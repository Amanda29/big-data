7/31/11 23:30|Lakeside|CA|Fireball|15 minutes|Pulsating orange ball that landed, then disappeared.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94972.html|1|ndxe201107| Pulsating orange ball that landed, then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime in July, 2011, I had gone throughout the entire day with the unshakable feeling that I was going to witness something, or that something was going to happen.  The feeling was vague associated with the sky, and since I had been watching the sky closely since a strange sighting in 2002, I was filled with much anticipation.  However, as the day wore on into night, I experienced absolutely nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2330 hours (11:30 p.m.) I approached my bedroom window (which faces South) and observed a bright, orange orb rising between the tree tops, on the other side of my apartment complex.  The orb pulsated, as if it consisted of flame, but I did not see flames.  The orb rose steadily until it was above the height of the trees -- approximately sixty feet up -- before coming to a complete stop.  The orb hovered completely still for a few minutes before slowly moving to the Northwest.  When it passed out of sight, I ran outside and saw it was coming over the dog-runs we have at the West end of the complex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while, it again stopped and hovered for several minutes.  The area was very quiet, aside from some distance sounds of passing cars on the freeway about a half-mile away.  The orb made no discernible sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside, to get my video camera, but when I tried to get the orb on film, it was too dark for my camera to detect it.   When I tried to zoom in, the orb appeared on the camera&#39;s screen, but the image was too blurry to have any discernible likeness.  The orb then moved farther Northwest, towards the hill behind the dog-runs.  It again stopped and hovered, for a couple of minutes, right over the house behind the dog-runs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb then moved downwards and landed on the hill, just to the North of the house, coming to rest between a couple of trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Using the trees as a guide, I was able to estimate the size of the orb to have the same approximately diameter as a Volkswagen Beatle is long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no light on the hill, except for a floodlight on the East side of the house (facing East) and the light from the orb.  I thought, for a moment, that I could see something moving to the left (South) of the orb, but I still could not see any details.  Attempting to use my camcorder again had the same results as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I considered trespassing on someone else&#39;s private property to get a closer look at the thing, there was a very loud popping sound, similar to what happens when one steps on a light-bulb, and then darkness and silence.  I continued to stare at the area for several minutes, and again considered trespassing, but I could not see anything well enough to determine if there was anything still on the side of the hill, where the orb had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I examined the area (from the dog-runs) early the next morning, but I saw no indication that anything had ever been resting on the hill, the night before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It moved in a straight line across the sky, and was going to slow to be a meteor.  It was much higher altitude than airplanes in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it approximately 25 seconds before it dimmed for a second, then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 minutes later, a second ball came from the same direction and flew in approximately the same flight path, dimming and disappearing in the same area as the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This AM I checked to see other reports. would love to know what this was...never seen anything like this, and I work for an airline.<n>

We were generally just appreciating the beautiful evening, and looking at all the bright stars we could see overhead.  Both of us commented on how unusually clear the night sky was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kenosha underlies takeoff and arrival routes from both Chicago and Milwaukee airports, plus the smaller airports of Waukegan, Kenosha, and Racine.  I personally am an Airline Transport Rated pilot with more than forty years of flying experience in many different types of aircraft, with over 20,000 flight hours, flying corporate jets the past 32 years.  I spend a lot of time watching the sky for aircraft and take pride in how many types I can identify as they pass overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly before 11:00 p.m. my wife commented, &#34;You should look at this airplane.&#34;   I said, &#34;I really don’t feel like twisting around to look at another airplane.&#34;  She said, &#34;You really ought to look at this.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned around in my chair and looked to the south.  What I saw was a bright red ‘light/bal,l’ low in the sky moving south to north toward us at what appeared to be a fairly low altitude at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped up from my chair to get a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a matter of just maybe 15 seconds, the red ‘light/ball’ grew rapidly larger. This ‘light/ball’ had none of the normal aircraft navigation, strobe, or recognition lights normally found on aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the ‘light/ball’ made a sharp right turn to the east over Lake Michigan and  accelerated at an astonishing rate as it climbed out of sight in to the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time of observation was approximately 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife said, &#34;What was that?&#34;  I said, &#34; have absolutely no idea. I’ve never seen anything like it.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stunned, we both returned to our chairs and sat down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly, she said, &#34;Here comes another one.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped up out of the chair, turned around and observed what appeared to be the same type and color object repeat the same maneuver.  I grabbed my cell phone and took two pictures.  One in &#34;normal&#34;; the object appears to be a small bright dot between the sailboat masts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then zoomed in max, and as expected it was very shaky/blurry, but the red color of the object is obvious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I do not know the size of the objects it is difficult to estimate the distance they were from us.  They appeared to be several miles away.  It was a quiet night, but we heard absolutely no sound from the objects.<n>

There was an intense lightning storm that covered about half of the night sky {covering the sky from the S.W. to the N.E. the other half of the sky was clear with stars clearly visable), the storm was headed in a N.E. direction.  We saw 25-50 orange-yellow lights come out of the storm (to our S.E.) cross the road in front of us and continue in a West - N.W. direction.  We pulled onto the shoulder of the road and watched them go higher and higher in the sky until they all disappeared.  Their were a lot of other cars on the road that night but I have not heard of anyone else reporting this event.  I did call the local Police but no one else had reported it.  I also called channel 4 news, but no one had called them either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What was thought to be a single light then became crisper, showing three lights. Unlike a plane, the movement and path this object was taking was irregular and fast.  It did not dim and fade like a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One witness claims to have seen similar happenings several times in the past two weeks. The other witness has seen something similar only once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After losing sight of one light-phenomena, about five to ten minutes later a similar (or possibly the same) type of light(s)/movement would reappear.  Three times in one sitting (approx. 30 minutes) these lights occurred.<n>

I would describe the size of each light as being similar to a softball. (The size was slightly smaller than the midway point between a star and the full moon)  These balls of light appeared at a diagonal angle from top left to bottom right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance between the two lights started as similar to the two stars that make up the &#34;bottom of the ladle&#34; Ursa Major.  Neither was stationary at any point.  The movement of each began as top to bottom (becoming closer to each other) and shortly after from left to right becoming closer still.  When the two lights were as close together as slightly less than the diameter of the moon, they appeared to move directly away from my viewing point(the bottom right retreating and fading slightly sooner than the other) The two circular orange lights disappeared at almost the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting took place in about 2 and 1/2 minutes.  The movement of the two lights towards each other took about 1 and 1/2 minutes and the retreat took about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no sound that I could attribute to these lights.  I have never seen anything even slightly similar to these lights.  I have no explanation as to what these lights might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

7/31/11 00:00|Rockaway Beach|OR|Chevron|15 seconds|Saw a flying object, seemingly orbiting earth, when there was a burst of light/energy and the craft sped off at an unimaginable speed.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97276.html|18|ndxe201107| Saw a flying object, seemingly orbiting earth, when there was a burst of light/energy and the craft sped off at an unimaginable speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im originally from Portland, Oregon.  The night of my 21st birthday, I was lying on a beach with my best friend.  We were lying there, talking about our future lives and all that comes with being an adult. It was a VERY clear and starry night. I saw several (3-4) shooting stars that night.  Being from Portland, I&#39;ve spent a big part of my life in the outdoors.  I  study star maps and astronomy whie camping in the mountains/beach.  I&#39;m lucky in that I&#39;m from an area where it is fairly easy to escape the city and find yourself isolated in nature.  I&#39;m an extremely clear thinking and fairly smart individual.  I&#39;ve always believed in life on other planets.  Mainly because the odds are stacked against the idea that we are the only species that has evolved to a degree of oenlightenment.  My use of enlightenment, of course, refers to having the knowledge of the universes that we have obtained as a planet.  I had never had a personal experience with unidentified objects.  So, my b! elief was based solely on logic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now to the experience. It was fairly short, but I was able to take in the information, look at it objectively, then immediately come to a conclusion.  My friend and I were discussing the complexity of life, when we both stopped talking.  During this intermittent silence. We BOTH saw an object that looked like a sattallite. I can take a stab and say it was not in our earths atmosphere. It seemed to be just outside.  As I said, very much like a sattelite orbiting the earth. This immediate acknowledgement did not seem out of the ordinary. I have noticed a sattellite or two in my time researching (amateurly) the cosmos.  So, we notice it without mentioning it.  That was when there was a burst of light/energy and it sped off into the reaches of space. It definetly had a shape to it, but it was very difficult to make it out from such a large distance.  I would describe it as an arrowhead or chevron.  The burst of light formed a circle behind the shape of this craft.  The burst was of a bl! u/purple hue. Also, a burst of white light momentarily trailed the craft/object for a split second. Being from the generation of the internet and special effects, it looked very much like the millenium falcon going in to hyperdrive.  Even down to the slight skipping of the craft/shape before it took off.  The craft was very visible before the burst, as was the burst itself. Even more so than the craft itself obviously. As I said, i&#39;ve seen many shooting stars (and wished upon them too).  But this was no star. As we watched it, we both exclaimed &#34;Whoah&#34;.  We then asked each other if we had seen the same thing. It was no trick of light, or an optical illusion from the cosmos.  We spent about ten minutes describing what we had seen so as to lock the knowledge and memory into our brains. We are both avid woodsmen, and have more experience with the night skies than most folks. We are two normal dudes who saw something brilliant and unexplainable.  As I type, I can clearly see the event in my minds eye.   I wish I was a more talented artist so I could render an accurate depiction of what it was like.  For now, these words will have to do.<n>

Slowly on our right hand side we noticed a low flying object moving towards the water.  The object was flying about the same height as the planes that fly over the beach with an advertisement behind them.  This object made no sound and had an orange light behind the craft.  There were no other lights or visible wings.  My husband saw it as a flat orange light on the back and I thought it was like a series of large orange lights forming an octagon.  The craft flew straight towards the horizon until it couldn’t be seen anymore.  This was at Old Wharf Road in Dennisport.<n>

These lights looking like stars other than their red and green changing glow. They where in a triangle pattern, with a &#34;star/light&#34; at each point, and moved swaying side to side and also up and down as if it was a bobber in the ocean or a top trying to maintain balance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw three different crafts, but one that stayed over the same area over a 4 hour period of time. Not moving with the other stars as the Earth turned over the 4 hour time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then around 1:45am to 2:00am on July 31, 2011 we saw a GIANT &#39;falling star&#39; that had a green tracing glow, this &#39;falling star&#39; then broke or exploded into 3 easily seen pieces that had an orange  glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This night from about 23:00 on July 30, 2011 to 3:00am on July 31,2011 we also saw at least twenty to thirty &#39;falling stars&#39;, most looked as if they where projected from the crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of &#34;twinkling&#34; star, together with meteors??

Prior to that, we were relaxing and talking at home after a busy day of work around the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were heading west on a local road when in the sky above us was what originally looked like four planes in the distance flying in a landing pattern approaching O&#39;hare airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, all four objects were what appeared to be a straight line.  As we drove a bit further and looked at the objects closer, we noticed that they were close and were not airplanes, so we pulled over behind another vehicle that was already pulled over looking at the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects had an orange color and made no noise.  The object at the far right started to fade as though it turned and was heading away in the opposite direction of where we were. Soon, it was gone from site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The remaining three objects slowly and silently, changed direction and converged into a triangle shape (if you connected the three objects).  The triangle shape they formed continued to converge getting smaller in size and then all three objects simultaneously faded and looked as though they turned and headed away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other vehicle stopped along side of us to also view the strange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take a photo from my phone but all you can see is a very small dot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no doubt in our minds that what we saw was real and it was not a common aircraft that we see in the sky (i.e. airplanes, helicopters) on a daily basis.<n>

He came back in right away, and told me to hurry and come outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hurried out, and he pointed to the sky and there, in the West, was a long line of round, orange lights heading straight toward us.  There had to be at least a dozen to 20 of them.  They were in rows of 2-4 each.   I told my son to run and get his dad, because he&#39;s a skeptic, and he&#39;d never believe it if he didn&#39;t see it for himself.  He came out and witnessed it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was exciting, yet scary too, because my first thought was we were being attacked, and those were missiles.  But as they got closer, I could see that they weren&#39;t missiles...they were round objects, that  moved slowly in formation...all at the same pace, and they never moved out of that formation.  All of them were the same size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no sound coming from them, and no flickering lights as they passed over us.  The sky was clear, with the exception of one small whispy cloud over the house next door.  Every one of those objects went into the cloud, and never came out.  There were openings in that small cloud, and we didn&#39;t see any of the objects pass by any of those openings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was over, I tried to find out if anyone reported the sighting, but only one news station answered, and she said they were short handed and nobody reported it.   I went back outside to check the sky, and the cloud was gone as well.   It was very frustrating!  I was kicking myself for not running into the house and grabbing my cell phone to try to film it.  I was afraid if I went to look for my phone, I&#39;d miss the event.   I don&#39;t know how high up the cloud was, or how low the objects were, but those objects had to be really big if that cloud was very high up, because they weren&#39;t  small dots in the sky.  They were a good size, and appeared to be  close.<n>

I noted it as unusual, but only watched it briefly. It was unusual because it was quite constant; it did not blink at all like airplanes. It did not look like landing lights from an airplane. It did not move like an airplane or a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then at approximately 10:30 PM my wife and I both saw three lights identical to the one I had seen earlier. We now paid great attention. I observed them through binoculars, but they still appeared as points of orange light that were not flashing. The three lights were slow moving and slowly moving with respect to one another. I estimated they were over Nantucket Island or even farther away. Then one light quickly, but not instantly, faded away almost as if it were turning and the light no longer was pointed in our direction. Then shortly after that the other two lights did the same and were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were lights like nothing I’ve ever seen in my 53 years. I have watched many meteor showers and observed many satellites both low orbit, bright, fast moving satellites as well as high orbit, dim, slow moving satellites.<n>

Started as one fireball, then another one joined it.  I stood and watched for a few minutes before getting 2 co-workers.  The fireballs come from the north and were moving south. I was near the beach, they appear to be over the bay, west from me.  They appeared to interact with each other.  They were very slow moving, changing formation, changing intensities of color ranging from white to orange.  The primary color was orange though.  This event went on for about 15 minutes or so, we were all captivated.  Eventually they slowly faded into the distance until the disappeared. oddly enough the last fireball to show up was the first one to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

At around 2218 I saw a glow in the sky to the northeast of us. I got brighter and clearer to the point where it looked like what I called a “campfire in the sky”.  That is exactly what it looked like, a glowing yellow/orange ball of fire. It stayed in the same position for at least 20 minutes before it just vanished.  I was not the only one present who saw it a friend and here daughter also saw it and where just as confused as I was about what it could be.  I maintain that I have no idea what I saw.  All I know is that it was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

About 15 minutes later we turned around to now see 3 of these same &#34;fireballs&#34; in a triangular shape hovering very high.  They were then joined by a 4th &#34;fireball&#34; that seemed to have come off the ground.  The fourth was far behind the first 3 but again they all started moving in an eastward direction and disappeared.  They did not become dim as they were moving away, they were still very bright before vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another peculiar fact, we tried on 2 different camera phones to take pictures and video of this, but they would not show up on our phones.<n>

These lights were not directly overhead, but were in the sky, in the distance (northeast direction - towards Michigan).   These lights were large enough to guarantee they were not stars / planets, and then they began to move in the air, converging towards one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since we were driving, some trees obstructed our view until we reached a place where we could continue to see the lights and actually exit the vehicle.  Once we parked, the lights began to move futher away, and within 10 seconds were no longer visible to our eyes (indicating they were moving at a significant speed).  I have never witnessed anything like that before, and I cannot speculate what else it could have been.<n>

I am not experienced in judging height but It appeared to me to be about 6, maybe 8 story&#39;s high and my angle of observation was about 45 degrees. According to Weather History for Lily Dale the evening of our observation it was 70 degrees that evening and the wind was 5 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was reluctant to add my observation as a good deal of time has passed and our location might prejudice readers and we might not be taken as credible witnesses.

My first reaction was that they were fireworks because of how they looked.  However, we realized very quickly that none of these objects were moving.   They were completely stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point our view was blocked by buildings so I pulled the car around the block to try and see if we could get another glimpse.  We were able to pull behind a vacant building with an adjacent field and parked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the lights had seemed to move more into the distance.  My guess is somewhere over Brentwood anywhere from Brentwood High School or the WSM Tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the number of lights had grown to around 50.  These lights did move this time but in almost figure eight motions, some even seemed to come together.   They started from around tree height up to cloud level which the clouds were low because of a thunderstorm earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend was able to get picture and video of this event.  Also, while we were there about 20 other people came to view this as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15 minutes the lights in no particular order very quickly disappeared.  Some seemed to do a quick flash before they would disappear.  It was maybe 30-45 seconds before they were gone once they started.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my girlfriend and I got in my car to try to ride over to where we thought the lights were over.  To do this we had to go over a large hill.  Once over the hill at a red light we witnessed what I would guess was a Black Hawk helicopter just hovering right above the tree line pointing in the direction of the lights.

I have a great binocular that are for viewing the sky at night but this I saw with my own eyes.  My husband didn’t see either event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also am wondering what a satellite looks like because there was an object I saw with the binoculars that had a light in the middle nine lights on either side with bright lights emanating out of the end lights like a flash light and three lights on the outside centered with the middle light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is this a satellite?   I can’t be sure but the two balls of light streaking across the sky came from that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Plus does the satellite stay stationary?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put together a diagram but the light is emitted from the longer rows of lights outward and the middle light was more of a blue smaller light.  It was stationary for most of the night.  But balls of light streaking from that direction happened quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure if it came from this object.<n>

This is where I automatically believed what he was seeing because he is always very skeptical about UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I grabbed my camera we got in his car and drove for a minute and immediately I had seen up to ten orange lights hovering in the distant sky.   They were located behind the WSM tower which has red lights blinking on it.  You could easily distinguish these fireballs from the tower lights or any airplanes.  They did not move and they were not stars (it was cloudy).<n> <n><n> <n><n> These looked like the same fireballs I had seen on July 4th that moved in formation from Nashville all the way south past Brentwood.  On the 4th, I had witnessed these lights with my parents and a few friends.  These made no noise and were not Chinese fire lanterns (they would have burned out the distance that these lights traveled).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, I tried to get video of the lights over Brentwood on the 30th, but my video camera is terrible at night and I was unable to capture anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought my brother, his friends, and myself were the only ones who saw the lights on the 30th, but I was wrong.  Yesterday a newspaper article mentioned something about the UFO&#39;s on the 30th, and today they say they may have pictures.  I have told people about what I saw and of course people shoot it down, but I have no reason to lie about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother, his friends, and myself are students who go to very credible universities.  Brentwood is a community full of lawyers and doctors.  If there are more witnesses besides myself and friends, it will be very credible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen different types of UFO&#39;s in my life and consider myself lucky to see such a thing.  I am writing this because there have been a string of sightings in this area over the past two months and I am just curious to see what everyone else has seen or heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I saw two fireballs glide by and there was no pyrotechs around.   It happened at 10 and 10:30.  We have had several things happen overhead and I was concentrating on the structure in the sky it had nine lights on either side with the end lights shining at an angle then in the center three lights of the nine there were lights beside it and inside those three center lights was a single light with more of a blue color hue.   I was looking at that for a few hours it was overhead and I questioned whether it was a satellite.  But last winter we had a circle made in the snow in our backyard.  My husband woke up and looked out into the yard and I tried to take pictures and a video.  I just got some of it on film.   A few years ago I had a ball of energy move from my bathroom into my hallway and hovered there. It was energy moving inside itself like balls of light that stretched and moved into each other and hovered ther! e looking at me.  It was crazy because I thought to myself I am not going to follow you because I don&#39;t want to die.   I felt it knew what I was thinking.   A few years earlier I saw a cigar shaped UFO and was told it could have been an experimental rocket.  I don&#39;t think so because it was flying over a populated area and had no fins and changed direction.  A few years before that I saw a sphere with a military plane directly above it.  I know something is going on out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a very pleasant evening with clear skies, calm winds, temperature in the low 70’s with a dewpoint in the lower 60’s.  Because I live in a very open area, adjacent to a large farm, it is always quite dark outside.  As such, when walking my dogs I always take a powerful spotlight with me…to light my way and also see if I am approaching any wildlife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an avid amateur astronomer, so whenever there are clear skies, I often take in the view while walking the dogs.  On this particular evening, I observed a very bright &#34;fireball&#34; looking object on the northern horizon.  The object was a brilliant red-orange color.  I would rate its apparent magnitude as -4 -- comparable to Venus at its brightest or the International Space Station.  The &#34;fireball: had a distinct circular shape to it.  Its apparent size was 4 times the size of Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object proceeded on a southerly course and flew directly over top of me.  It took approximately 45 seconds for the object to track from the Northern horizon to a position nearly overheard.  At the closest approach, I would approximate the altitude to be between 1500-2500 feet.  I was able to approximate altitude because I live a few miles from a small airport (Flying W; Medford, NJ).  Single engine craft on approach must adhere to a 600 ft flight level.  The fireball appeared to be 2-3  times higher.  This first object, after passing over me, vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 10 seconds of the first object vanishing, I noticed a second object, exact same characteristics; once again appear on the northern horizon.  At this point I asked my wife and daughter to come out and look at the object.  My wife brought her Nikon D5000 (DSLR 14MP) camera.  Once again, the object was a circular orb with an extremely bright red-orange light.  It followed the exact same course/heading as the first craft (North to South ... straight line).  Altitude was approximately 1,500 - 2,500 feet and speed was similar to that of the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time, my wife was able to take two pictures of the object.  They are attached.  More importantly, I grabbed my spotlight (15 million candlepower) and began to shine it directly on the object at its closest approach to us (nearly overhead).  After 3 bursts of the spotlight, the bright red-orange light on the object immediately ceased.  I continued to shine the light on the object and was able to observe the following:  &gt; The object appeared solid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had a round, circular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was clearly rotating or spinning in a counter-clockwise fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be 50-60% the size of the full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had a gray or silver color that reflected the spotlight beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was completely devoid of any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued on a southerly course, with no visible light, until we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The duration of the second sighting was no more than 3 minutes.   First appearance on Northern horizon to disappearing from view in the Southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an avid amateur astronomer with many years of experience.  I also am very well versed in meteorology.  I know what commercial and military aircraft look like, as we are in the flight path of commercial (Philadelphia International) and military (McGuire AFB) airports.  I also know that the atmosphere was clear and stable at the time of the sighting.  I know what most objects are in the sky-- such as planets, stars, constellations, satellites etc.  I firmly believe that the object that was witnessed by my wife, daughter and me was not something that I have ever seen before.  It was certainly extraordinary.  I think I am most puzzled by the way the object immediately cut out its light when I focused a spotlight on it.  It certainly took my breath away to see the shape, color and rotation of the solid object as I illuminated it from below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC has spoken with the three witnesses, on several occasions, and they made an appearance on a radio program, in order to talk about their sighting.

I only recently learned of your site and, until now, had no idea there was such a place to file a report of this particular sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 30, 2011, my girlfriend and I decided to have dinner at a restaurant called La Luna Mexican Grill, located in Bethlehem, GA. It was a warm summer’s evening, with a perfectly clear night sky. This particular restaurant had rooftop dining, which we opted for on that particular evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bethlehem, GA is one of many small, lightly populated areas that are found all throughout Georgia. As a result, there was very little light pollution, allowing for an amazing view of the thousands – millions of stars overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were about half way through our meal, enjoying some light-hearted conversation, when my girlfriend pointed up to the sky and asked, “do you see that light?” I looked towards the area of the sky that she was pointing towards, just in time to see a very bright light wink out. For the second that I saw it, it appeared to be an extremely large, very bright spotlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Oh my God,” she exclaimed, “what is THAT?” I continued looking in the same area of sky in which I had seen the light and, as my eyes adjusted from the candlelit table to the dark of the night sky, I realized what she was asking about.  Almost directly above us, there appeared to be an enormous, solid black object. It’s shape, defined by the area of stars that its massive form blocked out, was of a very long, very wide rectangle, with rounded ends. Much like the shape of a cigar, but broader.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to just hover in place as we both continued staring at it (about 2 minutes), at which point, my girlfriend then claimed to be able to see another, similar object floating next to the first. As my eyes frantically searched the night sky for the second object, my attention was drawn back to the first, as it suddenly shot away. Just like that, it was gone. Not a sound. No engine sound. No sound of propellers. Nothing. And, it was still completely black. No light shone from it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was it. We spoke about the objects throughout the remainder of our dinner, and both agreed that what we saw was some sort of UFO. What neither of us could get over, and what my mind still struggles with today, was the sheer size of the object I saw. I have never seen an object as large as that in the sky. I’ve seen blimps, and I’ve seen some of the largest airplanes in the world, first hand. I can honestly say that nothing compares in the enormity of the object I saw that night. If I had to give a size to the object, the only thing my mind can come up with is to say that it must have been at least a mile or two in length. That size of an object had slipped away with such speed, and in complete silence, AND had hovered in one spot for I don’t know how long (no idea how long it had been there, before my girlfriend had originally noted its presence). It was amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one question I can not answer is how high up the object was. My mind perceived it to have been a good distance up in the night sky.

I left my house just before 9PM on July 30th 2011 to ride to the store a couple of blocks for my house.  As I was approaching the store, I saw something flying down in the manner that a plane descends.  It was coming towards me very fast and as I concentrated my vision on it, it changed to a horizontal flight just about 20 feet above in front me and just flew right over my head.  It was about the size of an orange and looked almost like a glowing liquid fire, yellow orange in color.  It had no tail/trail.  I stopped my bike and by the time I placed my foot on the ground and turned around, it was gone.  I looked around and there was no sign of anything.  There was no sound at all.  There was a couple a few hundred feet behind me and I waited for them to reach me to see if they looked like they saw something, and it seems they didn&#39;t.  I mounted my bike and proceeded to the store. It! was 9:04 pm when I reached the store.  The whole event took place within a second or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently unemployed but I am a 6th Degree Black Belt in Classical Martial Arts of Okinawa and China.  I do not take drugs, do not drink alcohol and have no reason to lie. In fact, I posted the event on my Facebook as soon as i got back home.  My facebook name is Juku Cho.  Look for me and send me a friend request.  I&#39;ll accept you so you can see my post and my friend&#39;s responses.<n>

The sky was full of stars.  Noticied object with bright lighting in the sky around 2:00 a.m. Saturday morning.  Object appeared to turn in different angles and also could move fast.  It is hard to say how far in the air the object was located.  This object hovered above in the sky for over three hours.  Lighting very bright white and it almost looked as if at times it had lights coming down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed smaller objects a couple of times around the object headed towards the object and those disappeared.  I took several pictures and also recorded videos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reviewing the pictures on my cell phone it is clear that the object was changing angles in the sky.  One looks round, one looks almost boomerang shaped.  Object did not land and I was not able to stay awake long enough to see it leave or disappear.

My boyfriend, two friends visiting from out of town, and I were enjoying an evening outside on our backyard.  It was right about 11:30 pm when we saw a very large, unusually bright, orange looking fireball that seemed to suddenly rise above the two story house which sits behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was clear that night; it truly was a beautiful evening out. It was so large and bright that it looked like it was right above us but really it was so far away. It was easily 20, 000 plus feet high in the air. The reason I am sure of this, is our guests that evening are of military and have government backgrounds, and are quit knowledgeable in these areas.  They too sat in wonder and curiosity as we watched this thing traveling above and across us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireball first appeared above our neighbor’s  house to the East of us traveling West, moving toward us,  at a somewhat constant speed not to fast; as it became to become directly passing above us; one of the guys pointed out it appeared to have what looked like a ring around it.. They certainly couldn’t offer any explanations of what we were seeing, none of us could. Something else we noticed, there was absolutely was no sound coming from this object! It is not a far distance from the house behind us to ours, but it was just a few minutes, as it passed across us and once it did the orange fireball began to cross over the top of our house it continued moving West but at the same time seemed to almost move straight upward as well, much, much higher moving what look to disappear into the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I certainly will never forget what I saw; I admit every night I find myself looking over the top of our neighbor’s house at night wanting too, and wondering if I will see this again, what an extraordinary site!<n>

Just above the top of the pine trees I saw a black/dark triangular shaped craft with lights at each point (mainly white [constant] with blinking red and occasionally green) and larger [constant], amber in the center. There were other identical light configurations farther ahead of this one but I focused only on this closest one. It was traveling very slowly NW and made absolutely no sound. I stepped outside and listened. After observing it for10-15 seconds the object moved from ‘a clear viewpoint’ to behind one of the pine tree tops. I came back in the door and ran over to my kitchen window, hoping to have a better view of the object emerging from the obscuring tree but I never saw the craft emerge. I then ran back to the door and stepped out onto the front porch but the object was nowhere to be seen. I looked all over the sky above/around me for another 2! 0-30 seconds, saw nothing, and then went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in a well used flight path from Ft. Bragg and see and hear many types of aircraft. We have even heard (barely) some of the newer sound dampening helicopters and jet aircraft go over the house. This was nothing like any of these.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day my husband and I went to the local grocery store and, as our groceries were being checked out, I overheard the bag boy telling the cashier about ‘the UFO’s he and his Dad had seen last night.’ He said that his Dad had been in the front yard and saw them and called for him to come out into the yard so he could see them, too; which he did. They saw 3 identical, triangle-shaped black craft. He said that their house is ‘in the country’ with clear views and no stores or traffic noise. We both agreed to be watching the local paper for news of the event, wondering who else might have seen this. Sadly, there was never any news reported about the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At fist it looked like some type of airplane that was about to crash.  Then we noticed it was not an airplane, helicopter, blimp, balloon or any variation of either.  Additionally, we noticed that as it was descending very fast that it was moving sideways, actually different from the direction the main part of the craft was pointing.  Then is stopped in mid-air. I mean a complete stop.  There was traffic but it was pretty close to the tree line and a craft that big should have made some noise. The size I would say would be roughly equivalent to a commercial air liner and the color was a metallic/silvery almost transparent color. Almost camouflaged to be honest.  Depending on which angle you were looking into the sun, I doubt that everybody could have seen it.  We videoed a few seconds on if on ou! r Android X phones then it disappeared.  We were very happy that we got the video, only to learn seconds later that the video was corrupted.  I am a seasoned Software Engineer than have much experience in video/audio and I could not get that video to play in any way for any reason. This was even after I downloaded it from the phones and tried some other video editing. It was utterly and totally unusable.  This would make the 3rd craft I have seen and the 1st one she has seen. This one however looked nothing like the other two.  This one was shaped kind of like a giant bird type shape with wings slightly folded back and a raised front. I researched secret military planes that night and didn&#39;t find anything even remotely close, especially anything metallic/silver and that would be almost transparent in broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It came out of nowhere and then disappeared in the same fashion, the entire event lasting 2-3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it is safe to say that it is not a play or a shooting star because it was very bright and disappeared before coming anywhere near the treeline on the horizon.  The light was heading towards earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be crashing but there was no other flash apart from the bright light that came and went.<n>

We had already been outside for about 15 minutes when we saw a bright light coming towards us across the sky from a distance.  It was traveling much faster than any man made aircraft or jet plane would travel at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we had not a clue of what it could be but at this point we knew for sure it was not an airplane or human made aircraft of any kind.   As this object passed right above us it slowed down at a very speedy rate.  The object first turned out as a large orange ball of light going at a tremendous speed, but as it got closer it appeared to have the shape of a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see a large orange triangle shaped light in the center. We could also see that there were 3 blue lights moving in a circular motion around this bright Orange triangle light.  We felt almost as if something in this craft were watching us back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was the brightest flying object we had ever seen in the sky in our life.  The object hovered for about another minute or so and disappeared within the blink of an eye.  Not even 30 seconds after this craft disappeared an enormous solid red ball of light passed by in the same path as the other UFO we had just believed to witness.  These objects were completely silent as well and flew about 500 feet above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I remain baffled.<n>

We live in a rural area so if it isn&#39;t cloudy or too moonlit, we can see many stars and satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of July 28th, a clear night with no moonlight, we spotted what we thought was a satellite.  As we watched it fly east, it would slow down, speed up, and wobble.  It also made two turns, first to the northeast, and then straight north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no way this light was a satellite, or even a high-flying jet.  Since we were unable to identify what we saw, and it behaved in ways that more resembled the flight of a butterfly than a satellite, we decided to make this report.<n>

It was between 3:00 am and 3:37 am that I had seen what looked like a shooting star; it a lit up the sky for a good couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fascinated, I kept watch in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of minutes later, I noticed that there was what looked like a huge diamond shape with an outline of stars/lights hovering just above the mountains.  It stayed completely still;later I lost sight of it then it appeared again but now was in a different position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I did some research and I came across your website and found a ufo sighting report that was very similar to mine; the Bayfield, Colorado Report of Sunday May, 8th, 2011.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked into it and that sighting was reported to be ALSO over the mountains.  I&#39;d say that I was probably in the same spot the people from the other ufo sighting were; just on the OTHER side of the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was really shocked to see the picture from the! report was so disturbingly similar to mine; I drew out what I saw on a piece of notebook paper (didnt have a camera).  It was an exhilarating experience.<n>

I was alone and well my cousin came and joined me. I am older then what he is.  He came down and we sat and talked for a few minutes and I noticed he was looking over his shoulder to the the west of where we were sitting and I asked him, &#34;What was the matter.&#34;  He said he claimed to see a green light falling from the sky and I said maybe it was just a shooting star but when he claimed to see another one I looked and saw nothing a few minutes later he went in the house and I started to hallucinate started seeing things coming out of the water (to hard to explain) and I became really paranoid so I called him back down.  When he came back the figure was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we sat and talked then all of a sudden we both seen a green light falling from the west but it seemed to disappear this time but right above it their was just this massive fireball that just came out of absolutely nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my cousin both bolted to the house wit!h fear over both of our faces and we refused to go back outside.  We have not stopped going here every summer though.  And the more we go the more we see like last year for instance we were among 3 others walking and we all encountered three to four shooting stars in a matter of hours.  We all claimed to have seen different colors with every one we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All i know is that this general area is not very populated and its very easy to see the sky at night.  I will be going here this summer as well and will be recording the sky this time and hopefully I will be able to catch something for proof of explainable phenomenons at this beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It was a dark and very clear night with the stars, highly visible.  I was about 2 miles south of the Elkton/Sinai, SD exit and came upon a slower car which I decided to pass.  Before passing, I happened to look up through my windshield and noticed a bright, white, light to the north about the size of a quarter.  My first thought was that it was a plane with his landing lights on heading for the Sioux Falls Regional Airport about 40 miles to the south.  I did not see any of the usual strobes on this light and thought that was a little strange but, assumed that it was coming straight south and maybe I just couldn&#39;t see them from my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I passed this car and a little way ahead was another car going much slower than the one that I had just passed. I looked again, before passing to see if the light was still there.  It was but, had grown to about the size of a half dollar and still, I could see no strobes such as aircraft have. I was pretty interested in the light now but, was next to the car I was passing and sped up so I could have a good look at the light. In the matter of seconds that it took to fully pass the car and get back in the driving lane, when I looked up again, the white light had gone from the size of a half dollar to the size of a dime.  I turned my attention to the road as I had road construction coming up, then, looked up again.  To my amazement, the light had shrunk to the size of a star and then, it was just suddenly gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing couldn&#39;t have taken more than 45 seconds.  I was fascinated that it had gone from the size of a quarter to half dollar, then to the size of a dime, a star and then just gone, just like that. There was no noise, no contrail, no strobes, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am familiar with aircraft having grown up near an airport and I am a trained storm spotter and am well aware of atmospheric conditions.<n>

I was inside reading on bed when my girlfriend called to me to &#34;come see this!”&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> What appeared to be a glowing red/orange fireball was moving from north to south about 100-200 ft above the water just off the shore line.  Our vantage point was from the southerly end of the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb moved very slowly taking at least three minutes to travel from the approximate mid point towards our location.  The object when closest to us seemed to have the likeness of a small campfire enclosed within a glass egg.  It was almost as though you could see the flames inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then turned on a more easterly path and slowly moved off toward the horizon till if faded from sight.  There was never any noise that could be heard above the sound of the waves.<n>

I t was approximately 75-100 feet in diameter and for a split second I wrote it off as a firework dwindling out but it didn&#39;t dwindle, rather it changed shape just slightly (it was always oblong spherical in shape) and a small piece came off and moved slightly right of the object 15-20 feet (all distances and measurements may be skewed but they are what I perceived from my location) the small piece dwindled (went from visible to gone in 3/4 of a sec) and 1 ½ seconds after the larger object followed suit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not gain or lose altitude nor did it move side to side besides the small piece that came from the original object.  This ball was visible when I crested the hill so it’s possible it was there longer but I personally experienced it for 5.5 to 7 seconds (hard to tell! because I was just baffled and a bit thrown off when it didn’t dwindle like a firework would).<n>

It was a partly cloudy night but stars were still visible.  It was very windy too. It was almost dark when we were eating dinner outside and at about 9 PM we all (4 adults) noticed three faint orange lights in the sky in a triangular shape. We all thought they were planets or satellites at first because they stood out among the stars and did not flicker.  They continued to grow bigger and brighter and the orange color became much more clear.  At first they appeared to be stationary (on a very windy night) but then appeared to be moving very slowly along the coast. They stayed in perfect formation but dimmed and grew brighter and dimmed again.  At one point, they looked like bright orange spheres in the sky and appeared far bigger than any stars that were visible.  They were not flashing lights and there were no other colors visible- just orange.  There was no sound from whatever this was.  I walk ed up to my room about 30 minutes later when the lights looked like glowing basketballs in the sky and took my husband (who had returned to the room before me) to the balcony to see how bright they had gotten and they were gone.  The whole incident lasted about 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked some of the hotel staff about what we saw the following morning and they all looked at me like I was nuts.  I can&#39;t find anything on the Internet about others seeing these lights and am very curious to find out what they were.  So mad I didn&#39;t take a picture. I thought about it later when I actually considered the possibility of being a UFO (never given this topic much thought).  I did find several pictures on the Internet that look like what we saw though.<n>

What i thought was a plane stopped moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was odd and kept watching this white glowing object, if i had to pick a shape it was circular,or a big ball or orb of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Slowly it began to move again, but in ways i haven&#39;t seen an aircraft do before, moving slowly in an almost zig zag pattern, or something like a figure 8.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As time past from below the first white glowing orb object what appeared to be a shooting star flew past the sky, it was almost an instant, less than a second before that was gone.  Over the half hour i watched this glowing orb object  from a few miles away from it&#39;s left my eyes picked up on something else.  I had to focus my eyes to get a good look.  what appeared to be a shimmering  crescent moon shape. if you looked away from it it would almost disappear from view completely.  Over time i noticed two more of the shimmering crescent moon shaped objects.  One seeming to be a few miles below the glowing orb object, the other a few miles to the right,  Bringing the total count of the shimmering crescent moon shaped objects to 3. it was hard to focus on them, it was almost like you had to look directly at the crescent moon objects,or they wouldn&#39;t pick up on my vision, at least not in my peripheral vision.  I noticed these shimmering crescent moon objects were traveling around the white orb object moving counter clockwise around it.  i watched this from 4:10 am to around 4:40 am, roughly.  I didn&#39;t see what happened or where the objects went! , i was rather shaken up by seeing this and scurried back to my house before a climax or finishing outcome to this event. when i went inside i looked out my kitchen window i saw one of the shimmering crescent moon objects one last time before i got online and started typing this report up.<n>

It was facing towards siloam springs.  The object seemed to move up a bit but at a slow pace.  Within a few minutes the object turned from a ball of light into a long orange shape.  Then it changed from one object into two.  Then back into one, changing back into it’s original color and shape.  It started to become smaller and dimmer and then eventually disappeared.<n>

After noticing an extremely bright and loud craft moving east to west we decided to pay more attention.  Facing North, we took sight of a couple planes traveling at an average pace.  While watching the common crafts a burst of light took grasp of the Northern cloudscape. In motion this hot white light traveled at a speed many times greater than any earthly craft  I have been made aware.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While using the distance and speed of the other craft as a reference it was made obvious to me the U.F.O. was far greater in altitude and speed, yet was much clearer and brighter than any other the skies occupants.  This object went from a large cloud to directly behind a smaller tailing cloud before disappearing behind it.  It consisted of a huge explosion of propulsion, which emanated enough hot white light to allow me to make out a slight curve in the structure.  The e! ntire encounter lasted only a fraction of a second and produced no noticeable sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that morning near an odd triangle constellation my wife and I noticed similar activity at a much higher altitude.<n>

The bay is about 400 meters across with 40-50 foot trees on either side.  I noticed a small red dot pop straight up on the horizon from the west-southwest that was not blinking, but thought nothing of it, believing it was just a plane.  It was like a small red star or just the light of a plane.  It appeared to be a plane miles away, and it appeared to be about 20 degrees above the horizon, or a few degrees above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed it started to wiggle left and right and I figured it must have been closer than I thought and might fly over the bay soon.  I mentioned it to my friend and he looked up and saw it wasn&#39;t doing anything, so he ignored it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red dot hung in the same position for about 2 minutes, and then suddenly it changed color from red to orange.  This got our attention.  A few seconds later, it appeared to become 40 times the size as before, like 40 times the size of a bright star, or 1/4th the size of a full moon in the sky, appearing to travel miles closer to us almost instantaneously.  It looked like a small sun at sunset due to its orange color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In this same second, it traveled a short distance so rapidly to the right (north) that it appeared to blur the whole distance, and then in the next second it appeared to travel back from where it came from (west-southwest) and became a small red dot the same size it was when it first appeared, and then about a second later it became a very tiny dot and a second later was completely gone.  It appeared to do this just above and beyond the trees on the other side of the bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend stood up from where he was sitting in shock gasping for breath because he was in such disbelief. He had the wind knocked out of him.  I just sat there in disbelief.  The object was so bright the dot was still in his eyes, although I don&#39;t believe I experienced that effect.  Either way it was the strangest experience I&#39;ve ever had and couldn&#39;t have possibly imagined actually seeing something like that in real life.<n>

Above Kamloops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object that I had spotted that night of, July 27, 2011, was for Lack of better words Very Strange indeed!?  I was outside my residence having a cigaret, as I was looking to the west towards this mountain that is very tall &amp; was silhouetted by the moon that night, I noticed what I had seen, I just thought it was an airplane coming from Kelowna. Because I was living right by the airport at that time?  But as I continued to observe this object I thought that my eyes were playing tricks on me so I used the telephone pole &amp; transmission lines to line the object up to see if in fact that what I was seeing, was in fact doing what my eyes were seeing. And once I realized that was the case I started hollering for my ex wife to come outside to bear witness to what I was seeing.  What it did was Absolutely Amazing! I tracked it on the pole for the vertical trajectory &amp; along the cable and telephone wires for its horizontal trajectory. It first just hovered there then it went from the top of the pole down to the cable lines &amp; stopped and then traveled along to the halfway point between the other telephone pole. It then stopped stayed there in hover mode for a min. Or two, &amp; then went back along the same path as it used.  When it got to the pole it shot up the pole to the top of the pole and came to an abrupt stop.  And then proceeded past the top of the pole and up highe! r into the sky and then stopped in front of the moon and a very see thru cloud, it sat there motionless for a bit then it entered the cloud with the moon shining behind it.  And it was at this point I noticed that it started to shimmer as it entered the cloud it started to dissipate &amp; then just was gone!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My boyfriend was looking up at the night’s sky and pointed out this unknown object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was a satellite, then noticed that there were 3 white lights really close together flashing, and a bit of red was also flashing in the center of the 3 white lights.  We thought it could have been a plane but the movement of the object was strange.  It would move slowly diagonally and sit there in the sky a bit and then it moved back to where it was before repeating this movement several times, but sometimes in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s when we decided to go and grab the camera and snap some photos.  It was hard to take a picture of the object, half the time it wouldn’t appear on the camera.  Our roommate came home and we asked him if he saw it too and what he thought of it.  He wasn’t too sure all he said he knew it wasn’t a plane because of the positioning of the lights and thought it wasn’t a satellite because of the red flashing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Half hour later we went inside to look at the pictures we managed to take.  When we zoomed in on the picture a green light located above the red light appeared looking as if it were attached. When looking from the patio the green light wasn’t noticeable.  After viewing the picture we went back out to see if it was still there. Luckily, it was and we took a few more pictures.  We zoomed in on another picture and this time when we zoomed in on the picture the green light wasn’t there but the red was still present.  Instead of being an oval/circular shape, it was in the shape of a disk on an angle with the red light on top of this disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have never noticed this object in the night’s sky before.  Tomorrow night we will be going back out onto the patio at the same time to see if it is still there.<n>

I instantly posted to my facebook asking if anyome else happened to see it and infact so far 2 people have reported seeing it.  It was about 6 average stars width in diameter.  It was descending at about a 30 deg angle heading what looked like due north and sank behind the rooftops and I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of my friends who replied to my status update said they were walking along the beach and their bf saw it but she did not. I am not discounting a meteor but it was moving very slowly and had golden fire emiting from it evenly in all directions and had a tail that looked more like a rocket flame than a normal meteor.  It should be noted I have seen a meteor crash to earth before (within 1000 feet...i know pretty cool right?) and this just struck me as odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> oddities....<n> <n><n> <n><n> the flames were omnidirectional coming out of the object...not burning off to the back like something burning up as it travels through the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it had a vibrant gold color to it...flames...ball...tail...everything was gold  it was moving entirely too slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it all happened within about 2-3 seconds but it etched itself into my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> a minute later as i got on my train i saw a police chopper flying by the beaches doing their patrol but who knows what that could have been because they are often there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I&#39;m emailing you a picture I drew to describe it.  The second and third objects we saw we right behind one another, about 45 seconds apart, travelling slower than airplanes, no sound, and much, much higher of course.  All objects we saw this evening were traveling East, except one traveling Northeast and another traveling Southwest.  We frequently saw airplanes this evening in the sky at the same time as these objects.  We usually do not see airplanes in the air at the same time as the objects.  All 10 this evening were of the same, usual kind we typically see: silver, cigar-shaped, appear to float along with no sound.  The first one was notable because it seemed to be the lowest or closest of them all, enough to where we could make out what looked like a tail and a fin, almost like it was trying to appear to be an airplane, but looked nothing like an airplane.  So, we saw them all singly, spaced about 2-3 minutes apart o! n average, except for the second and third ones which were following one another rather closely.  After that there was one heading East and the only one that turned off and headed Northeast.  At this point, we were able to watch 2 in the sky at the same time again.  Only one of the objects had a blinking light on it, similar to an aircraft, but tiny and blinked a white or blue light that was inconsistent (i.e. i thought it blinked every second, it didn&#39;t).  I mention in the photo I&#39;m attaching that the silver material looks like plutonium.  I have often suspected that these objects power themselves through nuclear power, which may explain the radiation they put off, the appearance of plutonium, and in some videos I have seen where they appear to turn on a fluorescent light that looks to be composed of the krypton element.  Sounds very sci-fi, but I think it could be likely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  One of several from the same source.  PD))<n>

Of course I apologize for any confusion from the prior report and, as always, have provided my name an contact info to NUFORC just in case any further clarification may assist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As noted in the below report, I was having difficulty locating notes I made on an airline napkin in order to help me pinpoint all the details.  I have since located the item which states &#34;Approx. 7:15pm orb travels south off right wing of plane...7/26/11.&#34;  At first when I found this note (Delta napkin), I assumed I must have written the incorrect date on it because I thought the only flights on that trip&#39;s itinerary which included a northerly path were the ones on 7/23/11, when I flew from Las Vegas to Salt Lake City and from Salt Lake City to Denver (as originally reported).  In addition, I assumed that my 7/26 flight was a nonstop from Denver to New York (predominantly an eastbound path, not northbound as the sighting details called for).<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, after locating the napkin, and contacting the airline again to confirm the details of my flights I learned that I did not take a nonstop flight on 7/26/11.  In fact, on that day, I flew from Denver to Atlanta and from Atlanta to Denver (flight 786 which was scheduled to depart Atlanta at 5:35pm with a typical estimated flight time of 2 hours and 22 minutes, which means the likely estimated landing time was 7:57pm).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As such on Delta flight 786, on 7/26/11, when flying north from Atlanta to La Guardia, it would have been very possible for the sighting to have taken place at 7:15pm, as noted on the napkin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though I still cannot be 100% sure if the sighting took place on 7/23 or 7/26, I am now more confident that the sighting described below actually took place on 7/26/11.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note that I discovered another NUFORC sighting report for 7/26/11, from a couple, who also claimed to see a UFO while flying on a different Delta flight.  Perhaps just a coincidence but very intriguing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below is my original report text with corrections provided in brackets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ==========================================================================  [EASTERN] U.S.: Metal / gray sphere seen during commercial flight  On [TUESDAY, JULY 26, 2011], I traveled from [DENVER, COLORADO TO ATLANTA, GEORGIA AND FROM ATLANTA, GEORGIA TO NYC (LA GUARDIA)].<n> <n><n> <n><n> Delta flight [#1316] was scheduled to [DEPART DENVER AT 11:45AM]. Following the layover [IN ATLANTA], [DELTA] flight [#786] was scheduled to depart [ATLANTA AT 5:35 PM---A DELTA REPRESENTATIVE CONFIRMED THAT THE ESTIMATED FLIGHT TIME WOULD BE 2 HOURS AND 22 MINUTES, OR AN ARRIVAL IN NYC OF 7:57PM].<n> <n><n> <n><n> During [FLIGHT #786 FROM ATLANTA TO NEW YORK] [(ACCORDING TO the note I made on THE flight)] I looked out of the right side of the plane (I had a window seat). Traveling in the opposite direction of the plane, at an altitude a bit lower than the plane, and at a distance of approximately 120 - 250 meters away, I clearly observed a gray metal sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had a diameter that was approximately the same as an exercise ball (or about 2.5 or 3.5 feet). I was immediately shaken /startled at how close this sphere was to the airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself that this object, and it was clearly an object, could have been a severe threat had it collided with our aircraft. I discussed it with nobody as (1) it was gone in an instant and (2) I was concerned that a report may draw alarm by the passengers or airline crew, even though the object harmlessly passed by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if other passengers or crew saw the object. However, I did imagine that others who looked out the window would have likely seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again it was moving in the opposite direction of the plane at a trajectory that was roughly parallel to our travel path. So, it is difficult to approximate the speed of the object as both the plane and the sphere were both in motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are no photos or video of this event, as I could not react quickly enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [AS NOTED ABOVE, THE LOCATED NOTE NOW MAKES IT VERY POSSIBLE THAT THE SIGHTING, ORIGINALLY THOUGHT TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE ON 7/23/11, MAY HAVE TAKEN PLACE ON 7/26/11].<n> <n><n> <n><n> This [CORRECTION] is [AN UPDATE TO] my sixth UFO sighting report to NUFORC. The other five were for sightings that took place on:  1. 2/6/97 (Mesa, AZ)---Close up triangle. Original report was updated with map.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. 4/26/09 (Brooklyn, NY)---Orb  3. 5/14/11 (Brooklyn, NY)---Lights  4. 7/10/11 (Brooklyn, NY)---Brilliant light / orb  5. 7/30/12 (Brooklyn, NY)---Orb  A later (7th report) was recently filed for a sighting on 8/21/13 (Brooklyn, NY)---Light<n>

It seemed to be watching the lightening storm.  It was NOT a plane as it sat in the sky not moving for a couple minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/25/11 22:50|Mayville|WI|Light|Less then 45 secs|2 EXTREMELY fast moving objects 20secs. apart taking the exact same path as though they were in a flight pattern.|8/7/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82736.html|122|ndxe201107| 2 EXTREMELY fast moving objects, 20 secs. Apart, taking the exact same path as though they were in a flight pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking into the southern night sky, as I quite often do, and I saw what had appeared to be a shooting star.  It did not stay lit for more than a second.  This object was small like watching a satellite track through the sky, but at an extremely high rate of speed.  It appeared to be moving at the speed of a shooting star or faster.  It was not falling towards the horizon, but parallel to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the same portion of the sky that the object passed by and within approximately 20 seconds I saw another object do the same exact thing.  The second object appeared to be in the exact path as the first.  These objects both only stayed lit for a second.  If I would’ve blinked I probably would not have seen one of them and would’ve thought nothing of it, but being that I saw two made me believe that it was more than a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the objects I saw were beyond the earths atmosphere.  It was like watching a satellite move across the sky, but at an unimaginable speed.  Both objects made a streak of light while lit that made approximately a 15 degree arc.  These objects are the fastest moving objects I have ever viewed in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen dead satellites track through the sky before as they blink from the sunlight hitting them while spinning out of control.  I’ve also watched many satellites as they track across the sky.  This is nothing like what I’ve seen before.  I wouldn’t have even thought of reporting this observation, if I had only seen one object, but because I saw another in the same exact path, it struck me as being extremely odd.<n>

It was not blurry at all- just incredibly crisp and small.  There were no other objects with it, and it had no &#34;tail&#34;, so I am pretty sure it wasn&#39;t a shooting star.  I am not sure if it actually WAS spherical (since it was so small), but the telescope was in focus and it didn&#39;t seem distorted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a university student in Boulder.<n>
7/25/11 21:00|Galesburg|MI|Changing|1 minute|I viewed a 'fireball' change into an aircraft|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101240.html|124|ndxe201107| I viewed a &#39;fireball&#39; change into an aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving Westward, I noticed a stationary orange/amber fireball in a patch of sky WSW. Its angle of elevation was 55-60 degrees.  It remained there for about 10 seconds. In the next 5-10 seconds that followed, the object smoothly dropped very low to the ground, moved slightly NE (10-15 degrees N) and was now hovering directly above the road ahead. It dropped so low, I thought the object might land.  I estimate it&#39;s new angle of elevation was 15-20 degrees.  After dropping its altitude, I estimate the aircraft was hovering no higher than 100 yds. Gradually, during its descent, the object lost all of it&#39;s amber/orange glow and a small, triangular, flat black/primer colored aircraft became visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft hovered above the road long enough for me to drive almost directly under it. I was extremely close to the aircraft, it was due South, and at one point was almost at my zenith. I had to maneuver my head out of the window to have a look. The aircraft didn&#39;t have registration lettering, wings, a tail, propellers, cylindrical shapes, or navigation lights. The aircraft was roughly shaped like a diamond, with a slightly elongated section facing West. There was a convex shape on the top of the craft, almost resembling a cock pit. The aircraft was virtually silent. I rolled down my window to have a listen and only heard the passing air. I viewed the aircraft at this distance for about 15-20 seconds before passing it by. I almost immediately looked back and looked in my rear view mirrors, but saw nothing. I reported this sighting to my local county sheriff&#39;s office as well as the FAA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may be worth mentioning there&#39;s a military base about 15 miles away, in a neighboring town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was around 8:45 pm that the sun started to set behind the mountains in the horizon, I ran back to my campsite to retrieve my digital camera, a Fuji FinePix A205,  then ran back to the lake shore, by the time I got the camera ready to photograph the sunset, I was only able to take one photo before the sun disappeared behind the mountains, all it remained was the outlines of the mountains  in the distance across the lake and of the  tree tops to the side, It looked beautiful so I proceeded to take some photos of the view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky had turned fairly dark except in the lower part of the horizon.  It was a clear night, not a cloud in sight; all I saw in the sky before taking the last three photos was a few fainted stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t get around to transferring the photos to my computer until a week or so later.  While viewing the photos, I noticed a bright object appeared in the last three photos I took after the sun had set, the object seem to be high in the sky and at a considerable distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Using a graphics program, I opened the photos and enlarged them to get a better look of the object, it has shape, bright white, green bluish lights emanating and a series of dark spots forming a band from side to side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not observe the actual object, it seem to be invisible to the naked eye and only showed in the photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can you please help me understand what this object was?  It does not look like any conventional aircraft I’m familiar with; what’s more it appeared to be moving, judging by its position in relation to the mountains below it.<n>

It was coming from outside my bedroom window I could tell.  I was curious so I sat up and looked out my window. I lived in circle of townhouses at the time and my bedroom window was facing the center.  There was a swampy pond in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out in the distance I saw past the swamp an oval-shaped yellow-white shape with a yellow outlining.  It was probably ¾ of a mile away from my house.  The sound it emitted was a kind of electronic, hovering sound that was low-pitched.  It stayed there for about three minutes, and then it took off with staggering speed and strange motion to the upper right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It is a fairly clear night with only a few swiffs of clouds.  Tonight the moon and stars can be seen easily past the city lights.

Realizing its chevron head shape with rectangular body --&gt;.  It had lights on each edge and some scattered on the body making it well lit.  It was relatively close so i could make the ufo out very well.  My friend and I stared in awe as it turned away from the parallel path we were both going on.  He sped up and we turned on another street to follow but we could only keep it in view for about a minute and a half or so before loosing site of it over Riverside Hospital.  We spotted this craft over Upper Arlington in Columbus, Ohio.<n>

This, in fact, was not a meteorite but the light emitted from a UFO flying triangle.  I want to note that just before the sighting and during the brief sighting of the lights, which from what I already know about the craft which is a terrestrial reconnaissance craft, the sight of the lights would have indicated a necessary quick acceleration maneuver from a stationary position, and the lights themselves would be rocket engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noted that the lights came from about the same space above where, during the previous day, had been a double ambulance emergency dispatch for reasons unknown by myself at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The triangle accelerated to the speed of making a fast rotating blade through air sound&#34; I also heard a shriek of what seemed to be a female voice saying, &#34;Oh, no, why GOD!?,&#34; and a male voice shouting incoherently in a panic from where I just noticed just now the same area where an ambulance was dispatched to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately went inside to get my digital camera, a Kodak digital point and shoot (non-SLR) camera, model number M1063 10.3 mega pixels with 32mm-96mm (equivalent) and Kodak AF 3x Optical Aspheric Lens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arbitrarily took a lot of digital stills of the airspace hoping to obtain some evidence of the activity going on overhead, I analyzed the digital photographs in Adobe photo shop CS5, and I was able to identify most of the craft which I saw. See attached photographs presented.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what I was able to gather, I observed the TR-3B craft interacting with a Nazi Bell craft. I also noted that due to the presence of the Bell craft, that the saucer shaped craft was also possibly a Nazi craft, although due to the quality of the photograph, I was unable to clearly identify the exact model of the craft, as there are more than a dozen different saucer shaped craft and I can only speculate on the exact model. I also noted another variation of the Aurora program craft there, counting a total of at least two of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed that when I took my check from the U.S. treasury from my 2009 tax refund to cash it at the Wal-Mart customer service desk, a woman was there with what seemed to be a mild radiation exposure or sickness, with radiation burns on her face, and a hacking cough, she seemed ill, possibly had been in close contact with the craft, not sure of that story beyond that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I want to note the timing, and this should be double checked, of the ambulance dispatches to the house which required two separate ambulances yesterday afternoon, and the ambulance dispatch to the area of the neighborhood directly adjacent to the church in the neighborhood, the reasoning for the calls for help, and the situational awareness of those emergency calls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to note that although I do not have a Geiger counter, I am curious about the Geiger count in this area as there was apparently profuse activity in the airspace last night, as this could indicate the residuals from their presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went inside to analyze the digital photographs, I noticed flashes of light through the blinds which may have indicated either evasive maneuvering between the TR-3B and the Bell craft.<n>

That question remained unanswered Wednesday morning, and investigators have called off a search for a possible plane crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dispatchers started getting calls Tuesday night reporting a fireball falling out of the sky and into the ocean off Flagler Beach, near State Roads A1A and 100.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnesses said they thought it might be a plane that crashed about 7 miles offshore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flagler County deputies then called the Volusia County Sheriff&#39;s Office, asking if they could use that agency&#39;s helicopter, AirOne, to help in the search.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The helicopter was sent up, but officials quickly realized that the search area would be too far out over the open water to safely operate the aircraft. So AirOne had to turn around and head back to shore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Deputies then notified the Coast Guard, which sent a boat from Station Ponce Inlet to begin searching. But officials called off the search late Wednesday morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Petty Officer Jessica Potter said the Coast Guard found no wreckage or any other sign that a plane went down. She also said there were no reports of missing or overdue aircraft in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While officials said it probably wasn&#39;t a plane, one witness, Nick Kennerly, told us he saw the light and saw where it came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kennerly said a couple staying at a nearby motel lit a Chinese lantern. It&#39;s much like a hot air balloon.

They maintained a constant speed and altitude, absolutely silent.  Also they were not in any recognizable formation. It was approximately 11:05 PM so it is difficult to determine how far away they were or the altitude.  There were broken clouds in the sky, and as they traveled east the orange color dimmed and went out and some disappeared into the clouds.<n>

July 24, 2011  I witnessed Sunday night about 11:05 bright orange lights through my window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran outside to see what it was. I saw 5 orange balls in the sky very bright; they were staggered apart as they went by. 1 went into the clouds, 1 went behind the tree line, 3 faded out after they had passed over us to the east.  When they faded I could see a small white blinking light on top of them as they headed east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a group of four came up from behind them, and we watched them go by in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband got the camera and snapped pictures of the last group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were going west to east moving very slow.  They were much bigger than the stars, about 5 times bigger than the largest star out there.  They looked to be only as high as a small plane would fly over.  They seemed to be in the same path as the military planes fly. It was a clear night with some low cloudy patches.<n>

The red light was the same size and intensity as an exploding rocket from a firework.  It&#39;s speed seemed to be the same as that of an airplane. As it got closer the light seemed to get weaker, but I could still see the light.  The object seemed to go straight over my head, unknown exactly how high it was. The most fascinating part of this event was, it made no noise what so ever.  The exact same thing happened two more times within the next 5 to 10 minutes.  These objects traveled across the sky from east to west, and I watched them slowly disappear into the western sky.  Their red light seemed to be the most intense when I spotted them in the east, and slowly disappeared as the flew overhead and towards the west.  Unfortunately, I was not able to see a craft, only the light as it flew by.<n>

I spotted a large, orange, orb over the Colorado National Monument traveling from the West heading East.  It was a huge bright light, and bright orange color and moving very slow.  I knew it was not a plain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house and grabbed my binoculars to get a better view.  This bright orange orb had 4 or 5 smaller lights blinking all around it, not attached to it, but in it&#39;s proximity.  Then, it drifted into the tree line and I could not see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But just as soon as I lost sight of it, another one appeared out of no where.  Same as the first, large, bright orange, traveling from the West heading East, and many blinking lights all around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching it the other one appeared again for a short time and then just blinked out. And then to my surprise the visible one dropped straight down the front of the Monument.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed it down with my binoculars until I could not see it anymore because o! f neighborhood roof tops.<n>

The ball of light was aprox. the size of Jupiter when first sighted but grew to about 1/3 the diameter of a full moon when nearly over head and then shrank in size as it moved to the NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball of light moved steadily towards the NW and gained maximum elevation of aprox. 80 degrees before vanishing in the NW at aprox. 40 degrees elevation.  During the portion of the flight path from aprox. 45 degrees elevation in the SE to aprox. 60 degrees elevation in the NW the ball of light had what appeared to be a yellow V-shaped area inside the orange ball that extended half way across the ball and moved as if it were a flame &#34; like a pilot flame on a water heater&#34;.   The wide end of the yellow V-shaped area faced down and the point was up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the ball went behind some trees my cousin rushed into the house to alert me.  I immediately went outside the front of our house and viewed the orange ball in the NW at aprox. 40 degrees elevation between some trees.   The orange ball at this point was the size of Jupiter and appeared to shimmer slightly as if we were viewing it through the atmosphere at a great distance.  There were no attached blinking lights as seen on aircraft just the orange ball.  The ball was too small to see the yellow V at this point.  We both watched the ball of light for about 15-20 seconds before is slowly dimmed and could not be seen.  During this time the ball moved slightly lower in elevation.<n>

It was just hovering in the same place for at least an hour and that&#39;s when I left my friends house and didn&#39;t pay attention anymore.  We saw airplanes flying and due to that we know it wasn&#39;t an airplane.  We we&#39;re on a outside patio on the 2nd floor of an apartment complex, completely surrounded by walls but we were facing the ocean.  There were two crafts, both with the same lights but they were very far apart.  They were on complete opposite sides of the ocean.  But they just stayed in place and didn&#39;t go anywhere.  At one point it looked like one of the crafts released something.  It looked like a small version of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

You know how much better you can see the skies when you are in an area like this.  There were no campfires or such, just a few battery powered lanterns, so it was really dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed this greenish light in the sky.  It would just hover, then it would dart off really fast (like a fish), and then would stop.  It would then move in ways that no known aircraft or anything that I know of could move.  It would move really slow, then dart, then completely change directions instantaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it do this for hours, as it would always return to about the same area.  There was also at least 20 falling stars that night.  There also were things that looked like falling stars, but would go strait up or across instead on down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also saw a quick two flashes like lightning, but it was not lightning.  They happened in succession, really fast.  There was never any more after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light in the sky kept making off patterns and turns that I have never seen acheived before by any aircraft or satellite.  It was very strange.<n>

I looked out my bedroom window which is upstairs.  I saw three orange-ish red lights in the shape of a triangle in the southern sky.  They were rotating and gyrating while staying in shape. It was approx. 40 degrees high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom did not see them because a tree was blocking her view.  My brother and I ran downstairs and outside to get a better look. My parents followed us.  It was lightning and thundering in the distance and as the lightning lit up the sky I saw a black colored center with the three lights on each corner but that was the only time I saw the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved across the sky to the west, a forth light approached from the lower left side of the triangle. It didn&#39;t appear to be connected to the other three lights, but it was the same orange-red color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it came closer to the triangle shape only one of those lights was still vis! ible. Then both lights faded into the clouds.  It was really intense cloud cover with an extreme amount of lighting. We didn&#39;t see it again after that.  The whole sighting was approx. 2-3 minutes.  We didn&#39;t even think to take a picture of it until it was out of sight.  My mom did try to find our binoculars but didn&#39;t in time.  My mother, father and brother all witnessed the event.  My mother made a police report with 911 and reported it to local news stations via emails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are curious if anyone else saw it or have pics to prove what we saw.  I had my cell phone in my pocket but was too awe struck to even think of taking a picture.  We were kind of paralyzed by the thought of what we were witnessing.  It was exactly the triangle shape like people describe.  As a family, we are changed forever by this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We will never forget this night!!!<n>

He turned to me and told me to look at it to make sure he was really seeing what we both believe to be a UFO. It was traveling at a steady pace at about 70-80 miles per hour at about 1/4 to 1/2 mile up. It was very clearly a triangle shape and had very define points to it. We were both very baffled as to how something that shape could be flying in the night sky. The sky was free from and clouds and it was very clear out. As it passed by it blocked the view of the stars so we knew we were looking as a solid object. It was a very surreal feeling to be looking at this object. It kind of scared me a bit as well. Being a very logical person I was going through things it might be in my head as I was analyzing it as it flew over. There was nothing that I could logically say it resembled that I have ever ! seen and I have seen many tv programs in military aircrafts and prototypes and this looked nothing like anything I have ever seen in my life. I would say the size would be in proportion with a 747 jet. It had 3 very dim square light at each triangle point. The lights were a white glow similar to a florescent bulb and they were casting a glow in between each light showing the triangle shape. As it flew over we noticed that there was no sound what so ever and as it passed us we could see the back of it as it glided over us. It was perfectly flying it a straight line and parallel to the sky. It never pivoted of veered off course. After it passed by we got a very good view of the back of the craft. It was a flat dark surface about 15 to 20 ft high. We continued to watch it until it was out of sight. I have to say that was a very eerie feeling and I will never forget what I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Same thing as we did.  It was maybe 2 miles wide from corner to corner.  It was there for 10 minutes. 30 minutes later in another section of the sky two shapes that looked cloudish came together in the moonlight and made a saucer shape.  Then it proceeded to fly off.

I would describe it, as almost a flash of light wasn’t there previously, so naturally it caught our definite attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we looked directly at it and for a few seconds as it very quickly got brighter and much bigger, like it was moving directly towards us, then in the  very same moment just as we were discussing how it was getting brighter way too fast to be a plane,  It just as quickly got smaller, dimmed, and disappeared like it was traveling away from us moving directly the same direction it had came.  This all occurred within a duration of less than 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a few moments after we witnessed this object in the sky we heard a loud boom, which would be described as similar if not identical to that of a sonic boom, which we thought to be really curious.  Now<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this was some sort of aircraft it changed direction way to abruptly to be that of any aircraft known possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And it also appeared and disappeared way too quickly, that it had to be traveling at extremely high speed.  It came and left without a trace.<n>

The time was around 11:00 PM.  I looked out my bedroom window because I thought I heard a car idling at the corner of the nearest cross-street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no car, but I looked up toward the northwest and saw three fuzzy white lights in the sky, much closer and clearer than stars, in a triangle pattern equidistant from each other and moving clockwise in a circle.  Every few seconds they would all come together in the middle of the circle, bounce off each other, then go back out to their original positions and resume moving in a circle.  The sky was mostly clear with a few thin wisps of cloud.  The lights appeared to be between me and the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute I went into the dining room and looked from that window, and they were still doing the same thing.  After about another minute I went into the livingroom and looked again, and one of the lights was missing, while the other two kept circling and touching, but after a few seconds it came shooting back into the formation from the left (behind a cloud wisp) and the three lights continued to do the circling and touching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went away from the window for a couple of minutes, then looked again, and they were still there.  I went away from the window for a couple more minutes, then looked out the diningroom window again, and they were gone.  I looked for them again on various nights after this but never saw them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I saw what I first thought to be a meteor flying east across the sky and losing altitude rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized as its trajectory evened out and speed slowed that it was not a shooting star but maybe a helicopter at this point it appeared red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then changed direction going west then abruptly stopping and returning to the east side of the highway where in came to a full stop in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was flying back and fourth it shifted its color smoothly from red to green. soon after it had become stationary we drove past it on the highway.  From underneath it seemed to have a triangular shape.  Three white lights forming the points of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was tough to tell how high up it was or its size.  It seemed to be scanning the highway not from directly above but from a seemingly adjacent position to the highway.  I could the object continuing remain in the same spot in the sky and to glow green in my mirrors for several minutes as we moved away from the location on the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was heavy traffic on the road many others must have seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to think it was a helicopter, but it moved so fast and the lights did not flash but shifted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else observe this earlier tonight?

While waiting for her I was scanning the sky, as the meteor shower is due to begin in the next few weeks. I noticed a pale yellow star as it suddenly moved sideways and stopped.  A few seconds went by and a jet plane came in from the east rather low in preparation of landing at the Ontario or L A airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was over the plane and after the plane had passed under it, it suddenly moved sideways back to where I had first observed it.  I started to go inside and get my friend to show him, but thought he would just say I was seeing things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object repeated the action two more times exactly when a jet plane was approaching from the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally decided to have him look at it and see what he thought.  He saw it do the same thing and went into the front yard to watch it.  He agreed it was strange and thought I should report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked on the object about 15 min. later and it was gone.<n>

PD))|8/7/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82732.html|160|ndxe201107| More Memphis UFOs-- confirmed by investigator as unidentified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saw first craft at 8:52pm.  It was silver in color, cigar-shaped.  It had no contrail and was flying much higher than an airplane, but you could tell it was much larger than an airplane and had no wings.  It seemed smooth.  At times the silvery color appeared whiter or lighter in areas, but did not seem to be light, more the metal itself reflecting light?  That&#39;s a guess.  We watched it fly from West to East over a period of about 2 minutes or so.  It was long enough to watch it slowly glide out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:03pm, I saw a solid black object in the sky.  At first I thought it was just a black bird because they are usually flying around, but I noticed it wasn&#39;t moving or if it was moving, it was coming straight at me.  Regardless, it was not fluttering about like a bird.  I watched it for a second, my girlfriend was on the balcony during all of this and I pointed it out.  She doesn&#39;t see as well as I do and I watched it get much closer before she was able to see it.  It was so far away or so high in the sky that I couldn&#39;t even make out a definite shape to this object.  Briefly, I thought I saw what appeared to be a triangle, but this object was sitting upright.  When it got to it&#39;s closest point near us, we could both clearly tell it was moving, rotating.  It would rotate around and turn itself as it was rotating.  I hope that&#39;s clear.  At some point, it curved off and started heading East (from the South).  Neither one of us could make out what shape this thing was.  It was! a solid upright object, not like the longer, more horizontal cigar-shaped object.  In the dropdown list before filling this out, I looked to see if any of those may have described it: like I said, it looked at some point to have at least a triangular edge to it, so it could have been &#34;diamond&#34; shaped, but I&#39;m not entirely certain, but that&#39;s the best way to describe at least the edge I did see and the mass of the object itself.  This object appeared to have a haziness around it.  At it&#39;s closest point to us, it was probably about the size of my pinky nail if my arm was stretched out.  It was small, but very far and very high.  It stood out like a sore thumb because it was solid black on a light blue sky.  You couldn&#39;t miss it.  This one also moved much slower in comparison to the silver cigar-shaped object, which it probably why it appeared to be standing still when I first saw it.  Also, this thing came pretty much out of nowhere.  I don&#39;t know if I ever mention that, but! the same for the cigar-shaped objects.  We suddenly just see ! them and then watch as they glide away.  We never see them come INTO view.  They are just suddenly there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since we have frequently been seeing this, we contacted MUFON locally and I was contacted by an investigator.  While witnessing what I described above, I called the investigator.  He called me back later and it turned out he witnessed the exact same object I saw first-- the cigar-shaped one, heading the same direction, etc.  If it&#39;s any help to gauge the size of this object, he lives approximately 2-3 miles from me.  He mentioned that it was not an airplane, had no contrail, etc etc etc and ultimately it could not be identified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.

A flock of birds caught my attention, and behind the flock of birds, in the distance, I see what I originally thought was an airplane.  I watched it, not because it was doing anything interesting, but because it was in my line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it came closer, I couldn&#39;t see any wings, and so continued to watch it, to see if it was jet plane, or a propeller plane, whatever... just idle curiosity.  So I watch this thing coming closer to me, which is completely silent, by the way, and notice as it gets closer that there&#39;s no wings, no tail... no nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a white Tylenol gelcap, complete with a thick black seam down the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stop walking completely at this point, this thing has my full attention now.  It&#39;s to the south of me, and passes at a slight diagonal from my left to my right (east-by-southeast to north-by-northwest), moving at a pretty good clip, not mak! ing any turns...still silent...steady speed and altitude and then disappears behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SOMEWHERE within that 4-5 minutes while I was watching it, and my viewpoint changed as it moved, I should have seen wings or a tail.  Or a cockpit, or windows.  I see nothing, except the black seam in the middle of it.  I realize I should have taken a picture with my cell phone, but by the time my brain kicks in and tells me that that really ISN&#39;T a plane I&#39;m looking at, it&#39;s already over the trees to my west and it&#39;s too late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So now I&#39;m looking for fighter jets flying after it, or Fox Mulder lurking in the bushes, but nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was no zeppelin, the shape was wrong and it moved too quickly.<n>

The object appeared almost stationary, though it would move briefly in small, circular patterns before again hovering in place.  It also seemed as if the object was surrounded by a reflective glare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was perfectly clear, aside from a scattered number of cirrus clouds to the far south-west.  I quickly pointed out the object to my partner who was also able to observe the object and its behavior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes, I then noticed a second object of the same description, and then a third shortly after.  Neither of these appeared to have the same brightness or reflection as the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, a commercial aircraft cut through the field of vision, though it was at a significantly lower elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three objects remained stationery and when viewed together formed a large triangle shape.  The second object then moved southward, passing the first by a short distance, and then again became stationary.  All three objects remained in this position for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I removed my sunglasses to determine whether or not what I was seeing could have possibly been a reflection in the lenses.  I was still able to observe the objects with the naked eye.  My partner was able to track two of the objects but lost sight of the third.  I lowered my eyes briefly in order to regain focus and reduce eye strain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first and second objects where no longer visible and could not be found in the surrounding sky field.  The third object, however, remained it its previous position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed for another few moments before again lowering my eyes.  I was unable to then relocate the third object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total observation is estimated at 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both observers are successful health care providers.  One is also an educator.<n>

The flash of light became just a ball of light that looked like a small star in the broad daylight.  I tried to get my friend to see it but it was gone before I could get him to focus on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later I saw the same white/silver ball of light in the exact same spot and then it faded out and never saw it again.  I have never seen anything like this and it was not an airplane as there were some airplanes leaving contrails as the went by and this object moved very quickly but made no sound.<n>

Seconds later, we saw a very large craft that was traveling in a straight line northeast toward Washington D.C..<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was faster than a conventional airliner but not as fast as a jet fighter.  It was white but had a silver belly.  It looked just like a C-130, BUT clearly DID NOT have wings!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like a C-130, the fuselage was wide, and appeared to ramp to the rear, but there were no tail fins.  On the belly were two dark grey circles side by side, easily seen as they contrasted from the silver belly.  There were two large cylindrical shapes, one on each side as if there were was a jet engine mounted directly to the fuselage on each side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see the craft very clearly.  We did not see windows, not even in the front cockpit area.  There were no markings anywhere.  No contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it looked man-made but we saw it from the side and as it was flying away at an angle....we are convinced that there absolutely no wings on this enormous aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately we were in a pool so we did not have a camera.  However, I could draw it or give a very accurate description to an artist.<n>

My friend was with me and said what is that? I looked up and saw a very bright white light with no blinking lights. It seemed to be about the same distance as a satellite. It was moving very fast south to north, It was moving on a straight line with no sound but then it came to a complete stop directly above.  It stayed there for about 5 seconds and shot straight away into space getting smaller until it vanished.  Then to my surprise 15 or 20 minutes later we saw the same thing happen again but with this time it stopped overhead for only 3 seconds but then again shot into space at an amazing speed.  It was like watching something take off in Star Wars light speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Following the layover, Skywest Air (Delta partner) flight #4524 was scheduled to depart Salt Lake City at 11:05 AM for arrival in Denver at 12:32 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During one of these two flights (I am having difficulty finding the note I made on which flight) I looked out of the right side of the plane (I had a window seat).  Traveling in the opposite direction of the plane, at an altitude a bit lower than the plane, and at a distance of approximately 120 - 250 meters away, I clearly observed a gray metal sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had a diameter that was approximately the same as an exercise ball (or about 2.5 or 3.5 feet).  I was immediately shaken /startled at how close this sphere was to the airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself that this object, and it was clearly an object, could have been a severe threat had it collided with our aircraft.  I discussed it with nobody as (1) it was gone in an instant and (2) I was concerned that a report may draw alarm by the passengers or airline crew, even though the object harmlessly passed by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if other passengers or crew saw the object.  However, I did imagine that others who looked out the window would have likely seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again it was moving in the opposite direction of the plane at a trajectory that was roughly parallel to our travel path.  So, it is difficult to approximate the speed of the object as both the plane and the sphere were both in motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are no photos or video of this event, as I could not react quickly enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I plan to continue to search for my notes that may help specify which of the two flights corresponded with the sighting, at which time I will file an updated account with NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my sixth UFO sighting report to NUFORC.

As I was driving I noticed off in the distance, above a Walgreens, positioned SE what appeared to be a black hot air balloon. It was big and barely moving, if at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking at it, slowly, my skepticism grew.  As I drove for another 5-6 seconds, I considered turning on and grabbing my video camera that I had in the car with me. I am doubtful when it comes to a UFO sighting (I&#39;ve always wanted to see one) so I feel as if my mind plays tricks on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was no trick.  It was huge.  And as I drove with smy head out my drivers side window and stared, I rolled through a light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 3 ladies out running on the corner, and they had stopped to wait for the light.  I looked at them to see if they were seeing what I was seeing but it did not seem like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO hadn&#39;t left my sight.  So I turned my camera on and pulled into my neighborhood.  As I drove in, the houses blocked the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned to open road, couldn&#39;t have been more than 25-30 seconds, it was gone from sight.  It was then that a weird feeling started to kick in, almost of disappointment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was huge in the sky. Impossible to miss.  Looked like a big black ring with a weird center type and a little tiny upside down triangle on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I saw it, it seemed to be gone.  I wish I would&#39;ve shot a photo or shot some tape of the UFO but it was all over so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still hard to believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I have seen a number of unknown objects I can&#39;t explain, but these objects looked different than the ones I have seen before.  They were red, and silent and the shape wasn&#39;t uniform, but more ball like.  And They were an odd shade of red.  They were the largest most brilliant objects in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One appeared larger in size than the other and closer to the ground (1/3 the size of a full moon).  There were two young men standing with me looking up.  I asked one of them what he thought, if he knew what it was.  He gave me the classic I am afraid and I don&#39;t know what that is before they both huffed into the casino.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My hands were trembling with excitement and I had a hard time manipulating my new iphone, but managed to take a poor picture of the second object before it went straight up into the sky it was going up and getting smaller.  They had a mechanical non airplane movement, but did move in a straight line before disappearing, and the red color seemed to glow and expand and contract.  I had a hard time focusing my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on the location I would guess these objects to be as big as 737 aircraft.<n>

It shines it&#39;s spotlight on us!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are not alone  It begins around midnight. Friday,  July 22, 2011.  It was a clear night in the suburbs of Charlotte, NC.  More stars out than usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend &amp; I were looking at the stars, admiring their beauty.  There is what looks like a really brightly shinning and blinking star off in the distant sky.  We watched it for a spell of about 20 minutes.  I thought at this point it must be a tower of some kind.  I looked away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then, this &#34;tower&#34; starts moving around.  It&#39;s now a  bright series if flashing lights that appears to be moving up, down, and side to side.  I think my eyes are playing tricks on me.  I look away from the lights and rub my eyes.  I am done starring off into the sky.  I am looking to my right, talking with my friend; when a bright, white flash in the sky behind the trees &amp; right in front of me, catches my attention. &#34;what ((deleted)) was that?&#34; I exclaimed!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then, that my friend said, &#34;it&#39;s that.&#34; (while pointing up to the sky, where the flash came from) I saw the cluster of lights (red, orange, &amp; white) revolving around in the sky.  It was high then low, high, low. It looked as tho it were flat.  This was NOT consiststant with an airplane.  Airplanes move in a straight line &amp; have simultaneously blinking white &amp; red lights.  It was moving so fast! It turned it&#39;s big spot light towards my friend &amp; I.  I thought it looked as though it were headed straight towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we could hear it&#39;s low sounding humm.  It now had shifted shapes.  It was now a sphere. It hovered over the nearest  bunch of trees &amp; then came down into our c<n> <n><n> <n><n> ul-da-sac.  Just hovering there.  It hummed along down our street and stopped right before passing us.  It shined it&#39;s bright, white, spotlight onto us both as we just stood there, starring in awe &amp; disbelief.  The UFO was now about 12 yards away from us. It turns it&#39;s light back to it&#39;s path &amp; humms as it hovers down our street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The top of the craft was as high up  as the bottom of the second story windows.  It appears to be the size of a compact car.  It moves passed our house &amp; down our street, then back up into the heavens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to take a few photos.  Unfortunately we wern&#39;t able to get anything that looked even remotely close to what we saw with our eyes.  It began to ascend into the night sky. It became flat again!<n> <n><n> <n><n> In just a few seconds it disappeared.   Back up to the heavens to be seen as a bright star again.  This whole scene takes place in about 7-10 minutes.<n>

I turned onto I-90 eastbound and immediately noticed a large strobing and, very close and abnormally bright light.  At first I just thought it was an airplane or a helicopter but as I was watching it, I noticed that it wasn&#39;t moving and it was extremely close to the ground, as close as a crop duster would fly, and the light wasn&#39;t flashing like a plane&#39;s lights it was 3 bright white lights in a slight arc pattern, shifting from left to right.  They where so bright I could see the body of the object being illuminated, it wasn&#39;t just a light It was an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching the object and as I got closer to it, it still hadn&#39;t moved. I turned off on Pines rd and stopped in the parking lot of subway to get a better look at it.  It was making no sound whatsoever and I could see it was close, probably around the Spokane Valley Mall area.  A minute or two after I pulled over, the object suddenly started moving very slowly, straight towards me.  I tried to take a picture of it with my phone but my phone is old and the camera sucks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came very close to where I was, about a half mile or so, and then made an extreme 90 degree turn to the north. NOT a curve, 90 Degrees!   When I saw that, I knew this was no plane.  It traveled north for about 2 minute then made another 90 degree turn East for about 30 seconds then a slow dramatic wide curve South, to the original position where I saw it.  As it came closer to its original position the lights just disappeared.  Like turning off a light switch, I never lost sight of the object it was just gone, in an instant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shocked, I hadn&#39;t in all my years in the military seen anything like that.  I&#39;ll never forget this night.  No one I have told believes me but I don&#39;t care if anyone believes me, I saw this thing, it freaked me the !@#$ out and I am now a believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

They kept going towards them and then they shot off so fast.....they didn&#39;t make any sounds at all....they were red/orange in color as you can see in the picture....if you make the picture black and white you can really see the detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a picture that he took with his cell phone camera....if you zoom in really good they both look like saucers...it is crazy. thanks!<n>

Central Florida<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night of July 22nd I was walking Southward on my street toward a CVS and happened to be looking up into the sky as I walked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 3 minutes into the walk, I noticed a bright orange object traveling in a Westerly direction very quickly before seeming to explode.  The incident lasted long enough for me to catch it out of the top corner of my eye, look up to see it traveling West for under 5 seconds, then burst like an explosion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very different than witnessing a typical &#34;shooting star&#34; as the light was a red orange, quite fiery looking, and rather than blinking out of existence it first exploded quite clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say for sure this was not a fireworks display, as it all happened in utter silence and with no surrounding exploding debris.  It also looked much too far away, too high up, to be any fireworks display and did not resemble any fireworks I have encountered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This could quite probably have been a meteorite exploding upon entry into our atmosphere, but an incident witnessed in the same area the following night by several people including my brother and mother have caused me to look upon it with curiosity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably not a meteor.

The entire craft was glowing with a flickering orange light that made it appear as though it were on fire and also made it difficult to tell the size and shape of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew over my house close enough that if it had been an airplane I would have heard it&#39;s engines, I heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it may have been a meteorite but it continued on its course not appearing to change altitude at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did pull out my iPhone and record video however by the time I had gotten to it, all I managed to record was what looks like a moving spot of light in the black night sky.<n>

Then very quickly moved to the right. It continued back and forth in an almost pendulum manor.  It descended towards the horizon to where we almost couldn&#39;t see it through the trees in our back yard.  I could still see it though, hovering and moving large distances back and forth until it jumped back up in the sky and hovered some more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to move back and forth, up and down until it eventually decended at a sideways steady speed and disappeared from our view.  Our 3 neighbors heard us yelling and came outside and saw it all happening as well.  We caught a small glimpse of video.  It will be online very soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, my personal phone wouldn&#39;t go to video mode and when I tried to post to facebook about what happened directly after the sighting it said something to the tune of &#34;internet down try later&#34; a message ive never seen, it was different than my usual out of service message.<n>

I thought it may be a satellite, but then discounted that because of the speed it was traveling across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to my wife who saw it as well.  We watched as it travelled north then made two or three zigzags and disappeared.  I remember it as a white light with a red light next to it and my wife thought it looked more like three red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light pattern leads me to believe it was a plane, but it was very high and the speed it traveled and the zigzag pattern were not like a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It only lasted about 5 or 6 seconds and traversed most of the sky.<n>

When we drove by the lights were attached to a object that was hovering over the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was making no noise.  The object was triangular shaped and projecting bright lights from each point and each side for a total of six lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we finished crossing the bridge, we turned around to get back on course and check out the object again.  Not even a minute later we crossed the area again and there was no signs of the object, but there was a dark haze like cloud in the general area of the object.<n>

My husband is a computer scientist and jazz pianist.  We are avid bird and nature watchers.  We walk in our West Knoxville, TN, neighborhood almost every day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight my husband and I just witnessed what might be described as a fireball in the Farragut/Concord area just southeast of Turkey Creek and Concord Roads at about 21:15 tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were walking eastward on Turkey Creek Road just east of Anchor Park when we realized that the bright object in the sky above was not a helicopter or airplane.  The center of the roughly spherical object blazed bright orange at first.  It had a dark, slightly irregular outer edge.  It appeared to be spinning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for maybe a minute at most and then the bright center quickly died out and all that was left was a dark, cinder-like spinning object, possibly spherical or disc shaped, that slowly lost altitude as it drifted roughly southwest and was lost to our sight as it descended in the direction of Northshore Drive.  It made no discernible sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do not know if there is any relation, but there has been a bad smell in the area this evening - possibly a chemical odor or the smell of something burning.<n>

It looked the same shape, size and brightness as the surronding stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached near perfect north in the sky a small very bright light zipped right in front of it, almost like a rocket.  Then the lights just dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were shocked and amazed at what we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then near the same place where we saw the 1st light dissapear we saw another star like object appear and start to glow extreamly bright.  Then it got dimmer;about as bright as the surronding stars, and started to travel towards the same path as the first light had taken.  Only in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it had gotten about true east it vanished from view getting slightly dimmer througout its entire path starting from its bright beginning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a minute or two after, another object appeared where the second had appeared. It too presented with a bright light which drew our attention and followed the exact path as the previous light.  As if it was following the light before it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout the next 20 minutes or so we were treated to at least 5 or 6 more of the same lights appearing with a flash and traveling through the sky.  Although to and from many different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a 5 minute period of rest in the sky I told the fellows we had to get back to work.  By 21:45 it was all over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several more times through the evening; until midnight when we all left work, I peeked outside to see cloud cover and was un-able to see any more action in the sky.<n>

It appeared to be very close, close enough that the shape of the object was almost discerned: a dark, almost oval shape, engulfed in a bright orange light that did not flicker or change, almost like an aura over it.  A friend and myself observed the craft for approximately four minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point it had slowed and came to a complete stop, hovering for the duration of about four minutes.  The intensity of the light did not change.  What appeared to be a jet aircraft very close to the ground (as though having just taken off) approached from the left towards the light at what appeared from our position to be a 130 degree angle.  There was about a mile&#39;s difference between the orange light and the plane.  As the plane, the orange light moved directly upward and shot away at incredibly fast! speeds.  We watched the light get smaller and smaller as it flew up through a patch of clouds and disappeared out of the atmosphere.  The time it took from the light to leave its previous location to leaving the atmosphere was approximately five seconds.  To my knowledge, there is no man made aircraft that can accomplish those speeds.  Nearly 30 minutes later, I observed three planes flying in the area the light had been previously.  We heard no sounds from the UFO,<n>

I&#39;d just driven onto highway 6.  I had my headphones on listening to a news show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up into the sky and noticed a large airplane going across the sky.  All of a sudden a very bright lime green light appears out of nowhere.  The light shoots down toward the plane very fast (like a shooting star).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, just before it gets to the plane, it just goes out.  I then pull into the middle of the yellow area of the highway. I saw out loud &#34; Did anyone else see that s***.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look around and no one is around me.  All the other cars are at the light.  I&#39;m just sitting there thinking &#34; I can&#39;t believe I was allowed to see that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt very privileged and excited.<n>

We had just watched some small fireworks from people about 100 yards up the beach and remained on our blanket to look at the stars.  It was a clear night.  We were facing the ocean and lying down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We gazed at the stars and talked as a few people walked by but we were eventually alone.  Other fireworks were seen about a mile up the beach (north).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 minutes I decided it was time to return to the beach house.  My son sat up first and when he turned around he immediately exclaimed about what he saw in the sky behind and to the left of us over land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat up, turned, and was startled to see a large orange glowing orb (far larger than any aircraft relative to were it appeared--smaller, about half the size of  a full moon).  It was about 50 degrees above the horizon and probably under but close to 500 feet in altitude..  It appeared to moving toward us at first but was actually moving away (north) from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it move slowly and smoothly in a straight line for almost 2 minutes before it disappeared into either isolated cloud cover or possibly the haze of Myrtle Beach lights many miles north.  My son was a little worried but I remained calm and explained that it was simply &#34;unidentified&#34;, and what that meant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked about  what it could have been and another minute later I turned around (from the ocean facing inland) and it was there again but directly behind us and closer.  We both saw it.  It was clearly visible and seemingly a brightly glowing gaseous orange orb with a faint red outer tinge.  My son said, &#34;It looks like fire and gas&#34;  It was unlike ANYTHING I’d ever seen in the sky before<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time I was uneasy because it was quite ominous and eerie so when my little boy said, &#34;I think we should get out of here, Mom, let’s go&#34;  I stood up grabbed the blanket without shaking off the sand, and we quickly left, still watching it as we walked up and over the board walk.  (About 2 minutes time again that we viewed  the object).<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the golf cart ride back to the beach house, I remarked that no one was going to believe us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We returned to the house and told all family members.  My son described  the object the same as I would have as &#34;orange and round and -on top what looked like a red cap&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was little hard falling asleep just thinking about what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she sounded to us to be quite serious-minded and credible.  We suspect that she is an excellent witness.  PD))<n>

Flying at very low altitudes over suburbs silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were walking through a very suburban area of town when we noticed an aircraft coming towards our direction. We hid and watched, waiting for it to pass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was a helicopter due to its slow movement, but it was nearly silent.  We thought it was looking for us because of how slowly it moved forward, and how low it was to the ground. It was in a dark triangle shape, with white lights at the ends, and a red light in the center.  I believe it had a metallic pattern on the underbelly.  The white and red lights blinked intermittently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took around two minutes for it to pass us and go behind the trees and when it did, we got to a higher elevation and could still see it (very low to the ground). It didn&#39;t move in an exact straight line, it slowly and steadily turned and turned back to keep forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 25 minutes later, another similar aircraft passed by in the same direction, slightly faster I think and this time it was silent.  My friend claims to have seen the red light glow very bright and large but I did not see this myself, he had chased after it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something that might be worth noting: we had seen up to 3 shooting stars the same night, although a couple hours before and after we saw the aircrafts.

We had started late, around 10:15 and my two smallest sons slept in my truck while my fiancee, my oldest son 16 and I worked for 2 hours setting things up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 11:15 to 11:30 I started getting the feeling we were being watched…I kept my eyes open  and kept scanning the shadows (without making it obvious) while putting things on the tables.  It may very well have been individuals watching since it is a “shady” area and the building’s surroundings were robbed the night before.  Nonetheless, I was alert but did not see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About that time my son accidentally kicked a leg out from one of the tables.  I shook my head and made the long trek around the line of tables to get the leg on the other side.   The whole time my son watched me because he thought he was in trouble.  I picked up the leg and proceeded to walk a few additional steps to my fiancee to hand him the leg (he did not hear it break).  Upon reaching him I looked in the sky at a bright light, back at him, then immediately looked back up to take a double shot…at the same time, my son followed my gaze and within 10 seconds we both exclaimed in unison “What was that! Oh my God…What was that” and looked at each other in disbelief. We both were covered in goose bumps from that moment on and for about 20 min after.  Upon talking on the way home we both were still in disbelief and kept getting goose bumps talking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both seen the same thing.  It was a large bright …super bright sphere.  This light was brighter than LED lights, yet it did not illuminate (or radiate) the light outwards.  It was as if the light was self contained….There was not even a hazy glow around it like you would imagine a light to be…it was as if a child drew a picture of a black sky and placed a white/yellow light in the center.  The  light hovered and did not move for about 4 seconds when we looked at it. Then all of a sudden it shot off to the west and  it went so fast that it looked not like a streak, but like a small line of light (like a segment in the sky).  The first part of the segment was as bright as the object  the second half of the segment was half as bright.  Then there was no more. No sound, no light, no streak, no smoke, no nothing.  It was fairly close to the highway.  As far as distance up, the best way I can describe it is… Imaging a search helicopter then imagine a large commercial airplane w! here you barely see the blinking lights, now draw an imaginary line, and put the sphere of light about ¼ up from the helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancee stayed and worked on putting the stuff out for our sale the rest of the night.  I called a few times and talked to him and he had not seen anything.  He is a bit bummed out since he loves watching UFO documentaries and is into it and my son and I don’t really think much about it.  I don’t think anything about these things.  When I was a child we were in Spokane Washington and within 1 week I witnessed 2 UFOs. 1 was a craft and 1 was a disk in a field (it was faster than our car).  As a young woman I used to have nightmare about being on a table and having aliens surround me and I can’t move or scream…just cry.  (Where those came from, I don’t know…)  I don’t talk about these things or even think about them. I love watching the stars and catching a glimpse of a falling star or meteor shower, but I have never had any other sighting since I was a small child.  I don’t watch horror movies and don’t have an over active imagination.  I guess I would like to be able to give my son a reasonable explanation for what we seen.  Thank you.<n>

The lights were positioned as such: one light on the left extremity, one directly in the center, and one on the right extremity.  I use the word extremity because the object had no wings; the object was basically a triangle.  The object disappeared momentarily behind the tree-line; when it came back into sight, the lights on either extremity had been replaced by the standard red and green aviation colored lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object first appeared we approximate its angle of elevation to be 40 degrees.

My daughter noticed something in the sky and called all of our attentions to it.  We all looked up and saw above our homes, a little to the south, there was what looked to be basketball-sized, almost clear shape with what looked something like a fire burning inside.  Similar to what you would imagine a hot air balloon flame might look like, but smaller.  It was much lower than a plane would fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The edges were not solid and it moved at a steady speed in an East North East direction.   The flame inside the &#34;ball&#34; seemed to flicker and change between a reddish and orange color, and it was completely silent.  It moved very straight, and may have moved higher but it was hard to tell.  We all watched it until it disappeared behind the tree line, which is probably close to a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to add that it is an extremely clear night with many visible stars.  We live in an open area without a lot of lights, so the night sky is very visible.  There was also no wind whatsoever.  The object seemed to be something very light.  almost like floating but with direction and purpose.  We thought it seemed to be blowing with the wind until we realized that the air was completely still.<n>

Her parents and I were sitting on the porch facing the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 9:30 or so I saw a single red/orange light in the sky moving south to north along the coast over the water.  I commented on it to my wife and mother in law, at that point we did not think too much of it.  Shortly after that there were more of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched for the next 20 minutes or so, there had to have been at least 30 of these lights one after another moving up the coast, some singly, some in groups.  Some of them were red/orange in color as reported on this page, occasionally there would be one that was closer to yellow in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us had a camera capable of taking a good image of the lights though.  My father in law thought perhaps they were some sort of lighted balloon part of some sort of celebration, but seeing this page I am not so sure.  I’m not sure at all what they were or could have been.  But I figured after reading some of these reports, I’d share what we saw.<n>

I was sitting at my breakfast table which overlooks approximately 5 acres with a tall tree line in the horizon.  Suddenly a bright yellow fireball shoots straight up from the other side of the tree line.  At first, I thought it was fireworks and I waited for the burst but there was no burst and no sound.  The object continued to ascend into the northern sky with some flickering of light until I could see it no more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a few minutes later, two large fireballs shot straight up from beyond the tree line.  The one on the left was more red in color and the one on the right was yellow-orange.  They followed essentially the same pattern as the first fireball.

There were at least a dozen of them.  They were very large with one main running light pattern.  They had very bright lights like on the wing tips and either red or white blinking lights.  But there were varied flash rates.  Some of the jets had a shape of a F15, all of them had glowing white rear parts of the engines.  They did not increase in brightness during acceleration and could be seen from any angle from my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now several of them were flying a rectangular pattern in the west horizon, as I was watching with my binoculars I noticed they were flying very fast.  But they would make very abrupt 90 deg turns, way to abrupt for their speed.  Then several were flying east to west and west to east directly over head.  One was flying a  north to south and back in a rectangle pattern.  When he changed his course to the west of the rectangle as it turned there was a distinct triangle pattern to its white lights, with a blinking red light in the middle.  This went on for a half an hour.  It was some really strange maneuvers like I have never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two jets came out of the south escorting a shinny object that looked like a large satellite moving the same speed of the jets and through the rectangle pattern the one jet had been flying.  They went across the horizon and my view would be about 30 to 40 deg of the horizon.  After the objects went out of view, all the jets split up.  Some them were playing and chasing each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure of the date because this is a revised version the email I sent C to C AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was outside looking up at the stars because one star was very bright and close and it caught my attention. Then I see a red light flashing very high up and close to this light I&#39;m looking at it thinking to myself this air plane has to see the light I&#39;m looking at since it is right next to it. The red light kept coming in my direction for about 1 minute getting lower and closer to me.The red light was flashing on and off about one time per second.As it got closer to me I noticed it was a triangle shaped dark gray object with a red light in the center.I would say maybe 80 ft long from corner to corner and 10 ft tall from top to bottom flying very slowly about 30mph.It had no wings and it made no noise.As it hovered directly over my head about 150ft above me the center where the red light was opened up.It was a circle right in the center of the craft that had 4 doors that opened up right over my head the red light disappeared and I saw a very bright white light inside the craft.You can not see inside the craft just the bright white light.It kept moving very slow past me and about 3 seconds later it closed the center up and the red light showed up again and it flew off in the same slow speed over the truck yard I was guarding.As it flew away I saw six small white lights on the rear of the craft on the bottom to top side.The lights were flashing from left to right very fast over and over.Anyone could have seen this craft it was very low and moving slow not hiding at all.I&#39;m very afraid as to why it opened up like it was going to abduct me when it was over me.It looks identical to the triangle shaped ufo with the red light in the center with 1 light on each corner.Except the one I saw only had the red light on the bottom center no other lights on the bottom and small flashing lights on the rear.I could see carvings on the craft also it was not solid.I am not one to believe in s! tuff like this but now I have no doubt in my mind.I wish I wou! ld&#39;ve ha d a camera<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

When I looked up I saw 3 lights in the form of a triangle, so I got my phone out to try to take a picture and nothing would show up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It lasted for about 10 seconds and it was gone.<n>

While on the end of the pier, I looked up into the pitch black sky and saw multiple orange lights off in the distance, directly in front of the end of the pier, but miles away.  These were very bright lights and perfectly round.  The lights would move separately in opposite directions and at different angles, but they also moved synchronized.  Often time one would disappear and then shine in a totally different position, but for most of the duration they seemed to create a triangle.  There were only a couple fisherman out there, but they also saw what I was seeing.  After five to ten minutes the lights disappeared. Soon after that I saw numerous small white blinking lights fly across the sky, which seemed to be at a great elevation, moving very fast.  Minutes after that, I could hear helicopters! flying nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/20/11 23:00|Clearwater|FL|Unknown|5-10 seconds|Red/Yellow/Orange Orb-like Lights Over Clearwater|8/21/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83091.html|219|ndxe201107| Red/Yellow/Orange Orb-like Lights Over Clearwater<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife woke me up after taking the dog outside to report to me that she had observed 3-4 orange/red/yellowish balls of light in a northwest direction of our home, hovering while making no sound.  As I work in Law Enforcement, and she is very familiar with my type of work as well as military, she concluded that it was not a helicopter, plance, etc.  She stated the lights were probably about 1 mile away, just above the tree lines and quickly dropped down below the treeline, then back up, and quickly left in a westerly direction toward the Gulf of Mexico.  As I was tired, I dismissed her statements.  The following day, I did some searching on Youtube.com and found a video of someone on a motorcyle in Clearwater that had videoed a similiar event around New Years Eve (1/1/11).  I showed her the video and she stated it looked almost exactly what she had observed.<n>
7/20/11 23:00|Tybee Island|GA|Sphere|~2 minutes|Sphere hovering over the ocean.|1/7/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116487.html|220|ndxe201107| Sphere hovering over the ocean<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were vacationing on Tybee Island and had an ocean front condo.  My husband was on the balcony at approximately 11:00 PM.  I opened the sliding doors to the balcony to join him.  I saw as I opened the doors a large ball of white light that appeared to be hovering over the ocean near the water&#39;s edge.  I asked him what it was and he said he didn&#39;t know but had been watching it for a few mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved to the left of the balcony to sit beside him and realized this object had no trailing light behind it.  We didn&#39;t believe it then to be a light from a ship and there was nothing notable on the water that we could see.  I hadn&#39;t been in my seat more than 3 seconds when it disappeared right in front of us.  I don&#39;t know which way it went because it went so quickly it left us really puzzled.  It didn&#39;t change colors but remained white the entire time before it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We just sat there not saying anything for some seconds and then we started to speculate as to what in the world it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband hadn&#39;t gotten up to come and get me because he was trying to figure out what it was, and he didn&#39;t want it to disappear if he made movement on the balcony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He then said that it was much bigger than we probably realized and appeared to him to be farther out than I thought it was.  Its light was cast on the water underneath of it.  I especially wanted to ask my husband if he had seen any beam of light behind it and he hadn&#39;t.  He said it was solitary...just hovering there over the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular night I didn&#39;t see anyone on the beach and usually there were people walking with flashlights all through the night on that beach.  I have no idea if anyone else saw it.  I tried to remember if I had reported it here on this  site before but couldn&#39;t so I decided to report it just in case.  Needless to say I didn&#39;t sleep well at all the remaining nights.  We never saw it again but unless it was some strange natural occurrence we just happened to witness and know nothing about then it was indeed unidentified! by us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date may be approximate.

It is located just south of Casper, Wyoming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were looking at the stars because it was a particularly clear night.  The three of us noticed a point of light, equivalent to a bright star, moving across the sky.  In my estimation, it traveled 30 degrees of arc in approximately 30 seconds as we watched.  It is difficult to gauge its distance from us but we heard no noise from it.  It was travelling in an approximately northward direction, and in the north half of the sky.  My father looked away at this point, but my brother and I continued to watch.  As the object approached the area of Polaris, we saw it brighten, accelerate, and disappear all within a few moments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The regularity of its behavior indicates that the object was a craft of some sort.  The fact that the object very quickly accelerated and vanished leads me to believe that it was travelling at a rate of speed greater th! an those possible by any known means.<n>
7/20/11 22:00|Paradise|CA|Other|1 min|Multiple aircraft|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83532.html|224|ndxe201107| Multiple aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> I previously reported a circle of light (Dec. 2007?) that flew over my head at 4:00 in the a.m. to this site.  This circle of light was flying below 1000 feet, no noise, did not emit light, was approx. 1/4 the size of the moon and ejected (or maybe something shot at it and missed) a fluorescent light (orange/red tube segmented with a black line)from the bottom of it.  I told my sister all about this light a couple of years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This same sister was staying with me in July of this year.  One night (approx. 7-20-11)she woke me up to tell me that the light was flying over (22:00 hrs appox.). We both went out on the deck but it was gone.  She was pointing in the direction that it was going (same as 2007 sighting - traveling from NNW to SSE). While she was pointing south I happened to glance up (north) and saw a strange craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft was right above our heads and flying from the SSW to NNE.  It was flying below 1000 feet AND THERE WAS NO NOISE.  It had 3 lights on it (red,green and white) it resembled an large airplane but it was way too bulky (?) to be a airplane in my opinion.  I could see a fuselage and wings but the wings were as thick and as big as the fuselage which doesn&#39; t make any sense to me. The whole body of the craft looked like two rectangle boxes stuck together like a cross.  I could see the craft so well because IT WAS THAT LOW and SLOW!  This craft disappeared over the tree line and about 10 seconds later there was a very loud rumble (sort of like thunder but not) that lasted about 20 seconds.  The loud rumble came from the direction that the craft disappeared (NNE), NOT from overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, about 1-2 min. after that we could hear what sounded like military jets screaming out of Beale AFB (approx. 50 miles S of us).  It sounded like 2 jets but we only saw one fly overhead about 5-10 min. later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft my sister initially saw sounded exactly like the one that I saw in 2007. A circle of white light about 1/4 the size of a full moon, no noise, did not emit light and flying very low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what we saw in July, but it was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry for the length of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching this craft fly over the tree line<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

7/20/11 21:00|Talihina|OK|Light|3 hours|Strobing Ball of light and craft.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax??  PD))|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105983.html|225|ndxe201107| Strobing Ball of light and craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin and I had been in Pushmataha county on the Kiamichi river to a spot where, 2 months prior,  we had a violent encounter one night with a 15&#39; tall hairy giant that most people call Bigfoot.  He tried to kill us by pushing a large tree over and we barely escaped with our lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this encounter we began returning to the area with the intention of eventually killing this thing with assault rifles.  Once we determined where the creature was hiding out during the day we were preparing a plan of attack to sneak in and try to take this thing out.  One day while we were in the area we made contact with the creature through tree knocking.  I knocked and he responded with knocks followed by an angry howl.  For people not familiar with these creatures, they use tree knocks to locate each other or communicate with each other in the woods.  Anyway we waited around until about dark, but the giant didn&#39;t come out of the woods on this day, so we decided to leave since!  We didn&#39;t have night vision equipment.  On the way home we were on the highway between Talihina and Buffalo Valley when I saw a strobing light about a mile back in my rear view mirror.  I instantly thought cop and looked down at my speedometer to see how fast I was going.  As soon as I looked back up I remember hearing my cousin say &#34;What the hell is that&#34;.  To my shock, there was a strobing ball of light about the size of a basketball beside the car.  It was keeping pace with the car and was about 3 feet from the passenger side window.  After following beside us for about a mile, another cars headlights appeared over a hill in the opposite lane and the light instantly shot straight up in the air.  We looked up and noticed that the ball of light went to a larger craft and the craft continued to follow us.  I decided that this had to be related to the Bigfoot creature and they could be following us in an attempt to find out where we live.  We ended up staying out most of the night driving around and this UFO continued to follow us for around 3 or 4 hours.  It finally quit following us when I pulled into a driveway near Wilburton, OK., which is not where I live,and turned off my lights.  We returned to the encounter area the next week and instead of encountering one creature, there were 3, anyway this is a story for a different site, but I am convinced that entities from another world have an invasion going on and all hell is getting ready to break loose someday soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

7/20/11 20:00|Memphis|TN|Cylinder|~30 mins|Objects over Memphis, 8pm mostly every night!  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  One of several from the same source.  PD))|8/7/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82604.html|226|ndxe201107| Objects over Memphis, 8pm, mostly every night!<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8 or 9 crafts, flying higher than airplanes, cigar in shape, some more cylindrical than others, some more pointed on the front end than others.  Most of them appeared to have a brighter tail end.  All of them were silvery in color.  No sound, seemed to just float by.  All of them were by themselves in the clear sky, except a pair that were travelling opposite directions came fairly close.  Not &#34;dangerous&#34; close, but certainly closer than airplanes fly together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects seem to appear out of thin air and we watch them in the sky until they have gone so far that we can no longer see them.  I have made a few other reports this past month and decided that 7:45-8:30pm CDT is the prime time to spot these things.  We have witnessed more that we haven&#39;t reported because they have all looked the same, appeared the same way, flew casually, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The past few observations we made, tonight included especially once it got around 8:15pm with the sun going down, was that there is a tiny blinking light at the tail end of these crafts towards the top back, although there is no &#34;tail&#34; like there is on an airplane.  These objects are perfectly smooth looking in contour, perfect cigar shapes and sometimes cylinder when the tail end looks abruptly &#34;cut off&#34; but still has the slightly tapered nose.  Also, there appears to be something stemming off the objects in the middle, coming off the side.  Almost like a wing, but certainly not long enough to be a wing.  The &#34;stem&#34; off the side isn&#39;t even half the size of the craft, not even a fourth of the size and is barely detectable.  The only way we can see it is by looking at the perfectly smooth contour of the craft in broad daylight (and sun going down) and you can tell some small object comes off the side of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of them fly lower than others.  All of them fly higher than airplanes.  Make zero noise, float along slower than airplanes.  Silvery in color, more silver than airplanes.  Very pure looking.  They fly all directions.  This evening a couple flew towards Downtown Memphis, towards Southwestern Memphis, many towards the Frayser area, and some that go straight East from where we are which is towards the Germantown area.  These things are at least the length of a football field and you would not notice them at first glance because they are so high and the silvery color blends perfectly with clouds if you&#39;re not looking for it and once the sun starts going down, the objects take on that orangish-reddish color, so they are extremely reflective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We will be getting some tapes for our video camera now.  I think we can actually commit to this.  You know, I have been envious of people that see these things to what seems to be &#34;all the time&#34; and now that we are, we really don&#39;t know how to conduct ourselves.  I really wish you guys would send an investigator out here or something.  I know somebody else will be able to see them and they have been consistent now.  We are going to ask some people if they have some binoculars or anything.  Details of these things would be easy to make out with a pair of binoculars.  These objects almost look to be inspired by our airplanes, the way the long tube part of it is, except they aren&#39;t propelled &#34;forwards&#34; and have no wings and no contrail, of course.  We think there may be windows on these things, but we are not sure and are not willing to speculate that, but it certainly looks possible and it certainly looks as though we see these objects once they slow down tremendously from a g! reat speed.  We also see tiny &#34;blips&#34; in the sky like things moving so fast we can&#39;t see them, but it hasn&#39;t been worth mentioning because there&#39;s really nothing else to describe but that and that may sound crazy, but you just know there are more than what we can physically see at any given moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was very clear tonight, just like all the other nights we have seen them.  Oddly enough, there were zero airplanes taking off or landing during all of this and usually seems the case around the same time.  We have wondered if the airport picks these up on their radars (they must!) and stops sending flights out around that time and picks back up when we stop seeing them because that&#39;s exactly what we see happen.  A few airplanes take off at about quarter till 8 and it&#39;s usually dead till well after 8:20pm as these objects just float on by, then around 8:30pm the airplanes have their night lights on and are taking off as usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.

We then noticed another craft lifting from the same direction as the first.  At this time I stepped into the house and called my son and his girlfriend outside.  They both ran out to witnessed the third craft taking off all followed the first craft on a flight path southeast to northwest.  We watched for approxamitly three minutes until they dissapeared.

It &#34;seemed&#34; to be a few thousand feet in the air. but this is only a guess.  It moved slowly across the sky, moving neither up nor down, only parallel to the ground.  The sky was clear. The wind was calm at ground level.  At first it appeared to be an orange-red light, but as it moved across the sky it began to fade until it dissapeared.  Their were no red or white light associated with it.  The light did not &#34;flicker&#34; at all, it only faded.  It did not fade as it went to the horizon, it faded halfway between the horizons.  It made no noise.  I frequently watch the skies, so I know it was not a plane or other convention aircraft.

At the same time that we were looking at it a plane passed by so that&#39;s how we both knew it couldn&#39;t of been a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 minutes of watching it I noticed it started moving very slowly straight up.  I found it weird because it didn&#39;t move at an angle at all, it was moving directly north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I stayed longer to watch it, but I felt like staring at the sky in the middle of a mall parking lot was long enough  lol<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate, which we do not understand, given that it had occurred only 34 hours before the report was submitted.

7/19/11 22:00|Evans Mills|NY|Unknown|5 minutes|Tight groups of range horizontal lights in the sky.|8/7/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82735.html|235|ndxe201107| Tight groups of range horizontal lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Gouverneur, NY near Fort Drum.   I’m 44 and I’ve lived here all my life.  This sighting occurred as I was riding my motorcycle home from Watertown Tuesday, July 19th, at approximately 10PM.  I was traveling north on US RT 11.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached a the crest of a hill outside Evans Mills, NY, I saw a string of 8-10 orange horizontal lights appear from east to west in the north northeast sky ahead of me.  I would say the elevation was roughly 35-45 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon first notice, I assumed these were flares being dropped by some type of military aircraft, as this is a pretty common occurrence at Drum.   Two observations made this incident a little different, however.  First, if it was an aircraft, it displayed no lighting whatsoever and was utterly invisible from my location. The only indication of its presence was the afore-mentioned trail of 8-10 tightly-spaced orange globes that appeared &#34;behind&#34; it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second, while what I saw were similar in appearance to military flairs, they didn&#39;t drop, emit smoke or have the halo usually characteristic of flares.  They just appeared, one after another, in close horizontal formation, then disappeared after maybe 30 seconds in the same order in which they appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw 3 or 4 groups of these lights appear and then disappear.  The whole incident occurred in what appeared to be a broad west-southwest counter-clockwise arc in the sky over the road I was on.  To continue the clock analogy, if I’m riding towards 12, the lights started at 1 and, in 3-4 groups of 8-10 lights each, arced to 10.  This took maybe 3-5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed my bike to watch the show, and a car in front of me had also slowed and pulled over to watch.  I did not pull over.  I was traveling around 30-35 miles per hour throughout, and was wearing a half-helmet.  I could hear nothing such as a helicopter or airplane.  Also, I read a report from someone on a bulletin board who claims to have seen something similar near LaFargeville, NY, around 11PM.  That’s about 20 miles from where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was probably military, but it was certainly unusual.<n>

7/19/11 01:10|Janesville|WI|Unknown|30+ minutes|Possible viewing of star-field cloaking in use.|4/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108135.html|239|ndxe201107| Possible viewing of star-field cloaking in use.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 44 year old female. I have attended several years of college, but received no degree. I receive SSDI and do part-time care for an elderly shut-in woman.  This is my report of something I witnessed from the back door of my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the middle of July, 2011.  I had been quite sad and frustrated and was home alone crying.  It was a nice night so I had the back door of my trailer open for fresh air. The door faces west and I have a wide viewing of the night sky there.  I also live a ways out of town so there isn’t much light interference. It was between 1 and 1:15 a.m. when I got up and stood in the doorway, leaning against the door jam.  My cat came outside and sat on the porch. I cried and started staring at the stars. It struck me that they didn’t look quite right, but was very self-oriented and didn’t think twice of it.  After about 10 minutes, I had stopped crying and was again staring at the stars.  A weird movement to the left of my peripheral vision caught my attention.  I couldn’t see anything, so again I dismissed it and thought that my eyes were just blurry from having cried.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to get a cigarette about 1:45 then went back to the door jam and watched the stars again.  That’s when I saw a strange sort of wave in the sky almost due west. It was like seeing 2 or 3 quick water ripples.  I thought I was seeing things so I looked closer at that area of the sky.  I know the basic pattern of the stars I can usually see and the ones I did see didn’t look right.  They were in more of a grid pattern, all seemed to be the same brightness, and they didn’t seem to twinkle.  I suddenly had an overpowering, anxious, panicky feeling that I was being watched.  I looked around at the neighbors trailers, but there wasn’t anyone outside or in any window that faced me.  I then felt a strange electric sensation that made the hair on my arms and scalp stand on end and my fingertips tingle.  My cat got up and quickly ran in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up again and was watching this grid pattern. It was if I was transfixed.  I couldn’t look away and I felt as if I was in slow motion.  I don’t know how long I stared. Then, I can’t say that there was a definite shape to the area, but the stars I was looking at started to shift like they were all slowly moving in unison.  It wasn’t a big shift, but it definitely was between 15 and 20 degrees.  It took 20 to 30 seconds to complete the rotation.  When they stopped, my field of view of the sky seemed to look closer to the normal constellations I see and the grid pattern was less pronounced. I stepped out onto the porch to see more sky and tried to see if the area had a shape I could see. I couldn’t find any edges or darker, shadowed lines. Again, I felt the electric sensation and the tingling. I remember looking down and blinking several times and shaking off the sensations. When I looked up again, the stars looked normal and I could also see the lights of an east bound ! jetliner high in the sky. I remember having the distinctly clear thought “Go inside. Shut the door. Sit and watch some TV. No one will believe you.” It was like someone had told me this because I heard it in my mind. I blankly did such.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was going on 4 when I realized that I had been sitting on the end of the bed staring at the TV instead of in the middle where I usually sat. It wasn’t until then that I even thought of the strange things I had seen. Initially, I thought the unusual &#34;stars&#34; were more along the lines of government “Star Wars” satellites.  That would explain why they were all the same brightness and in a grid.  I recalled that when I had first gone to the door, there was the noise of frogs and crickets, but after feeling like I was watched, I don’t remember hearing anything.  I never heard a sound like an engine or felt any extra air motion aside from the gentle breeze that had been blowing.  I thought that I had just been lucky enough to see the distant satellites change formation in order to do whatever “spying” or weapon exercises they did.  It wasn’t until March of 2014 that I heard of “star-field cloaking” that some UFO’s have been reported as using.  Now, I question if it wasn’t something like that that I witnessed.<n>

About 10 miles out of Carthage I began to see bright, white strobe lights ahead of me.  They were very bright and low to the ground.  I thought that it was a helicopter.  As I approached the aircraft, I had to slow down because I thought I was going to run into it.  As I went under it, I noticed that there was a bright, white light at each corner and one round, red light in the middle of the craft.  The body of the craft was so dark that I could not see it.  The only way that I could tell its shape was by the strobe lights.  The red light in the middle was not flashing.  It hovered slowly over my vehicle from right to left and immediately in front of me.  It made absolutely no sound.  I had rolled down my window to hear if it sounded anything like a helicopter until I noticed that by its shape and lights it was not.  It moved to the left side of my vehicle and flew beside me right above the tree! line.  I was going approximately 55 miles per hour and sped up to 70.  My window was rolled down so that I had a clear view of it.  It stayed beside me for approximately 10-15 minutes.  My three year old daughter was in the back seat and could see the aircraft also.  She was describing it as I was driving.  I looked to the right side of the road and there was another craft simply hovering above the trees.  I passed it, and soon noticed another even higher up.  It was simply hovering as well.  As I approached I-20 in Marshall, I no longer saw the triangular aircrafts.  Until that moment I had never heard of a triangular shaped aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We live in the country so sky watching is just something we like to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While waiting I noticed a silvery light moving fast across the east horizon line.  The speed of it caught my attention.  I pointed it out to my wife  and then we notice 3 more as we began to look around.  They were almost directly above us.  The 3 were moving towards each other when we noticed them.  One was moving some what straight from a Southernly direction to a Northern direction.  One that looked like it was coming from the northern direction was moving erratically (like jumping from spot to spot.  It was also more bright than the others) but mostly head Southernly towards the one coming from the South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third just kind of appeared out out no where and seemed to be coming from the West. All 3 looked like they were going to collide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife got excited because she thought they were g! oing to crash!  But it looked more like they passed right through each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After crossing paths or whatever they did, the one headed more Northernly seem to pick up speed very fast and quickly disappeared into the North direction.  The brighter one from the North was still headed southernly but slowed and stopped for about 1 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one that came in from the West instantly turned 90 degrees Northernly (but was more N/W in direction) at the point of meeting for the three.  It kept the same speed the entire time. It wasn&#39;t fast, but it wasn&#39;t slow!  We watched it till it faded off into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brighter one that stopped, just disappeared where it was.  It looked bigger too compared to the other ones and most of the stars that are in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other two seemed to be about the same size and brightness.  I would size them comparable with the majority of the small stars in the sky.  Big enough to see, but too small to see any detail.  Not like you would see if it were an airpl! ane, you can see its flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can only say they looked like w hite lights just like most stars look like, other than they were moving.<n>

I initially thought it was a star but because it flashed red on one side and blue on the other with white in the background at equal intervals, I decided it wasn’t a star.  It stayed in the same position for 15 minutes, was over a tree, and didn’t change  course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came in the house, got my binoculars, and went outside and tried to make sense of the flashing pattern.

I tried to use my phone to call some one but instead of ringing or making a busy tone it sounded like waves of white noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back and waited to see if it would appear again, but it didn&#39;t.   When I got back home I google&#39;d the object, and then google&#39;d the city.

Just before we were going back into the house I noticed a bright light in the north eastern sky.  At first I thought it was an airplane. However the light which at first seemed to be the headlight of an airplane within four or five seconds faded to only the brightness of the smaller dimmer stars in the surrounding sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was travelling in a south east direction and slightly away from my position.  After the light had dimmed the object never seemed to change in speed but the direction was definately moving away from us.  It remained dim and I followed it until it got too small to see.  It seemed to be going away from earth.  This all took place in under a minute.  What ever I saw was moving faster then any airplane I&#39;ve seen.  I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s very hard to explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are several small airport&#34;s nearby and we are situated about halfway between BWI and Philly Intl.   I know that some people could confuse an airplane at great distance, but I am confident it was not an airplane because it was nowhere near the normal air traffic lanes for those two major airports.  I am puzzled as to what I may have seen?  I have always looked up when I&#39;m outside at night and seen many aircraft and shooting stars alike.  I just have no frame of reference what I saw.  Is it possible for a meteor to merely pass through our atmosphere?  If so that would be a logical explaination for what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You<n>

The object honestly just came straight down then we watched it hoover to the left and it was right above business 40 highway and tall trees located parrellel to the trailer park community. It was very quiet and huge. As we were turning left under the highway&#39;s bridge we watched the object continue to hoover over the highway and trees then it just sped up and disappeared. I would like to know more info on how I can attain information relating to radar or sky monitoring within my city. I would like to know how can I get aerial information around the time of this event. I would like to know if you can help me get more info within my city about aerial info and how to get info like this. We know what we saw. We tell everybody and now it&#39;s time to get information so i! f you can help we&#39;d appreciate it. THANKS<n>

I was photographing what Estee Lauder looks at as her backyard, namely the Atlantic Ocean, at 8:23 p.m..  At the time I snapped the photo, I did not see anything in the sky.  Reviewing the photos the next day I realized that what I had formerly assumed was the sun, was casting a shadow, which seemed unlikely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After further review I realized the object was rectangular and not round.  I put the photo on to my computer so that I could zoom in, and saw that it is actually four sun colored lights in a row. I researched the time of sunset for this area on that day and it said the sun had set at 8:14 p.m..  I also realized that facing East, I would never have captured a photo of the sunset anyway, which as we all know sets in the West; let alone a sunset casting a shadow.  I was between The Breakers Hotel and the Estee Lauder Estate.  The only sounds I heard were the ocean and some birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not definitely tell! you the distance it was or the height, because I did not see it until the review of the photograph. It is either casting a shadow or emitting beams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would very much appreciate you letting me know what you think of this photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n>

Temperature 90’s F  I was in back yard, sitting in chair, facing NNE.  Reading book, smoking cigar.  No alcohol, no medicine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a pressure or tension I should look straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after looking straight up, object appeared in motion entering view from neighbor’s roof line from SSW direction.  Flew straight line from overhead to NNE.  Flight path would place it as coming from between Leesburg Airport and Dulles Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Easily resolvable in detail except for indistinct longitudinal patch of silver/white/black at rear of object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Generally a cigar shape or rectangular shape with angular-to-rounded ends at front and rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No wings.  No delta shape.  No stubs on sides.  No tail appendages.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Silent.  No engine sounds.  No air rushing past &#34;fuselage&#34; area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No vapor trail.  No smoke trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Precise straight line and constant velocity flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hard to determine size of object and its altitude, since it had no wings, and it was not an organic (fowl such as goose, hawk, duck, etc)  Sharp contrast of straight black edges of &#34;fuselage&#34; to blue sky and to white clouds it passed under.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flying under base of clouds provided limit to estimate of altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My feeling of my eyes focusing on the object gave a sense that I was focusing at infinity focus, meaning, I can only estimate object was from 600-feet to less than 10,000-feet altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bottom of object was solid black and non-reflective. No Gaussian distribution of any reflected light, giving sense that bottom was flat or nearly flat and matte or was a complete light absorbent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could never focus on indistinct rear area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was nearing a virtual intersection (my point of view) with another small white cloud, while still in blue sky, with a large gap of blue sky between it and the cloud ahead, while easily resolvable in size, color, shape, contrast, while not shrinking via perspective lines into a dot, while not fading and not blending with the sky’s water vapor, It discretely winked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It suddenly, instantaneously disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Testing the idea the object may be a science test of visibility cloaking (contrast reduction technique), I expected to see a silhouette of it against the cloud wall as its path would lead it there in the next 4 seconds.  No silhouette appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would not expect a test of dynamic adaptable contrast to occur from my observer’s point of view while it transitioned from one level of background luminosity (the sky) to another (the cloud column); I was not involved in any such test; There was no apparent observer’s station in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no deviation in pitch, roll, or yaw before it winked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time of duration of sighting: approximately 7 seconds as object transitioned from observer’s initial overhead sighting to its discreet and sudden disappearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Angles of transition: approximately 90 degrees (from occultation by neighbor’s roof line) to approximately 45 degrees before it suddenly winked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Felt no emotional reaction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was reflective on uncanny sensation of feeling need to look up just in time to see it emerge from roof line. Perfect timing.

I was looking at a picture taking in mid summer of 2011 of my wife and her sister swimming in the lake.|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86510.html|263|ndxe201107| On Dec 24 2011 I was looking at a picture taking in mid summer of 2011 of my wife and her sister swimming in the lake. I had taking a few pictures of them  10 to 15 seconds apart.  I look at these pics before on my old computer and never notice anything but then again I was not looking for any unusually.  I purchase a new computer and was looking at these pics and on one of the pics I notice a plane so I thought.  I zoom it in and notice that this was not a plane. It definitely looks like a saucer shape object.  I had family and friends look at this picture and they all say this object is not a plane. Like I said these pics were taking 10 to 15 second apart and the object is in only one of the pics.  The clouds in the background never had time to change there shapes.  There are no building or roads in this area of the lake only a highway approximately 10 miles away.  We did not  see or hear these things while we where in the water.  This is Little Abitibi Lake north! east of Cochrane.  My camp is directly in front of were we are in the water on the West side of the lake. .  I am in the water taking the pictures looking south east.  The lake is 3 mile across east to west.  The point where the object is in the sky is about 1 1/4 miles away from where we are in the water, the other point is about 1/4 mile away. There were other people fishing on the lake but there was no one at this end at the time.  We are the only camp on the lake except for a few cabins at the North end of the lake which is 7 miles away.  Anyone who come to the lake only come here to fish and they come in by boat at the East south side of the lake.  The biggest boat I have every seen on the lake is a 18&#39; pontoon boat.  Float planes fly over the South end of the lake farther inland but we usually see them and here them.  None of us heard anything at the time these pictures we taking.  None of us seen anything either. If it was a plane flying above the water 1/4 mile away we all w! ould have heard it.  If anyone else on the lake other then us s! een it o r heard we don&#39;t know.  These pictures where taking on July 17/2011 2:38 pm.  There wasn&#39;t anything unusual about the weather at the time of the photo the weather was warm and the lake was fairly calm.  I will send you the pics but I burred out the faces.  I do have the originals pic on the sd card which was taking with the camera.  Contact for More infor   Thank you  John<n>

The objects moved at least five times faster than commecial air liners also flying in the area.  The objects were not flying in formation, but rather appeared individually.  I noticed each object in turn as it flew overhead and I followed it until it was too distance to view (approximately 20 degrees from the west horizon).  Each object travelled from directly overhead to out of sight in no more than 25 seconds.  The third object, the largest, returned (from east to west) approximately 25 minutes after it was initially observed.  There was no trail behind any of the objects and I was unable to detect any sound from the object.  A large military aircraft began circling shortly after I observed the first object.<n>

It was early morning 2:30 am.  I got up to use the bathroom.  It was a beautiful clear night. I noticed blinking lights in the distance.  Looked like stars moving then they were glowing and coming over us.  I woke up my girlfriend and we both watched.  The orbs entered a long cigar shaped craft.  It was close enough to see windows and beings inside.  It just hovered about 500 feet above our campsite.  Then in a split second it was gone.  We counted 4 orbs glowing and 1 orb glowed has bright has the sun and became very large in diameter then shot out something that looked like fireworks.  W etook pictures with our cell phone of the cigar craft. It was huge.<n>

We immediately started recording with my HD FlipCam, once the objects were above us and out of our sight, we turned back around to head West so we could get them back in our sight.  We proceeded to get out of the vehicle and continue the recording of what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The groups of 4-8 objects started from the horizon, once they got out of sight above us, another group would appear from the horizon and travel in the same path as the others.  It was a continuous &#34;string&#34; of lights, as you will see in the video, at times certain objects out of the group would accelerate past the others, proving that these were not &#34;lanterns&#34; or anything sent into the sky.  If they were balloons they would not be traveling in a perfect formation like these were, they would scatter or simply travel upward and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was recording, more cars were pulling over to watch this phenomenon, I approached one of the vehicles to get confirmation of what we were seeing, proving we were not the only ones that noticed the strange lights.  Once we realized there were no more objects coming, we left the scene.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day, I contacted the Michigan State Police, they had received no reports.  However, the video I caught was once in a lifetime footage.<n>

7/16/11 23:52|Erie|PA|Cigar|00:15|Obj. with a single, white light appeared over city and Lake Erie and moved in ways I have never seen any aircraft move.|8/7/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82697.html|273|ndxe201107| Object with a single, white light appeared over city and Lake Erie and moved in ways I have never seen any aircraft move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a police officer for ten years, and I served active duty in the United States Army in a reconnaissance unit.  One of my duties in the military was to observe and be able to identify aircraft from many countries, primarily those from the United States and the former Soviet Union.  I am also a huge fan of helicopter aviation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working patrol on the night of 7/16/11 on the 2230-0630 shift.  I was in uniform and in a marked patrol car.  While patrolling on a main street in town, I was driving southeast away from the lake and toward the downtown area.  At approximately 2352 hrs., I noticed a single, white light in the sky moving northwest.  The light appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 1,000-2,000 feet over the downtown area.  I first thought the object was a helicopter.  Just up the street from me was a large hospital which averages probably 4-5 medical helicopter transports a week.  I am very familiar with the medical helicopters which frequent my area, and after a few seconds I realized that what I was seeing was not a helicopter.  I also heard absolutely no sound from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light came toward me, I realized that it had no navigational or hazard lights (the green and red lights which flash on an aircraft).  It had a single, white light.  It was very bright at first.  As it got closer to being directly overhead, I noticed that the light appeared to be cigar shaped.  But as it got even closer to being overhead, the light seemed to dim.  By the time it was overhead (approximately one minute since I first saw it), it was as dim as most of the stars in the sky.  In fact, if it hadn&#39;t been moving, I probably would have thought that it was a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I actually stopped my patrol car in the middle of the street and had to stick my head out of my driver&#39;s side window to look up at the object because it was directly overhead.  The object continued to move northwest, but it was dim and appeared to be much higher than when I first saw it.  In fact, it appeared then that it was 10,000 feet or higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I was amazed when the object stopped dead in it&#39;s tracks and began to zig and zag, back and forth!  It went in all directions.  I would estimate that if it was 10,000 high it was probably moving maybe 200 feet in each direction around the point where it had stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It became difficult for me to watch the object with my head sticking out the car window and looking over the roof of the car to my west, so I made a u-turn and parked along the curb.  I could now see the object by looking out of my window toward the west.  Shortly after I parked, I phoned my wife to tell her what I was seeing.  My cell phone indicated that I called my wife at 2353 hrs. on 7/16/11.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after I started talking to my wife, the object stopped zigging and zagging and it began to move toward the east.  Just then, another police unit with two officers pulled up and asked what I was doing.  I ended the phone call with my wife and I informed the officers about the object that I was watching.  We then exited our respective vehicles while we watched the object.  Both officers saw what I was seeing.  One of them believed it to be an aircraft.  The other officer said she wasn&#39;t sure what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the object continue east, we noticed an aircraft far out in front of it, also flying east.  The object and the aircraft appeared to be around the same altitude, but the object had become so dim that it was hard to determine how high it was.  In fact, several times the object&#39;s light appeared to fade out completely and then quickly fade back in.  However, at no time did the light of the object appear to flash or blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of us watched the object move east and, once again, it stopped in mid flight and began to zig and zag around the point it stopped.  The one officer continued to believe that the object was an aircraft, and the other officer said she didn&#39;t know what it was.  Then the other officers had to move their vehicle because they had stopped in the travel lane and they were blocking traffic.  I got back into my vehicle and drove east and parked in a parking lot one block east of my original location where I continued to watch the object.  It continued east and its light faded in and out a few more times.  I lost track of where the aircraft, which I had seen in front of it, had flown.  Then I received a call for service from my dispatcher and I had to leave the area.  The total time I watched the object was approximately 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night I looked to the sky in the direction I last saw the object but I didn&#39;t see it again.  Through the course of the night I did see two meteorites, one to the north of town over the lake and one to the south.  However, I am familiar with what meteorites look like and the object I watched was NOT a meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in my shift I tried to call the local international airport to see if they had any aircraft or any other contacts on radar at that time.  But I only got an automated system and was never able to get through to anyone there.<n>

I was just sky watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a few small palnes in the area and they were all flying under the clouds and their srobe light were flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed a light traveling from SW to NE at a high rate of speed.  I cannot say what the altitude was, but it was flying above the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued on the same path until it I could not see it anymore because of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen satellites before and it did not look like a satellite.  It was not a meteor either.  It was not reflecting the sun. The light was coming from the craft.  It was a solid white light.  There were not flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting was near NAS Whidbey Island.  There were no military aircraft in the air that night.  I will continue to observe the smae area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a similar sighting north of Washington DC in 1996 or 97.<n>

All of us have many times hoped to see a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 11pm, we saw an orange light arise from a south-southwest direction.  The craft continued at a constant speed towards us at an altitude of between 2000 and 10 000 feet.  As no one could figure out what it was, we joked that it could be aliens and that the craft would zip away.  As soon as that was said, the craft seemed to vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later, a second craft appeared and followed the exact course as the previous, moved at the same speed, and vanished at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another 5 minutes passed before the third and final craft appeared.  As this one appeared, a friend (who is an amature astronomer) quickly ran and got 2 sets of binoculars. As this craft followed the same course, and the same speed, we could see that it was a disk shaped opbject giving off a bright orange light.  At the point where the previous 2 vanished, one of us continued to follow it.  He says that it it shut off the orange lights, but had visible smaller blue lights under the body of the craft.  The craft was tracked for about 30 seconds before it was reported to have sped away.<n>

He and our daughters had seen the red glowing light on the night of July 14th, 2011, as well and had told me about it.  Now was my chance to see it for myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran out the front door of our home in Conover, North Carolina.  At about 10:35-10:39 pm, the large red glowing light moved across the southern sky moving in a south-westerly direction.  It was undoubtedly red and about twice the size of a large star or planet.  It moved steadily and straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light slowly began to dim and shrink until it disappeared.  Unbelievable.  I thought it must be an airplane, as I have seen the headlights look very large if they are coming directly at me, but I have never seen them red and I have never seen them get smaller and smaller the way this happened.<n>

I looked up and noticed three brilliant fiery orange orbs in the sky above the tree line and rooftops.  The three orbs were in a straight line and moving from Southeast to Northwest across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled to my husband to come look at what I was seeing.  As he got over to my vantage point, four more orbs followed the orignal three in a straight line.  Then two more appeared in the line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As each of the orbs reached the same point in the sky the orange light dimmed (as if the orb moved straight up/further away from us and out of sight distance.)   When the last of the initial 9 orbs disappeared, another four appeared in the same origination point in the sky.  However, they were not in a straight line across the horizon.  They were in a scrambled pattern.  Three of them followed the same route as the first 9 and the last disipated into the sky before the point where the others vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of the orbs made a single sound and none of them left a tail/trail through the sky.  We often have planes and EMS helicopters fly over our house.   We are 100% sure that these orbs were not planes or helicopters.  We tried to catch them on film but did not have any luck.  All we ended up with is an audio recording of the last four orbs that we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The light of that was switching from red to silver alternately.  It was moving as  much rapidly that I had to keep track of that from an other window within a short time and I think the moving from south to east took something around 20 seconds and  when it reached the east the light started to fading,or maybe it was due to weather condition that it seemed like fading to me...so I lost track of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> can it be something like an airplane or something like that from human made objects,or it&#39;s an UFO?<n>

There was no sound at all and the lights appeared to be brilliantly lit, but would flicker and then, fade out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see that it was approximately a mile flight path when the lights were very bright and then died out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first 2 light burned out, another set of 2 lights appeared on the exact same path.  They were lined up just like the pair before.  Exact same results as the original pair happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I looked back to the south and another set followed the same path.

I went downstairs and looked out the back screen door and saw a big ball of red/orange light.  The best way to describe it is that it looked like a big ball that was on fire. It was changing from bright red to orange.  It had a haze surrounding it that looked like it was on fire.  It moved from South to North, very slowly and seemed to stop at certain times.  It seemed to be moving upwards. When it got over the tree tops, we lost it.  We saw it for about 3-4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we lost sight of it, we ventured outside to take a look around.  We stood out there for about a minute looking at the trees ahead of us when my mom looked suddenly to the right of us and there was another one.   And it literally was right above our heads.  Unfortunately, I’m terrible with distance and size, so I can’t say how high off the ground or how big it was, but it seemed very big.  It was definitely lower than an airplane.  And very close.  Too close, so we both ran as fast into the house as possible.  From the safety of our house, we watched the second one follow the exact same travel path as the first.  This one lasted about 4-5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movements of both were the same, moved from South to North, moved slowly and very controlled, every now and then seemed to stop along the way and just kind of hover and possibly move in stationary circles for a few seconds.  Both had very intense bright fire-like glows that seemed to change between red and orange.  They both seemed to have a haze surrounding them which, best described, looked as if they were surrounded in flames or fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never saw any sort of blinking or flashing lights, just shifting of colors.  Neither object had tails or emitted any sound. And they both seemed to move upwards as they went along.  We never saw the two objects together, just one at a time.  So there is a possibility the second one was the first one that circled back around.  Though we never saw it appear, we just looked up and it was overhead.  I don’t know where it came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can honestly say, and my mom agrees, that was the scariest experience of our lives.  We couldn’t run fast enough to get back in the house.  I am regretting not grabbing a camera or something. But at the time it was happening, we were memorized just staring at it and trying to figure out what it could possibly be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And we are still baffled.<n>

It was too high in the sky to be a helicopter search light, and planes don’t emit bright lights behind them.<n>

We came around a curve and between the trees saw a very bright, orange globe of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Originally we suspected it was street light shining through the tree limbs.  As we came to the street which parallels the coast, we stopped to examine the light. It appeared to be low to the ground, hovering over the water, but with no sound.  We watched for probably about one minute and it seemed to lift back into the sky, westward, without a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange light appeared to change to more of a white as it vanished into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7-17-11 9:30pm, 7-17-11.  From the deck we again saw the same type of orange light in the sky.

Then a short distance behind them another cluster of 3 evenly spaced lights following the exact same route across the sky. After the second cluster of 3 they came in single formation evenly spaced.  About 15 single spaced lights followed the two clusters of 3.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once they got to a certain point they faded out.  We assumed they must have turned so their lights were no longer visible to us.  We thought they must be helicopters. We turned off the radio and sat their quitely but could not hear any sound at all.  My husband took a couple photos and a short video on our digital camera.

It was quite bright, or illuminated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no flashing lights, or sound we could hear associated with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came from the east, and then turned to the north and continued until out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We attempted to photograph with the camera, but due to a bouncing type movement in the camera, a cellphone picture was taken.<n>

I am located in Penfield, NY, a suburb of Rochester, NY.  The lights made no sound of any kind. They were completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first appeared alone moving from the east to west and about 45 degrees above the horizon.  It continued to ascend but moving in an arc so that as it rose it also moved further from us.  The light didn’t fade out completely it just kind of turned off. Immediately after witnessing the first one, 5-6 more arrived over the tree line in the exact place where the first was seen and followed the same path as the first.  They seemed to move back and forth with each as they flew.  Meaning that the distance between each ball of light was never constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each ball of light did not blink as an airplane would.  It also did not have multiple lights as an airplane. These were solid fire orange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this group flicked out. Another group of 4 came across following the same pattern.  While they were flying I ran to get my camera but upon my return they were too far away and again seemed to just turn off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3 minutes after another lone light appeared and followed the same pattern and turned out as it went high into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each of these lights did not move fast, they did not leave a trail of light.  They flew in some sort of formation.  I would guess that it took about 30-45 seconds for each group to make their flight across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurrence was observed by myself, my wife and our 2 children who are 6 and 8.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone on two occasions, and he seemed to us to be quite objective and credible.

It seemed to remain stationary.  I was able to maintain visual the entire time until we took the first Laurel exit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, as we were heading to the stop sign, the object flashed with several round lights across the front, then turned black, then back again to white.  I lost visual as we got onto the road that heads past the railroad to Walmart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After shopping at walmart for approximately 30 minutes we left the parking lost of Walmart heading towards Bridger.  I glanced up and over the railroad area and saw a similar object that was still rectangular, but not as long and a little taller, not quite square, it seemed to be over the area where the high school would be or beyond, past it farther down the road maybe.  It flashed very bright and then disappeared.<n>

The object remained visible for at least 10 min.  Planes and firework balloons crossed in front of the object by it remained stationary.  It had to be many miles away from us because of its small appearance.  It would fade out behind the smoke of the fireworks but once the smoke moved on the object was still in the sky blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We where able to maintain a visual until the progression began again.  It then started to slowly move away, we lost sight at that point.<n>

Hooked around and jetted away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling on the interstate heading west late at night around 1 on a clear night when I noticed a bright white light hovering in the sky it sat there for about 5 seconds , then it dropped down and hooked around to the north , and all of a sudden just took off , slow enough where I can still see the light leaving but fast enough to where the light dissapeared in under three seconds.  During the durration of contact I never heard any noise emiting from the object.<n>

No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to get my daughter. When we came back out, the ball had stopped moving and was now suspended in the air, alarmingly close above the neighbor&#39;s roof. (Perhaps 200 feet?)  We stood fixated, watching the object, guessing what it may be.  As we were talking, we observed three tiny orange lights blink in consecutively, below the ball.  The small lights were below the object &#34;pearled together&#34; at an angular slope of about 45 degrees.  Once they blinked in, they began rapidly pulsating, one after the other, consecutively.  Then, the big ball began shrinking slowly, and while it shrank, the little lights blinked out a few seconds later, again, consecutively.  Then, the big ball faded out of sight, as well, right on the spot where it had been.  Because the object was not moving, and hovering low, at t! he time it faded out, we thought it had cloaked itself.  After that I made a report to MUFON.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now reporting it here, as well.  (We did not panic, were not afraid, had no unusual physical sensations, but we were stunned.)<n>

Our plan that night was to go out on the boat before dark, (about 8:00) find a spot about 35 miles offshore and fish through the night there.  We expected to return the next morning.  The waves were much rougher than they were supposed to be so I got very sick and slept and the cushion in the front of the boat.  My dad also became sea sick but he kept fishing making it even worse to the point that we decided to return early.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were pulling up to our dock at about 2:15 in the morning I was getting the ropes ready and my dad was driving so we were not looking at the sky.  My uncle then said “what is that?” and pointed to the sky, when we looked up we saw an object that appeared to be on fire.  I thought the object was a plane about to crash but I soon noticed that it was not.  I could see that the top of the object looked like a large isosceles triangle pointing upward and the bottom looked like a small equilateral triangle pointing downward.  I was very interested in the object so I watched and after a few minutes my father and uncle dismissed it and began unloading the boat.  As I continued to watch the object it went from the bright flaming orange color to a darker yellow color as it got smaller this looked to me like it was going farther away.  The object retained its shape as it got smaller. The object made no sound the whole time.  I then watched it go across the sky from the left to the r! ight at a very high speed then immediately stop, hover in place for about 2 seconds then completely disappear.  Then we saw nothing more of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on my dad asked my uncle if he thought it was the sheriff’s helicopter (which I knew it wasn’t) and he said no which was a trusted opinion because he is a lieutenant with the Police Department.  None of us said anything about it being a UFO but we probably were all thinking it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on I talked about what I saw with my dad and he told me he thought it may have been a UFO.  When I told my sister she did believe that we saw something that night but would not admit she thought it was a UFO.<n>

As I came to the stoplight at the intersection of S 170th and Pacific Highway South I could see that the whitish/yellowish light was moving North.  It seemed like it was travelling right through the middle of the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was not flashing or blinking, it appeared to be a single light.  It moved at about the speed you might see a helicopter moving at, like the ones I see leaving the Renton Airfield all the time.  But this was definitely not a helicopter and I’m not an expert or anything, but I know helicopters don’t fly directly over the airport like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned right (North) on Pacific Hwy after sitting at the stop light and watching this strange light.  It was out of my view at this point.  When I reached the next stop light at the cemetery, I turned around to see where and what the light was.  I could see it through the trees in the cemetery now, and it was beginning to turn to the East, toward Burien.  I returned to the intersection of Pacific Hwy S and S 170th St. again, this time turning right (East) back onto S 170th and continuing on Eastbound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was in full view, directly out in front of me in the distance, as I passed under the overpass on S 170th.  I watched it from the stop sign.  The light seemed to fade in and out once; not blink or flash, but gradually disappear and then come back.  I could see that it was moving away from me to the East and slightly North and then it seemed to just disappear into the clouds over Burien area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all took place over a course of about 10-12 minutes.  The light was small; it looked like about the size of a large start might look, except this was obviously in our atmosphere and below the cloud cover.  The height in the sky was maybe 30-50 deg. off my horizon.  I’m not real good at estimating the height, but I can say it was definitely not more than 50 deg., as I was able to see it in my peripheral without having to look up much to see it.  That’s how it caught my eye, I noticed it moving out of the corner of my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This statement is true and without falsehood and to the best of my recollection.  I am journalist for a local newspaper and understand and acknowledge the importance of accuracy of any account to be reported.  I am also a single mother and active member of the community in regard to local politics and the public schools my children attend.

We were 5-10 minutes NW of Wayland, MI when we noticed an orange/amber fireball SE of our position.  I estimate its angle of elevation was 35-40 degrees.  It looked to be flying very slowly, if not hovering at times, over downtown Wayland.  Having seen similar things before, we decided to follow the aircraft.  The aircraft had been traveling S but started traveling SSE once we got closer.  When we reached our exit, we turned E.  The aircraft remained visible the entire time, save for a brief moment when it disappeared behind some trees on our horizon. Regaining sight of the aircraft, we turned into a parking lot facing N to observe. After a moment, we realized the aircraft was now heading due South and was going to fly directly over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we pulled into the parking lot, I estimate the aircrafts angle of elevation was 30-35 degrees and steadily declined until passing overhead. I&#39;d say the aircraft remained under 150 yds in the air, at all times.  As the aircraft approached, the first things we noticed were two lights on its nose pointing forward.  That&#39;s to say, it had headlights very similar to a car. The aircraft also had 5-6 white lights on its underside.  The aircraft didn&#39;t have visible registration lettering, wings, propellers, a tail, cylindrical shapes, or navigation lights.  The aircraft was small, dark, and triangular.  It made a sound very similar to a jet, but was much quieter.  We didn’t see any afterburn. Even thought it was directly overhead, we were able to converse comfortably.  As the aircraft passed overhead, it was hard to discern the finer details of the body, perhaps from all the bright lights on its exterior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the object now traveling away, we got in our car and headed for home.  The distance from where we witnessed the aircraft to our home is 5 minutes by car.  After 10-15 minutes of being home, we heard a sound very similar to what we had just heard, flying overhead.  We stepped out on the back porch and saw the aircraft fly directly over the house were in, traveling S.  The night continued without further incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The appearance and probable point of origin of this July 19th &#34;fireball&#34; matched what I, a neighbor, and his daughter observed on July 3rd (traveling North to South in the eastern sky), as well as what I observed on July 15th (traveling East to West and then turning North, almost directly overhead).<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I&#39;m now convinced my July 15th sighting was a Chinese Lantern.  Not an extraordinary object, but an ordinary one displaying an extraordinary flight path and characteristics (likely due to the interaction of winds at altitude).<n>
7/15/11 21:20|Lafayette|LA|Formation|5 to 7 minutes|Red lights over Lafayette, Louisiana.|7/17/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82508.html|304|ndxe201107| Red lights over Lafayette, Louisiana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am one that can usually find an explanation for just about anything, but last night July 15, 2011 at approximately 9:20 p.m., I went into the backyard of my Lafayette, Louisiana home and looked up in the sky facing North West, immediately I saw seven bright red/orange round objects/lights in a slightly staggered formation.  I was stunned at what I was seeing and I started yelling for my boyfriend to “get out here”.  Once he stepped outside he saw exactly what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, I would say it all took place over maybe a 5 to7 minute period.  They moved horizontally towards the North while appearing to gain altitude and one by one they would disappear.  Then, we noticed another one approaching from the West beginning at the horizon, just above a distant tree line, moving in the same direction as all the others.  Then there were more coming from the same direction totaling 12 to 13 and they faded away one by one in roughly the same location in the North.  During the entire occurrence there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to take pictures and video, but nothing was clear.  We live on the outer edge of the city, so the sky is not affected by the city lights.  There are only a few street lights in the subdivision.  Also, I am very familiar with planes, stars and even shooting stars out here and these objects we saw were none of these.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once everything was over, we were both in shock.  I called one of the local news stations to find out if there were any reports and I was told none were called in.  I then called the airport (knowing these were not planes) and asked if they had any planes taking off or landing at that time.  As I was speaking with a gentleman at the airport, he told me they had one that was supposed to land at 9:30 p.m., but was running late and at that point I saw it flying across the sky and it looked nothing like what we had seen previously.  It was moving across the sky at a much more rapid pace.  I searched the internet for any other reports last night and this morning, but I found nothing.  Then, I found this site and called the number given and now I am posting this detailed report of the occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is there any other explanation for what we saw?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally objective and eloquent in her description of her sighting.  We suspect that she is an excellent witness.  PD))<n>

Sky completely overcast (low) ahead of a storm cell moving in from the west/northwest.  Calm, no winds (dead air).  Orange fireball, with white and yellow bright spots, traveled from the east to the west (opposite direction of approaching storm) to a point over the center of the city (almost overhead), then made a wide turn and traveled north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disappeared above the northern part of the city by flickering out, then in, then out, then in, then out.  It was a bright fireball (almost as intense as a road flare), at the altitude of most of the small planes I see above my neighborhood (they use the municipal airport northeast of the city) and about half the size of a small plane.  Its speed was the same or a little faster than the speed of a small plane.  No landing or navigation lights were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A neighbor, his daughter, and I saw two of these orange fireballs the night of July 3rd, traveling one behind the other, north to south, in the eastern sky.  We believed they were Chinese lanterns.  I have no explanation for what I saw tonight.<n>

Why do you believe that this phenomena is anything but man made? eg. lanterns/orbs....&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I replied:  &#34;Like I said, I have no explanation. It first traveled west, made a wide turn, and then traveled north.  Ninety-degree change in direction. SSE winds at the time were 0 MPH and no gusts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked Weather Underground right away, because I thought it had to be a Chinese lantern.&#34;  &#34;I suppose a SSE wind at altitude could have interacted with approaching NNW storm winds, causing the fireball&#39;s change in direction.  But then, it&#39;s reasonable to think there would have been something erratic about its change of direction - if it was a floating object like a Chinese lantern.  Visible bobbing, stalling, weaving.  There wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireball maintained constant speed and altitude, and followed a perfect straight/elbow/straight path.&#34;<n>

While walking I looked up at the sky because there was a helicopter blinking.  After a couple of seconds a light flashed in the sky, a good distance west of the helicopter.  Originating from the small flash, a cigar shaped object started to dart across the sky much faster than the helicopter.  It glowed a dull yellow color, almost a grayish yellow.  It also looked as though part of the midsection was missing or transparent.  It flew very smoothly and quickly through the sky for about two or three seconds before vanishing before my eyes.  This all occurred silently, the object made no sound at all.  I have never seen one of these before, so naturally it was quite exhilarating.  The adrenaline rush gave me the energy to run back home where I told my family, then continued to look for somewhere to report it to see if other people in my area also witnessed it.<n>

I was outside and had gone for a late walk around the neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My house is on top of a hill and I have this wide, open view of farmland with nothing around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was walking up my driveway I noticed three shining bright lights in the distance over the farms, maybe a little further back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped immediately and just stared at them.  At first, I thought it was just a plane, or a few of them, since there&#39;s a lot of small planes that fly near my home.  But I noticed that these were not moving.  They were almost floating there and they wouldn&#39;t budge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to think of any possible explanation but there wasn&#39;t any.  There are no cell towers or lights of any kind in that direction, it&#39;s all farmland and a few houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood watching them for a good five minutes, and then slowly I saw them almost fidget. That&#39;s the best way I can describe it.  I had been so distracted that I hadn&#39;t bothered trying to get a photo until the last mi! nute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked down at my phone to turn on the camera and when I looked up, they were gone. It was as if they just disappeared.  I literally looked down for a split second.  There was no way that could&#39;ve been any type of plane because I would&#39;ve seen the lights fade away.   They just completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never experienced anything like this ever before. I always believed in life on other planets, but I never really believed in UFO sightings.  Until, obviously, I had one of my own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can still see the lights clearly in my head like it was yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the strangest thing I have ever experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

That is, bottom-up coming back and from above to the earth.  I thought it was the effect of my exhaustion and I retire to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I noticed my horses did not come to greet me as usual.  I Send a child to look around the farm, did not find my horses, sent one of the farm workers who work with me and he did not found my horses either.  I went out looking for horses (7 animals) and did not found its.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Called the radio station to transmit a message across the region so that if someone saw my horses get in touch with me.  It was 1230 PM.  When talking on the radio to alert the community  and the authorities of this region.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Half an hour later and not knowing how or where the horses came out of a hill where there was no open on the fence that borders the farm. They came together at high speed running.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Sent  a worker who works with me to inquire about where these horses break the fence.  After researching,  he tell me that there said were no broken wires or clearance hole in the fence of the farm.  Still working on the ground and reaching the vicinity of the place where we the animals appeared we note a big dark green circle on the grass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This circle is about 10 meters in diameter, formed by a line of dark green grass and grass about two and a half foot wide. A well-defined line and an almost perfect circle.  The strangest thing is that herbs are born on the edge of the circle are half dark green leaves and leaving the green circle.  That is the boundary of the circle affects a single herb or shrub.  Dividing leaves and branches on one side one color and another of a different color.  Even after 15 days the circle is clearly seen.  I have informed the authorities of the National Botanical Center to find an explanation for these strange circles (for now discovered another higher up on the farm)<n>

I have tried telling this story a few places and around the internet but have gotten no feedback, corroboration, or other information from any of these sources and I was actually hoping you could possibly tell me that I and my partner who also witnessed this are not alone in seeing this type of occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the summer of 2011 (I&#39;m sorry I cannot tell you the exact date) and the sky had 100% cloud cover.  The clouds were very low and dark but not too dark.  It looked like a storm of some sort was brewing so me and my partner went out into the street to see what sort of natural spectacle that storms normally produce.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then without any thunder or noise of any sort a &#34;grid&#34; made up of perfect hexagons of what could only appear to be electricity appeared over head.  I would say it formed about 3 rows at a time of chains of perfectly shaped hexagons that moved or scanned back and forth across the sky in an east-to-west direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no thunder, no rain; only these &#34;electrical&#34; shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was mesmerized but I would say the formation lasted approx. 1 minute and scanned back and forth changing direction several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never heard of any sort of event and I cannot seem to find anyone who can shed any more light on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again I apologize as this is not exactly a UFO sighting but I have exhausted all other sources and am desperate for some type of clue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I was not under the influence.  My girlfriend and I were strolling along, and i caught 2 bright object out of the corner of my eye.  They immediately shot down from the sky, as if almost direct in front of me, but not the same perspective, cant really explain it. point being, they shot down at light speed practically. I looked at my girlfriend and she said &#34;what was that&#34;?  i asked if a bird crapped on my head, she said no, i though it was just something dumb and moved on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> about 45 seconds later, the same 2 object reappeared and swooped down in like 1/2 a second, like it said, it was like i caught them out of the corner of my eye in the sky, the swooped down, almost in between me and my girlfriend, and disappeared. when this happened a second time, i was convinced a bird pooped on my head and i stood motionless and asked her to look. as i looked over, everyone across the street was looking at me like they had seen a ghost. i was slightly nauseous but we kept walking. i was pretty freaked out. i am convinced it was orb&#39;s, since extra terrestrials are said to live in different dimension and not adhere to the same time and space restrictions, it is possible. it was twice, and never again since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> now the weird part- i did research, and those same two orb-type objects are being seen all over the country at the same time. it was busy week for sightings, is all im saying. and its getting busier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> since the sighting, i went back to the area where the sighting took place, to try and understand the significance. there is a direct route from my house to the sighing location. the entire time i walked to the site, at night, the moon and the only bright star in the sky practically pointed to the location for me. it is exactly between the two, and as a third point of reference, there is a red light from a tower behind... if you were to draw a triangle out of these points, from the angle, it would point to the location i was encountered. kind of like a guide, if you were looking for that point in the city. weird how it all lines up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> anyways, i will be investigating this more, i will be looking at the significance of the point where it happened (the landmark is at the point of a triangle in the road, and marked by the stars in a triangular fashion). any help would be appreciated...<n>

I looked up at Orion’s Belt and noticed what I thought was a star moving North Northeast at a smooth, steady pace.  The light was the same color as the other stars in the sky, a bright white with no flicker.  As I inspected the light I noticed that it was too high up to be a plane around Dallas (my house is right underneath the regular flight patterns for incoming planes into Love Field and DFW Airports) and it was moving too slowly to be a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it might have been a satellite due to the size of the light and the steady speed, but after 10 seconds the brightness swelled (not like a flash, but like someone manually changing the intensity of an indoor LED light) and dimmed back down, with the light beginning moving in a small zigzag or spiral pattern before it disappeared.  To me it looked like it just faded out of sight but my friend saw the light get smaller in the sky until it was completely gone about 8-10 seconds later, like it shot up into the sky at speeds unmatched by man-made craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire encounter took about 20 to 30 seconds and occurred just below Orion’s Belt from our position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the Orion Constellation is not visible during the summer months.  Object sighted may have been the reflection from an Iridium satellite.  PD))<n>

The object appeared to be below the cloud ceiling, appeared to be stationary at first.  The object then began to travel NW; the object traveled a short distance, then stopped.  The object repeated this maneuver 3-4 times before traveling steadily NNW and continuing on its trajectory.  I viewed the object for 5-6 minutes, (during which the aforementioned events occurred) until the object was in a position as such that I could not view it from my vehicle window and continue to drive safely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 15-20 Minutes Later...<n> <n><n> <n><n> While traveling East, in Kalamazoo County, at approx. 65 mph, I noticed another yellow-amber light remaining stationary.  I approximate the angle of elevation to be between 55-70 degrees.  I viewed this object for 3-4 minutes, all the while remaining stationary.  The object&#39;s luminosity began to dim; simultaneously, the object began to lose its yellow-amber hue, quite quickly, and began to turn a blue-white color.  I watched as the object dimmed and disappeared from the sky.<n>

I have to smoke cigarettes outside in which I see small aircraft and airlines every few minutes in this area, and its not unusual to see military helicopter sometimes.... this didn&#39;t match any of those, the intense bright lights didn&#39;t flash, nor were there blue or red lights seen as the law requires.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This might be just aircraft misidentified, however what kind ??<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above.

7/14/11 17:03|Chicago|IL|Oval|25 seconds|Very large white oval travelling at 300 miles per hour spotted over Chicago|7/17/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82463.html|331|ndxe201107| Very large white oval travelling at 300 miles per hour spotted over Chicago<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live just west of Wrigleyville on Chicago’s north side.  At the time and date specified I was looking through the south-facing window of my top floor apartment.  The weather was clear with only high wispy cirrus clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed an oval-shaped object which was quite some distance away, almost due south (SSE), and travelling westerly, with a color of white much like a cloud.  I would estimate the object to be three to four miles distant, and its size to be at about five or six jumbo jets in length.  Its height was approximately half its length.  The ends of the oval-shaped object appeared to be perfect semi-circles in shape, while the top and bottom were flat and horizontal, much like the “Begin” and “End” shapes on a flowchart symbol template.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I live near Wrigley Field, where the Chicago Cubs play, I first assumed it to be an advertising blimp.  Wrigley Field often employs a blimp to circle the field with a promotional message during games.  But the object was as far distant south from Wrigley Field as I was (at least three miles), and though at first I did not think much of the object, what caught my attention was the enormous speed it would have to be travelling-much too fast to be a blimp.  Using my estimate as to distance and size of object, I estimate the object to have been travelling at about 300 miles per hour.  I will emphasize again that the object was very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the westward-travelling object got due south of me it made a gradual left turn and headed due south so I was viewing it end on.  It continued travelling south, but instead of slowly getting smaller with distance it seemed to quickly (within two seconds) fade from my sight altogether, which I thought was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  I checked the Cubs schedule and they will be playing at home against the Florida Marlins starting at 7:05 p.m. tonight, some two hours after my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outdoors at 5:30 p. m. to check for an advertising blimp, but found none.<n>

We were driving a 2001 Ford Taurus.  I looked to my left and there was a church on the lower level street.  I then looked above the church and saw what looked to be about 50 to 100 feet in the air, three golden lights in a triangle formation hovering and rotating counter clockwise.  After a few seconds of witnessing this strange phenomenon, I saw grey spheres begin to form around the lights, and I started to fade in vision and found myself looking at the floor of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The driver and passenger assumed it would be a good idea to instead of stopping the car to drive to the nearest exit and get on the opposite side of the highway to get a closer look.  By the time we came to the other side of the highway, the lights were gone.  All three of us got out of the car and tried to collect ourselves.  I looked to the parking lot and I saw an SUV pull into the parking lot of the church with the light! s off, and what looked like a husband and wife get out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The husband had a video camera but the lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, on the highway there was a man who seemed baffled at the incident as much as we did.

After speaking to her on the phone for a few minutes, I got into the car with my mother and two of my cousins, one of whom is the son of my Aunt to whom we’d been speaking, to find my Aunt since she sounded frightened.  My mother called local police who asked if my Aunt needed assistance, and since we did not know, they advised us they couldn’t do anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got onto Highway 79 at the intersection of Highway 227 heading East toward Ithaca, still communicating with my Aunt; it was at that intersection that she had told us she first saw a large glowing orb and then up to 7 other moving, pulsing lights as she continued.  We saw nothing, but as we crested the first hill, I saw two lights over the trees, at a high altitude, to my right (South) pulsing and alerted my cousins and my mother.  We watched these lights for a few moments, debating on whether or not they were stars at first.  Both lights were blinking/pulsing very rapidly and then they moved across the highway to our North and joined with a third blinking light.  During this transition, there were a few aircraft flying toward Ithaca, and we were able to compare these lights to the light of a commercial aircraft, and the two were definitely not the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed these lights for nearly 10 minutes and our movement during this time resulted in the lights slowly shifting to the north of us so that I could no longer see them from my position in the driver’s seat without completely ignoring the road.  At this point, my cousins (my mother was in the backseat talking with my Aunt on the phone and no longer actively observing) began to get very excited, saying there was a fourth object that joined the other three, which had maneuvered into a triangle formation at that point.  My Aunt’s son said that if he observed the three lights that were in the triangle formation through the tinted rear windows of our van that he could make out a huge, dark triangle shape with the lights at its corners.  He also reported that the fourth object “flashed” and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we entered Ithaca, we lost sight of the objects and met up with my Aunt, and observed local air traffic for nearly twenty minutes so that we could confirm none of us could see the objects we had previously seen any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other two reports from Watkins Glen for this date.  We spoke with one of the witnesses via telephone, and we found her to be exceptionally objective and eloquent in her description of her sighting.  PD))<n>

I was very concerned and asked her son and my son and one of our nephews to drive with me to find her, mostly to make sure she was all right since she was all alone driving in the dark. We left Watkins Glen and turned up the hill on Rt. 79 at its intersection with Rt. 227. Once we reached the top of the ridge, my son who was driving and our nephew who was in the front seat of the van started yelling that they were seeing something, and my sister’s son joined them in the front and also started spotting these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am older and don’t see as well at night as they do, but I did move to the front of the van to see. I could make out three lights moving much faster and more erratically than any plane or helicopter could, traveling first in the sky over Ithaca ahead of us (due east) and then whipping around to swing in the sky to our left, which would be northeast. Their movements were unpredictable, very swift, and jerky. The lights I saw seemed to have a reddish-amber cast alternating with a yellow-white color. They were very far away and very high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am president and owner (with my husband) of an editorial services firm, college-educated, in my late 50s. I do not seek after paranormal or other-worldly events and was only along on this ride because I wanted to make sure my sister was all right. Though I definitely did see something that was not like anything I had seen in the sky before, I have no theories about what those lights might have been nor am I in a big hurry to find out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other two reports from Watkins Glen for this date.

It looked like the body of a jelly fish or a fire lantern but not of rigid construction in that the shape was flowing and changing but always stayed hollow.  At one point it looked like a sail was flowing on the top. There was a light situated in the base that changed in intensity, size and color randomly and sporatically.  The glow of the light at the base illuminated the inside of the globe.  It hovered slightly at the altitude of a high flying hot air ballon, floating much like one, slowly accending.  It did not seem to make any mechanical noises.  It did this for about 10 seconds.  The globe then began to ascend up and in a south westerly direction until it was just a redish rising spec and then it disappeared completely up into the night sky. It took less than 10 seconds to ascend to nothingness.  Area is an approach for the Columbus airport but the object was clearly not an airplane.  Airplanes were flying, cicrling for approach even in the immediate vacinity when the object was observed.<n>

I live under a flight path of our major airport in the area, so I am very familiar with the lights on aircraft because the aircraft are generally low altitude when they reach my home due to my close proximity to the airport.  This light was different though because it was bright orange and pulsating, moving in a southwesterly direction.  No landing lights or anti-collision lights could be seen.  The object then moved out of view behind the trees and homes in my neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later i noticed the same? craft moving again in the same southwesterly direction but in a little different spot in the sky.

The object flickered as it moved, the faster it moved, the more rapidly it flickered, yellow, white and gold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It ascended very quickly until it looked like a moving star, and I saw it join up with three others just like it, then several more appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another orb appeared on the horizon line in front of me and seemed to be headed right for me, but it also ascended and joined the others far ahead of me, very high in the sky,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I counted 8 all together.  They were all yellowish white, occasionally one of them would throw off what looked like and orange flare.!  They circled each other fairly slowly and asymmetrically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I got in my car and continued to try to follow them as I stayed in communication with my family and they reported seeing the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we finally met up they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This took about 20 minutes from my sighting of the orb to the multiple orbs disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:    PD))<n>

Our sofa faces the west window exposure in our loft.  It was around 9:40 p.m. when I jumped off the couch yelling &#34;what the he&#39;ll is that?!?&#34;  My lady looked and couldn&#39;t believe it either.  What we had seen was a green fireball like object jet across the window exposure wickedly fast.  There was a small trail behind it but quickly dissipated.  The fireball then vanished into the sky while moving south west.  What&#39;s interesting is that I&#39;ve seen this green fireball twice before in a property we lived in just one block east from where we currently reside in 2004.  It was seen traveling in the same south west direction.  My lady didn&#39;t necessarily believe me until this evening.  I can say what we saw this evening lasted roughly 12-15 seconds.  In our prior living space we had north west exposures so I know it had come from that direction.  Tonight It just appeared west and travelled south west.  She and I thought maybe fireworks initially but there are no structures surrounding to allow a launch in that direction especially being it moved horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have an iron clad memory and know without a shadow of doubt this IS the same gree fireball light I&#39;ve seen twice in 2004.<n>

The object made no noise or any sounds at all,unlike conventional aircraft or jets or a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really made me decide it was a ufo was that it glowed a bright white.  I walked down the road staring at it until it was out of site, then I turned around and walked back approximatly an eighth of a mile and saw it again in the other direction for about one minute,then the craft was gone over the horizen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time I saw the craft a prop engine plane flew by in the other direction,making clear in my mind that the object in question was nothing I had ever saw,so therefore I was prompted to file this report.<n>

He suddenly called out to me: &#34;You&#39;d better come out here quick, quick, what are those things flying in the sky?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran out onto the balcony, (we&#39;re on the third and top floor of an old brownstone type building with clear views over towards Mount-Royal) and I saw two morphing golden glowing disks about a mile up in the sky.  They retained their golden glowing colour with the same intensity whether on the blue of the sky or over the clouds.  They were flying in formation a few hundred feet away from each other, one slightly ahead of and above the other.  They seemed to be quite large, around the size of a small passenger plane, perhaps larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend says their shape was originally flat, but they had morphed into ovals and disks by the time I got there.  They were flying across the sky at a slight incline at a moderate pace, similar to the speed of an airplane.  They flew roughly towards the sun and then accelerated and turned 180 degrees on a dime and flew back in the direction they came from.  Nothing I&#39;ve ever seen in my life accelerates BEFORE turning 180 degrees in mid-air, and there were TWO of them flying in tandem.  They seemed to fly very much like the UFOs in many other videos I&#39;ve seen recently, specifically, the ones over the BBC offices in London.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we both ran to the front of the apartment where we have another balcony.  They were flying very fast with an erratic almost playful flight pattern, darting in and out of the clouds in a southerly direction.  Stopping and hovering for a second here, a few seconds there, then they abruptly disappeared. The whole sighting lasted about five minutes, no more.  Unfortunately we got no photos or video.<n>

He pointed at it and asked, &#39;&#39; what is that?&#39;&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all looked up and witnessed a greyish white (about the same color as a cloud) cylinder shaped object flying south.  The object had no lights, no wings, no rotors (like a helicopter) and left no vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to gauge the object&#39;s altitude or size at the time, but it was flying above cloud level , and seemed at least 5 to 10 times bigger than any of the jet planes that happen to have been flying around since the incident occurred.  (The appearance of these jets seem odd to us also , due to the fact we are located offshore in the gulf of mexico where there isn&#39;t much commercial or military air traffic- only helicopters traveling to oil rigs).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is actually the second sighting of this kind of ob! ject.  A co-worker and I first spotted the cylinder shaped object sometime in early June.  At that time, it was moving across the sky above us at a much higher rate of speed.<n>

It was a bright sunny day with few if any clouds.  While walking I noticed a bright stationary object in the north-east sky.   The object had caught my eye because of its brightness and I stopped walking so suddenly that my friend asked what was wrong.  He then looked in the direction I was staring and noticed the same “star-like” bright yellowish object.  I had been staring because I thought it might be a jet or plane reflecting the sun.  This object was not very high in the horizon and after looking at it for a minute or so we realized it was not a jet or similar aircraft.  The object appeared about as bright as the planet Venus at night except this was in broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I could not figure out what this thing was and I thought I might be witnessing a supernova bright enough to be visible in daylight.  I even considered a Mylar or aluminum balloon but there was a significant breeze and this thing was stationary.  My friend and I continued to walk and eventually I glanced away and when I looked back the object had disappeared.  I don’t know if there were other reports on this day and time in this area but others had to see this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be stated that we saw other aircraft in the sky but they did not reflect or appear nearly as bright as this object and they were moving like normal aircraft do.<n>

7/13/11 03:00|Bozeman|MT|Unknown|2 hours|That star is acting like a foosball!  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a bright star or planet??  PD))|7/17/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82433.html|354|ndxe201107| That star is acting like a foosball!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live a ways outside of town and work nights from home.  I was getting something out of my car when I spotted it.  At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.  It looked like any other star in the sky, but was moving, all kinds of directions, slow then very quick.  So quick it would leave a light streak behind it, as though it were a falling star.  The view from my front yard is S-SW, facing Yellowstone Park, the object appeared to be far away in that direction, and very high up.  At one point a jet flew by and the object seemed nowhere near it, much higher.  It would sit still, then fall like a meteor, then all-of-the-sudden, it would break at a 90 degree angle, without slowing down at all.  It would streak across the horizon like nothing else, then come to an instant stop.  It didn&#39;t behave with any sort of purpose, it all seemed very random, like it was bouncing around and spinning off walls -like a foosball.  I watched it until the sun came up! and I could no longer see it.  My mind is now completely blown.  The light it gave off really looked like any other star in the sky, but it remained bright long after the stars had faded into the sunrise.  Not sure what else to say, it wasn&#39;t strange looking, it looked like a star or satellite.  It made no sound either, but again, it seemed too far away to hear.  It moved like nothing I have ever seen, for hours on end.  I had to tell someone, almost called the police, but what the heck are they going to do -other than harass me.  Tried your hotline as I was watching, but there was no answer.  Guess this is all I can do.  I took photos, 60 second open shutter shots, hoping it would show up.  It moved too much for the lens to collect its light.  The photos look like any other night sky shot, nothing interesting or believable in them.  I tried video too, but that was too dark, nothing showed up -lots of me going &#34;oh my god!&#34; in them though.  I tried to narrorate what I was s! eeing.  If you want the photos or video, just ask.  I&#39;m mainly curious if anyone else reported it, and what to do if it&#39;s back tonight (?).  Thanks!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a bright star or planet, we suspect.  PD))<n>
7/13/11 03:00|Olney|MD|Changing|3 hours|UFO with "tentacles" hovering in Olney, Maryland.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of celestial body??  PD))|7/17/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82438.html|355|ndxe201107| UFO with &#34;tentacles&#34; hovering in Olney, Maryland<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 3:04 AM, a friend and I noticed an extremely bright object hovering in the sky, much larger in comparison to the somewhat visible stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a very short time of observing the strange object did we notice that it was moving quite a bit in all directions at what appeared to us as a slow pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then spent the next hour and a half standing in the same spot watching as the object changed shape and lighting.  Before deciding that what I was witnessing was in fact a UFO, I decided to use the app, “Google Sky” to make sure it was not just a bright star playing tricks on my eyes.  Oddly, my phone had absolutely no service, and though I can’t be sure that this and the object are related, after restarting my phone, it appeared to act normally again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then officially established that it was no star or planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime around 4:20 AM, I finally decided to vocalize an observation that I thought was crazy: the object appeared to have tentacle-like attachments that both my friend and I had assumed earlier, were just reflections of the lighting.  These “tentacles” often came in and out of view and at times, made it look somewhat like a jellyfish in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 4:45, I finally decided to awaken my mother as well as my boyfriend who live about a mile down the road to get their opinion on the animal-like object.  After seeing the UFO for himself, my boyfriend then woke up his uncle and we all watched together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 5:00 AM, three of us watched as some type of dark flying object flew towards the UFO and, as far as we believe, connected or went inside the larger, lightened UFO.  Around the same time, we also noticed yet another flying object within a decent distance that was much smaller and  flashed lights regularly.  This object, unlike the original large one, flew the sky at what looked to me like the pace of an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 5:40, it was clear daylight and only the original bright and animal-like object was visible. It was very obviously, as well as slowly,  heading higher and higher in the sky.  The last observation I made before leaving the scene was that the clouds were out and this tentacle having object was still beneath them rather than behind them like a planet or star would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of celestial body??

At 8:03pm I saw the first one, which was much higher than all the other ones we had seen previously.  I wouldn&#39;t have been able to see it if I hadn&#39;t been looking for it, I suppose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the total period of time of about 30 minutes we were out there, we saw 3 airplanes.  One going over us, one taking off, and one coming in.  They had their lights on, etc.  We knew they were planes compared to these other &#34;floating&#34; objects.  The planes also have clearly visible wings and tail.  We really double-checked ourselves a lot, especially after seeing so many.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within the next few minutes, I saw 2 more very, very high (I&#39;m not even going to try to guess how high).  They all seemed to be cigar-shaped, but were harder to make out their exact contour because they were so high, but it was clear that it was just a floating silver line with a &#34;tarnished&#34; blackish tinge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend saw the 4th one, which took me a moment to focus in on, but was able to confirm it heading West over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after a few moments, the last one came floating by, much much lower than all the other ones of this evening and last night.  This one had a much clearer &#34;cigar shape&#34; and was silverish in color, maybe hints of darker more tarnish-y areas.  We were able to watch it glide across the sky at a steady pace for quite some time.  At one point, from my angle it almost looked like a disc that was rotating forwards right side up, like a wheel and what was most visible to us was the underside of it, making it appear to be the cigar-shape.  My girlfriend said it was not only a disc rotating, but it was also shifting from side to side, but somehow was able to keep only the &#34;cigar shape&#34; of its side visible.  I also wondered if the cigar-shape may have been a ring of light that was wrapped around an invisible cylinder that may have been floating sideways in the way a ring would fit on a finger because when the object got further away it looked to be made of light instead of silvery, but it could have also been the sun going down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are going to look out again tonight once it gets darker to see if any of them may glow or are visible in the dark at all.  And we will certainly be watching again around the same time of 8pm.<n>

I was up late studying some materials for work.  After I completed my studies I went outside my home for a few minutes to get some fresh air before going to bed.  I occasionally take a few minutes to clear my thoughts by looking at the starry night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very familiar with various aircraft and spacecraft types.  I live and work on the Space Coast where I have witnessed and participated in many launches of various vehicles.  What I saw on this night could not be explained by any type of vehicle or object I have ever seen.  It was a virtually cloudless night as I looked north and up at about a 45 degree angle, I was searching for the Big Dipper.  The Big Dipper has become a very familiar star pattern to me.  As I searched I saw a bright flash that I assumed to a reflection off a terrestrial satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 seconds passed and I saw the flash again.  This time I focused my gaze in the area of the flash.  I could see a dimly lit object moving north-north-east.  I knew that it was not an airplane due to the lack of navigation beacons.  I also realized that due to the position of the earth that it was too dark for any earthbound satellite to be reflecting the sun.  I saw another VERY bright flash about 60 seconds later again further! north and to the east of where I saw the first flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly do not know what it was that I witnessed but what I do know is that it was not anything conventionally known. It made no sound and it looked as if it was on the edge of space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Witnessed from our second story balcony.  There was a fire earlier today in  the mountains just north west of Summerlin parkway, so I initially thought it was a helicopter.  The closer it came, the more I realized this was not a helicopter.  I called my wife to the balcony as the object traveled directly over our home.  Not a sound.  It appeared spherical in shape with a very deep glowing red.  the bottom of the object has a much brighter orange light.  The object was moving pretty slowly as it passed directly above us.   I watched it continue north and seemed to climb and the light slowly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On our last night, around 9 pm before the sun fully set, I was frantically called out of my tent by some of our camping group to come witness a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO looked like a large, wide candle light flying through the sky.  It looked to be quite far away, and moving at a fast rate (for how far it appeared to be away).  It appeared to be moving from SW to NE.  It was only visible to me for about a minute before I lost it behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was unlike anything we had ever seen, some members of my camping group thought it was a plane that had caught fire, until I pointed out that there was no smoke trail, and it didnt seem to be losing altitude at all.  We have no clue really, what this could have been, I just figured it needs to be reported, so here we are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately none of us had a camera handy to record it as we were sitting around a group campfire, which is a bit of a bummer.  However, the number of witnesses, and the quality of them (HS Principal, School Board Trustee, Psychologists, among other professions), not to mention most of these people (friends of my Parents) I have known since I was born, leads credibility to this sighting.<n>

7/11/11 20:05|Memphis|TN|Cigar|20 mins and watching|We saw 6 separate objects flying different directions with and without airplanes and in different flight paths than the planes!|7/17/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82405.html|371|ndxe201107| We saw 6 separate objects flying different directions with and without airplanes and in different flight paths than the planes!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Beginning at 8:05pm, my girlfriend was out on our balcony smoking a cigarette when she called me outside.  There was an object in the sky that was moving at a steady, casual pace towards the West, but as we were watching it, began heading south.  My girlfriend informed me that she had been watching it for a minute already and saw it fly past the moon, which is to our Southeast this evening.  Watching the object, we could tell it was not an airplane because it was SO high in the sky, there was no contrail, and the object appeared to &#34;float by&#34; instead of being &#34;propelled forwards.&#34;  Plus, for it to interfere with the view of the moon this evening, it would have to be flying very high and far away because the moon is at ~65 degree angle from us.  From our balcony, we see every flight that leaves Memphis International Airport, and THIS was not an airplane.  It was silvery in color and shaped like a long string, more cylindrical than cigar-shaped, but very narrow compared to its length.  It also appeared to &#34;grow a glow,&#34; but then it subsided.  It soon flew out of distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, we stood here in awe (we are still on the balcony now) and before we knew it a plane was flying West and here comes another one of these objects almost brushing the airplane!   We knew the passengers of the flight HAD to see this happen and we watched that object fly toward the East at about the same rate as the first one we saw, except this one was clearly lower and more cigar-shaped and looked to maybe have a light on each tip, but we are not really sure.  Each end was brighter than the silvery object itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before that one could leave our view, ANOTHER one flew from the East heading West and was flying against the other one.  They passed each other at about the same distance as the airplane and the second object.  So, that&#39;s three.  We watched them until they flew so far, we couldn&#39;t see them anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then another one came and was flying Northeast at what appeared to be a slow, steady pace.  It seemed very casual, like it was in no hurry.  This one also looked cigar-shaped, same as the third one.  Same color, approximate altitude, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During all of this, we called a friend who owns a shop down the street who we asked to look outside toward the moon.  We talked to him on the phone for a minute and before we got off the phone with him, he saw an object to the South.  We couldn&#39;t see it, but stayed on the phone and it showed up.  Same type of object, cigar-shaped, silvery, although this one appeared lowest of them all, but maybe it was because it was heading our direction to a Northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were off the phone with him and decided to stay out here knowing we would probably see more.  Then there was another one.  This one was different from all the other ones.  It&#39;s hard to describe the shape because it was so far up in the sky, but almost appeared like a cigar, but like it had something else on top of it or maybe kind of an L-shape to it or something.  Most notably, though, it had a reddish hue to it, like a haze, but not really &#34;light&#34; like it was shining, but maybe because the sun was going down and it was absorbing that color is my best guess.  That was at 8:28pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We counted 6 total and it&#39;s 8:53pm now and we haven&#39;t seen anymore since that last one.  Also should be noted, we KNOW the airport had to know about that one coming so close to that airplane.  And we have not seen ONE airplane in the sky since that happened.  We are very used to the airplanes and never get tired of watching them even though they are around all the time.  I must say it is VERY unusual to go this long without seeing at least one airplane flying any direction out of the airport.  It&#39;s just unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also want to add that I am in my 20s and have never seen anything like this in my life, not to mention so many.  I have always heard about them flying in groups, but we saw each of them singly.  The only time we saw more than one at a time was when the 2 were flying opposite directions of one another and that was weird.  Why we called the friend during all of this, though, was not only to confirm what we were seeing, but about 2 weeks ago, when my girlfriend was at work at the shop down the street, the two of them had spotted one of these objects then that she said looked just like these except the one she saw was bigger and appeared out of nowhere, disappeared, then returned heading the opposite direction, was reddish colored, and cigar-shaped with the brighter ends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were so excited to see these tonight.  It must be a blessing or something!  It certainly is miraculous what we saw.  Oh, and I want to add, the friend we were speaking to on the phone, describe the clouds to look &#34;affected by electromagnetism&#34; if that means anything to anybody else.  We saw what he was describing and I would describe it as super thin clouds appearing to &#34;ripple&#34; across the sky... very huge.  I really don&#39;t think I would have noticed it had he not pointed it out, but it was very unusual, especially since the clouds were so thin and transparent.  The sun was setting so the whole sky was clear, purpley-blue and what cloud you could see was more purple and pink.  It&#39;s definitely the type of sky that suits this occasion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s 9:06 and we just saw ANOTHER one, much, much higher than ALL of the other ones.  This one was heading north.  For being as high as it was, it must have been going really fast before we couldn&#39;t see it anymore because of the trees.  And then we just saw our first airplane since all the other stuff, heading East, blinking and clearly an airplane.  Wow.  Well, I will end this here.  If I have to do another one, I will.<n>

I began checking everynight to try and find it again and i did.  And everytime id look away for a second and it would be gone.  I&#39;ve only seen this happen twice. After about the third or fourth occurrence, I looked at the southeast part of the sky and something completely different.  It was an unmoving white light, brighter than the moon. It was disk to oval shaped, kind of oblong.  The moon was out on this occasion and it was full so im not sure what i actually saw there, but it wasnt swamp gas or venus.  And once again after a few minutes the light simply went out.  More recently, it was a lot closer than usual and had a kind of hazy spotlight projecting in front of it.  The spotlight was the same color as the ufo itself, bright orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

After they passed by our viewing location their individual orange lights appeared to go out in succession.  A lone orange disk was the last in the formation and trailed the others to the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentioned to my sister at the time of viewing that no noise at all was emitted from the objects while at the exact same time a commercial jet liner was seen and heard extremely high in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A lone SUV was approaching us in the dark road where we were standing and I pointed up into the night sky.  The driver of the vehicle, who was a young man stopped and also observed these orange lights traveling in their random formations.<n>

At the time I was on the corner of Russell St, and W Academy St, (near the high school).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While on that corner I looked north west toward the city of Hornell.  That’s when I observed one silently moving yellow red light just above the tree line for about one minute before ascending slowly then fading slowly as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed, aside from its color, and movement, that it is about ¼ of an inch in diameter from my perception; far larger than any satellite I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also that it seemed to lack the look of any airplane or helicopter as it lacked the standard blinking aeronautical lights of such aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The nighttime weather at the time was pleasant, in the low seventies with little haze, or fog.  I have seen bright orange lights just after sunset from aircraft, probably from the sun reflecting of the fuselage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object however was seen long after sunset as the sky was dark blue to the west, and the object was west not east of my position, ruling out any solar reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may have been some kind of spotlight from a plane or helicopter, but as mentioned I saw nothing in the way of aeronautical lighting.<n>

At first I thought it was a star shinning in the day light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object, which was located in the north eastern section, began to move closer to my field of vision.  The object now had a sphere shape and was now glowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved to the left, while still glowing and went to a halt.  The object now began to take off into the atmosphere.  It began to look like a star once again until it eventually faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While this was happening, I had no feelings of fear but rather I felt privilege to observe something so beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that I will probably never know what I saw but it was magnificent nonetheless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was coming closer to where I could see it better, I threw a peace sign, also uttered the word peace, and waved to the object.<n>

We were about halfway done smoking when I noticed what appeared to be police light on top of the hill north of our house.  When I pointed them out, my friend said there was no way for a cop car to get there and no reason at this hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all began to study the flashing lights more and saw that there was a green light as well as the red, white, and blue flashing lights that caught my attention.  We, soon after, saw that the object wasn’t on the hill but hovering slightly above it.  We stayed to watch it and it began to move northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO seemed to be scanning the valleys north of Missoula.  A bright light periodically would sweep through the valley and as it moved farther away we could see the light beaming down from it.  Where we had originally spotted it, there seemed to be a disturbance in the air.  It was like a billowing cloud of smoke but it was translucent and had a shimmering effect to it.  When the UFO got far enough away, we could see at least one other object farther out to the north-east that appeared to be ascending and scanning the ground as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the base of the &#34;cloud&#34; we noticed three small, gentle lights: one red, one blue and one green creeping over the hill.  These lights seemed to hover above the hill and were obviously very active, moving about the hill quickly and erratically scanning in miniature like the UFO had been.  They stopped, sometimes, reconvening and resting. We did not see the figures except faintly in the light of the UFO scans.  They were brown looking in the dark and very, very tall.  The first glimpse my girlfriend caught of one it seemed to be doing flips, like a slinky would.  The figures were lanky, bony looking and gangling. It was when we noticed the figures descending the hill toward us that we went inside and tried to settle down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD))<n>

I was 1000 feet from my driveway.  There was a clearing of trees in front of a small lake across the street from my house.  I saw a round orange/ yellow light in the sky.  It looked as if it was burning.  I was driving WNW the clearing of trees and the lake was to my right which was WSW.  the object was moving in a WSW direction.  It was moving relatively slow in a straight line parallel to the Harrison.  When I first saw the object it was right over head, so I  stopped the vehicle and told my wife to look at it.  I asked, &#34; DO YOU SEE THAT TOO?&#34;  &#34; YES,&#34; she replied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled in to my drive way and got out of the car.  We both keped watching it.

But I cant say for shore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was still moving away from us.  I would say it was a mile away from us when it flickered once and then the light just went out.  During this time there was no sound of any kind, and no other aircraft in the surrounding area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would just like to say i have never in my life seen something like this.

It seemed to be above the canal that connects the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers about ½ miles south of Grand Rivers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We first thought it was a hot air balloon when it appeared over the tree-line in the distance because it seemed to glow as if lit by a flame.  But it seemed too round and move too fast to be a hot air balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 to 10 minutes, it disappeared over the tree-line on the western bank of Kentucky Lake. We found it peculiar, but did not think too much of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following night, Saturday, July 9th, at approximately 10:15 PM, we saw what appeared to be the same type of object again.  This time it was travelling from East-Southeast to West-Northwest and appeared to be almost directly over the chalets and campground on the southern side of the marina resort about 100 yards away.  We had a very good look at it this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot be sure of its size because I am unsure of its altitude.  If I were to assume it was at the same altitude as small aircraft I am accustom to seeing in the area, I would estimate it would be about 20 to 30 feet in diameter.  Of course, if it was lower it would be much smaller and it would be larger if it was higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also travelled at the same speed I would expect a small aircraft to travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be dark orange and seemed to &#34;flicker&#34; from the lower front and underneath along the sides as if lit by a large, lazy red-ish flame, but I could not actually see flames.  There were no other lights visible on the object such as navigational or search/landing lights on an airplane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not glow, radiate light or a beam of light. The night was clear and the sky filled with stars. This was not a light emitted from a river barge or other craft on the river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although it was relative! ly quiet in the area, we could not detect any discernable noise from the object.  The hot air balloon comparison most accurately describes the color and appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However,  I want to stress that I do not believe it was a normal hot air balloon, as it was close enough, I should have seen a basket, it was the wrong shape, the flickering &#34;flame&#34; that wasn’t a flame came from the front and not underneath and it was moving way too fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object for about 15 minutes as it disappeared over the tree-line to the west of the Kentucky Dam.  There were several people in and around the marina parking lot that night that and someone else should have noticed.  However, we did not discuss what we saw with anyone and returned to the chalet we rented for the weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following morning we asked as we were checking out if anyone else had reported seeing the strange object.  The ladies behind the desk were very excited at our report, but said no one had mentioned seeing anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone knows of some kind of secret high-speed hot air balloon in Kentucky, please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This will haunt my memory until I have a logical explanation of what we saw.<n>

The orbs were quiet.  I pointed to two other individuals to look at the orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I pointed at them the middle orb faded away very slow but still moving at continuous rate of speed toward north east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We dismissed the orbs as military aircraft however after further discussion it was determined that if they were military aircraft they are part of the next-gen models.  The 3 Amber orbs resembled the 3 orbs observed on March 13 1997 in Phoenix Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching footage developed in 2005 about the Phoenix Lights I was convinced that the Amber orbs of 1997 and the orbs over Lakeshore Park were definitely the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watching the show also convinced me to report.  I almost did not.<n>
7/9/11 21:40|Arcata|CA|Rectangle|1 hour|Green and red lights that flew over Arcata.|7/17/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82369.html|406|ndxe201107| Green and red lights that flew over Arcata.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Humboldt County, and I never thought I’d see a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father stepped outside to smoke a cigarette, and then he called me outside.  It was nine forty at night (21:40).  I was standing in my front yard looking north towards 27th and Alliance Street in Arcata.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I didn’t know what I was looking at.  There was this object, and it had bright green lights.  Then it turned, and I saw a red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was a plane or a Coast Guard helicopter.  This is a coastal city, and I have occasionally seen Coast Guard helicopters fly by.  However, this object was different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It couldn’t have been more than 1,000 feet away, but it made absolutely no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father and I stood completely silent and we could not hear a single engine noise.  Another indication that this was no helicopter or plane was how it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved up and down, left and right, and it even did a spiral traveling upwards.  The object moved like a fish swims.  All of the turns were very fluid and graceful, and it would stop and move up or down in a single second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, it never left a certain area of the sky.  It would dip up and down, and move left and right, but it always stayed in an area between two trees and sometimes going right behind the tree and coming back out after a couple seconds (from my point of view).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another odd thing about the object was the lights.  I have never seen a plane or a helicopter use green or red lights.  Also, these lights were very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even though it was a about a 1,000 feet away, I could still make out the rough shape of a square.  And there were two distinct shapes of green light and an orb of red light in between them.  The lights were much brighter than any stars, and as bright as the Moon.  Also I knew the elevation couldn’t have been very high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cloudy night.  That is another reason why this thing was so noticeable.  The clouds covered the stars, and the Moon.  There was no wind so the cloud did not move at all.  I don’t know how low the clouds were that night, but the object had to be a few hundred feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object also came very close to the ground.  It dipped so low near a field that I thought it had landed.  However, I climbed on my fence and I saw it was hovering maybe a few tens of feet above the ground.  Then immediately it rose up a little bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the flying object for thirty minutes, I went inside to find a telescope and a camera, while my father kept watching outside.  My camera batteries were dead, but I did find a small telescope.  I set the stand up on my car, so I could have a steady base.  The difficulty was finding it.  The object was still moving around in the same area, so I knew where to look.  I centered the telescope on it then I looked in the eyepiece to locate it.  After a couple minutes, I found it, and tried to focus the best I could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a nice quick frontal and side view of the object.  Front view:  the two green lights on the sides were actually four.  The green lights were arranged in a square or rectangle pattern and the four green spheres were at the corners.  A single red sphere or oval was in the center.  What was odd what that the red center looked like it had eyes.  There were two yellow lights in the red center that looked like eyes to me.  That was something completely new.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Side view:  the object turned and I got a good view of its side.  I saw the two green spheres on the side and they appeared as a line with the sphere at the ends of the line.  The red center had what appeared to be some kind of tail behind it.  It did not look like legs to me.  The best comparison that I can think of is the vehicles of Tron and how they are made of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I got a good look of the object, I decided to get my brother to show him.  He saw it as well and tried to look through the telescope.  Then I woke my mother up.  She was a little groggy and didn’t believe what I told her, and then she saw it.  Even though she was confused she went back to bed because she was very tired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came inside and drew what I saw to the best of my limited artistic abilities.  At that point it was ten forty (22:40).  When I went back outside, amazingly the object was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father was still watching the flying object, but was tired so he went to bed because he couldn’t do anything more than watch (for an hour).  My brother followed shortly (he had only been watching for fifteen minutes).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shortly came inside.  An hour later before I went to bed, I checked and the object was still flying in the same area as before.<n>

The object went horizontal for a period of maybe 6-7 seconds toward our location then went vertical into the sky until it disappeared.  It seemed to be as high in altitude as a jet would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object was going horizontal, it made a 90 degree turn going vertical at what seemed to be a high rate of speed into the atmosphere to the point that we could not see the object any longer. There was no sound.  The color of the object was a reddish orange single orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The events on both nights were exactly the same in time, location, appearance and movement.  The event took a matter of maybe 15 seconds each time.<n>

It was mid-day and I happened to look up and saw an object tracking along the hills.  The object was going approximately 200 miles an hour.  It was too close to the hills to be a regular airplane.  I watched it fly along the hillside for approximately 20 seconds and then it went behind some trees and I lost it.  It seemed like it tracked around the end of the hillside since it didn&#39;t come out from behind the trees.  The object was flat and no longer than 20 feet.  The height was maybe 8 feet at most. The distance from myself was about 1.5 miles away.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately thought it was a UFO, but after considering the terrain and circumstances I wondered if it was a Military Drone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 44 year old female of sound body and mind and was not under the influence of any substances when I saw this object.<n>

I looked up to the left and saw about 12 silvery-white objects dancing around in the sky.  The object were about 400-500 feet off the ground and danced up and down about another 200 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, my kids and I thought they were seagulls, but they were too large and too far off in the distance to be any type of bird; plus I saw no wings flapping or gliding.  It was almost like a dozen automobile sized mylar balloons in a tornado 500 hundred feet above the ground but dancing fast almost like play fighting, like dogfighting jets, instead of being flown around like debris.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other objects, debris or dirt in the air.  The radical, fast movements and small cluster made me think it was not a regular aircraft.  The cluster moved out of my sight when I crossed into Reno and due to my kids safety I had to focus on the road.<n>

Basically a bright sunny summer morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was fairly obvious to notice in the sky because the sun created a shadow underneath the object giving it shape as I was looking up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I initially thought it to be a high flying bird or hawk approximately 250-300ft above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then I noticed that it had a consistant course of direction and was headed my way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It grew larger as it approached (object was heading due west at approximately 30-40mph).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached, it grew in size and became clear to me that this was not a bird or a normal/everyday aircraft as I heard no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living within a few miles of the approach path for the largest airport near our city, and an avid military aircraft buff, I knew this was nothing I had ever seen before nor could I identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second impression was that a balloon was let go and drifting, but this object continued to maintain a westward course against a south/southeasterly wind at 10-15 mph and did not change altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I started to mention this to my mother (while on the cell phone and the object now close to overhead and probably just two to three blocks north of my house) we lost cell reception, and our call was dropped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always had excellent if not perfect cell reception the 7 years i have lived in my town.  This was not normal cell reception as the closest cell tower is only a half mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a very soft triangular shape (roughly the size of a compact car such as a mazda miata or something) and looked disk shpae from the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So picture a very soft triangle from underneath the object, but was convex or disk shaped on the roof of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a slow rotation to it the entire time, it maintained level flight, never made a sound, and did not roll or pitch in a fashion that a tirangular shaped ballon might tumble while moving along with the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was silvery gray with some shimmer that the sun provided which informed me of the rotation it had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I thought, as weird as this was, I would try to snap some pics with my cell phone camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly took two pictures and I continued to watch the object continue it&#39;s course until it was completly out of my sight (heading due west).<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I started in the back yard, facing east, and walked to the front yard, facing west, and watched it until my polarized sunglasses (which helped see the object for a much further distance) were of no use and the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then was curious to see what my photos had produced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was nothing in the sky that I could see on my pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had some of the neighboring house tops in as references to possibly size and distance the object, but nothing of the object was visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was then a little un-nerved about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A photo expert may be able to find something or I may have not gotten the object into view while taking them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly cannot say, but I did make an honest effort to capture the object on two pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Either way I was extremely disappointed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel fortunate to have seen something that I could not identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The beam was aimed towards the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same instant that I saw the blue beam I saw another similar small round white object that was located slightly to the south of the first object take off at a high rate of speed to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object that shot the blue beam continued on its original path to the south and did not change its original speed.

They are triangular in shape and usually twirl and like lurk around my house for some unknown reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My house is near an airport and for some reason they go out when planes go by.  I like to sit out and watch them.  I am an &#34;observer&#34; of their behaviour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know you can find me by my code on my computer and I am not afraid I have nothing to hide.<n>

Three bright orange orbs ascending at 45 degree angle, heading southeast.   Flying at plane speed, but no blinking lights. Too fast for a candle balloon.  First orb ascended from area of Mt. Kearsage in New Hampshire.  Several minutes later the second orb departed from further north.  Several minutes later the third orb departed further north still. All were visable until they reached a cloud bank.  Each visible for about 30-45 seconds.   Mt. Washington weather observatory was contacted and they had no observation of phenomenon.<n>

This all seemed very strange, so I looked at the picture closer in a Photoshop program where I was able to enlarge and clarify the picture.  What I found were several objects, most notably a very distinct large alien looking face just to the right of the moon.  I also noticed what looked like a train of cylinder ships flying about the upper right crest of the forehead of the face, forming a semi circle in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know a little about hologram projections and I know that in order to create a projected image, one needs an atmosphere with most likely water particles, and a multi angular projection technique, which indicates that the cylinder ships in the photograph could have been projecting the image of this face into the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can also see a Burr tree shaped craft, a Saturn shaped craft, (my camera, sadly, is not suited to astronomical photography) I will of course send the pictures, clean, and enlarged for detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to note that I did not see aircraft chasing the objects in the picture, but that night there were several silent aircraft criss crossing the sky with lights, what seemed to me to be military planes, as the local airport is closed at night, it is not a twenty four hour airport, and Macdill AFB is about a hundred miles or so to the north.<n>

Next thing we know we are in bed, we remember NOTHING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No memory, nothing.  Not even sure how we made it inside the house, everything was still on, stereo, TV, lights and the door was unlocked, which is not something we do.  I woke at 2:45 am totally confused, feeling all &#34;warped&#34; and the fear, fear very strong, but wasn&#39;t sure why.I was naked,  I do not sleep naked, EVER. This was not the &#34;norm&#34; for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I woke, I had the most intense pain in my neck, shooting through my upper back and up through my head.  I reached around with my left hand to hold my neck and there is a &#34;bubble&#34; of sorts and it was very painful to touch.  I could not lay there as it hurt so bad, so I sat up, and became so nauseous, dizzy and still confused.  I got up, holding my head, as the pain was incredible.  Got my bearings and walked to the bathroom which is just out the master bedroom door, and I looked in the mirror, and saw not me, but a warped me, as in, I could see me, but I didn&#39;t recognize the person staring back at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suddenly was overcome with even more dizziness and nausea,  I turned, and vomited like crazy for the next cpl hours.  My husband WOULD NOT wake up. I finally crawled back in bed 5 am after I went downstairs and locked the house, turned off the lights and was still very confused as to what happened.  My husband woke at 5 am, to feel the same way, only not vomiting, but very confused too, and not sure how or when we went to bed the night before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He is still VERY unsure what happened!   the whole next week I was terrified. beyond fearful.  I could not even go upstairs by myself to use restroom, take a shower alone in the house, NOTHING, I was so afraid.  We saw nothing, there is a void and it is eerie.  There is a feeling of being watched constantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thursday July 7th, again, I was sitting alone in living room, watching TV, and I was overcome by fear, I felt something was watching me again, I got very scared, (not like me at all) I sat there a few minutes only to hear a strange noise, not something I could identify, but I felt it from the upstairs, and I ran out of my house and to my neighbors house, I was scared again.  My husband was at work, I texted him to tell him I had a melt down and needed him.  He came home about 20 minutes later.  We sat and talked a bit, I calmed down, sorta.  Then we proceeded to bed to sleep. @ 11:30 pm.  I tossed and turned a bit, was very restless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started at 0:30 am for me.  I was awake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was lying in bed with husband, and I could feel fear, beyond fear, it was incredible to feel this way, though not a good way, but none the less, intense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> husband rolled over onto his left side to go to sleep, I curled up behind him, and suddenly I could see these lights, little tiny lights, lines, shapes, all different colors, my heart began to race, and in my mind I could see flashes of &#34;monsters&#34; ugly ones, real strange looking.  I prayed so hard, I was so terrified, and yet I could only pray, husband was no longer awake and wasn&#39;t going to wake, I KNEW that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hubby wouldn&#39;t wake up at all,  I was alone in this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt a &#34;weird&#34; hand on my upper back, it rolled me over, I saw &#34;them&#34;.  Three of them, two of them were a little smaller, with bits of stringy hair, they were at the foot of my bed, and one was taller, on the right side of me, and felt very &#34;powerful&#34; no hair, but the eyes, dark, ugly and very hypnotic.  My right hand was &#34;forced&#34; for better words down to my &#34;privates&#34; and my left hand was &#34;forced&#34; onto my chest.  I felt an odd heat coming over my body, and then I was &#34;forced&#34; to roll onto my left side, my knees were forced to my chest and my hands now forced across my abdomen.  I felt a sensation like never before.  My stomach was moving, literally. like a rolling sensation. I felt a heat between my legs, it was very warm and it was a rod like thing going inside me, a warm liquid came out of it, I could feel it.  Then I was rolled back over onto my back, and the big &#34;being&#34; had in it&#39;s hands a small &#34;baby like&#34; being, I heard an incredible high pitched noise in my head.  Next ! thing I know I am waking at 5 am, I have an overwhelming sadness, tears coming out of my eyes, I KNOW, I just know I was &#34;visited&#34;.  A knowing/feeling/sensation that won&#39;t leave me.  BUT I am once again at peace, not afraid and no longer nervous, paranoid or anything, I am great actually.  Strange, I do not feel afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, my nose, is sore,  It is still painful just to touch the right side of it, NOT sure why, but will be going to a doc to find out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just and FYI, I have reported several eyewitness accounts to UFO sightings on your website, there were also witnesses, and I have called before due to another case involving my younger son,  I needed help, and was turned away. I want to KNOW what happened, and WHY!<n> <n><n> <n><n> thank you.<n>

This occurred in front of my house upon returning from my boyfriend&#39;s house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, I believed that it was an aircraft but upon further observation the object was bright and orange/red in color which had the appearance of fire that pulsated; the object did not leave a trail or change color.  I observed the object for approximately 2 minutes.  At first, the object was &#34;cruising&#34; along until I began to film it.  At that point, the object slowed but kept traveling West.  Eventually, the object slowed to a stop, began to ascend into the sky and finally faded from view.<n>

It was approximately 10:20.  My fiancé was parking the car in the garage.  I had gotten out of the car in the driveway before he pulled into the garage, as it is a tight fit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As he was parking the car, I saw from the southwest direction, something flying in sky with red lights.  Whatever it was was flying at the same constant speed like a plane would and was smoothly flying like a plane would.  It was flying low.  At first, I thought it was something like how a small plane would fly with advertisement attached to it, but at night.  However, when it was approaching nearer and then overhead, it was a circle of red lights with no advertisement.  I could not make out a shape or form as it was at night, but could make out a circle of red lights.  My fiancé then came out onto the driveway after parking the car.  We stood and watched the lights wondering what we were seeing. We watched these lights for probably a couple of minutes.  There was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights didn’t change color as far as I could tell.  The lights looked constant to me.  They looked like a blur of red lights…like the glare you would have after coming home from the eye doctor after dark and after having your eyes dilated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights moved steady at a normal plane speed for awhile going into the northeast direction.  Before it got past the trees where we could no longer see it, it seemed to hover for a while before moving on again and out of our site beyond the trees that obstructed the rest of our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have no clue what we saw.<n>

I looked up, but in a different direction and only seen an airplane.  Then she proceeded to tell me, no mom, look this way!  I turned and never have I seen an object like this before.  It was orange and compared to the other airplanes in the sky it would have been 10 times bigger than an average airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I thought it may be a weather balloon like always assumed, but when it went up and down and backwards then out of sight I was in shock!   Never in my life have I seen something like this.  And we live in the city, where I thought nothing happens here.  Boy was I wrong!   That’s what we have seen and I hope that if anyone in my area has seen the same sighting please let me know!   Thank you!<n>

It was hard to judge their distance, but they must&#39;ve been at least a mile from my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were curiously bright- not blinding, but well defined and certainly not planes or helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped briefly to observe them, and two of my neighbors, who had just pulled in, joined me.  We speculated about what they might be, and as it&#39;s July 6th, I posited that they might&#39;ve been a sort of firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbors rejected this immediately, and admittedly I&#39;m not familiar with with any fireworks that behave as these lights did.  As I said though, the lights were already in the sky when I noticed them, so I can&#39;t speak to their ascent, but once in the sky they did move upwards, downwards, left, and right (slowly) despite it being a still night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing the lights for a minute or two, I continued into the la! undry room, and when I returned they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did have my phone on me at the time, but I&#39;m sure the lights weren&#39;t significant enough to register on the phone&#39;s shoddy camera. Describing them plainly as two orange balls of light is perfectly accurate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bit of background on myself...  I was, and still am, skeptical about the existence of sentient alien life.  I think these lights could reasonably be dismissed as fireworks, although I can&#39;t explain their duration or behavior.  It looked like something straight out of a bad UFO TV special, and could&#39;ve easily been some sort of light attached to a balloon, but it&#39;s testament to the sighting that they were impressive enough for me to bother googling this website and submitting a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not, however, interested in following up on this sighting or volunteering any personal information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

One object was following the other (right behind).  Observed until the light became so faint that it dissapeared from sight.  Seemed to be moving straight out of the earth&#39;s atmosphere (not following the curve as typically seen in airplanes).  It was still light outside when the observation was made.  The observation was made beside a lake, which enabled good visibility over a long distance.

I was driving down W Burnside Rd, in the west hills facing NE going around what I believe is Washington park.   As I was going around a curve there was a very tall tree in front of me, on the hill that the curve goes around, I saw a very large object going behind the tree.   It was directly in front of me.  I believe the reason it cough my eye was because it was so so so shiny it looked to me as if a piece of tin foul with the most bright light shining off of it.  The shine was most bright in the middle of the object and faded as it got closer to the sides of the object where you could see medal it looked like tin foil.  This object was about 6 or 7 times the size of when you look at the sun.  It was only maybe 500 or so feet directly in front of me. It took up about 2 or 3 of the limbs on the tree.  There was not a cloud in the sky.  I do not remember the shape but I know it was a solid shape like a circ! le or octagon or some kind of shape like that. There was nothing hanging off the object like wings of propellers.  This whole time I was on the phone with a friend (she is planning on making a report of what happened on her side of the line.) But I thought I had only seen it for a glimpse of a sec.  But my friend told me I stopped talking for over a min.  When I came to the other side of the curve there was a few trees but the object was no longer there.  I think the weirdest part is that there was NO noise at all. I do remember as soon as I saw the object I was so infatuated with it.  It happened so fast but just remember being amazed not even thinking about if it was a plane or not but just wanting to see it.  I don’t remember any of the time from seeing the object until my friend had been yelling in my ear Hello?<n>

Hovered over the tree line as well as flew over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve contacted this agency once before, but must have done it wrong, as no one responded.  This time I have a much closer thing to describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 11:45 p.m., on July 5th, 2011, (33 minutes from the time I’m writing this), I looked in my usual place in the sky from the back of my house to see if there were any bouncing lights (as there are nearly every night in the past 2 years since moving here).  This time, in the same general area of the sky, something caught my eye.  While usually, I see bluish/whitish lights, this time I saw a very vivid red light flashing, then turning white, then back to red.  It was moving side to side, then up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, this thing moved overhead so I was looking at the underneath part as it flew over.  I saw 3 red lights on three triangular shapes, connected to whatever the main part of the body was.  It flew over and went from the southwest sky toward the eastern sky.  It went over about 2 large fields’ length, then I w! atched it bounce a bit again, before it faded and began to look like one of the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when I texted my sister next door to get over to my front porch (where I went after I couldn’t see it from the back anymore).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited two minutes, just watching the sky for anything out of the ordinary, when suddenly we looked in the same direction the thing had disappeared into, and just a couple of fields over, there was an amazingly bright light hovering in the tree line; the light stayed red a few seconds then switched to white, then back to red, it glowed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I watched, not taking our eyes off of this thing. It looked like it was staying in a small patterned area, because it hovered, then moved slightly to another nearby location, then moved again to another nearby location.  It was almost as if it was searching for something.  We watched it another couple of minutes, then the bright red light faded out, just like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I immediately heard clicking no! ises; first from the field area, then closer to my house (all the while we were still on the front porch).  That was enough to make us want to come back in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve been watching certain &#34;orbs&#34; of light actively move in the same area of the sky night after night (for the past many months), and always watch them sway side to side some, then move fluidly up and down; sometimes going from one area to another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would really love for someone to contact me about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

Detailed Story&#39;s Of A Desert Boy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve Reported here before  I never followed up because I was scared.  I think its finally time to talk...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my back yard, and my dog was barking like crazy, i was trying to get her to be quiet, she kept running back and fourth in the yard, jumping up the fence, like as if chasing a cat... she was barking and she sat in the middle of the yard. and i finally got up one last time to bring her inside, but as soon as i got next to her she stopped barking. it was so silent. at night, you can see the stars... for the most part... there wasn&#39;t any. it was pitch black. i mean, NOTHING. it, the stars i mean, were in the shape of a ellipse, but i don&#39;t know for sure. my phone broke, like, literally. broke. the battery was dripping. i don&#39;t know what happened next. i woke up in my room and i haven&#39;t talked to anyone except for one person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second encounter i had, which I&#39;ve sent before, was in my living room. in the morning. the sun was barely rising. it was around 4 or 5, summer. and i looked out the window. and. there it was. clear as day. a being. Its face was like a bony mans, very skinny, sucked in to the bone.  it had no eyes. no nose. it had holes on the sides of its head, which, i thought were like a reptiles ears. but this was pale, flesh. it looked human. but it had the slightest green in it. blue in some spots. it was tall, but hunched over, it had four arms, and very small legs. it had a very large spine, like, it was long, and it was very prominent, very easy to see through its flesh. it had something else, where our ribs would be.  It looked like gills, they were bright pink. no tail.  I dropped my glass of milk and he/it turned to look at me.  It stared. for what felt like hours...  I know exactly what it looks like.  I could almost feel the creature through the glass.  I blacked out.  I woke up lat! er around 12.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And lastly. the reason why I reported this entire three story&#39;s.  was because i was in page with a friend, hes Navajo , and he took  me to meet his family on the reservation. that first night, we went out at about 12, we got up, on top of this huge sandstone ridge, and he said that his father told him never to leave at night, blah blah blah right? i&#39;m a boy, i&#39;m 14. i didn&#39;t listen. mind you i&#39;m a very intelligent 14 year old boy. I should have listened.  There was a bright light.  illuminated the valley. it was a bright as day, it grew brighter and brighter. and then it kind of coned into a small area, like a stage light.  but really bright, we could feel the heat, and it was very cold. anyway, the cone of light grew so small you could barely see it, yet it grew hotter and hotter. it was like a laser. technically, by definition a light is a laser. but whatever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BACK TO THE STORY.  A loud buzzing sound started, it was a low hum, then a loud ring. then. complete silence but it was! bright, the light sketched across the sand like lighting or a crack in the ice. we ran faster then I&#39;ve ran before. *living in the ghettos of Arizona, especially being white, you have a lot of things to run from*   We decided to walk back to the sands after last night, and we walked out there, and it was over cast, raining.... but the rain was caught and wouldn&#39;t sink more then a few feet inches. we dug in. for a radius of thirty feet, there was glass.  It looked like a spider web on the top, with a plate under it. we dug it up and, it looked random to me, but who knows, the father said to leave it and its gods work, its not for the media, so we buried it. Shortly after the mans cattle and sheep started to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I NEED a follow up please, i really want this to be at least seen by someone. I almost feel like the one person i told doesn&#39;t believe me…<n>

On June 5Th 2011 at 23:00 hours we witnessed activity over the ocean from our beach front 3rd story condo. My father in law brought it to my attention, how these lights would get into formation of a triangle and disappear. This went on for 30 mins. They would go away and show up seconds later miles apart from were we saw them. I saw a burning red color and as it streaked away it left a red trail behind it. That prompted me to get my video camera.  After about 15 mins of waiting the objects appeared again this time right in front of our condo. I got at least 20 secs of the oval shaped craft with lights fixed around it. I zoomed in for a better view and they vanished as quick as they came.  After watching the video i discovered another craft spinning on a slant heading right into the ocean.  After that the other one took off upwards.. The lights were luminous and strange.  Not like lights I have ever seen!  The video is with a dark background being over the ocean at night.  Nothing much to compare size to.  However the crafts are Highly visible on camera.  With some detail<n>

It started to sprinkle a few drops so I looked up to see what the clouds looked like.  When I looked up I saw three white strobing lights heading East to West.  They were in a perfect triangle with what would appear to be the flat side facing forward in the direction of flight.  I am assuming that the three lights were on an object, I could not make out any structure between the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was passing in and out of the bottom of the clouds, although it never became fully obscured.  The MDW TAF says that there is a broken cloud layer at 5000 and a scattered layer at 12000, although the sighting was two hours previous to me checking the TAF.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I thought was odd was that the craft didn&#39;t have any beacons or navigation lights.  All I could see was the three simultaneously strobing white lights. There were other aircraft in the sky, there were two helicopters circling almost constantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For background I am a professional aircraft mechanic and have worked at O&#39;Hare for the past 22 years. I am very familiar with aircraft and their lighting patterns.  This is unlike anything I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no way to tell if it made any sound.  The concert was very loud.<n>

There was high clouds and they were in the formation below the clouds. We were looking north east over royalton township.  The craft stayed in the formation and were all the exact same distance apart, like the dots on a dice.  My best guess is they would have been near the St. Joseph river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the craft in the bottom right moved over directly under the center craft but keeping the same distance.  Now they formed a Y shape and accented up into the sky.  Because of the clouds we lost sight not long after they went into the clouds.  While they accented up into the sky they kept the Y formation and always stayed the same distance apart.  This all took place over a period of time between one or two minuets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after this happened there was a helicopter that seemed to spend a lot of time flying around the area. Almost as if in a search pattern.  There was also a large number of other aircraft in the sky like commercial jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one hour later we seen a large flash of light to the East, like lightning but there was no storms in the area. Im not sure if the flash of light was related to the UFOs.<n>

Ironically enough my friend was telling us about her alleged &#34;UFO&#34; sighting two days prior (the 3rd of july 2011) when she was coming into fillmore from moorpark.  She told us that she saw this rectangular shaped object it was really bright and she saw it dim a little and out of nowhere it shot straight up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had told her to report it on some ufo report site to see if anyone else might have seen it.  The funny thing was that one of her guy friends had posted on facebook that he witnessed something similar to her story (the 4th of july, a day after her sighting).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming home from work, we pass a little town called piru (about 5 minutes away from fillmore) anyways, about 2 minutes away from piru on top of a mountain, my friend points out and yells, &#34;That’s it right there!&#34;   We saw a short glimpse of  what appears to be a rectangular shaped object but it looked as if there was a tall bright antenna  on top of it..  Everything was lit up, it almost reminded me of a long rectangular circus hut because from the antenna, it looked 2 be lights connecting to the ends of the craft to the sides or the top of the antenna.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another unique thing about it was it looked almost if there where windows!  Some lit and some not.. like one yes next no, one yes, next no. the lights on the antanna and the ones connecting looked almost like small round lights (like x-mas lights u hang on your house) but inside the window looking things it was illuminating from the inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lost sight of it because the mountain covered it because of our drivi! ng straight.  I told her to turn back but she didn’t want to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance from us to the object was about 300 - 400 yards away (idk if im calculating it right because of the height, but it was a little mountain) but the mountain from the road we were driving on was about 100 yards.  It looked like a long version of a huge house (one story house).  And when we couldn’t see it, we can still see a glow behind the mountain that was covering it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a little we didn’t belive her, but she swore it was the same thing she had seen 2 days prior.. we were all shooken up<n>

During the week of July 4th, my daughter and her family were visiting.  I was pushing my two year old grandson in his stroller in my driveway.  As I rounded my house, I noticed two shiny spheres, slightly larger than a basketball and approximatley 18 inches apart, near the top of the trees in my neighbor&#39;s back yard (40-50 feet high).  Very soon after I noticed the stationary objects, the two spheres moved horizontally over my neighbor&#39;s house very rapidly, maintaining their distance apart, toward the lake and were quickly out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I thought I was imagining something and would have discounted the whole event except my grandson pointed to where the spheres were first seen and said, &#34;Balloons!&#34;  I told my family what I had seen and have subsequently also told the story to friends.  I frequently look at the area where I saw the spheres and cannot get the event out of my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I then started to take video but I was having trouble seeing the sphere on the I-pod so I pointed the I-pod to were it was the last time I saw it and started to record.  We saw the black sphere for about seven to nine minutes it moved sideways, up, down, and would also stay in place for a minute and take off.  After it disappeared we heard in the back round military jets going to were the black sphere were. I came inside my house and started to see the pictures and the videos put the screen was to small to see anything so I downloaded it to my computer and started to darken the color of the pictures to see it better and I started to see white spheres on the pictures so I started to see the videos that I took and the same thing the white spheres were there too.  Then I converted the three minute video to one hour and twenty minutes and also adjusted the lighting and when I played it back it shocked me and scared me because the white spheres where going in and out of the clouds and some even left a trail when they came out from the clouds.    they are different sizes and they are more than thirty or forty spheres and they move so fast and if you go frame by frame you can see them going in and out and some stop and you can see that they are white round spheres.  I was in shock how many they are and how fast they move and also how they used the cloud to hide and to me they manipulated the clouds shape so they could move to another place.  si! nce that day I feel confused and also have a hard time concent! rating o r focusing on things I feel lost and the more I see the videos the more start to wonder why so many of them? and what were they doing or looking for?   I wish I could talk to some one about it but I&#39;m scared I don&#39;t want to talk to just anyone.  If you would be interested on the videos I have it on my computer and still have the originals on the I-pod and if you would like to get a hold of me write me an E-mail and give me a number were I can call, because I really want to talk to some one who has experience on this type of sightings.<n>

I saw no exhaust being emitted from the object, as we approached, it flew off in a southerly direction into the clouds, it seemed to be sharply turning in a South-Easterly direction at a high speed.  I know little about aircraft although even in the distance it seemed to be travelling very fast.  This was when we were flying across the North Sea towards what must have been the Northern areas of the Netherlands.<n>

People have been lighting off illegal firworks and we were watching the show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were looking up, I saw a large triangle craft moving slowly to the south-west towords the airport.  I was standing facing the same direction, when my son spoted another set of lights that looked like bright orbs.  There was 3 of them and moving south-east of our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The large triangeled changed colors form white to red to blue then back to white, then started to fly way faster than anything else that was in the shy that night and was out of sight in about 4 seconds.  The orbs also changed color.  Red,white and then back to red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see other airplanes flying into the Fresno airport and taking off, but nothing could fly without making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited to see if the Air National Guard would send jets to the area of these objects, but nothing. We have seen other unexplained lights over the greater Fresno/Clovis area for the last couple of months, but nothing like this.  The orbs stayed on the same course, but came together as one light and disapeared straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were at least 3 helicopters and multiple airplanes that night, but nothing moved or looked like those lights we saw that night.<n>

I proceeded to sit down on my porch to relax for a minute when i noticed a bright cicular object moving slowly across the skyline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object when I first noticed it was to my east, moving to the South with maybe just a slight Westward inclination.   After watching it for maybe a minute or so, it dawned on me that I should grab my binoculars to see exactly what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house grabbed my hunting case and the binoculars were not there.  I searched around the house for probably another minute or so and then gave up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back outside and the object was still there but further away to the south.  I watched it for possibley another minute or two and then it blinked on and off about 3 maybe 4 times then just simply disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a moment i went in the house still trying to find my binoculars.  After a short search to no avail, I stepped back on my porch and there was another object exactly like the first one traveling the exact same path as the first.  I watched it for probably 3 minutes or so and then it dissapeared too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both objects seemed to follow static lines across the sky, neither going up or down. I would describe them as round perhaps 4 to 5x as bright as the brightest star, red in color with perhaps a shade of gold or oranges tint toward the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure which direction the wind was from that night but it was negligable. My first thought was that they were some kind of Firework, but to my knowledge nothing is going to stay in the air for that long and move in such an exact manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date above has been corrected.

7/4/11 23:45|San Pedro|CA|Triangle|20 minutes|Golden Fire Pyramids over San Pedro and Palos Verdes, CA - 4 July 2011|6/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89668.html|476|ndxe201107| Golden Fire Pyramids over San Pedro and Palos Verdes, CA - 4 July 2011<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two large unknown objects ascended through the night sky off the coast of Palos Verdes, California around 23:45 on 4 July 2011. Our party of four had just finished watching the fireworks display in the southeast night sky over Long Beach, Ca from our backyard patio. A few minutes had passed when our attention was diverted to the southwest portion of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given that it was the Fourth of July, we merely thought it to be a floating lantern, or possibly a large flare someone shot up off the coast. It appeared to be rising from somewhere between the southwest tip of the Palos Verdes Peninsula and Catalina Island and we were able to calculate that it was rising over White’s Point, San Pedro - on the Pacific Coast (roughly lat:33°42&#39;42.78&amp;quot;N, lon:118°19&#39;7.09&amp;quot;W). Expecting it to explode like the fireworks cascading the night sky did throughout the day and night, we watched it intently with anticipation.  We believied it to be one final spectacular display since the major firework shows in the area had ended within the last hour. Yet,this object was moving at a steady pace - not as though it had been shot out of a cannon, and grew larger in size as it came into view. When said object did not explode and rather, ascended higher into the night sky -we realized that this was not a fireworks display. We also realized that this a! rea of the coast does not have a fireworks show. From our vantage in our backyard in San Pedro, the Palos Verdes Hill blocks any view of the firework displays in Redondo Beach and north through Manhattan Beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first noticed the object it appeared as a perfect triangle. We referred to it as a “Golden Pyramid.” Its coloration was a mixture of gold, orange, red, yellow and appeared to be pulsating within itself - as if it were on fire. Said object rose into the night sky to a point where it was clearly too high for visibility. It ascended in a straight line for about 6 minutes, made an arc north for about 4 minutes, then continued to raise straight up into the night sky where it became a small pinprick of a light. It then appeared to shoot straight up into the sky and disappeared.  The reason we knew it not to be a firework was because the glowing and pulsating was contained within the shape of the triangle - there were no trails of sparks of flame leaving the triangle. For example, when one views images of the sun from space, it has flares shooting out from it’s surface. This object had the same appearance, but all was contained within the shape of the triangle. It also neve! r fell in altitude. If it were a balloon, flare, or firework - they would all pop and descend in an obvious manner. This object did not. Weather balloons also do not glow in the manner we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four of us were flabbergasted and kept asking each other what we saw. Only a few minutes had passed when yet another object emerged in the same spot in the sky as  the previous object. It was larger than the first, but matched coloration and appearance. What solidified that the first object was not anything we have ever seen before, the second object followed the same exact course over the same exact amount of time, rising into the night sky until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We attempted to film the object on our cell phones, but a combination of light pollution from the street light over our backyard and low resolution on our camera phones made it impossible. A few minutes after the second craft had disappeared into the black of night, a night flying Cessna airplane flew over roughly the same area the first UFO appeared.  We determined this was the altitude private planes must fly and that the first “Golden Pyramid”  appeared much higher in the sky.  A flare was shot off in the southeast corner of our visibility - toward Long Beach - and we concluded this object was nothing close to a flare.  These were two solid reference points for us to analyze what the situation was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of the crafts appeared, and rose into space.  Plain and simple. Maybe they were watching the fireworks as well!  There is no firework that could follow such behavior patterns, and there has not been any man made craft that the public has knowledge of that would accomplish such feats.  We researched rocket and missile launches in the area, and we came up empty handed for that date.  All we know is that we all saw the same thing and hope to find someone else who witnessed the same thing.  I write this review so late because I barely found this site today, but feel the need to share what the four of us saw in the night sky that evening.  There is not a single day that goes by where I forget about this experience and my life has completely changed since then.<n>

It was about 5x the size of a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several seconds afterwards, a second sphere appeared, identical to the first.  Both continued to float slowly and steadily upwards, occasionally flickering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, the first one faded out, and we left before seeing the last one leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The wind was Westerly, and we looking in the Northwest direction.<n>

It looked as if it were wheels of plasma within wheels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two silent craft flew slowly forward then took off in the north direction and disapeared behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 craft seemed to have a mind of there own.  One craft was red and one was orange.  One of the observers was a lawyer, one had no job and two were only children.<n>

It slowed down and stopped for a moment, it then turned around and shot away as if it went into a tube or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told her to look and she did and seen it with me.  But it seemed to scare her and she denied seeing anything and won&#39;t talk about it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was softball sized and reddish orange and seemed to have an orange bump on the bottom and top.  IT WAS NOT ANY KIND OF FIREWORKS!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wrote to you before about my first sighting. I did&#39;nt dream I&#39;d see another one!  I wasn&#39;t going to report it, but something told me to check anyway.  Now I&#39;m glad I did!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing just made a U-turn and went from softball sized, to a dot, and then to nothing, within a half second!   From start to finish, it lasted about 5 minutes<n>

They drifted up one after another until there were about twenty total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were drifting with the wind in a westernly direction and were definitely sky lanterns.  I was close enough to see what they were and recognized them immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were quite a few other people in the area who saw them and many were wondering what they were so it would not surprise me if any UFO reports were to come in from this area regarding this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lanterns were orange-yellow in color and created several formations, including triangles, as they sailed through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event lasted approximately 30 minutes before they all flickered out one by one and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m only reporting this because I saw that NUFORC was asking for reports of intentional releases of pyrotechnical devices. I hope this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We note that 30 minutes is a very long time for a pyrotechnic device to burn.  We would like to see video of the alleged event.  PD))<n>
7/4/11 23:00|Arcata|CA|Triangle|5 min|Red, green, and white lights hovering, jumping, and zig-zagging above  Arcata, CA 7/4/2011|7/6/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82225.html|487|ndxe201107| red, green, and white lights hovering, jumping, and zig-zagging above  Arcata, CA 7/4/2011<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 4th, 2011 my fiancee and i were driving eastbound on Samoa Blvd. in Humboldt County from Eureka to Arcata in Northern California. We noticed a standing light above the town of Arcata.  The lights were still when we first saw them, and then started to move together in unison, as though all on one object.  My fiancee pulled over and we got out of the vehicle and grabbed the camera, which was almost dead because we had just taken pictures at the fireworks show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked as though it was directly above the Arcata plaza and Humboldt crabs baseball field, where a live event just finished 30min prior.  It was approximatly 1,000ft high and at times dipping as low as 700-800 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked as though it was big, about the size of a small house. There were red, green and white lights and seemed to be in a somewhat triangular position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were looking North when we got out of the vehicle.  The object would make sudden and swift changes and would also hover during the 5 min period in which we watched this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took pictures of it, one zoomed out so you can see where its located, and a couple zoomed in so you can see the colors and shape.  We then tried to record it because of all the movements it was doing, and thats when our camera died.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sudden changes in direction while in flight were unexplainable.  The object would quiver in the sky and almost dance, making &#34;s&#34; and &#34;z&#34; movements, moving faster than anything we have ever witnessed.  It would jump up and down so quickly it was hard to focus your eyes on it, and then it would stop.  It would then hover and slowly rotate 360*, sometimes while moving across the span of the entire city of Arcata.  It started to move closer to us so we decided to get back in the vehicle, because we both got nervous and felt unsure about what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove North on Hwy101 we saw it above Arcata, and actually ended up passing it, the entire time us keeping a close eye on what it was doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the lights would just turn off, then flash on placing the object close to where it was but in a different position in the sky.  It did that about 5-10 times then stopped and hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled off the Hwy at this point scared and wanted to see if there was anything else it was going to do, we pulled into a gas station and as we did so, the lights/object started towards the South side of town making it hard to see from our location.  We spotted it down on the horizon, slowly moving behind a house that was in the way.  We got gas and as fast as we could do that, it was gone.  We pulled out and continued to look for it for approx. 15 min.<n>

When I returned outside it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I went to go back inside another glowing orange-red object appeared and moved in the same direction and with the same speed.  It just appeared and moved at a 45 degree angle traveling south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not pulsate or blink. Just a continuous glow and just faded from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through my binoculars, it appeared to have a halo attached to it, but I cannot be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it faded, I could almost see a dark object continue to move for a moment.<n>

I went with him outside and we watched 4 things in the sky above.  They were moving very slowly in a formation.  One in front, two on the outside and one in back.  They were yellow/orange color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside to get our camera and my husband hollered - three disappeared just like that and as I got outside the last one was almost gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wish we had a cell phone w/camera but we don&#39;t.  My husband is retired/disabled and I work full time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have never seen anything like this before.

They were spread out in a diamond shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled off the road to watch. They moved very slowly, couldn&#39;t tell if there was any sound.  I was near a highway, but it was nothing i have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So for about three minutes i watched, snapped a very grainy photo. Three of the lights are visible in the photo, the fourth was behind a hwy sign.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the photo was taken a passanger plane was heading towards the four lights. Three of the four faded out one after another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fourth was very close when the plane passed (the pilots had to have been able to see the light, if not all of them).  After the plane passed the last lit light, the light dimmed a little then began to follow the plane (from my vantage point).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that it dimmed out.  Almost like a candle flickering. (happened above TMI and HIA area)  Very Weird!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Too bright to be a star.  As it moved to the south/ south east at a very good clip it faded and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four minutes later another one appeared in the same spot of the sky moved in the exact same direction and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we jumped out of bed and started to watch to see if another would arrive.

Of course there were sky rockets and mortars going off all over the place,  HOWEVER.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10:45 pm a fairly bright (3 on a scale of 5) Orange Reddish light (which appeared to be pulsating slightly) SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE SKY AT ABOUT 25 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON,   It came from the direction that dozens of small, medium, and very large Aircraft per hour do on approach to the BOISE Airport.  BUT LANDING LIGHTS ARE WHITE, THIS WAS A BRILLIANT REDDISH ORANGE. out of the NNE and headed slowly and silently to the SSW and then CHANGED COURSE to a more due S direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hard to determine the altitude.  IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT ANY KIND OF FIREWORKS, HELICOPTER, AIRCRAFT, there were no strobing running lights at all.  IT COULD HAVE BEEN A SATELLITE AS THE SUN HAD JUST DROPPED BELOW THE HORIZON ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.  BUT IT WAS TOO BRIGHT AND SEEMED MUCH CLOSER.  It could have been a chinese lattern that some Yahoo let loose.  HOWEVER - IT JUST APPEARED IN THE SKY ALL OF A SUDDEN - NO CLOUDS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My step daughter tried to get a video on her phone but couldnt really get a lock on it.  But everybody witnessed it and went &#34;Hmmmm. That is no airplane. or firework or satellite.&#34;  And it deviated in its flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years, I have observed several anomolies.  Just being in the right place at the right time, I suppose.   And paying the slightest attention to the sky, its not that unusual.  This was not the spookiest or the hardest thing I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was another sighting back in 1999 when I lived in Boise that was a formation of little red lights moving in spiral pattern silently overhead maybe 500 ft. (2 witnesses) I could give the details on that one sometime if your interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am VERY familiar with Aviation and space technology,  I can identify most commercial and militray Aircraft.  Aircraft and theory of flight, running lights on aircraft.  I watch satellites all the time.  I know how they track across the sky typically, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.,  Robert in Star<n>

I didn&#39;t think anything of it and thought that it was something to do with the fireworks or even possibly a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, I seen 3 more orange balls traveling the same speed, they were lined up one after thee other, a bit of a distance apart and were also traveling to the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with 5 other people at this time and got there attention and to our amazement we seen a plane fly through the sky at the same exact time and then we knew for sure that this was no plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother said they could have been Chinese lanterns, but seeing how fast these orange balls were going, each following the same direction and path, and moving at various speeds...we counted the Chinese lantern idea out.  The objects were orange in color, round in shape, looked like balls of fire gliding through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing about 3 more sets of the orange balls follow the same path within a few minutes in between each set, we decided one person would Google it and 2 other people got out telescopes.  My brother was assembling the telescope and the balls continued on and then as soon as he had the scope ready to go they all of a sudden stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say that we seen around 10 of these fireballs in total.  If anyone has any ideas what they could be or similar stories please get back to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Looking at it, it seemed too bright to be lights from a plane, planet or other things you might find in the sky.  The object seemed to be moving, and moving fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes of intense brightness it seemed to be fading, blending in with the others stars but still keeping it’s orange color, still traveling it seemed to change direction a few times before disappearing completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or so of searching the sky it returned just as bright and big but in a different location.  This object was also moving, but not as quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another minute or so it brightened and got larger and another fireball fell from it, traveling down to the ground as fast as you would expect something to fall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the second fireball fell from the original, the original light disappeared and soon after, the second light also disappeared but behind trees and houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recorded the two balls separating on camera and it truly does look like a fire in the sky but seems too high and constant to be so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Freaky.<n>

The eight of us range in age from 55-18 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we wondered if it was a plane in trouble (on fire?).  But then, it seemed to be getting closer to us and my husband said it must be a hot air balloon and we were just seeing the glow of the fire in it.  It was a dark night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were looking towards the southeast and the fireball was traveling from north to south.  Next we wondered if it was a satellite, but it was traveling too slow and at times it just hovered and didn&#39;t move.  That was the strangest thing of all.  It was traveling in a linear path and didn’t change altitude.  The altitude was hard to judge since we didn’t know what we were looking at, but it was at probably the upper limit of what a hot air balloon would travel at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After four minutes of discussing this on the driveway, we all agreed that we had no idea what it was.  We were all feeling unsettled, even my sensible engineer husband.  Then, in about 10-15 seconds flat it flew up and away from us into the darkness.  We watched it until it became a tiny dot and then it disappeared completely.<n>

Disappeared in about 1 minute<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and some friends were standing in an open lot behind a plywood factory watching the 4th of July celebration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the event we noticed three small, bright lights appeared northeast of our position.  The three lights appeared to be several miles away judging by the distortions or twinkle of the lights and appeared to be orange to almost red in color.  Initially, I believed them to be some sort of aircraft in a line formation as the judged altitude was about 3000-4000 ft with motion and speed consistent with an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, I realized the lighting was inconsistent with any aircraft beacons or navigational lighting.  The light emitted was a constant reddish-orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects appeared to be traveling in a southwest direction towards us.  As they neared, all three objects gradually faded, sequentially disappeared one after the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing unusual was further seen afterwords.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather conditions at the time were very clear with a slight breeze from the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am convinced this was something very out of the ordinary as I have very extensive knowledge of aircraft patterns in the area and am very familiar with civilian and military aircraft types.   I do not believe it was any kind of firework either as the position of these lights observed were 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon and did not have a trajectory consistent with any kind of firework.  Even a flare suspended by a parachute could not have done this as the wind was blowing opposite the direction of travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By trade I am an automotive technician.<n>

Very different from the fireworks going on tonight.  A steady orange color about 5 or 6ft in diameter given the altitude of about 500ft.  I was visible for several minutes as we passed on the highway.  Once home we saw 5 more orange lights appear in the eastern sky one after the other and pass over our house, in a extremely straight line and very fast moving west toward Rosecrans airport/139th Airwing base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three directly east and two from the Northeast toward the same westerly point.  As they passed over our house you could clearly see the underside was not illuminated with the same orange color and it appeared to be a reflective disc object at least a 1,000 feet up.  There was no sound, no blinking lights.  Once they passed over they were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself, my husband and three children witnessed this event. In the distance you could see an airplane with its blinking lights.  This was very visible and very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above to reflect an evening sighting.  PD))<n>

My friends and I were on my boat, moored at the marina, watching the fireworks display over Yaquina Bay. The display ended around 10:30 pm.  I noticed a bright, solitary red light in the sky to the north.  It was traveling north to south, directly towards us, and I believed it to be an airplane; except the light was not flashing, and was much larger than lights on a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the light for about a minute, waiting to see flashing or other colors with it.  But there were no other lights or colors. I pointed it out to one of my friends who had remained after the fireworks display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He and I watched this bright red light coming in our direction for about two minutes, trying to determine what it might be.  We considered it was probably a light from a Coast Guard helicopter.  That wasn’t the case. Within about four minutes of first noticing the light, it was finally directly overhead, at an altitude of about 1,000 feet.  We then knew it was not an airplane, or a helicopter.  It made no sound whatsoever. It appeared to be traveling faster than any plane that would have been flying overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately after it passed us, the light became smaller and dimmer, appearing to be less than half the original size. It seemed to be traveling more than twice as fast once it was south of us, than when it was coming towards us. Within about 20 seconds after passing over us, the light seemed to shrink until it was completely gone. We have no idea what was generating that bright red light thatwe were watching for almost five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We followed it as far as we could but them lost it in the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were both yellow speres, no sound, and traveled at the speed of a small plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live close to the airport and we know the what small planes coming in to land look like and these we not planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were very bright, no flashing lights, just a yellow spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have seen these before but have never seen them flying so low or so slow.<n>

When the light was out I could still barely make out the shape of the craft and it seemed to be grey in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then veered quickly East and seemed to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I call them fallen angels, I go an yell at them and tell them they will be cast in hell someday.  This last time the one ball of light I seen was by Montserrat Mo.  The moon this time was in the east, but the time before 2011 it was setting in the west.  It almost seem that those balls of orange light were going straight at the moon.  I would say they were less then 20 feet high over my head, and no bigger then a softball.  On July 3rd. 2011 there were two balls of light, but these were yellow with a red ring around them.

My neighbor saw the orange fiery sphere in the sky from the back yard.  He told us all to look and pointed at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like it had a trail of fire moving underneath it and behind it a little too.  It was a pretty good size sphere and was moving at a high rate of speed from the South to North.  We all ran from the back yard to the front to follow it and then it stopped in the same place for about one minute then it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 11:00 PM my boyfriend and I were outside in the front yard and we spotted the sphere in the same place that it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to get a video of it with our phones but we could not pick up the sphere quick enough.  This time the orange sphere was staying in the same place but only stayed glowing for about 30-45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the third sighting was about 11:15 PM.  I was standing alone on the back porch letting the dogs out to go to the bathroom and I saw the orange sphere again moving at a steady fast pace from South to North I ran from the back of the house and out the front door and by the time I got there I saw it disappear in the trees.<n>

I have never seen and reported a UFO before.  This is the 4th of July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireworks ended about 9:50 PM (and were a long way away and not visible at all where we were due to the height of the houses and the distance to the fireworks (2 to 3 miles).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:25 PM, I was in the pool with my girlfriend and I was looking up at the sky saying how great it is in California to see meteorite showers and other such things in the night sky because the sky is always clear in the summer in California (as opposed to Illinois where I lived all my life (58 years) until this past October).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after I stated how clear it was and almost &#34;on cue&#34;, four round, glowing objects came into my line of sight out of the southwest, heading northeast.  They seemed fairly small, and flying fairly low; similar to the altitude of a single engine plane flying low.  They almost looked like four searchlights shining on a thin cloud, but the stars were out, and there was not a cloud in the sky.  They were fairly dim, but brighter in the center, and rimmed with a soft glow around each.  They were in a &#34;v&#34; formation, but there were three on the right, with one on the left. I am aware of the &#34;v&#34; shaped sightings that seem to be the underbelly lights of a larger craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These did not seem to be that since there was only one light on one side, and they were not flying slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued at a steady rate, much faster than any prop or jet plane would fly, and in a straight line. I watched for about 8 to 10 seconds from when they appeared in my line of sight until they went out of sight. I am not sure at this point, because they were not really visible, but they may have dispersed from the formation, because as I was watching the point where they went out of sight I caught a glimpse of a streak off to the northwest of where they disappeared that flashed for just a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing them for 2 - 3 seconds and realizing they were somethin! g special, I pointed to them right in front of my girlfriend&#39;s! face and emphatically said, &#34;Look! Look!&#34;, and she was able to see them for about 5 seconds or so. She has always been a scoffer and has made fun of me watching Ancient Astronauts and other UFO related shows on TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was a little shocked, a little scared, and would love to tell someone what she saw.  I think the incident changed her mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope we were not the only ones to observe this. I am thinking there were many people looking up at the time due to backyard fireworks.<n>

Although, I’m unsure of the exact time, it was around 10:15 PM CDT.  There was still plenty of light in the North Dakota evening sky. The sky was still blue and there was some scattered stratus clouds at an estimated 20,000-25,000 feet to my SE. The clouds were normal white with grey shadowed areas.  The visibility was unlimited. The temperature was around 75 F and the wind was light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hold a commercial pilots license and a BA. My state of mind was good; I was alert, well rested and completely sober. I was wearing my glasses which bring my vision to 20/15 – 20/10.  I have a small loss of hearing at 50Hz left ear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing on my driveway looking to the north at a few fireworks going off in the valley.  I noticed a reddish/orange glowing orb appearing to rise into the sky at about the same area of the fireworks.  At first I thought it was part of the display and continued to watch expecting a firework burst.  The object continued in my direction getting brighter and moving horizontal rather than vertical. It had been coming from the same direction as Minot Air Force Base.  I concluded that it was traveling from the horizon rather than ascending vertically as I first thought.  It was not Fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eyes fixed on the object as it almost passed over my house and a little to the east.  It was solid flaming orange with a slight elongated oval, and very bright, much, much brighter than ISS and moving much faster than an airliner at altitude.  It was traveling to the SSE at 160 to 170 degrees. It was close enough to hear any noise created by jet engines or sonic booms but it was completely silent.  I kept on watching it as it moved through the cloud deck and into blue sky.  It seemed to accelerate as it moved further southeast and I estimated it was at 20,000 to 25,000 feet and well above Mach 1. It disappeared into the clouds further south.  It didn’t leave any condensation trails and moved in a straight line.  I want to emphasize that the object was extremely fast moving and was silent. I’ve witnessed SR-71s making high speed passes and a Space shuttle launch along with B2 fly over’s and myriads of other military aircraft in-flight along with other celestial events.!  This thing topped them all.  Spooky stuff for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10-20 minutes later I saw another orange object almost due north. It appeared to be climbing to the NW at a steep rate of climb. It was smaller in size but orange like the other one. I could not determine its distance but, Runway 29 at the M.A.F.B. would be on that heading. I ran inside my house to get my camera and field glasses and when I returned 30 seconds later it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier that year in March I was outside on my driveway in the middle of the night (3 AM) getting some fresh air.  I looked to the east and saw a solid orange object in the sky moving at about the speed of a small 4 seat airplane. It seemed to be just lumbering along and I watched for awhile thinking this was the atmosphere playing tricks on me because of its solid bright orange appearance. Later, I looked on-line to see if it was the space station and found out it wasn’t ISS or any other satellite or orbiting debris.<n>

I was sitting in a chair facing north a few feet from where he was at.  I was watching the fireworks that he let off, as well as some others in the neighborhood.  I was looking east up in the sky.  I saw a small light, thinking it was the remains of someone&#39;s fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I kept watching, it moved and got bigger.  It was heading SW in the sky and was orange in color.  It appeared to be oval shaped but looked like there was a smaller area on the top also orange.  The light was solid and did not blink.  Due to all the fireworks around us, it was noisy, but in moments of silence I could not hear any noise coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching until my view was obstructed by a tree, that was close by.  I jumped up to see if I could still see, it but it was gone.  It either disappeared, or went behind the tree where I could not see it any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son saw it also, but was intent on his fireworks, so did not pay much attention.<n>

Just before reaching the Smithton Truckstop, I saw what I first thought was a plane on fire, in the sky, left of the Interstate, headed West.  The object in question did not seem to have any blinking or standard aircraft lights, but had a pulsating fire looking light, which did not turn completely off at any point.  The object seemed to be traveling at a consistent speed, like a normal aircraft, but the light is what made it unusual.  I was unable to safely pull over and observe it, as construction work is in progress along that section.<n>

After loading my car, we stood in his driveway and watched fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 22:00 we were talking and turned to face northeast (two o&#39; clock) in the direction of I-480 and North Olmsted Golf Club.  Both of us saw a formation of six orange-colored, oval-shaped lights moving in line (from two o&#39; clock to nine o&#39; clock) toward our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I commented: &#34;I don&#39;t think those are fireworks.&#34;  My father was in the miliary and has flown aircraft. He stated: &#34;They must be military transport choppers!&#34;  He added: &#34;But it&#39;s not exactly safe conditions to be flying tonight.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 22:01 three neighbors from down the street had been watching fireworks (southwest) and approached, one woman asking my father (due to his knowledge of aircraft) &#34;What kind of planes are those?&#34;  He told her he was uncertain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The six orange lights flew in two wide triangular formations that stretched and contracted, narrowing as they passed over us.  The lights were solid, exhibiting no blinking or pulsing.  The lights made no sound, and my father remarked that &#34;you can&#39;t hear the rotors.&#34;  The lights paused at times, ascended and descended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He asked me to photograph them with my Droid.  I attempted to first record video and second snap pictures.  I got two of them, but only caught one light in the picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 22:01, after they passed over my father&#39;s house, the lights receded into the distance for a few seconds and then vanished.  A fourth neighbor/witness remarked that these may have been &#34;balloons.&#34;  The lights did not return.<n>

Noticed reddish orange circular object that just looked different than airplanes, straight ahead, north of our home, moving south south west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad was a pilot and we watched planes from the time I was very young.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object was passing to the west of us, I walked out to the road to get a better view as it moved southwest, thinking we would see blinking lights of an aircraft as it passed us, as many times the blinking lights are not viewable until they pass by at a different vantage point.  There were no blinking lights from the three vantage points as it passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was some smoke in the air, so we also assumed that the smoke may have had an effect on the light we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The illuminated object remained the same size at all vantage points, about 2 times larger than the bright light of a lowflying aircraft.  The light emanating had a shimmery effect. The color was a bright orange red but! again the object had a different shimmery effect, as if there was motion in the light, not clear cut points of light.  The other witness described the object as &#34;flying up&#34; into the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light seemed to fade away as it moved southwest, though it seemed to be much closer to us, lower altitude than the other aircraft that were also in the sky at the time.  The other aircraft in the sky were easily viewable, along with their blinking lights, not an orange/red color and seemed to be at higher altitudes than the unknown object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were very perplexed because the object was just not the norm and even though it was the 4th of july and their was a bit of smoke in the air, it didn&#39;t add up...given us comparing the unknown object with other known objects visable at the same time. Still on my mind, decided to look up other possible reports and my goodness there are many!<n>

As we watched the display, I noticed a nearly steady orange ball of light move across the sky, moving from the north to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I initially thought it was a burning ember being blown away from the fireworks, but the light continued as the object moved almost the complete distance of the visible sky.  As it moved past us and on further south, it flickered a few times and then went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed outside for about half and hour, and during that time we saw a total of six of these objects moved across the sky in the same direction.  They didn’t follow the same path as each other, but they all did move north to south, some of them extinguishing their light sooner than others.  They were not all grouped together, but at one time there were two of them in the sky at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time, there were various airplanes flying overhead, so you could see the difference in their lights.  These objects did not have the flashing lights that the airplanes did.<n>

This happened on the evening of July 4, 2011, around 10 pm (time is approximate.  I did not check the exact time when the sightings occurred).  All three sightings occurred when there were fireworks going off in the sky, and later when the fireworks ceased, we had no more sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first sighting happened at approximately 10 pm (plus or minus 15 minutes).  My son and his friends noticed a red/pinkish light in the distance to the southwest.  It grew larger as it got closer and then they said the light just went out.  That’s when I looked over to see what they were talking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time, I could see the object, but it was pitch black.  There were no lights on it at all, which ruled out commercial aircraft immediately.  Also, the shape of it was irregular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my angle, it looked to be somewhat triangle shaped, with the nose slightly rounded, but the “tail” was not straight as a triangle would be.  The tail was rounded, or bulged out.  It was almost heart-shaped, with the point being the nose.  If flew due north at this point and my wife then saw it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the red/pink light(s) when out, there were no more lights that appeared on it.  It flew into the distance and we lost sight of it.   The entire sighting lasted maybe a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting happened about 5 minutes later, around 10:05 pm.  This time I saw the red/pinkish light in the southwest.  It immediately got my attention since it was not blinking at all.  We watched as it came closer (heading approximately northwest) and before it got over our location, it turned east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point the light began to diminish/fade out.  I watched it as the light faded out and at that point it was behind a tree in the neighbor’s yard so I could not get a good view of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the other side of the tree to watch it as it headed east (I assumed it would be the black mass like I saw before) and I did not see it emerge from behind the tree.  I searched the sky but could not find it.  Again, the entire sighting lasted maybe a minute or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third sighting happened about 10 minutes later and this time it was again the red/pink light in the southwest.  I wanted to get a good look at this one and take a video with my phone.  I turned to tell me son that another one was heading our way, and as I turned back to look at it, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being the 4th of July, it’s very easy for people to dismiss this as fireworks, but I can assure you that this was definitely NOT fireworks.  The black mass that flew north (the first sighting) moved about the same speed as the commercial jets that cross the sky in my area (there is an airport near, and we did see other aircraft that night).  But I have never seen an aircraft that just had one red/pink light (instead of the red/green that is required), that did NOT blink at all (commercial craft lights blink).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the light faded out; it didn’t turn off as in a switch.  It was gradual.  Plus the shape of the craft was NOT anything that I’ve ever seen.  Even if some would say that it was a commercial craft that had it’s lights off for some reason, the shape of the craft was not like any aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There may have been one or two more sightings by my son and his friends before the initial sighting in this report, but it wasn’t until I saw the craft as described above that turned completely black that I started documenting the sightings.<n>

Watching the fire works being shot off of Saunders Heights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:45 P.M., we noticed a very bright multiple colored light to the south of us over Berryville, Arkansas.  We thought it was fire works but it did not disappear, but kept silently moving towards us, maintaining its altitude.  As it passed over head with out making any sound you could see it had a circular luminous shape with a halo type glow around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was virtually no breeze.  It seemed to be observing the fireworks, too.  It continued to the north and turned reddish and slowly faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an artist and my wife is a librarian.  We have both spent our entire life in the country and we are very familiar with the night skies and what planes etc. look like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting lasted maybe 45 seconds at most and in 64 years of observing the skies we have never seen anything like that in real life, only on television  shows.

Noticed reddish orange circular object that just looked different than airplanes, straight ahead, north of our home, moving south south west.  My dad was a pilot and we watched planes from the time I was very young.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object was passing to the west of us, I walked out to the road to get a better view as it moved southwest, thinking we would see blinking lights of an aircraft as it passed us, as many times the blinking lights are not viewable until they pass by at a different vantage point.  There were no blinking lights from the three vantage points as it passed.   There was some smoke in the air, so we also assumed that the smoke may have had an effect on the light we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The illuminated object remained the same size at all vantage points, about 2 times larger than the bright light of a lowflying aircraft. The light emanating had a shimmery effect.  The color was a bright orange red! but again the object had a different shimmery effect, as if there was motion in the light, not clear cut points of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other witness described the object as &#34;flying up&#34; into the atmosphere.  The light seemeded to fade away as it moved southwest, though it seemed to be much closer to us, lower altitude than the other aircraft that were also in the sky at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other aircraft in the sky were easily viewable, along with their blinking lights, not an orange/red color and seemed to be at higher altitudes than the unknown object.  We were very perplexed because the object was just not the norm and even though it was the 4th of july and their was a bit of smoke in the air, it didn&#39;t add up...given us comparing the unknown object with other known objects visable at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still on my mind, decided to look up other possible reports and my goodness there are many!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF ORIGINAL REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Addition to report below, there was NO sound coming from the object &amp; we heard noise from aircrafts at a much higher altitude about 5-10 minutes after the sighting:<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

The spheres continued to show up for about 45 minutes. Most of the witnesses are non-drinkers and were very alert,  Thinking at first that they were &#39;Chinese lanterns&#39;, only a couple of pictures were attempted.  While watching carefully, it was later decided that perhaps they were something unusual.   A similar sighting was noted in 2009 of a single object on that Fourth of July, and it was also reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 4th this year, it was a warm night, little to no wind, fireworks going off everywhere.  Some of us are familiar with various human made craft, and have seen &#39;chinese lanterns&#39; in flight.  This was purposeful and did not flicker or move in an erratic way.  One group of five or six contained four spheres that were very close together in two sets of two.  These broke apart and coninued to soar in a shape similar to the markings on dice -  Like the &#39;6&#39; with one dot on the top missing.  The sixth sphere winked out and lit up again as they traveled to the west.  The shape became similar to the Big Dipper, but the movement was smooth and did not appear random.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects came from the east, but at different points along the horizon.  Some were farther away, most were &#39;BB&#39; sized or smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the objects was observed for at least four minutes -  It crossed under the flight path of a commercial airplane as the plane was starting to descend towards SeaTac Airport.  The plane was aproximately twice as high as the object, and the object was aprox. 100 feet above the tops of mature alder and evergreen trees.  The object did not flicker but seemed to pulse a beautiful orange color. It did not veer in any way but stayed in a straight path at the same altitude, speed was relatively slow.  At the closest point, it was slightly smaller than a wooden pencil eraser and was coming from the east, and it continued to glow as it disappeared into the distance to the west.<n>

University Place is just south of Tacoma, WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 10 PM and dark. The lights in the park had just shut off, so I do know it was just about dead on 10PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no detectible wind at all.  I was looking directly south, (I know this because the road entrance goes directly North-South.)  I just verified this on a map so that I would be absolutely sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An object was heading due south running parallel to this entrance road.  I immediately knew this was no aircraft.  It had none of the required FAA lighting on the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur astronomer and an aircraft enthusiast since I was young. I can tell you what a B-25, B17, Lancaster, 707, F-22 Raptor, etc. all look like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing I noticed is that it was spherical in nature and had these flames surrounding it.  I immediately thought, &#34;bolide.&#34;  No.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was at my highest Zenith point to me, approximately 80 degrees over the western horizon it had no tail or flames at all trailing behind it.  The flames were a dark reddish hue, hugging the craft on the sides and seemed to have an electric/plasma effect to it that made them appear to adhere to the craft in vertical, striped patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way that I can further explain this effect, is this: In an old TV set, there is a yoke on the back of the picture tube directing a scanning electron beam to the front.  This is what the vertical electrical/plasma pattern was appearing to me to give off this unusual visual effect.  It was to me an electromagnetically controlled plasma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This above explained reddish pattern would be replaced by a more yellowish underlying glow that would switch back in forth, pulsing every 3-5 seconds.  I just timed this in my video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I will try to describe the size, speed, and trajectory as best that I can.  I was the first to see this between the three of us.  I was looking north.  I would say it was approximately 60 degrees above the Northern horizon, and ever so slight West by approximately 2-5 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it, I would say it was the size of a pea at arms length.  But when it came at our Zenith my 13 yr old son said it would about the size of a penny at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see this because I was busily trying to keep this centered &amp; steady on my camera from this point forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Speed was steady the whole time, never wavering at all and was completely silent.  The height is almost impossible to determine in the dark!   But the one thing that I would say, is it appeared not to be more that 20-30 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trajectory is the easy one.  It flew directly in front us in an exact North South direction following parallel to that entrance road.  Speed is a little tougher, but it did appear a consistent speed that maybe a private 2 engine Lycoming engine based aircraft would be doing while it was in cruise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting I would estimate to be 3-5 minutes in length in which it traversed 150 degrees of the sky.  We saw it until it completely disappeared into the southern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was a young boy I saw 2 bolides in the sky flying in parallel, one slightly ahead of the other with 2 long flaming trails.  This was even more fascinating!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My conclusion in all of this is that it was constructed and controlled.  I need not speculate any further.<n>

You can see my prior reports on same day at approx. same time.  I think someone may be trying to create a hoax because it happens, so far, every 4th of July soon after fireworks (over past 3 years I’ve seen it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approx 9:55 pm.  An orange glowing orb glided slowly across the sky from the (approx) SW toward the NW for about 15 to 20 secs.  I and a friend made sure to have binoculars handy this time and sure enough, the same sighting as in the past two years.  We saw no other lights on the &#34;craft&#34; just a glowing orange ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;Orange Glow&#34; seemed to intensify and then dull a little a few times (like manipulating a dimmer) but for the most part was steady.  Then, it just dimmed a bit and went abruptly totally out, while I was looking at it in my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, I could not see anything of a &#34;craft&#34; once the glow disappeared.  I looked with bare eyes then again with binoculars.  And could not see a thing, nothing.. it was gone.   Also, there were no other lights, none flashing or steady like a normal plane or helicopter etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I hope u were able to have someone out here this year to try and catch it and find out what the heck this is and if someone is hoaxing it.  Ill watch your site intermittently to see if you found an answer and if anyone else reports same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What keeps intriguing me on this is that I do see other sightings of apparently similar looking orbs in the night sky…..and some on the say day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ill keep reporting and watching for answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for being the place to go to report these things!

The lights were much too large to be stars and they were extremely bright for 1-2 minutes and would then fade to nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights would then appear again about a minute later and would be as bright as when we originally witnessed them.  They did appear to remain in the same general location in the sky, but they moved up and down slightly.  There did not appear to be any sideways movement witnessed.  We also did not see flashing colored lights as with an airplane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were bright yellow/white glowing objects.  We do live near a Nation Guard Base, but the flight path is in the opposite direction and the aircraft flown from this base do not exhibit the behavior witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 7 adults and 1 child that witnessed the lights and none of us could figure out what we were witnessing, except that they were not stars or aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of the adults present were managers, two adults were skilled trade workers, and the other two adults were college students.<n>

I couldn&#39;t really tell how high up in the sky it was, but it appeared to be no higher than a low flying plane.  It was not flashing or blinking in any way.  It didn&#39;t change color or fade in and out, it was just a steady, bright orange colored light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began moving very slowly toward us going from south-east to north-west.  It made no sound as it moved.  It also moved very smoothly in a straight line, not changing it&#39;s speed or jerking in any way. It moved approximately 200 feet in 3-4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were watching it, an airplane flew right by it going in a south-eastern direction.  Almost immediately, after the plane passed the object, it turned to the north and seemed to just fade away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other than myself and my son, two women, and several children were watching the object, but I didn&#39;t get their names.<n>

Was orange with yellow aura around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I told my kids, its probably a firework or a plane.  But I soon realized as it got closer, it was not burning out, was not making noise and was getting brighter and larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes, it seemeed to be following the vehicle and flew overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point my 12 year old daughter got very upset, started freaking out and saying. &#34;Its a large circle with a orange light in the middle!  It&#39;s hovering over the car!  Its a UFO!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I stopped the car immediately into a parking lot.  I looked up and the oject shut off its lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared at first to have completely vanished until my 10 year old son and myself looked over at the treeline and saw the shadow of a craft hovering over the trees.  IT was shaped like a layered cake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son drew what looked like a three tiered circular object with an antanae on top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object flip on its side, and then was a perfect black circle, which then flew off slowly with no sound.  As I watched it it then took off in the blink of an eye upward too fast for any terrestrial plane to accelerate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above, to reflect an evening sighting.

This was not the red navigation lights that you see with the red, green. and white combination.

The first one had an object that was clearly not the crescent moon.  She was facing to the west from the deck of our second story condo.  She looked at the instant feedback on her Exilim Casio digital camera and noticed the white spot.  She immediately took a follow up picture that showed something fading in the same location.  She was simply taking a picture of the sky originally, not the object.  The photo was taken outside so there is no window glare.  There were no fireworks allowed on the resort so that should eliminate that possibility   I blew these up on my computer and noticed something of unusual shape inside it.  The second photo shows an object in that same position (6 seconds later) that appears to be fading.  Her time on the camera setting is obviously off when right clicking preferences but notice the time lapse between them.<n>

They were a constant, bright red.  They didn&#39;t flicker, they didn&#39;t blink or pulse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house to grab my Father and his roommate to see, by the time we got outside there were 9 red lights in the sky.  They weren&#39;t moving in any apparent formation.  It is hard to tell how fast they were going since I am not sure how far away they were from us.  But they were moving West at what appeared to be a slow pace (Slower than what commercial airlines or hospital hilos appear to be moving)<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they moved West/Southwest they began to fade slowly, like a ! dimmer switch was being turned down.  As the bulk of them (8) moved west/southwest and faded one broke away from the pack and began moving higher than the rest and started to fade in and out, same dimmer switch analogy.  This lasted about a minute and then it faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after a 10th light appeared over the treeline traveling at the same pace as the others but lower in the sky. It dipped back under the treeline and we lost track of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10 red lights floating in sky, moving what appeared to be very slowly, no apparent formation, moved independently of on another, 8 faded out slowly, 1 faded in and out and deviated from the direction the others were moving, 1 dipped below the treeline and we lost sight.<n>

This occurrence lasted during a display of what one could describe as flashes of sparkles, through which my wife and I could perceive this vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hesitated to inform  the center because concurrently there was a search for a recent drowning victim by a helicopter, but upon reflection there would be little chance of such machine being that high and in reasonable distance from  the explosions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been told  by Mr. davenport to contact the T.V. stations to have them confirm what we saw.<n>

After flying for several miles in sight it faded into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got back to my house, I still had company.  Me and my great uncle explained what we saw.  After we finished my mother said that my great uncle&#39;s mom had said to her &#34;I just saw the strangest thing.  Well I swear I saw a ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother then told us that my great uncle&#39;s mom&#39;s description matched our&#39;s.<n>

We have folks in this area that fly their hovercrafts, but they make noise when they fly over during the day.  I read that some people say, they have seen &#34;Chinese Lanterns,&#34; and I am not sure what they mean exactly, except when I explained the four objects seemed they were on a rope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time that I have seen this object, the first time was in January 2011, and me and one of my friend&#39;s heard a noise above us, and this big orange ball (like a loss hot air balloon) flew over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting was no noise and four individual objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I actually cannot believe I am contacting anyone about this, but it was amazing and I wasn’t alone this time either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are thinking it could be something the government is experimenting with so, I will be anguish to read tomorrow’s newspaper and see if anyone else had seen what we had seen this evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You ask for our backgrounds we are ordinary folks both have good jobs, not sci-fi buffs  but, I will tell you that I had called my friend that was with me with the first sighting in January to tell her what we had just seen this evening.<n>

It was moving in and out of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnesses beside us said it was a candle tied to a balloon, or a japanese lantern, which i started to think &#34;oh yeah that makes sense&#34; but, the orange ball continued to pulsate and then the orange ball started slowly dimming, which i thought was the candle going out due to lack of oxygen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weird thing was though that as soon as the orange glow went out there was a bright blue flash immediately followed b! y a bright white flash, (and the flashes werent like the flash of a firework) the object disappeared for a minute, then the orange glow reappeared and continued to pulsate again for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was approaching above our heads, the object stopped glowing, but you could see the silhouette of the object in front of the blue sky.  It looked like an oddly shaped blimp or something, still hovering above us.  Then it floated out of sight.  I thought maybe i was crazy or hallucinating  but my mom saw the exact same thing i saw, we thought there was another explanation until the blue and white flashes. We would have recorded a video but my moms phones battery was dead.<n>

I turned the camera toward it, but it wasn&#39;t bright enough to show up on the LCD display.  Nevertheless, I did keep the camera trained on it for about a minute by lining up the top of the camera and the side of the camera.  My eyesight is not the best, (I&#39;m in my 50&#39;s) but it seemed to have at least two points, high and low, producing the red glow, although they were very close to each other, but the point is that it did seem to have some structure, it wasn&#39;t just a point of light, and although I had no idea of the distance between us, the diameter of the glow was about a tenth of the diameter of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to filming fireworks for a couple of minutes, went inside my house and transfer the .avi file from the SD card to my computer, and decided to go back outside and film some more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time I went into the street in front of my house, and although about ten minutes had passed, the red glowing object was still in almost the same position, although fainter and smaller, giving me the impression that it was moving away from me, although I couldn&#39;t really detect any movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again I trained the camera on it by lining up top and side, but after about a minute of that, it became so faint that I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning, 7/5, I did a search for UFO sightings, and I noticed immediately that there has been a lot of &#34;fireball&#34; sightings, very similar in description to what I saw, so I felt compelled to report this.  I also can&#39;t imagine that I was the only one who noticed this, since so many people were looking to the sky watching fireworks.<n>

I used a Canon T2i digital camera (18 Meg) set at ISO 800 and for 10 second exposures.  Each picture was taken 30 seconds apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With those settings, any objects like airplanes, fireworks, an even helicopters would show a trail.  Even the stars, if you zoom in, would show a small trail due to the earth rotation during 10 seconds of exposure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flying objects in the photos were pretty steady in their positions, except that they seem to appear and dissapear without leaving a trail.  Notice the change from photos number 5 and 6, where quite a few objects appeared from the twighlight zone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were not visible with the naked eye.

And she responded that I was crazy and seeing things, the light disappeared for a split second and it once again appeared, now not more than 100 ft. away, I asked her again did you see that? ,and she responded once again that I was crazy, so this time I had time to take 5 pictures which only 1 came out. The funny thing is my neighbor still does admit seeing it. The second time I really thought that the light was coming toward me, and I ask myself why is it that my neighbor couldn’t see it. I then had the strange feeling that I was going to get abducted. The light disappeared on an unvalibable speed to the west. I hav! e the the picture, and is clear that this was not a helicopter, or fireworks, take a look at the picture and you can see the landing gear, and something coming out of the the left bottom opening of the ufo, that created the light, see for yourself and be the judge of it. This was 4th of July, and I am sure I was not the only one that saw it.<n>

We were coming from indiana and following my parents in thier car, with my two brothers.  We really close to turning right onto Dxie Highway.  I dont know the street name, im not really familliar with Ill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were driving I was looking out the wpassenger window toward the west, and I noticed theses three orangish lights.  I noticed they werent moving and were in a triangle pattern. just sitting there.  They looked like steady light then later i thought they flashed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cant be sure. we kept driving and i tried to get a picture.  I took two pictures but by then one of the lights had faded off and only two were visible.  It was wierd because it didnt just vanish it was it decided to turn off its self and it just faded away.  the other two disappeared after i took the two pictures.  we had pulled over by then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like it, except in movies maybe.  The picture were from a moving car so  you can only just barely see the two lifghts above the tree line.  They were above a field, but by the time I took the pictures, trees were in my way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, not sure if this is off worth mentioning, but I tried to call my mom to see if they saw the same things, and as soon as I dialed, I lost all signal, and when I told my mom, this she said the same thing happened to them.  They were trying to call us, as well.<n>

The time, as I recall now, must have been a little after 9 pm (2100 hrs).  There was still a little light in the western sky, but our deck faces east, and already our neighbors were lighting their fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 9:20 or so, I looked into the southeast sky and saw a ‘fireball,’ for lack of a better description, &#34;moving slowly&#34;, traveling east to west.  I didn’t mention it to the others, at that moment, because I had lost sight of it behind a large tree in our backyard, and wasn’t sure that it was not a plane, or just another firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say it was flying about 2-3000 feet or so (hard to determine).  About 5-10 minutes later, another (or the same) ‘fireball’ appeared almost on the exact path or trajectory moving again, east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time, my son, 23, saw it and pointed it out to all of us, and exclaimed, &#34;What is that?  Is it a UFO?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told him I didn’t know but that this was the second time I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in to get the camera but it had traveled out of sight.  I did see it 2 more times, this time following it from the front porch into the western sky where it just became a small dot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m surprised no one in our town or neighbors mentioned this sighting.  I haven’t yet had time to download the pictures or video I took into my computer.  The times the ‘fireballs’ were spotted were apx 9:20, 9:35, and 9:45.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a light colored magenta, not brilliant, but certainly not an airplane indicator light that flashes in a constant rhythmic pattern, more like a flame on a stove or burner unit.<n>

The street lights had just come on (I believe it was around 21:20) when my daughter saw what appeared to be a single orange circular fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She nudged me and asked what it was.  I had no idea.  We watched it travel slowly from East to West, when it stopped moving and the light slowly faded and disappeared.  There was no sound emitted from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw several people in the crowd look up at it, but no one offered any explanations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw something that looked exactly the same on Saturday, July 2, on the lake at Apple Canyon, IL, waiting for their fireworks to begin which was also around 21:20.  It had the same shape and color (circular and orange)and there was only 1.  It moved slowly West to East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a minute when I got distracted by someone and averted my eyes for only a moment.  When I went to watch it some more, the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not one of those people who believe in UFO’s, but thus far, no one has offered a reasonable explanation as to what the object was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

It was orange in color and seems to glimmer like a flame.  However, we begin to watch as it moved across the sky beyond our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be high in the sky.  Roughly 10 minutes later another &#34;orange flare&#34; came across the sky following the same pattern almost, it too flew out of view as the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it flew overhead, binoculars form within the house were obtained.  View through binoculars, the object was very hard to focus in on remaining blurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 10 minutes later another flew in about the same path and direction as the previous. This time, this particular &#34;orange flare&#34; was moving faster than the others coming from the same direction and going towards the same direction as the other.  (The direction these things were going was from the North - Northeast moving towards the southwest - sometimes turning west).  This one slowed down and appeared to come to ! a complete stop while still glowing orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute or two later, the item began to move in a western direction and slowly began to disappear until it was gone.  Once it disappeared, another came into view across the sky to the north again - it followed the same path.  This point was when the choice to grab the telescope was made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, as the telescope was being sought after, two more objects appeared outside. This time as one went across (same direction) another appeared across the sky in the direction they were coming from making visible two of these objects at one time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were photographed and caught on video (phone).  However, watching the video and film afterwards, it is very hard to see what was actually seen.  Describing the view through binoculars - the objects appeared to be an orange spot light moving from side to side almost.  It was very hard to focus in on the objects.  The sky was clear except for some smoke in the southern portion of the sky from t! he fireworks - however, these objects moved through clear skie! s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the one object stopped, we observed a plane flying from the east to west and appeared to be flying toward the direction; however, when the plane flew by the object - you could tell the plane was much higher than the object.  However, it seemed weird that object slowed and stopped as the plane approached and as soon as the plane passed over head of the object, that is when the object begin moving in the westerly direction as the same as the plane, then vanished.  Further research on the internet mentioned items such as Chinese lanterns which may be possible - not sure because we have never seen them but the objects were weird as they seemed to be moving at various speeds and the one that stopped.  We have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first two objects came from the North and traveled in a southwestern direction.  The remaining objects came from the Northeast and traversed in a southwestern direction except for the one object that stopped and changed to a western direction.  All objects except the first vanished or disappeared in the sky in view, while the first vanished behind the house out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object emitted no noise from at least what we could tell - there were fireworks going off in the distance and the booming of those were heard, however, when the plane flew by, we could hear that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were very hard to focus on and appeared blurry even through the binoculars; however they were very bright in color and looked like flares in a way but without the excessive smoke or flame appearance flares give off - the same color though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first two were moving about the same speed and the third that stopped was moving very fast before it slowed to a stop.  The remaining was various speeds but no! t as fast as the third.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The items were viewed from about 2115 hours to approx. 2215 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects appeared as circle type and blurry. We stayed out until 2250 hours waiting for more but no more were observed.<n>

The object appeared toward the south around 30 degrees inclination and moving northerly with a alight easterly bent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flickered like an object reentering the atmosphere being burned, yet the rate it moved in the sky was very much like viewing the Space Station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

July 4, 2011<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in the crowd watching a band at an outdoor concert for the July 4th weekend in Traverse City, Michigan at approx. 9:05 PM.  The fireworks display was going to start after the band finished.  There were several thousand people in the crowd as this was the beginning of the National Cherry Festival.  My buddy sitting next to me said, &#34;Hey, what is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we looked up in the crystal clear deep blue sky, there was a perfectly round reddish orange orb, which looked like a red hot glowing metal ball. It made no noise, had no trail, just hovered and slowly moved across the sky, then winked out.  Everyone in the crowd was looking at this thing including the band, when suddenly two more appear from a different direction.  They also hovered for 1-2 minutes then winked out.  Then one more appeared from where the first one was seen, hovered for 1-2 minutes, then winked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the last we saw of the orbs that night, the whole time was about 5 minutes total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I managed to get pictures of these objects, although my hands were shaking, which explains why the pictures show the orbs with tails which is me shaking the camera.  One of the photos curiously shows strange colored contrails in the area of the orb.  These could not be seen with the naked eye, I only saw them when reviewing the pictures later.  I would normally not file this type of report but saw on the NUFON website that there were similar sightings the same night in the Saginaw/Bay City Michigan area at the same time and with a similar description.  Pictures will be sent by e-mail.<n>

It was a warm, clear night and shortly after turning on to the highway, I noticed two separate lights in the sky with the furthest north one seeming to be just south of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down while driving to get a better look at them, thinking that since it was the 4th of July they might be wish candles.  Neither of them appeared to be moving however and it was then I noticed two more further south.  All four of the lights seemed to be in a perfectly straight line extending about 30 miles or so to the southwest of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife to let her know I was off work as I kept driving into town.  As I was about parallel to the furthest north light, I mentioned the lights to her and she said they were probably the wish candles.  About that time, I saw lights on the northern object start blinking like an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hung up the phone and sped through town to get a better vantage point on a high butte.  By the time I got up there though, I was unable to see any of the lights.  I kept this whole incident to myself until recently I was looking online at videos of UFO&#39;s and I noticed a comment from a user (on a video on UFO&#39;s in Dickinson) that he had spotted the same thing two days earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a  triangle-shaped orange spark move out of the fireworks and continue to go up in to the sky without exploding or fading out.  It continued to move at a slow and steady pace up and northwest in the sky until it was directly over my head after maybe a minute or so of  watching it perplexed about how in the hell this thing was able to keep going.  The distance above us is uncertain, but it seemed small and very distant.  If I was to give it a size from my perspective on the ground I would say about the size of a grain of rice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have been able to assume it to be just about anything else if it did not suddenly increase at an unnaturally fast speed and continued northwest until it was out of view in a matter of seconds or maybe less.  I looked at my friend who had just watched the same thing and had the same reaction, &#34;What the f*ck was that?&#34;  The only time I have ever seen anything going from what seemed to be 0 miles an hour to turbo speed within a matter of a second of so is in sci-fi movies and that is exactly the type of movement that I saw.  The span of the horizon at the distance the object seemed to be at covered within 1 minute seems truly bizarre to me.<n>

On Ballas Rd just north of Manchester Rd we witnessed a red, glowing orb-type thing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first thought it was plane or helicopter, but both decided it was neither.  It looked like a fireball of sorts.  Kind of glowing.  Don&#39;t think it was a hot air baloon, either.  It was odd.  Moving towards the west slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We couldn&#39;t stop on that particular stretch of road, so had to move on due to traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unsure if others saw anything.

It had no sound to it nor a outline of a air craft, it was just a floating ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Couple days later around 5pm i take my dogs for a walk in my neighborhood and i see it again.  Couple months later, i see another sighting, but this time its something ive never seen before.. it was around 3 am when i was takin my dog out to the bathroom, i see literally a fire in the sky.. it was burning and flickering just like 1.   I immediately get scared n yell for my dog to get in the house, i then go back to my bedroom and look out the window, it lasted for another 3 minutes until finally it went down to a single flame and burned ou! t.  I have friends who have said they seen it too on the same night, same time frame also but in a different town about 20 minutes away from me.<n>

The time was between 9:30 and 10:00 pm.  Our porch faces east towards south Nashville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were watching a few fireworks when we noticed a large red light rising straight upward from the general direction of Nashville.  It never entered my mind that it was a firework as the light rose slowly for several seconds, possibly a minute.  I told my wife that it was a plane and that it only appeared to be going straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light seemed to get smaller as it rose which seemed strange to me because I thought &#34;the airplane&#34; was coming toward us.  When the light was at about 75 degrees it sped up dramatically and headed south.  In a matter of about 5 or 6 seconds it disappeared behind the trees, about two thirds of the way from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is difficult to describe the exact movement of this object, but one thing is sure to me.  This object was flying at least 20 times faster than anything that I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never heard a noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point it seemed to my wife that the object was not round but triangular with rounded edges.<n>

When filling my car I looked to the east and saw 12 objects that looked to be floating at a slow speed, moving east to west.  They looked to be at about an altitude of 1000 ft agl.  They looked like glowing orange/red balls.  I told a lady filling her car to look and I commented that the look like ufo&#39;s and we both laughed.I figured being the forth of july they could have been pyrotecnics of some sort.  After reading other posts on this site about the same objects it has changed my mind about what they could have been.  Very odd sighting to say the least.<n>

The sky was in twilight between 8-9pm in the small township of Goodland, just north of Imlay City Michigan. I had finished a late dinner and was standing in my yard looking south. Goodland is a small farming community. Each house is separated by farmland. South of me there are only 6 to 8 homes within my sight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few neighbors were lighting off some small fireworks in their yards which had my attention directed south and low on the horizon. Amid the small pops of bottle rockets and the like I noticed roughly 6-8 lights hanging just above the horizon at an indeterminate distance. The ground rolls slightly for miles and there are several tree lines that merge making the distance too difficult to judge. The dots of light were red, pink and yellow. At first they appeared to have the same glow of some of the larger fireworks you&#39;d see at a festival, but these orbs were slowly rising. As the lights  rose higher I called to my wife to come see. She came in time to witness the lights organize from a loose arrangement to lining up in a straight vertical line evenly spaced apart. From that position they slowly faded away over a period of about 1-2 minutes. The top one faded first followed by each subsequent lower one till they were gone. I think the fade was a product of them moving off dire! ctly south, one by one. The whole event took 3-5 minutes at most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This being the 4th of July with fireworks at the time, I figured there was no sense reporting this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally, there is an air force base to the south east of me, (Selfridge ANG) which is 40+ miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not seen those lights again.<n>

Beautiful thunder and lightening was all around.  We saw a couple of warm up Fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we saw one, that looked like a warm up Firework, Chinese Lantern style I suppose, it seemed to rise and come forward and I thought it was a large Firework Ember coming toward the field we were in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I said OMG that is a huge FIREBALL with a white center and red around it &#34;My boyfriend said the center was yellow, I thought it was white..,&#34; then I said; &#34;Wait no, it&#39;s a huge Meteor!!!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching to see where it was going to land.  But then it changed from moving to the right of us, to slightly turning and lowering coming East toward us!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend got out of his lawn chair, and I was trying to figure out which way we should run, and how in the world we could dodge this large METEOR in time!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right at the state of Uh Oh...it then pulled up and started to fly over head.  NO SOUND!   It looked like the red light on it was panning left to right, the whole thing moved left and right, NO BLINKING, just panning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran for my binoculars in the car, and still all I could see was bright light.  Then it faded into the distance…<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked about it for HOURS trying to figure it out! Was hoping to find someone else who saw this too...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

If I had thought to check this site then, I would have reported sooner. UFO&#39;s aren&#39;t my thing but this was darned odd. I am a technology professional. I don&#39;t have time for UFO&#39;s and little green men.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 45 minutes before fireworks were due to begin, my wife, my two kids and I were out in the front yard playing and waiting for darkness to fall so we could watch the fireworks our town puts on every year. Our yard has a spacious view of the skies to the north and west. As my infant son played in the bed of my pickup truck, I was intrigued when I noticed a single, bright ball of light moving very slowly southward from the distance in the northern sky. It took several minutes for the light to reach our position but slightly west of us. As it came closer, it almost seemed as if it was made of fire, like a campfire moving through sky?! Since there were no clouds, I was unable to determine any kind of altitude. As I watched it continue to move southward, it seemed to slowly fade out and disappear completely. I could see the lights and vapor trails of airplanes higher up but not this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As fascinating as that object was, I was completely astounded when I witnessed five more objects, traveling nearly the same trajectory, one by one in succession, cross the evening sky in the same general direction, that is, north to south. The last object traveled out of the north, moving directly south and ended up to the east of our position. They all took approximately 5 to 7 minutes to traverse the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that these were some kind of rocket tests as we are near Crane Naval Weapons Station. But I never found any news articles stating that there would be tests. I eliminated the possibility of chinese lanterns simply because of their trajectory. I didn&#39;t have a video capture device at the time so I was unable to get footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One idea I had was to look back and see what the wind patterns were on that night, but I am unable to find any data on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this information is helpful to someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was betting dusky but still quite light and the sky was overcast.  I am not certain what the visible ceiling was but below the cloud layer I noticed a bright light almost directly over my head.  I do not think that the light was very high as the clouds seemed quite low in the sky but I cannot speak to their elevation.   My wife also noted the light and asked me what it was.  I commented that it must be a firework perhaps on a parachute.  There was no noise at all so I  doubted it was a helicopter or airplane given the light could not be too high given the low-lying clouds.  It was moving towards the west slowly on a straight line.  My wife lost interest in the light but I continued to watch it expecting it to descend as I presumed it was a firework on a chute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the light did not ap! pear to be a spotlight as it shimmered as if it was burning.  Once again, no sound of an engine was audible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I glanced off to the south and discovered another light parallel to the first as far as I could determine.  It appeared to be a match to the one I had first noticed immediately overhead.  Both lights continued on their westward path until they disappeared beyond the treeline.  I was able to observe them for more than 5 minutes and there was no sign they ever descended.  Thus I cannot believe they were fireworks and there were no running lights beyond the single burning ball of light makes me doubt they were aircraft.  As I really would like to see an UFO of extraterrestial origin, I am thus intentionally skeptical but my recollections are as dispassionate and accurate as I can make them.<n>

I was standing with a friend talking when he looked up and saw a round, white light drifing slowly from southeast to northwest.  It was difficult to determine exactly how high in the sky the light was.  If I had to guess, I&#39;d say if it were a 50 foot wide circle then it would be about 4,000 feet high in the sky, probably less than a mile but I&#39;m not trained in this type of analysis so that&#39;s just a guess.  It appeared to be perfectly round and reminded me of a bright white heat lamp bulb shining down toward the ground so that all that was visible was the photons from the light, nothing else.  But as it drifted away (silently) I thought I saw (but can&#39;t be sure) a bit of darkness at the top of the light as if something solid was coming into view as the angle of view changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I discussed the possiblity of UFO&#39;s and we decided that it wasn&#39;t anything we could think of that was manmade.  It wasn&#39;t just reflection from the setting sun as it was definitely a light shining downward.  I see commercial jets fly over all the time at dusk and can easily recognize them as such.  I was an airman in the USAF from 1973 to 1976.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were out by Central Park just around sunset when suddenly a plethora of what sounded like explosions started sounding off.  I looked up to the sky in search of the source of this screeching sound and I saw a series of strange somethings.  They looked like odd lights that went upward towards the sky and then made the most godawful racket and then a shower of lights!  My friends and I retreated via the lift to our flats where we all most urgently had to use the loo out of stark terror!  We thought we were going to be abducted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The worst part is that it went on and on, these lights and bangs. When I looked out of my window I saw the fire department there in the park as well. Trying to get control of the situation and cover it up, I assume! That no good government of ours!

It was there for just a few seconds, moved unnaturally fast and then completely vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was not a cloud in the sky, and it was high above the treeline so it wasn&#39;t hidden by anything - it just completely disappeared.<n>

7/4/11 09:30|Natick|MA|Fireball|2|I thought it was a plane on fire headed towards Logan Airport...|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85105.html|620|ndxe201107| I thought it was a plane on fire headed towards Logan Airport...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing at my grill cooking as it was 4th of July (Independence day), chatting to two friends. My neighbor was walking his dog up the street.  He was really freaked out and exclaimed &#34;Excuse me, but am I seeing things or is that an airplane on fire?&#34;  We all looked up and there was this giant ball of fire moving across the sky. My heart just sank because it most certainly looked like an airplane on fire.  A raging fire really... and had a really strange orange glow to the flickering fire.  I was scared, all I could think of was horrible things happening aboard the plane.  It was moving at the speed of an airplane so it definitely was not a meteor or firework.  It was moving across in a mostly straight line but wobbling slightly, headed toward Logan Airport in Boston.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By observing I got the &#34;vibe&#34; that it was obviously not normal.  Excited and frightened, I checked the news that night the next morning and the next few days but there was no report of an airplane fire or crash, etc.  This is not the first time I&#39;ve seen a sighting here but it was certainly the most creepy.<n>

As night fell we went to the back yard to watch fire works.  As my friend went in side the house I notice a red bright light out side coming toward us flying over head.  I yelled at my friend to hurry bring out the camera there is a freaking UFO fly over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As he grabbed his camera, he caught the tail end of the UFO on tape.  I turned left witch is north east toward Los Angeles is where the UFO was coming from a second UFO came into view.  He filmed this and got a real good shot of it.  You can really see the shape of the craft saucer shape.  On the video it looks bright orange or red but in person I could see other colors like green radiating from it.  I would like to post it but we don&#39;t have the cable to the camera.  On the video the craft looks like the middle is separated as if it had windows where they can look out.  The craft made no noise and it appeared to fly slow and smooth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called Chino police is where we live in California, to see if anyone else has reported the sighting and they said no.  As soon as I get the cable to the camera, I will download it and post it here and Coast to Coast.  The video is very clear witch I believe to be one of the best UFO videos ever filmed.<n>

If you looked north north-east, there was an object that had lights going kind of around it.  It wasn&#39;t a plane because it didn&#39;t travel fast enough.  And it&#39;s not a satellite because it moved too much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to have a reddish kind of light going around the outside of a blueish light.  It&#39;s really hard to describe!  We actually called the police department and all the commotion woke up my mom.  We are all pretty rational and we also believe in paranormal type things.  But this is the first time we have ever felt the need to actually report something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please get back to me if possible!  Thanks!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Not the ISS.

We had just dropped off a patient on the rooftop helipad of a hospital three miles east of downtown Cleveland and were preparing to depart for base when all three of us witnessed a &#34;fireball like&#34; object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1:50 AM, July 4th, 201, I was preparing for engine start when I observed this fireball like circular object flying from east to west just north of our position.  It appeared closest when I first saw it.  This is an area of intense air traffic so it took a second look to determine it did not look like an airplane.  At this particular time of morning there were no other aircraft seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately jumped out of the cockpit and went back to the crew loading our equipment and told them check this out.  All three of us watched the object fly over the shoreline at approximately 3000 to 4000 ft.  Maybe a speed of 150kts at least.  We tried to determine if it was an airliner as this is the same area they fly on their approach to Cleveland Hopkins airport.  However there were no position lights and no strobes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not see any structure except for the roundness and color.  It was a yellow golden sphere with red on the sides (See drawing).  The bright red seemed to have the characteristic of fire or vertical flames but was not flames.  It was not underneath only on the sides with a little on the top.  It was like red electrical fire.  It did not look like jet propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not an artist but I did attempt to draw what I saw and that is included here.  I would estimate a fairly good sized object, at least 10-20 feet across.  It flew east to west over the shoreline.  As it approached downtown proper it turned northwest and departed out over the lake at a constant altitude and airspeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two excellent reports from this source.

We agreed to get them at the bus terminal.  They were due in at 00:10 hrs.  from Chicago, and although we left Red Wing, MN, a little late, we were sure to get them by 00:20 hrs on the morning of the 4th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving northbound on U.S. 52, we approached the city of Saint Paul.  In the South Saint Paul area, I noticed orange globes above the sodium street lights (also orange) while driving the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked again, because the orange globes were of a more saturated and slightly darker orange than the street lights and above them. We both stared out the side windows to see six globes in total. They were arranged in two groups of three each, forming identical isosceles triangles.  They hovered about 200 feet off the ground slightly west of U.S 52 and about 3 miles ESE of the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport.We checked the time and it was 24:00 hrs (12:00 midnight.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not make out a fuselage, but my gal saw a non-orange light come out of the center of area of one, then move away.  The two craft hung motionless, one parallel to the ground and one with the apex tipped downward.  They gave the amusing appearance of two fish in a fish-tank, hovering at odd juxtaposition to each other.  The craft were roughly estimated to be 100&#39; on the short side and 140&#39; on the long sides and were identical in size.  The orange globes were set at the most peripheral points of the craft and were estimated 10&#39; in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not move, they did not make any sound that we could hear, and the fuselage did not become directly visible to us.  Any hull color would have been flat black, or otherwise not visible in the dark of night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed the two craft for about 5 minutes before driving out of sight of them.

7/3/11 23:55|West Lafayette|IN|Fireball|1-2 min|Orange-amber fireball observed, passing above clouds|7/4/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82115.html|629|ndxe201107| Orange-amber fireball observed, passing above clouds<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking out of a university building and was talking on the phone.  I then saw an almost steady bright orange-amber ball in the sky, like a fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first suspected a still incandescent remnant of a firework of some type.  It was not falling in a parabolic manner though, but was traveling linearly instead.  I was hearing sparse firecracking so I naturally suspected firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then appeared much higher than expected for a firework and seemed to last unusually long.  I dismissed the possibility of a plane as no blinking lights were seen.  The ball was steadily traveling linearly, like a meteor, but a little slower.  It was like traveling across the sky from a north-east to full west direction and seemed to pick up speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only as I saw it approaching a cloud that I realized the cloud looked to be beneath it?!?  The light was covered by the cloud.  I could still see a orange light through it.  It seemed at this point to follow a slow rotation, the light started fading a little.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was not hazy and only a few trails of clouds were scattered in the sky.  Could it have been a (new type) of fireworks?  The fact it passed over the cloud made me doubt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then had the surely exaggerated thought of a plane possibly on fire. It continued its course until it went full west then behind a building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I took my car i then saw it (or maybe rather another one) again up in the sky in the west direction in the horizon.  It was glowing amber, seemed to stand still and slowing faded as it slowly moved further in the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Firecracking and fireworks rare noises were much closer to me than was this light which seemed to be much further away.  I suspected a new type of fireworks but having seen recently meteor, (not a meteorite nor shooting star), crossing the entire sky near this place this spring, it looked more like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A fireball traveling linearly from north north-east to west and above the clouds as it went close to it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suspect the ridiculousness of the situation for something that might just be a so-called &#34;Chinese lantern&#34; you most recently mentioned and that I never saw.  I, at first, just got appalled by the recent postings on your site as I came to check it, out of curiosity (and for the first time).<n>

It grew brighter, and faded, then grew brighter again before fading out completely as if it went to high for us to see it, but it seemed like it was going in a very large arch almost. Saw it for about a minute. It wasn&#39;t blinking, and very red, but had a white light sorta around it.  Was NOT a firework, nor a plane or anything like that, and lasted far too long to be a firework. Anyone else see this? What could it be? Also, we were near Covenant Hospital. It was high enough, probably the whole town could have seen it if they were looking. It looked like fire, or a missile, sorta. We tried to take a picture but we only had a camera phone and it didn&#39;t show up.<n>

Couldn&#39;t get the shape of it because of the distance, but he color was bright. It didn&#39;t appear to be an aircraft because there was a plane flying around the area from O’Hare airport, you can see the difference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was running a steady fast stream for about 2-3 min. It was long enough to talk about it and compare it to the Aircraft.  Then just like an amber fade it was gone in mid-Air.  I know there were Fireworks that night and know it wasn&#39;t that I was seeing because I was at the Fireworks of Crystal Lake earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the light was way too distanced to be a firework.

7/3/11 22:10|Bradenton Beach|FL|Other|45 mins.|Bright white trapezoidal objects viewed ascending into clouds over Gulf of Mexico off of Anna Maria Island|7/17/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82492.html|644|ndxe201107| Bright white trapezoidal objects viewed ascending into clouds over Gulf of Mexico off of Anna Maria Island<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of July 3rd, 2011, between the hours of 22:00 and 23:00 Eastern Standard Time, a group of us witnessed a very unusual sighting off of Anna Maria Island, on the west coast of Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After fireworks had been launched off the pier around 17:00, there were six of us in a group hanging out on the second floor walkway of our condominium which looks out over the beach and Gulf of Mexico.  There were also two men who were renting a condominium on the first floor who were also outdoors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime after 22:00, we saw two or three objects take off south of Anna Maria Island, going from east to west, and rising into the sky at a climb rate similar to a small airplane, i.e., approximately 15 to 20 degree incline and moving around 100 to 130 knots.  The interesting thing about the objects was that they had no navigation lights (no red or green wingtip lights or navigational beacons), but instead emitted a steady glow that I would describe as either white, or white with some golden color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were trapezoidal in shape, with the top sides being longer than the bottom sides, and looked to be about the size of the full moon when they were at their closest point.  They glowed steadily, and moved at what appeared to be a constant rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the people in the group used to be a pilot, and mentioned that there is a website where you can track aircraft movements.  I remembered that flightaware.com does just that, so I proceeded to look at aircraft movements out of the Sarasota/Bradenton airport for that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last flight had taken off at approximately 8:15 PM, at least two hours before this sighting, and I distinctly remember the aircraft flying overhead, as it was a Boeing 717.  No further flights were recorded after that time, which would indicate to me that the objects were definitely not aircraft coming from that airport, which is the only nearby airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we observed the first group of objects in the sky! , I yelled out &#34;what the heck is that?&#34;   At that point the two gentlemen that were down below immediately ran upstairs, and said that they saw the exact same thing that we saw.  We discussed what we had seen for approximately 10 min., and then sign another group of objects following the exact same path as the previous objects appeared.  I watched as they climbed to the cloud base, and disappeared into the clouds, just as the previous ones had. I assumed that the objects were very close, within a couple of miles or so, because the base of the cloud looked very low and hung just offshore, as there were thunderstorms in the area within the hour .<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the gentlemen also said that he believed the objects had to be very low, as he saw their reflection in the water.  The objects emitted no detectable noise whatsoever, which was one of the features that were so unusual about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the sighting of the second group of objects, I ran into the condo and got my binoculars.  Although I was only able to lock onto one for about a second and a half, there appeared to be a very distinct thin line surrounding the trapezoid, but not touching it, in the shape of a hot-air balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately handed the binoculars to one of the other gentlemen from downstairs, so that he could see with his own eyes what I was seeing.  He stated that he saw the exact same thing I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would normally speculate that the objects were some kind of luminaries, but the fact that the flame or light was fully contained within a trapezoidal shape, along with the speed at which the objects were traveling, makes me believe that there&#39;s no such possibility that they were luminaries.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am at a loss to explain what we saw, but I’m assuming that hundreds of people had to have seen the same thing, as it was a weekend and people had recently been outdoors just a few hours ago to watch the fireworks, and so surely many would have lingered on the beach, or outside on balconies as we had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found no writings in the newspaper about the strange lights, and have no clues as to what could be their source.<n>

It was a beautiful, clear sky filled with stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds after looking up I saw a very bright object moving from north to south.  It was moving steady and as it passed overhead, it appeared to have a triangular shape.  There appeared to be two, bright lights shining side by side and there were no other lights.  Lights were steady with no blinking.   There was no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved at a steady clip but there was no way to know how high it was.  Of course, the higher it was would have meant a very large object.  At arm&#39;s length it appeared to be about 1/2 the size of my little fingernail.  The entire sighting lasted maybe 15 to 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it reached about 40 degs. above the Southern horizon the lights just went out.  I could still see a very faint object of the same size but it quickly moved off and disappeared.  I found out when I came in that my wife, who was in the backyard walking the dog, saw it also but thought it was a plane.  I was in the Air Force for 4 years and never saw anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness observed an over-flight of the International Space Station.

The time was approximately 10 PM and we were watching the skies for local fireworks.  We were traveling West bound on Rt. 22, just past the Airport Rd exit when I noticed this unusual light low in the sky.  It was red in color, appeared to be still, and was not blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the airport close by, I thought at first it may be an incoming craft on approach.  As we approached the Lehigh Valley Mall though, we could see this was not the case.  The light was actually hovering low in the sky to the left of us on 22.  For reference, it was almost directly across from the Lehigh Valley Mall on the other side of 22.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we took the MacArthur Rd exit we had actually past the light and we could no longer see it to our left.  We could then conclude it was indeed hovering (or stationary) and that it was close to our proximity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curious with what we had both seen, I drove into the Lehigh Valley Mall area and parked in the Southern area of the complex between Bravo and Macy’s.  The red light was still there and hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being dark out we couldn’t make out any kind of distinct shape, but the light was very solid with no blinking or haze.  It hovered for about 2 more minutes and then slowly moved northward towards our position at the mall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After just a few seconds of moving North towards us, the light shot virtually straight up into the atmosphere until it was no longer visible.  Although it was partially cloudy that night due to thunderstorms, we could reference a few stars in the sky where it ascended.  Therefore, we knew we hadn’t lost the light in the thick of possible clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way this light hovered and then shot into the atmosphere with such speed was beyond explanation.  I’ve watched the shuttle take off and reach altitudes till it could no longer be seen, but this light/object did it 10-15 times faster.  It was re! markable and something we never will forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I’d share this experience in the hope that others may confirm what we had seen or could perhaps supply a viable explanation of these events.<n>

We were on a bluff overlooking Lake Roosevelt.  We were taking turns looking at Saturn and I heard my niece gasp, &#34;What are those?&#34;   She was looking over my shoulder in the opposite direction from Saturn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Turning around we saw three very bright red-orange balls (lights?)  in the sky.  They were some distance apart, did not look connected, and appeared to be moving slowly.  They did not look like they were very high in the sky.  They seemed to be directly above where the Spokane River empties into Lake Roosevelt.   We watched them move towards us for about 30 seconds, and then my niece’s husband began to turn the telescope towards them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before he could get  them in the telescope’s sights, they winked out.  One at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking they must be some type of aircraft (military?) that if continuing on their course would pass overhead, we watched the sky.  Nothing passed between us and the bright stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to forget about it (after some teasing by the rest of the family), until I looked at your website and saw similar sightings in Washington State around the same time.<n>

The object appeared as a yellowish redish light and once appeared just stayed in position for 10-15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People starting commenting on the strange light drawing more attention to it.  The object neither got closer or further away it just stayed there on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had roughly 10 people in our group, but there where well over 100 people there to watch the fireworks (I didn&#39;t ask everyone, but I assume most saw the strange object)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We where there together sitting on the beach facing South West, the object was roughly 35-45 degree&#39;s in the air and was about half the size of a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A full range of thoughts and emotions began through the group questioning the origin and exact nature of the object when the fireworks started.  I would turn my head and watch the fireworks, then turn and look at the fireball (I was half afraid that it was a comet heading straight to my location).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would watch fireworks, then glance back and forth then, the next time I look, the object had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded and credible.

There were 3 of them spaced evenly apart and they followed the same horizontal path across the lake but never fell.  (They were about 30 seconds apart.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then moved to the south side of the lake to a parking lot to watch the rest.  Again 3 more of these orange objects moved across the sky at the same height, following what looked to be the same path as the first 3 we saw, spaced evenly apart, but this time about 10 seconds apart.  Now they were west of where we were standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later there were 2 more, again about 10 seconds apart, following the same horizontal path as the other ones did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought they could be small airplanes or helicopters because of the height at which they were moving, but the more we watched we were convinced they weren’t because they had only an orange glow that in no way flashed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the noise from the fireworks we could not tell if these objects were making any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have never seen anything like this before.  A few other people, who came near the end, saw the last ones and also wondered what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is the manager of an office beverage service and I am an elementary school teacher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else saw something in central to northeast WI on July 3, please share with us.<n>

We bowled a few games and hung out for about an hour and a half.  It was getting near closing time so we decided to head home.  We live in Winlock, Wa so we had to get on I-5 South.  Within a minute and a half of getting on the freeway, there were fireworks blowing off all along the highway and I was telling the kids to check it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were driving along, there were a ton of fireworks going off to our left.  My wife and I were watching out the window when we saw it.  I’m not sure which one of us noticed it first, but my wife and I, as well as the kids all became very aware of what we were seeing.  There was an object, amber in color, almost red that was shaped similar to a lantern, hovering above where the fireworks were going off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caught my attention was the size of it.  At first, I thought it was a firework about to go off and I thought in my head, this is going to be a really cool one.  Suddenly my wife says, &#34;Do you see that?&#34; and pointed at the object.  It was literally hovering in the sky, when all of the sudden it shoots over the trees in an extremely quick motion.  It looked like a giant glowing lantern.  We slowed down to almost 25 mph on the freeway and were watching this thing for a good minute.   As soon as it got out of site, we sped to the nearest exit and turned around to go back and see it.  My wife had our camera out at this point too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got back on the freeway, we could see the object crossing the highway at what appeared to be no more than five hundred feet in the sky.  It made it’s way to the opposite side of the freeway and then moved very fast toward the hills before it was out of site.  We tried to follow it, but it was too fast and our kids were becoming very scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen a lot of aircraft, but nothing like this before.  It had no conventional shape.  It hovered for at least fifteen seconds and the moved horizontally across the sky.  When we regained view of it, it was much too fast to keep up with.<n>

They glowed for about 8-10 minutes then each slowly faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that evening, at approx. 10:30 pm, there were 2 more of the same exact lights that were seen away from where the lights were first seen.  Those two lights, faded at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC also received a number of telephoned reports from Chicago, for the evenig of July 3rd.

My daughter and I were looking in the sky for fireworks the locals were setting off early.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed an orange&#39;ish light far away in the sky, just being able to be seen above the trees in front of us.  We observed this orange light coming in our direction.  At first it appeared to maybe be a helicopter.  But upon watching more of this, it stopped and seemed to be motionless for about a minute or so, then faded away back into the dark sky.  Again, a few minutes later, this same object appeared again and brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately took pictures with my iphone and filmed a video (this is all I had on me and the quality is not that good).  Four of us observed this and questioned what this is.  Again, the light slow changed directions and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say that this was not a helicopter because I live near the local hospital and witness helicopters takeoff and land all the time.  Since last weekend, I have seen some military helicopter flying around the area but I am not sure if this is just a routine procedure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I have witnessed UFO activity this year.  Again, almost 2 months ago in Warfordsburg, PA, I had 2 witnesses with me at the end of my shift at work and we witnessed lights moving in and out of the tree line, changing directions and changing colors..  Then slowing flying away like normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My coworker became freaked out but I was excited since I have been hoping to see ufo activity for years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This same phenomenon occurred several times before the night sky became quiet.

My daughter and I were looking in the sky for fireworks the locals were setting off early.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:24 PM, we noticed an orange&#39;ish light far away in the sky, just being able to be seen above the trees in front of us.  This would have been witness in the East direction, which we viewed in the direction of the football stadium.  It appeared red&#39;ish then seemed to be more of an orange color as it became more visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed this orange light coming in our direction but still high in the sky and far away.  At first it appeared to maybe be a helicopter.  But as we watched this object, it seemed to stop in mid air and get extremely bright, then it went back into the distant darkness of the sky and faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, a few minutes later at 9:30 PM, this same object appeared again and brighter!  This object was in the same vicinity of the last appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our family stood there and watched to see what this object was going to do.  I am sure most of the town witnessed this because everyone was waiting for the local firework display to begin (which did so almost an hour later).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately took pictures with my iphone and filmed a video (this is all I had on me and the quality is not that good).  Four of us observed this (2 more were on the porch) and questioned what this is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, the light slow changed directions and disappeared into the far distance of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say that this was not a helicopter because I live near the local hospital and witness helicopters take off and land all the time.  I am also ruling out that this was a latern or flare in the sky due to the fact that this object was in almost the same exact location both times and did not seem to be affected by the wind patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object used a steady movement to glide across the sky in th! e direction it traveled before coming to an immediate stop..  I have never seen anything on a balloon stop and pause in the air for over a minute before moving again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This also could not have been a firework display since it did not come from the surface and travel into the sky as a firework does... this thing came out of the sky at a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since last weekend, I have seen some military helicopters flying around the area but I am guessing this is just a routine thing around here, as I have seen military helicopters at the Johnstown and Ebensburg airports practice maneuvers in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just thought this should be documented.<n>

At approximately 21:15 EST my daughter asked if we could see the red lights behind the treeline.  The sky was not completely dark at this time.  We began to observe to the direct northern sky, two red, sphere like objects that seemed to be moving to the northeast.  At the time they were fairly large, similar to a silver dollar if held up to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they passed the treeline there was a third identical object that began to catch up to them.  These three objects continued to the northeast and just disappeared into the distance.  While the first three objects began to disappear two more were seen coming from the west.  They were intense red in color and identical to the initial sighting.   They continued along the same path as if they were following the first three objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time the last two objects were heading northeast, we could see a plane that was in the sky which appeared to be lower than the objects we were observing.  We walked further down the street to get a better view.  By this time the neighbors began to come out into the street to observe these strange lights.  The final two lights appeared to stop in the distance and then just disappear. We have seen the chinese lamps before and these did not look anything like those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, daughter and her boyfriend all observed these lights together.  We are a normal family that has not seen anything like this before.  I am an IT System Administrator; my wife is going to school to be a psychologist and our daughter is 15 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness and he seemed to us to be quite credible.

As they reached the clearing a third one caught up to them and they continued on into the tree line.  Two more where coming up into the clearing behind the three that had disappeared.  They lingered in the clearing about a min to two mins where they either began to fade or fly away and then they disappeared right before our eyes.  As they were starting to get smaller a commercial jet flew a little beneath them.  There were many people gathered in the streets watching all of this occur.  To begin with the ones we first witness were approx half the size of a full moon... as they traveled they became smaller.<n>

At this point in time it was still light out.  One member of the party noticed a strange lit up object moving across the sky from a Southwest direction.  As the object passed overhead the party discussed whether or not it was a familiar aircraft.  No wings could be seen and the craft had a constant, strong light in which we noticed slight flickering as it passed overhead in a beeline headed North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially this was dismissed, however less than a minute later a formation of 12-15 circular craft appeared above the horizon where the first craft was seen.  The craft were &#34;stacked&#34; in a vertical formation in two columns so as to appear in a zig-zag.  As one party member ran to fetch binoculars the other two witnesses watched the objects go overhead, following the first craft.  Some of the objects had lights and others did not.  When viewed through binoculars, the objects appeared to change shape slightly from what one observer referred to as a &#34;smart-car&#34; (in profile) shape to a sphere.  About a minute after this event, a final craft appeared and headed in a Northwest direction as if anticipating where the previous craft were headed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the craft were silent and moving quickly across the field of view.  The first craft appeared smaller (as if it had the greater altitude) and the rest were about 1/3 to 1/4 the size (in height) of a visible sliver moon.  After the stars came out it was plain to see they (the craft) were significantly larger than any stars or planets visible.  One observer noted that they must be quite large if we could see them so distinctly from our distance.  It was hard to determine color as they appeared dark against the light sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also unusual was that no one could recall seeing them appear or disappear, just that they were suddenly there and just as suddenly gone.  One observer said they must have disappeared into the clouds, however no clouds were present.<n>

I saw what I thought was a plane approaching from the east.  I thought I saw a flashing light but realized quickly the whole light was glowing brighter and it was sure not a flashing light like on a little plane... like I am used to seeing. (I am in the pathway of midway airport so very familiar with smaller as well as commercial planes going by.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside, dumped my purse, grabbed my camera and managed to take a shaky video.  I was trying to watch it while taking the video.  I did pretty good I thought, I got something.  All I could make out was that it was a bright white to yellow light that pulsed brighter every few seconds and the edges were more orange or red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a plane.  There was no sound. it seemed to almost drift by and I would have to guess on the height and size because it was getting dark... but a wild estimation I would say it could have been as small as a beach ball or as large as a car, height was higher than the lowest planes I&#39;ve seen go by, but not very high.  Well the coolest thing happened within a minute!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ANOTHER one came over my yard and followed if not the same exact pathway, pretty darn close to it.  They both came from the east, went over my yard at a slight southwest angle and then I lost sight of them as they went over the trees.  That helps me determine height because if much higher I would have been able to see them further.  Both glowing lights lasted about a minute from the moment I saw them to the moment I lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sending my videos taken 2 minutes apart!  Side note:  I did see the Tinley Park Red Ufo lights back about 6 or 7 years ago when thousands of people saw them forming a triangular pattern... so this is the second time I have seen curious lights in the area.<n>

I saw an object that was out of the ordinary. The first thing i thought of was a hot air ballon but it was too low for a landing because of all the power lines and buildings in the area. Note there was a dead wind on the ground. I would estimate the object was about 300 feet off the ground. Let me add that i have spent my whole life at airports. I am a pilot and a regular skydiver with over 600 jumps. With that said i am trained to know distances of objects and wind conditions. This was no hot air ballon because there was not a basket underneath. I would also know this because i have many ballon flights as well. The object was flying at about 35 to 40 mph. The object was orbiting in a clock wise rotation from ground view. I would say that the object was turning at 10 rpm. The color of the object was a light rustic brown. I could! tell the object was rotating because there were three indentations on the bottom half, much like a golf ball would have. The object was about 30 meters in diameter. The object maintained heading until out of site. The object was silent. This object was nothing i have ever seen and let me say that in all my years in aeronautics it baffled me. I dont know what else to say i just want answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we were watching the storm, we noticed a spherical object just underneath the fast-moving clouds.  The object was a brown or plum color, non-reflective, and remained perfectly still despite the very high winds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparent size was about a fingernail at arm’s length and perhaps 30 degrees elevation.  Hard to judge the distance, my best guess would be about 200 yards apparently over a road that distance away.  That would put the size at less than 10 feet in diameter??  Though just under a very fast moving low cloud, the object was stationary and remained there until the clouds passed over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above.

Three rapid pulses of white (may have been the sun reflecting rather than an actual light) then a pause, during which the object was dark but still visible, then the pulsing would begin again.  The pulsing was consistant for the duration of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Too high to notice a distinct outline or shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it stopped for a moment, then continued in the the same north to south direction as before, but slower this time, stopped again, then proceeded east. I know what aircraft look like at ANY altitude, this was NOT an aircraft. (Nor fireworks, or a balloon)<n>

7/3/11 03:00|Charlotte|NC|Light|3 or 4 minutes|A couple dozen orange lights traveling against the wind.  ((NUFORC Note:  Very reliable and convincing  witness.  PD))|7/4/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82097.html|693|ndxe201107| A couple dozen orange lights traveling against the wind<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 3 am Eastern time I happened to notice 3 orange circular lights traveling North by Northwest.  I was looking South when I saw them and the speed and trajectory they were traveling was consistent with a commercial jet.  These lights were not blinking or fading and they were roughly 4 or 5 times the size and brightness as the largest visible planet.  They were close to being in a straight line, made no noise whatsoever, and left no trail.  Had they left a trail, I would have guessed they were meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was with 2 friends who also saw the objects and thought them to be odd enough to quickly call their wives outside to check them out before they disappeared over the horizon.  It was then that one of the wives exclaimed there were more coming, and sure enough 3 or 4 more appeared from behind the treeline and followed the same path at the same speed.  More kept coming in random intervals for the next couple minutes, sometimes only 2 at a time, sometimes up to 5.  There were no patterns I could discern except for a couple groups seemingly forming a perfect triangle.  There were about a couple dozen total over the course of 3 or 4 minutes.  We managed to get videos on cell phone cameras, but they are what you would expect from filming with such a device against a dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were amazed and baffled to the point that we called 911.  While we admitted to the officer who came out that we felt a little silly calling and that we had been drinking all night, we felt a burning need to let authorities know what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked wind direction for that time frame, and it was blowing South at 5 mph which pretty much discounts the possibility of chinese lanterns or flares.  I have absolutely no clue what these things could have been, and I feel very fortunate that I had friends with me to witness this.  We are all in our 30s and have careers in retail, insurance and teaching.  I am sharing this experience in the hopes that someone else saw these and can possibly explain what they were.  The random formations discount (to me) the possiblility of military aircraft, the wind direction rules out lanterns or flares, it was a clear night so they weren&#39;t reflections, and no trails tell me they weren&#39;t meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Absolutely unexplainable, and the quantity made it somewhat of a scary experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a brief time I wasn&#39;t sure if they would stop coming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness.  We found him to be exceptionally objective about the sighting, and he seemed to us to be quite eloquent and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD))<n>

I could make out three lights in what i would say were in a formation with the center light blinking rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was obvious to me that these lights did not originate from any aircraft known to me i automatically called 911 and was told there were other confirmed reports of these lights as well as my own report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been a month now and i have experienced lapses in time between the hours of 3 am onward and after a few strange dreams i woke up with a numbness in my right hand.  This IS NOT an attempt to hoax.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very frightened to have discovered an object about a half centimeter underneath the skin of my right thumb (second knuckle) and i have no recollection of having ever noticed it before.  I dont know what to make of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am going to go to a hospital to arrange for it to be removed.  The object is dark and from what i can see about the size of an apple seed.   I can see it because of its dark color and closeness to the surface of my skin but it is an object that I can feel by pushing down on the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know what this is but it was never there before all of these strange incidents began to occur.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not seen the lights since my last report<n>

In the southern sky I saw what at first I thought was an oncoming plane with bright reddish light.  The light was not completely steady but not blinking either. It seemed to be radiating like a twinkling star but much brighter. It was a very luminescent light with a definite shade of red. I think it was at least as bright as the planet Venus as it appears in the summer sky. It got a little brighter as it got closer.  I estimate the altitude to be 1000 to 2000 feet but that is hard to tell without knowing it&#39;s size and it&#39;s distance from me.  It was moving from south to north northwest.  The object was moving steadily but I&#39;d have to estimate the speed because it depends on it&#39;s altitude and size to be accurate.  The object seemed to change direction and turn straight west.  As it did it&#39;s luminescence grew fainter and fainter  as it kept going west.  It was fading from sight and it&#39;s view was going  to be blocked by the treeline west of my house so I began to step up onto my deck bench.  I had no lights on so I looked down a few seconds to be sure footed as I stepped onto the bench.  Now on the bench I looked back up and now to the south and I saw three more lights exactly like the first one and they were on the original course as the first object when I first sighted it, seemingly coming from the south going to north northwest.  They were in a line one behind the other and evenly apart.  Then one after the other they all turned west and followed the first objects course and as they did they too began to grow faint.  I tracked them until they faded. I got the impression they were gaining altitude slightly as they proceeded west, but I&#39;m not positive. The estimated speed is hard not knowing their distance from me.  There was no real point of reference. If they were 1 mile from me and at 1000 feet they were possibly a meter in size and traveling at around 50 mph. If they were ! 5 miles from me and at 5000 feet they were much bigger and goi! ng much faster. There was no sound coming from the objects. I did see a couple of flashes like a heat lightning not near the object but more to the west. There were sounds of explosions like fireworks in the distance, it is close to the 4th of July and the local yahoo&#39;s are blowing them off even at this hour. There appeared to be some clouds to the south and southwest of me and definitely more distant than the ufo&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the objects faded out of sight I then checked the radar online and saw there was cloud cover at the time of my sighting approximately 10 miles to my south. So logically these objects were less than ten miles from me. There was some pretty severe storm activity to the south at the time of my sighting but at it&#39;s closest it was just south of Kankakee, IL approximately 40 miles south. There was sporadic but small rainclouds (according to the weather.com radar maps) in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what these objects were. I tried to come up with reasonable explanations. They were not like any kind of fireworks display I&#39;d ever seen and I&#39;m well past 50 and seen quite a few . I don&#39;t know if the sound of the fireworks and or the distant storms were coincidental or related. I tried to reason that they might be flares suspended under a string of helium balloons somehow tied together to remain in a straight line. But the last three appeared so suddenly and how would they be ignited? I&#39;ve seen many aerial fireworks displays. This didn&#39;t seem to fit. I&#39;m almost positive the wind was blowing in the opposite direction too. How to make balloons travel single file and turn uniformly following an exact path that the first like object took sounds like an improbable task. I&#39;ve seen my share of meteors. I&#39;ve seen the really fast small streaky kind and the slower fiery kind. These were not even close. They were much slower than a meteor and held a course, held a pattern! and then changed course in pattern. They were objects for sure, I cannot identify them and they were flying. I hope there were others who reported this. I was going to call the police but I wasn&#39;t sure what they&#39;d do or say, so I did a search on who to report sightings to and found your site. I was just going to forget about it and go to bed, but someone has to at least know about what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a professional musician.  I am well over 50. I am a reasonably logical person.  I do not take drugs. I only drink occasionally and then only one or two.  I am not given to flights of fancy.  I do not hallucinate.  I have a very credible and reliable reputation both professionally and personally.  I do not frequent any ufo websites or follow anything related as a hobby or as a way of life, I am too busy with my everyday business.  In other words I&#39;m not a big ufo fan or anything I&#39;m just an  everyday Joe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight I finished my job and drove the 40 minute drive home and just after I got home, and opened up the sliding door I spotted these objects.  I never saw anything like these before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my long life I&#39;ve seen a couple of things in the sky that I still can&#39;t explain.  I told a few friends or family and I was not the only witness on those occasions.  They were never reported just tucked away.<n>

There was no sound what so ever and it was faster and lower than a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were banging on the window for my mother and sister to come out.  By the time they ran out it just disappeared into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a few minutes later over the same trees I saw the orange light again, this time both my parents, my sister and I saw it.  It followed the exact same pattern, distance, and height as the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed out for about a half hour waiting and looking and there were no other sightings.<n>

We were sitting on my outside deck visiting when 2 bright orange lights rose up above the tree line.  We were looking toward the SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Without knowing for sure the objects sizes I am not sure of the taking off point or altitude at hover.  My best guess is that they were 3 meters or so in circumference which from my estimation could have placed them in the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, they rose to maybe 500 to a 1000 feet  and hovered.  Then one of the object took a path away from us toward the SE while the other took a NW path over our heads.  The object was very visible while it went over head and what had appeared only bright and orange took more of a stubby cylinder shape with rotating red lights on the bottom of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to film it with my wife’s phone but we where not successful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it continued its path we were briefly obstructed by a tree but then again spotted the object on its same coarse.  The object then accelerated out of sight in less than a second.  This entire encounter lasted about 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had just started talking about how we did not believe what we just saw when another single object rose up from the same point as the other two objects and took the same path to the NW over our heads again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been curious about the unknown but now I am a believer.  What my family and I witnessed was not from this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love some more information on any similar objects people have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh I almost forgot,  these objects had absolutely no sound.  Wow this was just incredible.  We had also just discovered a strange out break of Blue Green Algae at the lake.  The GRDA almost shut the lake down because of it.  Not sure there is any connection but it is weird and it has not happened previously.<n>

As we were heading back to the dock, we both saw a red-orange ball of light out of the south sky.  We see lights from aircraft all the time from the municipal airport, so we overlook lights in the sky, but this light was very bright, almost like a signal flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When first seen, this light was roughly 3000 ft in altitude.  We watched it for roughly 3 minutes all the while it was climbing in altitude straight up.  It reached about 15,000 ft, stopped climbing and hovered for 10 seconds, and then the light slowly faded out, which took another 10-20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There wasn&#39;t ONE cloud in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the evidence says a signal flare but it was too bright and signal flares and fireworks don&#39;t go to 15,000 ft in the air, they fade as they fall from the sky.<n>

It moved silently at about the speed of an airplane. I would guess an altitude of 500 feet or so.  After moving steadily across the sky nearly above me, it suddenly stopped.  It did not move for at least 5 minutes, flickering slightly once in awhile. Then it winked out and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I have been following the reports of fireballs on this sight for nearly year, I observed this as intently as possible.  I should also mention the sky was clear.  Now here is the most important part:  I saw the fireball emerge from a firework about a block away!  I have never seen or heard of a firework like this before or know anyone who has.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other than the fireball, it had looked like a normal firework.  Had I not known that it was a firework, I would have mistaken it for a UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This certainly can not explain all of the fireball sigthings out there by a long shot.  But I can tell by reading some of the repo! rts this month, that many of them are describing exactly what I saw. I consider myself a bit of an amateur astronomer, so if it almost fooled me…<n>
7/2/11 22:00|Santa Fe|TX|Light|15 minutes|A series of  red light flew overhead|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83479.html|706|ndxe201107| A series of  red light flew overhead<n> <n><n> <n><n> July 2, 2011. Santa Fe, TX.  At about 10:00pm I was in my front yard,  I looked up and directly overhead were four bright red lights.  Very pretty,  I went in and called my wife to come out and look.  We watched as they slowly moved off toward the northeast.  Then we looked  back and four more red lights were over us.  They were not flashing of rotating.  The night was clear and starry and the red lights were low enough to be seen very clearly.  They flew away in single file following the first lights.  Then we looked back and four more red lights were coming overhead, they were slightly north of the first lights but going in the same general direction.  No noise, moving slow, and we watched until they went out of sight.  They seemed to be getting higher as they flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 73 years old, a retired firefighter, arson investigator and I flew airplanes for 30 years.  I am well aware of what aircraft lights look like and these lights were not any kind of aircraft that I have ever heard of.  They were too far apart to be a single aircraft or three large aircraft.  They were just individual lights following each other across the sky.  I would really like to know what they were.  This has been on my mine a great deal and I have no answer.  Maybe you can tell me what this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked to other people in my neighborhood who said that they say the lights also.<n>

As it&#39;s July 2, many people in the neighborhood around my home were shooting off fireworks, so when the fireball-like object first entered my vision, there was a second or two where I wasn&#39;t paying too close attention to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking closer, I then realized that it wasn&#39;t a firework or a piece of one, but whatever it was, it appeared to be burning, as it had a flickering quality to it, which is why I describe it as fireball-like. Its size appeared to be something along the lines of a kernel of corn held at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially thinking it was a crashing aircraft, I jumped off the couch and ran outside to observe the object (2-3 seconds or so elapsed at most) and made it outside in time to view the object cross the sky by about ten more degrees or so before passing over the top of my house, out of my sight.  The sky was overcast, and to the best of my knowledge, this object was below the clouds, yet moving too fast to be an aircraft, even a crashing one, and too high to be a firework.  It indeed appeared to be on fire, yet there was no smoke trail and the object made no noise whatsoever.  After it passed over my home, I lost sight of it, as I would not have had time to run around the house and follow it to the horizon.  The fireball-like object appeared to be traveling from the N/NE towards the S/SW, and was visible to me for between ten and fifteen seconds from the beginning of the sighting to its end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen the ISS pass over my town before, and know what it looks like; to the best of my knowledge, this wasn&#39;t that (especially as it appeared to be below the cloud layer).  Don&#39;t know what it was, meteor or otherwise, but I&#39;m sure with all the people outside lighting off fireworks for the holiday weekend, someone else must have witnessed it as well.<n>

My friend pointed to the sky and said, &#34;Look at that!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all looked up, and a bright white light was moving fast above us, going in the west to east direction.  It was flying lower than a satellite, maybe about the same height as a plane, but it was much brighter.  For about twenty seconds is flew in one direction, but then started to slowly turn in the south direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all certain the light was not a satellite, it moved much faster, lower, and the light was very bright.  It could not have been an airplane because it had no emergency lights, and no noise was detected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light turned south it started to slow down.  My father and I stood watching it and the light started to fade.  It kept moving south, but the light got dimmer and dimmer until it faded out.

I flashed very brightly four or five times and then slowly faded out again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad and I yelled for everyone to come and see it.  My niece and one of my friends saw the fading light.  My dad and I are the only ones to witness the full duration of the sighting, but about seven people saw different glimpses of it.  It was flying too high in the sky, and for too long, to be a firework.<n>

It kept the same altitude. It made no sound.  It had no other lights on it, only the bright orange light.  It flew slowly by. Was about 3,000 ft. up in sky.

After moving halfway across the sky behind some clouds the object suddenly veered to the right as in a giant L.  It moved quickly away southeast without a sound and became dimmer as it went behind the clouds.  My wife saw the object weaving back and forth slightly before it changed directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)  I saw a second, dimmer star-like object moving roughly west to east again, much slower than the first object.  This time I noticed it weaving slightly.  I lost sight of it when it went behind some clouds.  at this point, my wife went to the bathroom, and noted the time at around 8:26 when she was done.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)  I saw a third star-like object dim and as slow as like the second object, moving roughly north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4)  As the third object moved behind clouds, a fourth dim star-like object appeared moving from the southwest heading northeast.  at this point, the occurrences were getting closer together.  I went inside to tell my son, but he did not believe me.  As my wife and I were talking about what we saw, we noticed<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5)  A fifth bright star-like object.  As bright as the first.  It appeared in the east, yet somehow overhead almost above us moving very slowly southward.  We observed that it suddenly grew extremely bright and then dim, and then lost...perhaps behind the clouds?  Hard to say.  Some stars were visible in the vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6)  A sixth bright star-like object appeared shortly after a couple of minutes...or less...moving slowly southward.  It grew suddenly very bright, then dimmed, and was lost behind the clouds.  It&#39;s pattern was similar to #5<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited outside for more activity...nothing...when we went back inside; it was ~9:20 p.m.<n>

I was staying with her over the 4th of July weekend.  I saw 3 reddish-orange orbs.  They were very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were from cell phone towers, so I did not think too much of them. As I mentioned, they were very large and they were not blinking as cell phone towers normally do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I thought I&#39;d pull over on the side of the road in her neighborhood and see if they moved.  To my surprise, they were moving very slowly across the sky.  The lights were sort of oval in shape.  The center was primarily reddish orange but there was a whitish or lighter color outside of the orange color.  There was no noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them for approximately 3 minutes as they moved across the sky.  A car pulled in the neighborhood, so I needed to move my car.  When I finally reached my mother&#39;s house I couldn&#39;t find them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a keen interest in UFO&#39;s and sightings, and I tried to think of everything I could to explain what I saw.  The lights did not behave like traditional air craft lights.  They were much to big and they were not blinking.  Plus, I believe that aircraft would&#39;ve moved faster across the sky.  They were not lights from a cell phone tower or from a satellite or star.  I&#39;m telling you, these lights were very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t going to report this until I spoke with my father today.  He said that he saw something similar last night in his area of town.  Apparently, he was watching some fireworks with his wife and neighbors and they saw them as well.  He said he even said, &#34;Hey, do you see that?&#34; to his neighbor about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I knew this was a significant event and that I needed to say something.  Be it extraterrestrial, military, or some other phenomenon, something out of the ordinary was going on that night.<n>

I looked up to the sky toward the West when I noticed a round object the color of reddish orange with a slight glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object appeared to be about the size of a dime (held out at arm&#39;s length) and was proceeding toward the South in a perfectly straight path.  It did not make any sound nor did it leave any visible trail behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a storm building up to the Southwest with gusting winds toward the Northeast.  These gusting winds did not have any effect on this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It never deviated from it&#39;s straight line of flight.  I would estimate it&#39;s altitude to be approximately 2,000-2,500 feet.I watched it until it went out of sight toward the South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have a camera with me so I did not make a photographs.<n>

It moved slowly in various directions and hovered at times.  The inner core looked like it had flames inside of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to photograh it but it would not show up on our phone camera.  Eventually the globe had the appearance of turning and as it did it fading out of sight.<n>

There were 7 total at one point.  Two were on the left side hovering and moving super fast to the left and returning towards the cupola of the monument at a lower speed.  The ones on the right had a semi-circle formation and were moving very slow maintaining the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was strange because I saw them when the sun was creating like an eclipse because it was behind the very top of the monument.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching, there was a kid who asked his father what were those objects.   When he asked his dad if he saw the objects, I immediately responded like he was talking to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a photo of a light that in another frame appears as having symmetrical shape that looks like a saucer.  I did not know it was there until I was showing the photos to my wife&#39;s aunt and uncle.<n>

I looked outside and was shocked to see clouds like I&#39;d never seen before.  There was an arrow shaped cloud jutting out in front of an apparent funnel cloud.  I quickly ran outside and saw what appeared to be a face with an arrow in front of it, sort of like an ancient carving or something.  I captured video of this whole event.  The storm proceeded with zero rain at first, but a near touchdown of an apparent tornado which I captured on video. Since then I&#39;ve had what can best be described as demonic oppression symptoms.  I decided to go over the footage again, as this general date was the time I started to have unexplained symptoms.  To my shock, i captured 1 fast moving rod shaped UFO, a shocking cloud of obvious faces in a cumulonimbus cloud that spawned a &#39;funnel&#39;, a craft appearing out of the funnel, an object shooting upward in the foreground skyward into the clouds, reptile faces and shapes in the sti! ll photos, and weird centipede-shaped organisms or beings.  The crafts can best be seen when the hue is inverted in the video. It is obvious with sharp edges and landing gear style legs that appear.  It seems to change shape at will.  The foreground in the video seems to have anomalies like a hologram or something is interrupting the field of vision.<n>

I consider myself to be very mechanically inclined.  And what i say was like nothing I have ever seen before.  It was so fast with no sound.

I saw something in the sky.  I look just like a star, but was moving very fast.  There were no blinking light, just a steady constant beam.  It was not a plain or anything that we have created.  I grew up on an air force base, so I know that is was the unknown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object didn’t give off a noise, and was too high.

I&#39;m not for certain that this was a bonafide U.F.O., but I don&#39;t believe it was a helicopter, and it certainly wasn&#39;t a star.<n>

It was glowing dim,the best way for me to describe it,is it was a white light,dim,soft.  It was after 9 pm,the sun wa! s just startint to go down.  It traveled in a way,if you draw an s in the sky,but add 1 more bend,then banked right,and looked like it took off during its last right bank,and was gone,almost like it blended into the sky!

It was slowly moving closer so I ran inside to get my camera.  When I returned outside with the camera it was hovering, about a minute later, it turned south and slowly faded away behind a cloud several miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((deleted--boyfriend)) and I went back inside thinking it was gone.  ((boyfriend))  went on the computer to look for information.  After being inside for about three minutes, I went back outside, the object had returned to the exact location.  It was hovering again; I screamed for ((boyfriend)) that it was back.  The object hovered for about two minutes and flew south.  As it flew away; the glow became dimmer and the light from the moon enabled me to see the craft, it was a gray rounded shape. It faded away behind a cloud several miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((boyfriend)) and I waited about 5 minutes to see if it would return.  When it didn’t, we went back inside the house.  After about 5 minutes in the house we decided to go back outside.  It was back in the same location again.  This time it seemed lower and much brighter.  It hovered longer this time for about three to five minutes, when we suddenly heard a helicopter approaching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Off to the west about a ½ mile away we saw blinking lights of a helicopter hovering, at almost the same moment the amber glowing ball flew south quickly back into the cloud and the helicopter flew away in the opposite direction.  We waited about another 30 minutes outside and the object never returned.<n>

I initially took it to be the landing light of an airliner, due to its size and the fact that this is a common flight path for plans arriving at Pittsburgh International Airport.  However, the color was wrong for a landing light.  In addition, there were no blinking lights anywhere in the vicinity of this light, as would be found on a plane&#39;s tail and wingtips.  I also did not hear any noise at all, as I would have expected from a jet flying overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light progressed across the sky at a fairly slow pace.  It passed overhead perhaps 30-45 seconds after I first noticed it.  As it did so, the light faded out.  There was a faint dark shape that continued in the trajectory of the light until the glare from Pittsburgh hid it.  The impression was similar to a vehicle with a headlight and no taillights passing by.  The shape was faint enough that I cannot describe it with certainty - perhaps triangular or rectangular?  In the sky it was perhaps the size of my thumbnail when held at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A check of NASA&#39;s SkySearch found no satellites passing over the McKeesport area between 11:00 and 12:00 this evening.  After retrieving my camcorder, I sat outside and observed the sky until 12:30, but did not see anything besides the usual jets passing overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a pastor in my mid-thirties, with a bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degree.  This is the first time I have observed an object in the sky that I could not explain.<n>

An orange ball of light appeared &amp; seemed to fly, almost glide in the same manner as an airplane might, but the light seemed to fly very smoothly.  The ball of orange light had a starburst effect at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For verification, daughter said to mom, look up quickly and tell me what you see.  She said, I see it ... and the direction it was headed was Northwest (toward Hwy 380).   We only spotted it for a short time &amp; then the light flickered out once, then the second time, it completely went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mom &amp; daughter were so baffled -- the duration only lasted approximately 30 seconds.   It never made a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since we live in a flight pattern to D/FW Airport, it was evident that this was no plane because about 5 minutes after spotting this UFO, an airplane flew over.  The major difference was there were no red or white lights blinking like on the bottom of an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the first time daughter had witnessed anything like it! And there was no alcohol or drugs involved.  And it was NOT fireworks (close to 4th of July weekend).<n>

I thought it was a plane but there were no blinking lights.  All of a sudden the small light turned on a spot light that was 100 times larger than the small light.  It then moved the spot light to the east where I could barely see the light when it turned back towards me there was a dark hour glass shade in the middle of the spot light.  It then blinked and the hour glass was gone. It was then just the huge spot light.  It then turned off the spot light and there was the small light again.  It then just kept going across the sky like it was a satellite moving across the sky.  I thought it was a plane that turned on its landing light but this craft made no noise and there were no blinking lights on it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Hundreds of people saw them during the evening fireworks.  They descended three at a time in line from east to west slowly from about 80 degrees to 10 degress above the horizon out over the lake, then they began to accelerate to the north west until they disappeared like tiny stars moving at incredible speed.  Size was about 1/2 disc diameter of the moon initially.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three sightings about five minutes apart each lasted about a minute and contained three orbs following the exact same trajectory in a linear fashion.

Dalhousie.  It didn’t seem like it was going real fast, but at what seemed like a constant speed in mostly a straight line. (having had a Pilot’s licence since turning 17, I have familiarity with standard forms of aviation).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the closest, it was perhaps the size of a nickel, when held at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for 2 or 3 minutes, then brought my mom out to see it. But, it took her a minute or 2 to get outside, and by then it was farther away, and not as bright. But, still much brighter than any airplane or planet would have been.<n>

I was driving on the A7 motorway, between Mornas &amp; Piolenc France.  I noted that about 14 to 17 white orbs in the nights sky, just to the right of the motorway.  At this time they were all stationery, all spread out , over 1 km, no pattern at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a short time, the bright white orbs, all moved to a single spot in the sky, all at the same time.  It now looked like one large white light in the sky. after 2 seconds, from the 6 o’clock position they started to move one by one very fast to the lift, then attach themselves to a very big round or oval shaped platform in the sky.  (apx 2000 ft ) I did not see this at the time, as it had no lights on the underside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the orbs attached to this platform, and at this point all the white orbs went out, leaving a orange glow to the under side of the craft.  1 second later 3 lights came on, 1 at the front, and 2 at the back,  It now looked like a black triangle.  It moved to the lift across the A7! very slowly, it then tilted to the right, and sped away, up in the sky at great speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I first looked at this, I was driving at 130km per hour. but unknowingly slow down to 40 km per hour, to look at this in the sky.  No one passed me on this motorway, all the car had slowed down, I was not the only one to see this on this night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

The sphere was very close to my door, less than 3 ft from where I was standing inside. It was larger than a basketball, solid, and perfectly symmetrical. There were dime sized holes covering the sphere, perfectly spaced, approximately 1.5 inches from each other. Bright lights were emitting from these holes, changing colors, from red to orange to yellow. The sphere was spinning slowly and horizontally, from left to right. I was so stunned that I stopped in my tracks. I watched the object, while I called out in wonder to the individuals in an adjacent room, who could see me looking outside. They kept asking, “What is it?” so I turned to tell them, and when I looked back, the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It floated eastward across the clear sky a pretty good distance where it had then dissappeard.  It was so amazing but, what is it. I continued looking to the stars.  About 10 to 15 minutes later i saw another orb. This one was alot smaller.  It looked to be about the size of a star.  It seemed to be alot higher and moved alot slower.  This orb looked as if it were floating southeast.  It was the same color as the first one but yet so tiny.  What are they?  Amazed with what i am seeing, i am still gazing the stars right now.  This is so awesome!<n>

I tried to look at the maps, but i couldn&#39;t find anything that matched up its orbit to what/when i saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Belton, MO, which is about 20 miles south of downtown Kansas City, MO, and really close to the Kansas state line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday July 1, 2011.  It was a little before 10:00 p.m.  I&#39;ll estimate 9:40 or 9:45.  It had just turned dark with the rest of the twilight disappearing.  I was sitting on the front porch facing due south.  People were shooting fireworks off.  There is a tree line about a block in front of me, so the horizon isn&#39;t visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what appeared to be a very bright glow or light that appeared through the trees to be going straight up.  It didn&#39;t make a sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it cleared the trees, i was waiting for the fireworks to explode out of it.  Instead what i saw was a triangle/diamond shaped glow.  I realized that it wasn&#39;t going up, it was going across the sky traveling due north and the curve of the orbit/flight made it appear to be climbing at first.  I am assuming this, although i couldn&#39;t see through the tree line to know this for sure.  It appeared to be directly over head, maybe a little to the east of here, but almost directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped down away from the house to have a better view of it as it traveled.  At first, I thought it was a diamond shaped glowing object, it appeared shaped like a kite but as it neared, I noticed this was just an aura around it.  It was shaped more like an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t appear to be solid but more like an object that was made out of fire or an intense orange colored light.  It looked like a phoenix but not flapping any wings, more like an phoenix airplane.  If most jets fly about 30,000 feet, i would estimate the altitude of this object to be about 5,000-10,000 feet or less, it&#39;s hard to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a 200 foot water tower across the street from me, so it was substantially higher than several hundred feet, but appeared to be very low and bright with the glowing aura and the bright object in the middle suggesting that it was pretty low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i watched the object continue straight north, pretty much flying directly over Kansas City, MO, I noticed that it did not make a single sound, and it didn&#39;t appear to alter its course directionally or altitude wise.  I like to watch satellites across the sky and this seems to have had a very similar path, just much lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to its shape, my immediate thought was maybe this was the space station on a close fly by, or some strangely shaped comet.  However, it didn&#39;t have a tail like a comet and looking up the path of the space station and satellites, I couldn&#39;t find anything that matched up, assuming I read the information correctly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 38 year old male.  I am a teacher.  I enjoy looking at the night sky on a regular basis.  I have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally objective and capable in his description of his sighting.

I originally thought that it might be street light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got closer, it almost appreared to be a hot air balloon with orange flame type lighting the bottom.  We made a u-turn, and pulled off the road into a parking lot where we then observed the object as it hovered for about two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was orange with no other colored lights observed.  I estimate the altitude to be about 3-4 thousand feet.  It was silent as it hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 2-mins, it took off at a hight rate of speed to the east.  As it was moving away, it began to flicker, and then blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did video the object on a Camera Phone, but all that we could pick up was a faint light.

She didn&#39;t believe me at first, then she looked and asked me what it was and I replied I had no idea.  She and I watche it for about 30 seconds and asked the other witness if she saw it.  She thought we were pulling her leg until she looked and saw it also. We continued watching it for about 3 more minutes until it disappeared behind a taller part of the building.

7/1/11 20:30|Kinderhook|MI|Changing|4 - 5 minutes|Four witnesses see a black object fly overhead about 1,000 ft up and 300 yards away in clear evening light.|7/6/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82208.html|752|ndxe201107| Four witnesses see a black object fly overhead about 1,000 ft up and 300 yards away in clear evening light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of July 1 2011, 3 others and I were witness to an unknown craft flying overhead. It was a clear, warm evening close to 8:30pm EST with only a slight breeze from the Northwest.  There were few clouds in the sky and the cloud deck appeared to be several thousand feet for those that were present.   We had just arrived at my mother’s home on Silver Lake in Kinderhook, Michigan, (South of Coldwater Michigan) and gotten our stuff unpacked.  We were sitting outside of her garage watching my dog wandering around the yard, staring at the lake and just enjoying the beauty of the evening and being there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of the west/southwest, I noticed a red light appear above the tree line, moving toward our location.  That area has several smaller airports that many aeronautical enthusiasts frequent. It is common to see ‘things’ flying about.  Given the topography of the area, it is generally easy to identify those enthusiasts and their machines quickly.  This was not one of those things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light held a steady brilliant red glow as it approached the lake.  About the time it reached the opposite shore line moving towards us, I began pointing and saying my son’s name to gain his attention.  He looked where I was pointing and said ‘what is that?’ As he said that, the other two witnesses also looked at where I was pointing.  It was moving about the speed of an ultra light aircraft as it came across the lake.  Initially my son declared it a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my view, as others got a ‘fix’ on it and began looking intently, the red light went out.  The craft continued across the lake towards us in darkness. It was initially the traditional ‘saucer’ shape round with a small dome.  The size was roughly the size of a four-seated Cessna aircraft common in the area.  The coloring was completely ink black. It passed overhead less than 300 yards away and about 1,000 feet above the ground, without sound. The harder I tried to look at it, the less I could see detail.  Almost simultaneously, we all verbally declared that this was not a plane.  This is where we all in our own ways began saying the ‘oh my god what is that’ and ‘that’s not a plane’ things to each other as it passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began asking for a camera or my binoculars.  The cameras were still in our bags in our rooms, but my binoculars were right in the garage.  My fiancée ran into the garage behind us and grabbed them for me.  The rest of us never took our eyes off it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a large farmer’s field across the street from my mother’s house, and during the time it took my fiancée to get those for me, the object had only just crossed the length of the field, heading north, northwest.  I trained my binoculars on it (10x50 power) and was able to follow it with them until it passed below the tree line.  As I watched the object, I tried to discern details such as wings, or edges to it.  It appeared to alter shape slightly, as a loosely filled balloon would in a breeze. This was no balloon though.  What continues to stand out in my mind is the blackness.  No edges or details were visible at all within the boundaries of the objects outline.  It was just blackness.  It was kind of like watching a round black hole float across the sky, with its edges slightly blurred and its outline wobbling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it approach the tops of the trees in the distance, the object made a subtle shift up and to its right, and then dove downward and left at a 45-degree angle.  It disappeared behind the treetops and I could not locate it after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not until several stunned moments afterwards, that I realized it had not made a sound. I mentioned that, and everyone was again stunned and in agreement in realizing that it in fact did not make a sound.  Considering how close it was to us, there was no way we could not have heard even the smallest of engines.  It is very quiet and calm out there and you can hear even just birds from a long distance off. This made absolutely no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother has lived there for many years now, and I have seen all types of aircraft and balloons launched from local airports. This was none of those things.  It was far too light outside and too clear, for us to mistake it for anything else at that distance.  Normal aircraft flying overhead at that altitude are very visible and audible to the point of almost being able to read their call signs with the naked eye and tell how many cylinders the aircraft is running on.  It was also traveling across the mild breeze at about a 45-degree angle, and I feel confident in ruling out a free-floating balloon based on that alone.   We do not know what we seen, but we all seen something truly amazing.<n>

I have seen this type of vehicle twice now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On May 13, 2010, and July 1st, 2011.  It looks like a bright fireball from where my house is,yet it gives off no illumination, other than flare of it.  Almost like a arc-welder.  It was out on the mountain in the back of the house.  Me, my husband, and a friend watched it for like an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after it got dark it started flying towards me, but changed it&#39;s shape to make me believe it was an airplane, but it wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw, it wasn&#39;t from this world. I have the full video of it (almost an hour), and I also have still captures from the video to show you this &#34;fireball&#34; phenomenon...it&#39;s very strange, and all I want to know is what is it!!<n>
7/1/11 19:00|Bardstown|KY|Fireball|split second|Three Fireballs seen over Bardstown|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84285.html|754|ndxe201107| Three Fireballs seen over Bardstown<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were driving east into Bardstown, and were coming into the City Limits and over a large bridge they have built as you enter the town.  It was a clear day in early July and the sun was still about an hour or so from setting.  We had a nice view of the town skyline from the bridge.  All of a sudden there were three separate fireballs in the sky that actually appeared to be explosions; they did not appear very large (but I assume that is due to the distance we were in comparison to the fireballs) and were not closely grouped together (one appearing in the far southern direction to our front and right, one directly in front of our position, and one towards the far northern part of town to our front, left).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I blurted “Did you see that!?” to my husband, to which he said kind of confusedly “Yeah, what the heck was it?” I mentioned that it appeared to be explosions and suggested that we call the small airport (which was directly west of us) or call the police and tell them, thinking that it may have something to do with a distressed plane.  My husband thought this was kind of silly, because we had seen three fireballs, not one.  There was no smoke, no sound, just three simultaneous round fireballs and nothing more.  There was no indication that there was any aircraft in the sky, much less crashing after an explosion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We considered the possibilities of the fireballs being someone setting off fireworks; however they were spaced too far apart to be the same person doing so, and there was no sound after the fact, not to mention that they happened perfectly in sync and were spaced miles apart.  They also seemed to last just a small fraction longer than a mortar shell that you purchase for the 4th of July, as well as they happened much higher up in the atmosphere.  We are from this area, and we see fireworks set off into the sky every year over the town; that was not what we witnessed with these three things.  They did not occur again, and we watched for quite some time while in town (we were in open air for several hours after arriving, so we had opportunity to watch the sky).  I never heard reports of anyone else witnessing this, even though there was at least one vehicle driving into town ahead of us facing the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were three fireballs, like you would see in a movie were missiles are exploding in the air.  Perfectly round, perfectly timed simultaneously, and made of orange fire.  The sky was clear, then suddenly, three fireballs, and then there was nothing more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

7/1/11 10:00|Riverdale|UT|Circle|1 minute or more|soft white or opaque circular object|7/4/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82053.html|756|ndxe201107| soft white or opaque circular object<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to share another sighting I had today, and, the time is approximate on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed what looked to be an opaque white circular or spherical object fly northward, quite high in the late morning sky!  I have submitted reports here before, so I always watch the skies over where I live, considering that there is an AF Base close by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object I observed, I would estimate, was possibly close to 18,000 feet or more, as there were scattered high thin clouds, and this object traveled above and behind these clouds!  It traveled slowly, and almost seemed to come to a stop a couple of times, but always kept in motion!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for at least a minute or more.  A co-worker was outside with me, but he was unable to focus on this object!  What is worth mentioning here, is that this same co-worker also intimated to me, after the object had gone, that he had seen a similar object earlier this morning, maybe less than an hour prior to my sighting, traveling southward, high up, and going at a really fast speed, he estimated, to be at least as fast as a passenger jet, and maybe even faster!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object I saw was going due north!  There was no noise associated with this object, nor was there any vapor trails left behind it!  And no flashing or strobe lights!  At this elevation, it would be quite impossible to say it was a plane, because, even at ceiling limits of most passenger aircraft, one can still discern a fuselage of a plane, on a clear, sunny day!  This was round, and moving slowly!<n>

Me and three of my cousins went outside to talk on my cell phone.  We were playing around for about five minutes when one of my cousins told me to look at the red star.  (I told her that the red ones were planets.)   We looked at it and it was standing still, which made it seem like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the sudden she screamed and told us all to look at it.  The object was moving very slowly to the south.  (The right of us.)   First, it was just one reddish orange dot moving.  All of the sudden we saw four dots.  Arranged like they were at the corners of a square.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we saw four lights in a row blinking. We watched it until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n>

We both watched intently and listened for any noise but could here none. The object travel to the north for about 1 minute and then took a sharp turn in the sky and began heading south south east at the Sam rate of speed as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hung up the phone and attempted to turn my video camera on to film the object but the screen was scrambled and looked as though it had been submerged in water. I had to take the battery out to reset the phone. While this was going on the objects light began to fade away and after about 1 minute in the new direction it completely burned out or disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend who was with me is an 8th grade science teacher and owns several telescopes I began quizzing him as to what we may have just seen and he was literally speachless.  Neither of us had ever seen anything like it in our lives and it was very clearly in our atmosphere and was not an airplane or a meteor.  As we were discussing the possible origin of the &#34;UFO&#34;  we had just witnessed and the strange thing that happened to my cell phone, the object reappeared in the sky just over our heads, it took what appeared to be a near identical course and it had renewed brightness this time.  It looked like a moving fire ball that changed shape before our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time I managed to get a picture of it and both of us got video on our phones of the UFO.  It made the same turn in the sky and slowly lost it&#39;s brightness in the same part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my 14 years in law enforcement and his 8 as a teacher neither of us have ever encountered anything! like this, it seemed to have a clear path and I am just really happy it came back and let us catch it on video.<n>
7/1/11 00:50|Gaithersburg|MD|Triangle|2 minutes|Strange high frequency noises heard in the sky.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91364.html|760|ndxe201107| Strange high frequency noises heard in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event in question occurred at around 12:50 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last year around this same time I did see a large triangular shaped object in the sky that hovered over my neighborhood, and then took off at an extremely impressive speed without any sound whatsoever, but in this case I did not see a UFO.  I know that this form is for UFO sightings only, however, what I heard last night was so strange that it had to be something unexplainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting up in bed reading, and I heard something just outside my window (there’s a busy street just by my house) that at first sounded like screeching tires.  I thought that someone had hit a deer because there are many that live by in the area, but then the tone of the screeching changed.  There were three different tones to it, and the duration of each tone would last for about ten seconds and then it would change.  I realized as soon as it changed that it wasn’t a car crash. The sound continued to change in tones without any brea! ks in between.  As crazy as this sounds, it sounded like that scene in Close Encounters of the Third Kind where they contact the aliens using music. It was very loud and very high pitched.  It went on for at least 2 minutes.  I looked out my window to see if I could see anything in the sky, but my window isn’t at a very good vantage point, and I didn’t want to go outside because I was worried I’d miss the noise.  I didn’t feel at all scared or threatened.  It was just very strange, and I knew that I was experiencing something that wasn’t normal. I think that someone else out on the road either heard what I was hearing, or saw something because in the midst of the noise going on,  I did hear a separate noise of tires coming to a hault out on the road.  So this is just pure speculation, but perhaps someone saw something in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last year when I saw the Triangular shaped craft, it was very large, and had a lot of different colors of lights all around it. It approached my neighborhood, which is a townhouse community, and stopped over a row of houses. It hovered there for a few seconds, and then took off at a sharp 90 degree angle, and was completely gone. During that sighting there was no sound whatsoever that came from the craft, even when it took off. A few nights later my mother was out walking our dog, and she saw what perhaps could be the same craft. It approached the same row of houses, making no noise at all, and then took off and reappeared in the same area, took off again , then reappeared in a different section of the sky almost as if it was shuffling across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m wondering if perhaps there was another craft in the area and if perhaps more people are going to report experiences like this where they see a craft and hear music coming from the craft. Perhaps they’re attempting to communicate with us now.<n>
7/1/11 00:20|Myrtle Beach|SC|Circle|3 to 5 minutes|2 circular objects appearing as clusters of orange lights moving parallel to the coast off Myrtle Beach, SC.|7/4/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82019.html|761|ndxe201107| 2 circular objects appearing as clusters of orange lights moving parallel to the coast off Myrtle Beach, SC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately fifteen to twenty minutes past midnight early in the morning on Friday, July 1, 2011, while staying on the 3rd floor of an oceanfront resort hotel on the South end of Myrtle Beach, SC, (just North of Surfside Beach), my wife awakend me to come out on the balcony and look at a strange circular orange light glowing in the sky above the ocean several miles off the coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my 10x binoculars and noted an object that with binoculars presented itself as a tightly grouped circular cluster of orange lights moving in a line from South to North at an altitude slightly lower than one might expect a jet airliner to travel in a flightpath.  The object slowed to a stop and hovered for about 20 seconds, then from a stationary position, the cluster of lights arced slightly upward, slowly dimmed and went out as if it were moving away from the coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the the first object hovered and dimmed, a second object of approximately the same size (or very slightly larger) appeared and traveled in a similar path to the first object, at approximately the same altitute.  The second object was roughtly identical to the first, except it moved more slowly, then stopped and lingered for about 20 seconds as it slowly dimmed and arced slightly upward, dimming out as it moved higher and away from the coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were not fireworks, since they both moved South to North/Northeast well off the coast in a path parallel to the coastline and at a uniform altitude parallel to the horizon until they arced upward.  The sky had no visible clouds, but there was a uniform atmospheric haze, which might account for the fact that each of these two objects had a flickering effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife is a retired corporate executive.  I am an attorney.<n>

She pointed it out, it was circling the antenna.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving and when I tried to see what she saw, I barely caught a glimpse of it before it was completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our corner to turn was basically at the sighting location.  As I turned, it came directly at our car.  I actually ducted ((sic.  Ducked)) in the car, because I was sure it was going to hit us.  But it didn&#39;t and once again gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less then 30 seconds from this, we were in the driveway and my wife already had her cell out with the camera on.  No sooner from getting out of the car, it came again, towards our house, and then gone like it was in perhaps the same direction it came.  The speed was amazingly fast and no sound.  I took afew pictures not even sure if I got anything, and waited incase it returned.  It did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1 min later it shot towards us again, and returned from the same direction.  Again I took more pictures in hopes of catching something.  This thing came towards us faster then a jet can plummet to the ground.  It came to a dead stop right in front of us, and in a blink gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No more were seen that evening and from a non-believer I now believed and so did my wife.  As for the pictures I took, they did catch a few good pictures I can&#39;t explain.  We only saw this glowing ball at hyper speed.  In one picture you can see the ball glowing with outer rings not visible by the naked eye.  These outer rings are seen in the pictures, touching the pavement in front of our house.  The very first picture I took was the most impressive, as we only saw a glowing ball, this picture showed windows with shadows of something in them.  The windows were around the object which looked like a disc type object. we couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it. I took up watching the skies as if it was my midnight job. about 2 weeks later.  It happened again, but this time different. I was on the back porch and ! it was fairly dark, you could see the stars. one in particular! stuck o ut to me. it was like this star was puking lil stars, just an amazing thing I had never seen.  I called for my wife to come out and check it out. she came and when I pointed it out, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something just approaching our roof top, it was a good 75 feet above us.  I ran for the camera and the wife was trying to figure its shape as we could only see a little of the object.  As I was running back out the patio door with my camera, my wife yells it just took my picture...the flash was so bright it could be seen inside our house. by the time I saw this flash and actually got through the door and looked up, I asked in panic, where the hell is it, she was scared and said its right over the house now, but it was gone. just a dot in the sky. still to this day, I cant stop lookin to the skies, everytime I go outside..something that will question my wife and myself the rest of my life I think…<n>
7/1/11|Lafollette|TN|Triangle|Seconds|Low flying triangle.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96633.html|764|ndxe201107| Low flying triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could only guess at the date this event took place, but I remember the event itself very well since I suppose I must have recounted it for an hour straight afterward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving threw downtown lafollete on the four lane which is the only main road threw the town, on my way to a close friends house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was getting dark out the time being around late dusk, my eyes focused on a set of three lights up ahead which were above the road ahead, but their was a bend in the road and I quickly assumed these lights were just streetlights, but as I got closer I realized that these lights were on the bottom of some type of air craft which was moving so slowly that it had previously looked stationary. I began freaking out loudly laughing and saying oh my god, while trying to get a good look at the aircraft without rear ending the vehicle in front of me, I even tried to pull off on the side of the road, but by the time I was able to I would have had to have turned around as I had went around another bend in the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The road was fairly busy that night, and I seen a young boy in another car with his face nearly plastered to his window looking at the craft as well, so I know others could see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can only estimate the size, and height of the craft. I would guess it must have been 10-15x as high as an average streetlight pole, as several times larger then a passenger jet. ( Like I say these are entirely estimates and could be off ) I could really only see the underside of the craft, I could see no windows or other openings. The craft was mostly a triangular shadow, with three larger white lights on the underside, one in the front, two in the rear, with a smaller flashing red light between the two rear white lights, but set slightly forward them. The craft was low enough that as this red light flashing I could see some texture to what appeared to be a domed covering which I would liken to looking like a cars break light. I heard no sound emitting from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to include that a friend who lives near the location where I had this sighting had told me a story about a craft with this same description a week or so prior to my sighting. He had told me that himself and a friend of his were walking the road near his house at night, when what looked like a star lowered above them, and then continued off in the direction the craft I later seen had been traveling. When he told me this story I didn&#39;t believe him. I thought he was just making it up, until I had my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am amazed that this craft flew so low, and in such an incredibly peculiar way, almost hovering in place it moved to slowly. Yet I have never heard another people say anything about it aside from my friend who had told me about seeing something similar prior to my sighting. I just for the life of me do not understand how web sites like topix weren&#39;t abuzz with chatter about it, how it didn&#39;t end up being talked about in the local paper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My gut tells me this was not an ET craft, but something from here. The flashing red light on the bottom of the craft just looked to much like stuff iv seen, and similar to the lights on the bottom of planes, and jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
