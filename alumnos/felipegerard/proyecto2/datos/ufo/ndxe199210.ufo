We were driving home and I felt the strangest feeling that a ufo was above me so I looked up and saw something strange. It was a &#39;cluster&#39; of lights, as if the stars in the sky were moving. I could not identify the shape but did notice about 10 moving lights, one of which were blinking an odd blue -off 0.5 second and on for about 2.5 seconds. I saw the object for about 6 seconds and it seemed to have just vanished.<n>
10/31/92 19:00|Osterville|MA|Rectangle|10 seconds|A seemingly close object with a rectangular pattern of lights moved silently|11/26/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33143.html|3|ndxe199210| A seemingly close object with a rectangular pattern of lights moved silently<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was in the 6th grade, my friend and I were out trick or treating when we stopped by his grandparents&#39; house. We were standing outside the house when my friend jokingly flashed his flashlight into the sky a few times. We got really spooked when right after that a strange object passed silently right in our line of sight across the night sky. I didn&#39;t see any actual detail of the craft, but it had 8 lights arranged in a rectangular fashion. It seemed to be quite close to us. That is, we were standing on the steps in front of the house and looking across the street where the object was at an angle that put it just above the trees. It appeared to be roughly the size of a helicopter at a distance of a couple hundred yards. The strange part, though, is that it made no sound at all. I live near an air force base and in the path of coast guard patrols, so I&#39;m used to hearing passing aircraft. At the distance my mind was assuming the object had to be at (that is, a couple hundred yards), a helicopter would have been really loud. The night was completely silent, too, as the unidentified object silently glided across the sky. It moved in a straight line at a speed comparable to the coast guard helicopters patrolling over my house, which I assume is something like 40-50 MPH or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other possibility is that instead of what I saw being a single, close aircraft, it could have been a more distant formation of aircraft (since I didn&#39;t see any detail of the &#34;craft&#34; besides its lights), which could also explain the lack of sound. The problem with this is that each light was a single, distinct point. Even at long distances a normal civilian or military plane has multiple lights that are easily discernable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I turned right and went ahead towards Jacksonville.  As I watched the object it decended down below the trees probably a mile or so away.  I could still see the lights through the trees when it went bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, as I was driving home, I seen armed guards at every back gate to the camp.  I have never seen any soldiers in the thousand times I have drove by it before.  There where Humvee&#39;s driving parameter patrols as well.

I heard the drops of rain dropping down one by one before falling asleep. For some reason I woke up because I kept on hearing the drops and something felt  unnatural. I turned the light near the bed on and imediatly froze and fear and shock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was a frog down on the carpet. I do not know why, but it scared me very much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was young, 11 or so at the time. I reacted by not moving at first and looking at it for about 10 seconds. It didn&#39;t have a specific color. It looked more mechanical than natural green color. It had a small antenni on the head. For some reason I fear of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that it was intelligent and was directing it&#39;s attention to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I acted slowly to cover myself on the sheets and stayed under the sheets for what left like no more than 15 minutes thinking what I should do. Then I figured I would throw the   bed covers on it and run downstairs to talk to mother. I did that and I woke her up  and explained that there is &#34;something&#34; up there and that I did know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said that it is probably just a mouse and offered to walk upstairs on the 2nd floor where I had a bed and check the room out.

10/16/92 23:00|Pittsburgh|PA|Disk|2 minutes|Bright light on small disc craft January & October 1992 Bates & McKee Pittsburgh, PA|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87780.html|10|ndxe199210| bright light on small disc craft January &amp; October 1992 Bates &amp; McKee Pittsburgh, PA<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occurred in south Oakland, near Bates &amp; McKee Place, in Pittsburgh, PA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 11pm, on October 16, 1992, just after I reached up to turn off the lamp above my bed, my room was filled with dazzling yellow light, as bright as daylight.  Thinking a transformer had blown on the power lines on the next street, I got up to look out the window.  The light coming in between the curtains was warm to my skin, like sunlight.  The source of the light seemed to be very close to the window.  I, then, wondered if someone were on the roof of the neighboring warehouse, shining some sort of light around the roof.  Earlier in the day, I the dirigible had made a chugging sound, and this light source made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I opened my curtains, I saw a small, round, Oreo cookie-shaped vehicle, with a domed top and bottom.  In the center layer were small round lights on the outer ring of the craft.  The lights were amber in color.  From the bottom, emitted the singular, enormous light beam I had seen coming through my window.  The craft was about twelve to fifteen feet above my window and seemed to be about three and a half feet in diameter.  It was slowly ascending from the roof of the adjacent warehouse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now, the light beam was no longer pointed towards my window, but had swung away from it, shining along the wall to the back garden and the adjacent warehouse that made an L-shaped wall around the garden.  It shone on the garden for a brief moment, then, swung back so that it was perpendicular to the craft.  Then, it retracted into the craft and the entire vehicle disappeared.  It had not made a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke my next door neighbor who reported seeing two beams of light coming through his window earlier, maybe 30 minutes before my experience.  He said that one beam had been blue and the other had been amber.  His windows faced the warehouse wall below where I saw the craft. He had been too tired to get out of bed to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, it was midnight and I could not account for an entire hour of my time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went outside to see if we could see the lights or anything unusual, but we saw nothing.  No one on the street seemed to be looking surprized or paying any attention to the building where we had seen the light.  My neighbor climbed on the roof of the warehouse to see if there was evidence of something having been there, but he found nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, the elderly woman who lived in the apartment directly above mine reported being frightened by the bright light shining in her window the night before.  She did not open the curtains to directly observe the light.  She had lived in the building for 40+ years and was terrified of this light that night, deciding, &#34;It was a sign from God!&#34;   Also, prior to seeing the light, my apartment had smelled strange, as if something hot and metallic were burning a bit.  I even checked my oven to see if the smell emitted from there, but it did not.  The other peculiar thing is that an electric alarm clock kept buzzing--not with the alarm sound, but with an electrical hum--in the hours directly preceding my sighting of this craft.  This clock was on a bureau beside the window from which I had seen the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ten months prior to this experience, in mid-January 1992, a bright light had awoken me around 2am. (My room was normally very dark, sheltered from outside street lights.)   My boyfriend was staring at the light, but did not respond when I asked him what it was.  In this instance, I did not get up and investigate.  I was too frightened to get out of bed.  The light lasted a moment or two and went out. The next morning, my boyfriend did not recall seeing any light in the middle of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think that this was the same craft perhaps visiting on two separate occasions.  The warehouse on which it was located stores food for a large local restaurant, but particularly houses many whole potatoes that are cut up to make a popular item at the restaurant.  My building and the warehouse were owned by the same person.  I did verify with the building maintenance personnel that no one had been on the warehouse roof with a light.  They all said that they had not been up there and that no light of that candle power was on the property, nor any other thing that could have looked like what was seen.<n>
10/15/92 22:30|Nhlangano (Swaziland)||Sphere|10 minutes|Strange light emmitting shpere in Africa with bright flashes.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34020.html|11|ndxe199210| Strange light emmitting shpere in Africa with bright flashes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all, I was one of 4 mormon missionaries that witnessed this.  We had hiked out to a village.  The trail was about a 2 hour hike down into a valley and across a stream and back up the otherside to a ridge where many villages tend to be built because of flooding issues.  We got to the village approxiamety 5:30ish that evening, dark sets in at that lattitude around 6:30, and honestly, we were a bit nervous about the hike back in the dark, with absolutely no lights of any electric kind visible anywhere, and being in Africa, with animals.  However, at about 9:30 p.m. we left the village and at approxiatemley 10:30 p.m. we reached the river.   To the south of the crossing the valley really broadens out into grassland and 10 to 15 miles away there is another mountain range.  That is when one of the missionaries said, hey look at the moon, it looks strange, and I already had noticed the moon earlier, and noted to him that the moon was in the opposite direction.  We stopped and stared at this large spherical glowing mass, that seemed to be translucent with mostly oranges and a hint of blue coming from it.  There was absolutely no sound.  Then suddenly, it emitted like lightning bright white, and the whole valley was alluminated, for a split second like we were part of a huge camera flash.  At this point, we were getting very nervous, we could feel static electricity in the air, litterally.  The sphere was still there, and again, about a minute later, another flash.  And then it was gone.  And the night was again to us and the half moon and clear skys.  I don&#39;t have any explanation for this, except that we all saw it and wonder to this day what it was.  I have never seen weather do this.  And it dissapeared so quickly I doubt that it could have been any aircraft, such as a helicopter hovering.  The size which would be difficult do to distance had to be large.  We could see the glow of it on that ridge that was 10 to 15 miles away, the flash seemed to come from the center of the object.  A! t this point due to my career, and being in contact with large amounts of people, I prefer to remain anonymous, with no contact, just felt this might be interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

If you were in grade school in the 1970’s and 1980’s as I was you may remember your teacher placing chalk in several wire holders attached to a piece of wood she would use to make lines on a chalkboard.  Imagine the colors of the spectrum being drawn on a chalkboard and that is basically what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The colored lines emerged from nowhere and briefly moved across the sky and then abruptly stopped.   From them shot a bright white light that moved across the sky in a southwestwardly direction.  The whole sighting took a couple of seconds at the most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in October 1992 is approximate.  PD))<n>

We had just past Elliot Key at about sunset and were heading north to Miami.  We were just cruising at a slow pace past the inlet before Key Biscaine when my husband said, &#34;What is that light following us?&#34;  It was very dark at this point and I looked way up and back and saw a light above us.  It was a strange light as it didn&#39;t have any glare and didn&#39;t seem to be connected to anything.  There was no noise as from a ship or a plane or helicopter.  The light just kept getting closer and closer and bigger and bigger.  I could look straight into it without any it hurting my eyes.  The whole boat was engulfed in light as it came right up on us.  My husband kept getting quite excited and screaming, &#34;What is it? See if you can make anything out.&#34;  I thought I could see an outline of something, but there was no noise as if a craft were approaching.  No red or green lights, no propeller sounds...nothing. Just the sound of our boat cruising and my husband screaming.  I said, &#34;Just hit it, just get out of here!!&#34;  I was afraid a large ship was upon us or something.   My husband hit the throttle and I braced myself for the thrust of the boat.  As I did this, the light flew up into the sky as fast as lightning and we could see it moving into the galaxy farther and farther away.   We have told few people about this incident as we don&#39;t want to look like nuts.  But we both know for sure that a UFO was checking us out.  We went back the next day to see where we were exactly--we found a marker we passed along the way--there is nothing out there...nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It had no wings but could move rather fast.  The fog/cloud started to reappear again and the object disappeared.  We watched the object about 20 minutes before it disappeared.

There were no other vehicles on the road, no street lights and no homes in the area. I observed a very brillant bluish/white light streaking toward the earth. The object was about one mile wsw of the intersection of Hwy. 88 and Kimmerling road and at an elevation of no more than 3,000 feet. I recall thinking to myself, &#34;Wow! this shooting star is going to impact the surface&#34;. Wanting to witness the impact, I stopped to watch and had thought it might be interesting to try and recover some segment of the object. At about that time, the object stopped it&#39;s almost verticle descent and shoot up at a forty-five degree angle in a nnw direction. the object remained brilliantly bright during the entire incident.

As I had a colleague doing art for them and was soon to be working with SETI and was also involved with NASA and the other astronomical organizations I was able to get my wife ((name deleted)) and myself invited to the Barstow event and the Goldstone ceremony.  I knew a few people there and a few astronomers I had worked with as well as a couple artist friends.  I felt an outsider most of the time not being able to afford the dinners and hotel events.  I borrowed a friends 8mm video camera and had my own SLR and lots of film, so spent most my time shooting the event.  I was able to meet Carl Sagan and was able to shake his hand and thank him personally for his work in educating myself and the public so beautifully with the PBS Cosmos series.  Just a few minuets with him though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We where bused into Goldstone on the military base for the ceremony where I shot film and video of all I could.  We had a great time participating in the historic event and got photos of Carl, friends and other dignitaries.   It was a good event and history in the making.  When it was over we just wanted to go relax somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As was our tradition at the time, when we are down that far south we always try go through or stay a night in Death Valley, a favorite place to this day, having spent much time there hiking and camping as well as exploring through college and after.  My wife and I spent two weeks just below the monument for our honeymoon in 1980 and I had done several road trips and backpacking high in the mountains in the seventies.  So we where very comfortable in this desolate beauty and powerful nature spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived in the monument from our Barstow hotel in the late afternoon.  Not wanting to miss a shot at a sunset session there, we went to the sand dunes directly, grabbed our day-packs and photographic bags and a borrowed Hi8 video cam and ran (walked fast) out to the deep dunes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we walked, my wife and I where having an argument probably due to our depleted neurochemistry from erratic sleep, road-food and stress.  As we stood 10 feet apart and speaking loudly at each other, about nothing I remember, all of a sudden a bright light in the sky over ((deleted--wife)) drew my attention.  I was facing mountain Tucki Mountain looking south across the Panamint Mt. range  The range was had mountains as high as up to 11000ft.   This Tucki Mt. was over 5000 ft. I know because by that time in my life I had climbed Telescope Peak there (11049 ft.) in 1976 and had hiked the valley many times, so was familiar with the distances and geography first hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked at the light I noticed it was like a super bright flare slowly arching down from what looked like a massive black triangle 70% oblique to me.  I estimated it was close to the mountains and probably we where at or below sea level, observed the object at about 4000ft I estimated.  I yelled at my wife to look!, thinking she missed the &#34;spark,&#34; but as she turned, another bright spark came out of the craft and flew slowly down and out.  What we where left with was a view of this seemingly football-field sized or larger black triangular shape with what I remember was maybe many colored lights on what looked like the leading edge.  It was moving slowly, silently and deliberately northward along the range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By that time it was dusk heading for twilight and the light was going.  I had film with ASA rated for daylight but attempted to get a shot after a few minuets of checking ourselves and confirming we where seeing the same thing.  I could not get any exposure, shot some blanks on the off chance they would show, but no luck.  The Hi8mm cam I had could not even show an image it was so dark.  In retrospect I could have narrated a detailed description on video.  I did not think over the ontological terror of seeing such a thing at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we stood in the sand dunes for about 20-30 minuets watching as the object slowly moving north along the mountain range until we lost sight of it in the extinction, haze and darkness.  Our legs where like rubber and we where very excited and a bit concerned for our safety as we thought we where totally alone in the vast valley.  So we made our way deliberately to our car parked a mile back through the dunes.  As we reached the parking area we noticed a motorcycle had come while we where gone and parked with its owner sleeping on top of one of the few picnic tables.  I was too spooked and in too much of a hurry to wake the person and ask him if he saw anything or warn him of the possible danger we felt.   We headed rapidly for the Stove Pipe Wells campgrounds with our heads rotating 360 for any other sights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later at home, I referenced topographic and standard maps of the area and noticed that just the other side of the range but several air miles south from Tucki Mountain was the military test range China Lake Navel Weapons Testing Range.   So the military is all over the place down there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So although I had no visual record of the event we experienced, we had solid memory as you might imagine.   This is the first time I have written about this.  I have told some friends, but that is all.  I am producing a documentary segment for the event in 3D high resolution animations.  I also have a Google Earth KMZ file showing the site.  Much more research also on file.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So who would believe such a story?  An artist, a Sci-Fi fan and lifetime UFO interested person coming from a SETI event?  Not a chance.  I could have physical evidence and people would just laugh.  I would probably not blame them either.<n>

I had been photographing balloons all morning. At 10:00 the Fiesta was winding down; only a few balloons were still aloft. Then it happened,two spheres of light about the size of 5 magnitude stars, moving from east to west moved into my line of vision &amp; stopped directly over head. Two more followed,then two more. They too stopped &amp; remained motionless for a short period. Then all 6 began maneuvering independently in straight lines with no given pattern,right,left,backward,forward. It was all happening directly overhead,well above balloon altitude. I took 6 photos using a 35-105 zoom lens,5 of the photos included balloons for scale reference. The 6th without balloons. All 6 spheres reduced in size,as if going straight up until they vanished.<n>

We were in a residential neighborhood, the houses all being on at least one acre lots.  All the lots have trees on them.  We are 25 miles west of downtown Fort Worth, and there were no street lights, so you can see the stars very well.  From where we were standing, in the street, you couldn&#39;t really see the horizon, just the houses/trees around us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, from what appears to be only feet above the trees,(moving north to south) a large, black (or dark grey) air craft comes into view.  I cant remember what the &#34;front&#34; of it looked like, just that there was something VERY large approaching us.  It was totally silent. No vibration, no air movement, no smell, no visible moving parts, no smoke, nothing!! I got the impression that it was either rectangular, or maybe triangular, and for some reason I was thinking that it had to be pretty flat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved, well hovered would be a better description, until it was directly over us. It was soo big that it totally filled our field of vision.  You could not see the stars/sky behind it.  It seems that there were some dull white lights on the edges of it, but me and my husband never did agree on what the lights looked like, or if there were even lights at all.  The whole encounter lasted under a minute.  I dont remember how it left our field of vision, and neither can my husband. Nothing can fly that low, that slow, that quiet, without crashing to the ground. Not to mention the emmense size of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is almost as weird as the sighting itself, is that me and my husband, never could be more specific about what we saw, why I didnt remember the date, or what we saw after it passed over us.  I have tried for years to pin point an exact time frame.  I know me and my now husband were just kids, so it had to be 91-92.  I am thinking it was early fall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have thought about this everyday of my life, and have asked everyone that I thought might have some insight about planes/experimental aircraft/military aircraft etc, and no one can explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was glad to see soo many reports here, during that general time frame, that sound like our incidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We were traveling west on a heavily traveled, two lane highway when about four cars in front of us began to brake like and accident had occured.  When we approached the scene and slowed we noticed to the left of the highway only about 200 feet above a vacant field we saw a very long, possibly 300ft long craft, with a width of 80+ft and a height of 40-50ft. The botom of the craft had no super bright lights, however, it was illuminated.  Having lights that resembled looking at a city scape from above.  You could literlly see all of the botoom side of the craft as it maintained a staionary posistion above the field.  I could not beleive what we were seeing. There are two strange things about this sighting that I still struggle to understand today and I feel almost tormented from not knowing and the need to know.  #1 Everyone could see that this was not ordinary, yet the traffic only slowed to a crawl while people looked out their respective windows... no one stopped to investigate more intensly. #2 Although I wanted to talk about this with my mother, who was driving the vehicle, I couldn&#39;t.  Not because I didn&#39;t want to, but because I would think to myself &#34;I need to see what she thinks about this&#34;  and then when I would get near her to talk it was like it just was&#39;nt in my mind to ask.  Hard to explain how that feels.  We didn&#39;t talk openly about what we saw for almost 7yrs.  Then one day we watched a program about UFO&#39;s with my father around 2000 and my mother says, &#34;Do you remember when we saw that ufo years ago?&#34;  I did and have always.  I just don&#39;t understand why we couldn&#39;t talk about it, like a block, for years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Night time comes early in the fall as I was driving on airport blvd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had exited airport blvd off the southwest fry.  Airport Blvd. is a short road that runs from the frwy to Murphy road.  I was on my way to have a conversation with my ex-wife about our son.  We were to meet at the Casa Ole restaurant located on Murphy Rd.  To the right of airport Blvd is Texas Instruments a large computer chip manufacturer.  Half way down the street there is a grassy area between the road and the T.I. parking lot. T.I. has workers 24 hours a day so anyone starting at 6:00 PM would be coming in to work the second shift.  I was driving east, the stars were bright, the sky was clear.  Halfway down the street right over the grassy area a beam of bluish, purplish light appeared on the ground from about 30 feet in the air.  I heard no sound, saw no craft.  My gaze was on the beam of light, suddenly a man appears on the ground and runs toward the T.I. parking lot.  My eyes follow him at first then as I gaze to where the beam of light was; it is gone.  This all happened so quickly I put it out of my mind and went and had the meeting with my ex-wife and never thought about it again until I started to hear people share their stories on coast to coast radio.  I many years later concluded that this person worked at T.I. and was given a ride to work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I am sharing my story on your site.

10/10/92 17:00|Panama City|FL|Formation|1 Hour(?)|During a road trip to Panama City a friend and I witnessed a pair of luminous light formations appear and dissappear over the Gulf.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05031.html|22|ndxe199210| During a road trip to Panama City a friend and I witnessed a pair of luminous light formations appear and dissappear over the Gulf.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was years ago, so my memory of exact times and dates may be assumed to be a &#34;best guess&#34; but all details of the objects, and their behavior are still completely clear in my mind. A close friend and I had been working our tails off all year without a break, as we were both enrolled in the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and he(my friend) was also employed as the assistant to the broadcasting(mass comm) department(in which I was taking classes at the time), and in addition we produced a public access cable show in our spare time, which there was little of. In short, we needed a break, and thought it would make an interesting show if we documented ourselves winning the florida state lottery, so we used the show as an excuse for a road trip, and took one of the department&#39;s cameras with us (no, we didn&#39;t expect to win, but if we had it would&#39;ve made great television). So after a long drive from Birmingham, and a long afternoon of filling out lottery tickets, neither of us wanted to drive back, so we found a cheap motel, and put away our stuff to stay the night. It was about 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon when we both went out to the beach behind our hotel, and plopped down into a pair of those wooden beach chairs, and admired the calm sea, making small talk as the sun sank to the horizon. I don&#39;t recall which of us saw it first, because at first we didn&#39;t think anything of it, as there had been planes in the sky all day, and this seemed at the outset to be just an oddly-colored set of airplane lights. Although after about 15 or 20 minutes the lights hadn&#39;t moved, and we both took notice then. There were two rows of lights, the top row was an arc of four (reddish-violet in color)and were larger (not brighter) than the bottom row of three (bright yellow) they were arranged like this: O O   &lt;----Violet arc of lights O ... O ^------Yellow row of lights My initial thought was of a jetliner with four violet lights on the front of it&#39;s wings, and three bright yellow tail lights, seen in perspective flying towards the land. However since it was somewhat within a cloud, no structure was apparent. Also, nothing that size(jumbo-jet size) that I know of can hover, noiselessly (or if it did make noise, it was drowned out by the incoming surf). We watched the object, for a few moments, and it dawned on me that we had a camera in the trunk of the car, and there might be some way to profit from having a (near)professional quality UFO video (students are often broke, y&#39;know), so I told my friend to go get the camera-he had the keys (we had driven in his car). He refused to be moved from staring at the thing, and I quite frankly, didn&#39;t want to miss a moment either, so we stood there arguing about who should get the camera, while waching the object, when it dissappeared, like somone flipping off a light switch. We both stood there for a moment, then I sat back down on the chair, as did he, and we started talking about what we had just saw, and UFO&#39;s in general. By this time the sun had completely set, and we could see stars in the (mostly) clear sky. As we sat there looking around for any other strange things, we both noticed a number of planes in the air(or should I say red tail lights of planes)passing overhead at extremely high altitude, always in pairs, from right horizon to left (west to east) then back again. There must have been more than a dozen planes in the air in the next hour, before they finally stopped flying over our position. When the sky was clear again, as if on cue the object reappeared just as suddenly as it had vanished, and seemingly hadn&#39;t moved an inch. This time I was yelling &#34;GET THE CAMERA!&#34;(while elbowing my poor pal), and as we watched, another set of lights appeared, to the right, and above the first set(this time it was too dark to see if there was a connecting structure), and the first set of lights slowly faded away. After the dissapearance of the first object, my friend (FINALLY) trundled off back to the car, to get the camera. as he went away, so did the second object, lightswitch-style. Then I looked around the beach, and noticed that there wasn&#39;t a soul in sight. I must admit it-I got the creeps at that point, with the mist and surf slowly creeping up to the chairs, it was all I could do to sit still, and not run ! off to help my friend with the camera. As I sat there looking at the sky, I saw one final display. It was as if one of the objects was turned upside-down, right next to the other, with all lights on both glowing an intense yellow. Like this: O O O ... O O ... O O O This flashed brightly for a moment,low near the horizon, then was gone. After many long minutes my friend returned with the camera, tripod, and batteries, plopped it all down, and we both set it up. We searched the sky for an indeterminate amout of time to no avail, there was to be no more light show that night. But as we packed up to go back to our room, there was one other person on the beach who walked up to us and asked if we had seen the lights, too. &#34;Yes,&#34;we replied &#34;what the hell were they?&#34; &#34;Don&#39;t know, but that&#39;s been going on all week&#34; he replied. I later determined(by looking at our handy road map)that to our west was Eglin AFB, the likely source of the planes, and nearby was Gulf Breeze, which I later suspected may have been the source of the other things. Additionally, the lights of each set of lights never never changed position relative to each other which is what leads me to believe that there were two seperate objects whose surfaces were adorned with these lights. Also, the lights gave off an aura (almost like neon, but as bright as incandescent) which readily differentiated them from regular lights (though during the daylight sighting I attributed this aura to the lights being inside the boundary of a cloud, diffracting through the water vapor, but at night- it was a whole different story). Also , when we got home, my friend and I drew sketches of what we saw seperately (to make sure we both had the same experience) and they matched exactly.<n>

The sun was glinting off of *them*, or I wouldn’t have even have been able to see them.  The Raleigh Approach controller didn’t call them as traffic, and I wasn’t worried, as they were a good bit ahead of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked down to review an approach plate or tune a radio or some minor task, I looked up about thirty seconds after first seeing the flight of two, and the next thing I see is a chevron shaped vehicle within a! n eighth of a mile of us.  It is now right outside of my window, just forward off the left wing, traveling opposite direction, at our altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think that this must have been what I had previously thought to be the F-16’s.  The chevron shaped thing must have been in a turn earlier, and that the sun glinting off what, for lack of a better term, might be considered end-plates of the *wings* made it appear like a couple of F-16’s (or any other small fighter).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As unusual sightings go, this was not a very flamboyant looking vehicle; however, it was a very flashy flyer.  It wasn’t flying along as if it were a *flying wing* type vehicle.  It flew past us, standing on the tip of what you might consider to be its left wing.  So, rather than the wing being parallel to the surface of the earth, it was perpendicular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about five seconds before it passed behind our left wing.  I asked the Raleigh Approach controller: what just passed Airline/flt. # so and so?  I was specific when I asked him.  I stated that it was just to our south, and at our altitude, flying from a generally southwest direction to the northeast.  The controller took a little longer than normal to reply.  He said he didn’t have anything on radar.  Then he waited a little bit longer, and asked if I had seen anything.  I knew it was better, at the time, to keep my mouth shut, so my reply was along the lines of:  no, I guess not.  The controller didn’t press, and I didn’t offer anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This vehicle was unusual in a couple of ways.  It flew on the tip of a wing, level (as it were) and didn’t seem to have any problem maintaining altitude.  There was no, visible, means of propulsion.  It didn’t leave any type of trail.  It was approx. fifty feet (plus or minus ten feet) from tip to tip, and from its *nose* to the trailing edge of its *wing* was no more than maybe twenty to twenty five feet.  It was a dull grey, kind of like battleship grey, and there wasn’t anything on the side that was visible to me that looked light lights.  There were no markings at all, that were obvious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I had been totally taken in by this thing when it flew past us.  After it passed behind the left wing, I asked to FO and FE if they had seen it.  They had not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC has exchanged a number of e-messages with the party who submitted this report, who is a retired senior captain for a major U. S. airline.

We pulled the car over to the side of the road to observe the object. The object was a considerable distance away from us at that time. There was a pasture to our left in between us and the object and all of a sudden the object was at the edge of the pasture over the trees out the drivers side window. It looked maybe the size of a large house. It turned like it was angling down toward us and it was lights,very bright, in the shape of a cross. I personally, at the time felt we were being scanned or analyzed by the object. I don&#39;t know if we experienced lost time or what . The next thing i remember was looking at the digital clock in my friends car and it said 11:11 pm. Ever since then, if i&#39;m around a clock at 11:11, i&#39;ll automatically look at the clock for some reason. It&#39;s really weird. Something just makes me look at the clock at that time. The object backed off a little, slowly and then shot off to the W/NW at great speed. It happened on a country road between Henderson, Oxford, and Youngsville off hwy. 56. There was no other traffic on that rd. at the time. Theres alot of weird stuff going on in this area. Other people have seen things too. I know two guys who live in the Watkins community of Vance Co. which is a very rural area w/ alot of woods, saw one land in the woods behind their house. They walked down in there about 200 yds. and came in contact w/ the object. It made a humming sound and had lights flashing in sequence around it. The closer they got , the faster the lights would flash in sequeqnce. They got scared and ran back to their house. The object was said to be small, about the size of a full sized van. If anybody in the world wants to see some weird, unexplainable stuff in the sky, just come to Henderson for about a week and go out into some of these areas i&#39;ve described. I&#39;ll guarantee you will see something that will blow your mind!!! Theirs something weird going on here, ! theres n o doubt about that. The cross in the sky is not the only thing i&#39;ve witnessed,by far. It is the closest i&#39;ve been to one ( I think ). I wish someone would at least come and investigate the weird things that are happening around here. I would gladly assist any way I could. Some, or most people are skeptical to my accounts but i would pass a lie detector test w/ no problem.     Thanks.<n>

One nite while hooking up to a trailer at a large chemical factory I saw a large group of lites passing over head. THe lites were flying very close to each other. I thought it was a low flying jetliner with it&#39;s landing gear open which would be very unusal for around here. After the lites passed over head all of them changed to a flying Vee formation that is when I knew that all those lites were seperate objects. Also there wasn&#39;t any sound. Even with all the noise in the plant there sould have been some sound.<n>

Driving home we had to sit at a red light crossing the frwy at a bit of a downhill grade. My son sits low in the front seat.  He pointed up and slightly to the right and said, &#34;Mommy, what’s that?&#34;   I lifted my sun visor and bent forward to see what he was pointing at.   We saw a large football shaped object hovering above an apartment complex.  We use to live in that complex years before so, I know how big the area is there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object hovered above the complex and was almost the same size as a football field including bleachers space!  It had a soft glow of white and no defined edges, no windows, no sound. I froze for a moment then shoved it in park, threw open my van door, and stood out on the step of the van.  I looked at the truck behind us, waved at them and pointed back up at it.  They too leaned down a bit to look under their visors, saw it, and they both raised their arms up to push up their visors at the same time their mouths wide open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back and it was still there and all of a sudden, I got scared and sat back in the van closing my door, looking up from inside with my son again the object sped quietly upward at an angle to the right, getting smaller.  Now the size of a baseball it stopped and changed course speeding upward in the opposite direction so fast and kept going till it disappeared.  Its flight path was in the shape of the letter V= (&gt;) like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment the light turned green we drove through and on the other side of the freeway was a field, parked along it was a man’s truck.  He was in the field staring at a deer that was frozen scared staring back at him.  As he inched closer, I pulled over, jumped out and yelled, &#34;Did you see it!?&#34;  He said, &#34;See what?&#34;  I said the ufo, it was over there above that apartment complex&#34;  He said, &#34;In broad daylight, no?!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> He looked at me like I was nuts and I ran back to my van and drove away...I remember one thing really struck me as odd.  Just before my son said, &#34;Mommy, what’s that?&#34; !  I had be en repeating over and over in my mind-- Turn green, turn green, turn green.  When my son spoke to me it was as if he broke a trance I was in.  I had felt like I had been possessed to keep my attention on the red light in the intersection, the man and the deer too. It was as if he was made to stare only at the deer.  The deer was unusually frozen in its tracks.  HOW COULD HE NOT SEE IT!!! unless he was in some sort of trance too.  Why was my son unafected by this trance?  I don’t know, maybe they didn’t think he needed to be.  You know how you get a strange feeling someone is staring at you!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well that’s the feeling that frightened me into getting back in the van.  I felt like many eyes were watching me!  They saw me!  It has taking me years to be able to say this.  Aliens from another world looked at me and only at me for that moment in time that I stood on the step of my van.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve read many stories over the years, but none described the massive ship I saw.  Please tell me if you heard of any ships as big as this one. I can’t be alone on this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Received by MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP - http://ufomig.bravehost.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Faster than any jet. I would stop, move, disappear, and reappear. This went on for 15 minutes. I turned off the hwy. to my sister&#39;s house. While parking, a hoovering sound startled me. A triangular craft moved slowly over my car. It was gray/silver with three large white circles in a triangular pattern on the underside. The circles looked like lights that were not on. The lights took up most of the underside. It was sleek and aerodynamic looking. It dissappeared and the only sign of what direction it took were the bent trees 100 yards away. Two children playing next door upstairs saw the craft also. As it left the house trembled. We live near Warner Robins AFB. This base has managed to stay around although hundreds of simular bases have closed!<n>

I lived on air bases all my life- please read the following information. I have sent this stuff the Art Bell... this WAS REAL. It was NOT FROM THIS WORLD !!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Whitley, (I also sent this to Art.) I am in a most unique position. I have been observing the night sky since 1983 from a snowcat in the high Sierras. Where I am, from midnight to morning, there is no light pollution. I have seen some extraordinary night- sky natural phenomena that were quite spectacular- I would love to tell you about them. I once saw a Macy’s- sized chunk of ice light up the entireTahoe basin a cobalt blue as bright as day… it must have been as big as an iceberg… skipped across the upper atmosphere in a swath of cobalt- blue light spewing green and gold sparks. Rock and metal, I imagine… the ionizing H2O lit the night sky like a magnesium flare.  I was perched on a crag of rock at the top of Echo Summit kicking back in my Bombardier snowcat at the top of Sierra At Tahoe ski area taking a break and watching the comet two years ago… when this GIANT meteorite- if you could call it that, it had to be almost all ice-gouged it’s way sluggishly across the top of the atmosphere… Though spectacularly beautiful, such sights do not make the spine tingle and the skin crawl, the hair stand on end..…but I saw something that did one night, and that story follows… Please read this letter. I think you will find it interesting- I love Dreamland- I am fascinated by the people who call in who have seen UFO’s- because I had an amazing encounter with one, and so did my father, who was a United Airlines pilot for thirty years. I never DREAMED I would have such an experience. My God, when it happens to YOU it changes the way you look at the night sky FOREVER. As you will read, the craft I saw could not even be from our corner of this solar system, as it defied the local constants of physics completely. Here are my stories. Absolutely true. They read like installment- articles because they were posts I made to a together-list on the net. If you think it would be of interest to your listeners, I would enjoy talking to you on the air about my years in cats at night in the high Sierra. I am articulate and though this is not the same, perhaps, as being an abductee, still, my range of night sky observations make for interesting listening. Call me if you’d like to talk about it. I enjoy relating the stories. In January of 1992 I was sitting in my Bombardier snowcat on a run at Sierra at Tahoe, Echo Summit, Hwy. 50, South Lake Tahoe. It was around 3AM, I was making snow on Broadway. I was rested, had NOT been drinking or taking any kind of mind- altering substances !!! I am NOT a recreational drug user! I was facing to the east... the night sky was very dark and clear, with almost no light coming up from the Tahoe Basin, which was about ten miles to the east. I saw an oddly bright orange ball of fire coming up in the direction of the basin...it had unusual detail in the corona, kind of a flickering. I thought about it and decided I was looking at the exhaust of a large jet taking off out of Tahoe airport and flying directly away from me... thus the orange ball of fire. It did occur to me as odd, because large jets had ceased regular service to Tahoe several months earlier. It was raising up quite quickly...then it abruptly- and by abruptly, I mean instantaneously! took off north at a speed that made it a streak of bright orange fire. Then it stopped of a dime, hovered motionless for a second, then proceeded to do a number of these maneuvers over the next sixty seconds. I got the major willies. I was not scared, but I knew that nothing any human could build in THIS age could withstand those kind of forces- OR accelerate with the speed of the USS Enterprise going into Warpdrive. I jumped out of my cat almost instantly, looking all around to see if there were any other sources of light that could have caused a reflection on the inside of my windshield- but there weren&#39;t, and there it was, still making the same movements. I would guess from the detail and from the fact that it was to my side of a couple of peaks in the far off distance that it was three to five miles away... Then it shot straight down out of sight- and reappeared a few seconds later, shot up to about 5,000 feet above me- hovered for a minute, then instantly rose at a speed beyond anything previous, shooting straight up into the sky on a pillar o! f orange light that looked like a neon tube, and kept going, right on out of the atmosphere. I could see it for a long time, it was visible all the way out of the atmosphere. I had tried to call another cat operator to check it out but he was out of his cat at the time and busy with the snowgun he was running and did not look up. However, I was to learn this last year that I am not the only one in the Tahoe basin to see this type of craft. During my sighting of this orange fiery object, the manuevers it performed  gave me the willies- I was not fearful, the thing was a long way off- but it was covering a lot of miles on it&#39;s one-second trajectories. It moved across the night sky approximately 40 to 60 degrees...left to right, right to left, with huge altitude changes, and some of it&#39;s movements were shorter and more nearly vertical. I could not think of any possible reason for these weird manuevers. It was moving so fast that there was no real appreciable acceleration or deceleration... it was stationary, then there was a streak of orange light, then it was stationary somewhere else for a moment. I was very happy and excited to witness this. I always wondered if maybe I would see some strange phenomenon in the sky, being up in a cat on the top of the Sierra where visibility is so good, but never thought I would see anything so clearly impossible by present human technological standards... and never before or since have I seen anything so wild.. Four months after the UFO sighting in 1992, I went to a local pizza parlor where a friend was putting on the showing of a Christic Institute film called &#34;the secret war&#34;, narrated by Elizabeth Montgomery (see it if you ever have the chance- it&#39;s about the Iran Contra affair) and at the show was a very odd, spooky looking guy who said nothing until everyone was on the verge of leaving, then asked if he could have a moment to speak to everyone. He admitted that he was not there for the movie, but rather, wanted to know if anyone present had seen any ufo&#39;s in the Tahoe Basin... I thought about that for a moment and went over and said, yes, I had. He then asked me if it had been coming from the direction of the lake. I said it seemed to be...HE THEN ASKED ME IF IT WAS AN ORANGE BALL OF LIGHT. I said, yes.... WAS IT MAKING JERKY MOVEMENTS. I got the willies all over again! I looked more closely at this guy... tall, thin, gaunt, wild- eyed, looked like he had been maybe had a real bad fright he never got over… Spooky... I asked him, how the HELL did you know WHAT I SAW? He said,that&#39;s what EVERYBODY&#39;S BEEN SEEING. Turns out he had seen one like mine a couple of years earlier and had been so affected by it that he had been traveling around the Lake Tahoe Basin asking people about sightings, and he had come up with a bunch of people who had all observed similar craft- coming out of the lake or from near the lake, orange- white balls of fire, jerky, high- acceleration movement and eventual flight straight up. He asked me if I wanted to know why they made the jerky movements. He said he had talked to people from Nevada who “knew about these things”... said the air force &amp; CIA had learned from the Roswell craft that the controls in these things were bioelectronic, that the beings set their hands into little recesses in the seats and interfaced their own nervous systems into the craft&#39;s guidance systems, which were part-biological, and that focussed microwave beams could disrupt and disable the craft- and that the ! operator s did these maneuvers in order to avoid being shot down! Well, I don&#39;t know if I believe that. for one thing, why couldn&#39;t they just go blazing straight out of the atmosphere at a zillion knots, that should be sufficient to avoid being shot down. But I do know this- I know what I saw that night, and it was not of this planet. No human- OR human machine- could take such forces without becoming pate’... and no structure running under the known physical constants of our little part of the universe could suffer such G forces without turning into little pieces of scrap metal. It seems to me that these things carry around with them the local constants of some other part of the universe. In fact, I have a friend who works for the air force at Edwards who wires obsolete fighters to be used as drones to be shot down by pilots in gunnery school who told me about the Aurora project... 9G&#39;s, but pilotless... flies on some kind of propane pulse engine... it&#39;s what they&#39;ve been seeing and hearing in LA, the things that leave the smoke rings up high in the sky... and that is a primitive and slow craft compared to what I saw that night. This last winter, I started at Sierra and had been working for a few weeks...while in the cat barn, I heard a couple of snowmakers talking...one of them said, &#34;Keep your eyes out for those &#34;UFO&#39;S&#34; Chuck, the security guard, has been seeing! Yeah, said he saw some BIG ORANGE BALLOF FIRE MAKING JERKY MOTIONS IN THE SKY...Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!!” I turned around and said, WHAT DID YOU SAY!!! WHO saw this! They told me and I tracked him down... a retired man who works at Sierra as a security guard... turned out he and his wife were on the deck of their house last summer off of North Upper Truckee Road, looking south toward Meiss Meadow... which puts their sighting about the same place MINE was, - TRIANGULATION tells us more accurately where the things seem to be coming from- and he described the EXACT SAME THING I SAW. IDENTICAL. He was worried about me telling people, he didn&#39;t want people at Sierra to know, he was afraid they&#39;d think him crazy. What I have related here is all true. SOMEthing IS going on !!! I can&#39;t BELIEVE we humans fly around in machines that can do what I saw that night. I DON&#39;T think that it&#39;s US. It&#39;s THEM. Whoever they are...I just hope- they&#39;re friendly. “My father was a pilot for United Airlines for 29 years... once he returned home with a wild story about seeing a UFO... and here it is. My father is a very humorless and pragmatic individual who never had much interest in gags or jokes... so I was interested to hear his tale of seeing a UFO once in 1970...I was fourteen... he came back from a flight and told me this story... &#34;We were enroute from Chicago to LaGuardia when ground control advised us to be on the lookout for a large object that was on their radar and had been observed by several airliners in the area...as we got closer to the object we picked it up on our screen... we had a United VicePresident aboard, a captain, co- pilot,(my dad) second officer(engineer) and four stewardesses...all of whom saw the object-There were two other airliners watching the thing when we got visual on It. It had been doing high- speed erratic manuevers but was stationary when we got it on radar... then it started pacing us, staying several miles ahead and to the right...then ground control asks us, is it still there? It just went off of our screen! Right out of the MIDDLE of the screen...We had it in visual contact, as did another aircraft, but it just blinked off of everyone&#39;s radar, one by one...we were most interested in it at that point...then it shot across our flight path to our port side, and it was so fast you almost couldn&#39;t see it, just a blur...then it paced us for a while on our port side...it was a large sphere,maybe a hundred feet across or bigger...it had a green light on top and a red light on the bottom, both lights alternately tracing a path around the perimeter of the body of the craft, the green doing a half-circle across the top, left to right, the red doing an arc across the bottom half, right to left...then it shot at us at perhaps 2000- 3000 miles per hour, passing under us to our left perhaps several hundred yards below us. The shock wave rattled the airplane violently, as if we had hit a huge air pocket...&#34; About a week after my father came home with this story, a letter marked &#39;confidential&#39; came in the mail from the air force. My father was out of town on a flight. I was very curious to know if it had anything to do with his sighting. I opened it. (I knew he wouldn&#39;t care) It requested my father to attend a meeting in Manhattan in a week to discuss the sighting and it specified that he was not allowed to discuss the sighting with ANYONE, including family. This confirmed to me that he had seen what he said he did.Then, the capper: in 1993, I was watching a special, a Sixty-Minutes sort of thing on UFO&#39;s, and there was one segment that went as follows: in 1970, two airforce fighter pilots were scrambled over Norad in the Rockies to check out a large UFO which was in Norad airspace and not responding to identification requests. Both of these pilots, since retired, were able to get fairly close to the thing before it took off at a zillion miles an hour...they said, (and it was another of those getting- the- willies- moments) it was a large sphere with a green and red light, both moving in a semicircle around it, alternating left to right. They saw exactly what my father saw, same year, same continent, just 1800 miles away... This was the story he told us, my mom and me. I was very surprised and as it was extremely out of character for him to make up a story like this, I believed he had seen SOMEthing....<n>
