The object was about 1/2 mile from us. We thought it was an airplane coming at us but as we got closer we noticed it was not moving. Why I did this is beyond me now, but I pulled up next to it and stopped. It was hovering above the ditch in the exact location where the main entrance to Carl Sandburg College is located now. The college campus didn&#39;t exist there in 1967. My fiancee opened her door and stood on the pavement looking at it. I leaned towards her open door then got out my side also. A beam of light like a spotlight came on and shown at an angle down on the ground to the west then it slowly moved off tinto that direction.  The object was approximately ten feet to our right and 20 feet in the air so we were very close to it. It  sounded like a huge vacum cleaner. There was no air movement, like blade wash liike from a helicopter, nor was it an airplane. We drove down to a corner and turned south just in time to see it accelerate then shoot straight up into the air in southwesternly direction, and at an incredible speed. A police report was filed and an officer went back to the area later that night with me. There had been a few  strange lights observed in and around Galesburg a few days before, and one hoax where a few guys floated a large balloon with a light attached to it, over town. This was no balloon., airplane, helicopter, or experimental aircraft...not in 1967.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was 12 years old. It was nearing sundown,the sky was overcast, on Woodlawn Ave. near the SW corner of the city. Four or five of my friends  (I can only remember [name deleted] being one of them)and I were just playing &#34;Tag&#34; or some other game we played outdoors, when one of the guys started screaming like a mad man. His eyes were poping out of his head.I was facing him and ducked because he was looking and pointing behind me like something was going to hit me in the head or something. I spun around and did&#39;nt see anybody close to me. But within a second or two it caught my attention. There in the sky was an object which looked to me like a &#34;grey banana&#34; with the ends pointing up, and rocking to-and-fro on it&#39;s bottom arc like a rocking chair. We wathced it for 30-45 seconds then we took off. It was hovering low, Im guessing 3-4 hundred feet in altitude and 75 or 100 feet across point to point and 25 feet or so in diameter with no lights or sound at all. We all ran as fast as we could to ((deleted--neighbor&#39;s)) house looking back as we ran. It seemed to be following us, so we all went sliding under his dads pickup truck. ( I think we followed the leader to get away from it.) We were there for a good half hour&#39;s time because nobody had enough guts to look to see if it had gone. Thankfully it had by the time we came out. I get the EEBEE JEEBEEs so bad when I think about it. Goose bumps and all. I&#39;ve only told my wife about it. I&#39;m 47 years old now and this is still the most vivid memory of my life so far!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was apx 8:00 am on a weekend when we were called outside by a neighbor to observe this object.  The object was circular and glowed an ultra-violet blue w/a solid black center.  The object was stationary directly over us and although located in the fast moving broken cloud cover it did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object for apx 30-45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a camo colored twin engine Air Force jet which came from the southeast and flew by the object.  We could clearly see the exhaust from the jet as it came towards the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the jet was apx 200-300 ft. from the object the exhaust smoke cut off and the jet glided past on one side and the exhaust resumed when the jet was apx the same distance past it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jet made a circle and the same thing happened as the jet passed on the opposite side of the object.  The jet at that time left the area heading back to the southeast.  The object was apx 3-4 times ! the size of the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The official Air Force report was that the object was a weather balloon.  There was a lot of media calls about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This beggs 2 questions from me that did not make any sense. (1)  How could a weather balloon stay stationary for all of the time we were watching it in the wind?  (2)  Why would the Air Force send an observation jet to look at a weather balloon?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up the jet in the library and it was a state of the art photo-recon jet of the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never know what it really was but it would be nice if the Air Force would release the &#34;TRUE&#34; photos that the jet had taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

3/10/67 23:00|Mt. Washington|NH|Circle|2 min|Three incidents that happened to me in the White Mountains. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68866.html|4|ndxe196703| Three incidents that happened to me in the White Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were hiking to Tuckerman&#39;s Ravine on Mt. Washington late at night in 1967. We were both 17 and still in High School.   I decided to rest on a very large rock and drink some wine. We were laying on our backs looking up at the stars when my friend said, &#34;look at that star moving across the sky&#34;.  I  said, &#34;That must be the satellite echo, the one covered with a reflective surface.&#34;  Then my friend started stuttering which was a complete surprise to me.  He said &#34;Tha tha that&#39;s no satellite, it&#39;s reading my mind.  Then I connected also and it flashed a great big &#34;Hello&#34; like in lights in my brain, and then it shot off toward the moon and disappeared into a speck and then gone.  It&#39;s possible that we were abducted because I can&#39;t remember anything about the trip after that except driving home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are two more incidents connected to this.  One happened 7 years earlier in 1960 when I was 10 years old.  This time my family was with me, my father, brother and mother. Hiking from the top of Mt. Washington to Mt. Adams, I became very ill and had a 104 degree temperature. When we finally made it to the Mt. Adams hut, I was burning up. My mother asked everyone at the hut if they were a doctor. One couple told her, &#34;We are not doctors, but we can heal your son&#34;. She said &#34;OK&#34; and brought them to me in the mens dorm. They explained to her what they were going to do. &#34;We are going to put our hands on your son&#39;s chest and remove the fever.&#34; The woman put her hands on my chest and the man put his hands on her elbows. Immediately they started to withdraw from the burning heat that drained out of my chest. The man said to the women, &#34;Did you burn your fingers?&#34; She said &#34;yes&#34; and I could see her fingers were bright red. I felt completely better immediately. My mother took my temperature and it was back to 98.6. My mother will vouch that all this happened. My brother and father didn&#39;t see it and didn&#39;t believe it. We learned later that this couple belonged to the Atherious Society. The next incide! nt happe ned seven years after the second incident, which was listed first. , when I was 24. Again, I was hiking to the Mt. Adams hut, this time with my 17 year old cousin. We wanted to go to the top of Mt. Adams first, but there was a large man completely covered in rain gear and all you could see were his eyeballs. He was standing at the base of the trail to the top and he roughly told us we couldn&#39;t hike up there because of the bad weather. It was windy, but it wasn&#39;t very cold and it was a bright sunny day. I could see a lot of people coming down from the top. We were a little annoyed but decided to take his advice and take the short cut to the Mt. Adams hut. When we were about 50 feet away, something lifted us up in the air about 4 feet and layed us on the ground gently on our backs. I looked back, but the man was gone. I was sure he had done this to us.  Again, I don&#39;t remember discussing this at the time and ever again with my cousin. A few years later, I wrote to Betty Hill after Barney had died. I told her about these incidents and I got a wonderful letter back from her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/3/67 22:00|Oak Grove|LA|Unknown|30 Minutes|My girlfriend and I were having a romantic evening in the front seat of my car one evening.  I looked across a field that lay in front|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45415.html|5|ndxe196703| My girlfriend and I were having a romantic evening in the front seat of my car one evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked across a field that lay in front of us and saw what I thought at the time was a helicopter about a mile away moving back and forth.  I mentioned this to my girlfriend and we watched it for a couple of minutes.  It descended on the other side of the field and we forgot it as we were preoccupied.  Later I noticed that the object had reappeared and was moving erractically across the horizon.  I noticed that it was getting progressively closer and finally realized that it was heading directly toward my car across the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I remember was two lights blinking alternately.  One was red and the other green as I remember.  About half way across the field it stopped.  I knew it was close to the ground for I could see the reflexion of the light on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now we were both interested and did not know what to make of it.  It continued across the field directly towards us.  When it had gotten to a point very close to us, I think I panicked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was parked in a position just across a narrow bridge with no backup light that would make it difficult for me to back up.  I made the decision to crank up and drive toward the object instead.  When I turned on my headlights it stopped and the green light became a bright white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued (without applying too much accelerator) down the road that would lead me directly under the object.  I was as scared as I have ever been in my life as we came closer to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my girlfriend to move to the other side of the car and see if she could see anything.  She did and came back across the seat screaming that all she heard was a whirring sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued slowly down the road expecting the worst.  When I had gotten far enough along that I could see it in my rearview mirror, I stopped and got out to look.  At this time it took off with more speed than anything we have today.  It was a streak of light.  It was seen going over the town of Oak Grove that night by friends of mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were many sightings of it during that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw my ex-girlfriend many years later and brought up this event to her.  At first she had no recollection of it at all.  She finally said that she thought she remembered something about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a real occurence and I have often wondered how she could have possibly forgotten something like that.  She and I went back out many times trying to see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh well.<n>
3/2/67 19:50|Hickman|KY|Formation|20 minutes|6 objects disappear and reappear jumping about 5 miles of airspace to dodge an airplane.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98618.html|6|ndxe196703| 6 objects disappear and reappear jumping about 5 miles of airspace to dodge an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> March 2, 1967, was the date of this event.  I am now a Christian minister in Tennessee.  I am now 61.  When I was 14 the following event took place  8 miles SW of Hickman, Kentucky.  I was out in the back yard (country without street light) with a pair of cheap binoculars just looking around.  It was dark and appeared to be no clouds in the sky.  A full moon was shining as it came up in the east.  I was looking west across a field and woods.  About 23 miles SW of Hickman is Tiptonville, TN.    Southwest into Arkansas is located the Blysville Air Force Base in Arkansas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As first I noticed 3 lights in a V formation.  I looked around in other directions and looked back and saw 6 lights in two V formations.  They were just above the trees from my view but were close to the location of the winding Mississippi River about 5-10 miles away.  These lights appeared to be following the course of the Mississippi River.  I went into the house and told my daddy and we went out on the front porch facing north to observe them.  They were about 2-4 miles NW.  They were bright and there was no sound.  Daddy said they were probably airplanes with landing lights on.  I said ‘but there is no sound’.  Daddy went back in the house.  I watched with curiosity.  I heard an airplane coming from the east (probably from Union City direction).  It was making the usual sound a plane would make.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The airplane appeared to be on a collision course with the 6 lights.  I was intensely watching because I expected something to happen to the airplane if these were real UFOs.  My eyes were focused on the airplane.  My side-view I could see the 6 lights.  I looked quickly left and only saw 4 lights.  By now the airplane was in the air-space of the first 2 lights.  Out of the corner of my right vision I saw the 2 lights about 5 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my attention back to the airplane.  Again I took a quick glance to the left and only saw 2 lights.  I immediately looked to the right and saw 4 lights in the distance.  Then I figured out what they were (impossibly) doing.  This time I focused my attention on the last 2 lights left of the airplane.  As the airplane was approaching near their air-space the 2 lights started to sparkle bigger at the top and narrow at the bottom (kind of like a top).  When the 2 lights went out I immediately turned my gaze to the location of the 4 lights at my right.  Then I observed the 2 lights starting to sparkle (bigger at the top and narrow at the bottom) and then come on like a light bulb glowing.  The airplane was all by itself.  The 6 lights were still in formation and they never broke stride (speed).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at my watch.  It was 8 o’clock.  I stayed out in the yard.  At 8:10 I heard the roar of jet planes coming from the SW in the direction of the Blysville Air Force Base.  They came very low over our house.  They were F4 Phantom jet fighters.  There were 2 of them and they were proceeding in the direction where I last saw the 6 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This means there should be a record at Blysville Air Force base of this event on radar.  I do not know if the airplane pilot made any report on this date.<n>
3/1/67 19:30|Whittier|CA|Oval|2 seconds|Two observers witnessed 500-foot long oval craft  with lighted porthole windows flying low over Whittier.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43204.html|7|ndxe196703| Two observers witnessed 500-foot long oval craft  with lighted porthole windows flying low over Whittier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A good friend of mine who I have known for 10 years, recently told me about a UFO he saw in 1967.  Since he is an artist, I asked him to draw me a picture of the UFO, which he did, and which he gave me permission to post, and which is attached here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the story as related to me by him on Sept. 9, 2004. (Bear in mind, this incident occured about 37 years ago!): My friend was living in Whittier, California in early Spring, 1967 (approximate date).  He was with his wife over at a co-worker&#39;s house for dinner, and after dinner he and his co-worker went out on the patio of the house in Whittier, and they were standing there, leaning back slightly, at about 7:00 pm - 7:30 pm, (it was dark out) and they were talking about work.  He and his co-worker were both electricians, and they had been working together that day.  Their wives were in the house at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they were on the patio, the UFO (depicted in the drawing) flew by, going from south to north, approximately as depicted.  It was travelling at approximately 100 mph to 200 mph, at a steady, uniform speed, and was totally silent.  (No engine noise.  No noise at all.)  It was in the view of both of these gentlemen for approximately two seconds.  It was approximately 500 feet long, approximately 100 feet diameter.  There were hundreds of windows, or port holes, approximately as shown, which were approximately 3 feet in diameter and approximatley 10 feet apart (10 feet spacing).  The windows, or port holes, were filled with bright white light.  The UFO was travelling approximately 100 to 125 feet above the ground.  It was approximately 150 feet away from these two observers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark out, but my friend got the impression that the UFO was silver in color, although he is not sure about that.  He was close enough to the UFO that he would have been able to see &#34;passengers&#34; in the windows, or port holes, if there had been any &#34;passengers&#34;.  No &#34;passengers&#34; were observed in the windows or port holes; only bright white light.  Both individual witnesses observed the craft as described.  Immediately they went inside the house to tell their wives what they had just witnessed and to report the UFO to the Air Force, or to the police.  However, when they went in the house they observed on television at the time was a news story about some kids who had released helium balloons with Aluminum-foil attached earlier that morning near Griffith Park, and it created a big traffic jam on the Golden State freeway, and many people had reported this as UFOs.  As a result, my friend and his co-worker decided not to report the UFO because, in view of the news story on television about the kids&#39; balloons and the resultant UFO reports regarding the balloons, because he and his co-worker decided that their report would probably not be taken seriously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He remarked that the general shape of the UFO was that of a blimp, however in every other respect (speed, size, silence, hundreds of brightly lit windows, etc.) it was definitely not a blimp, or any other kind of conventional craft; it was a &#34;UFO&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the data above about this incident (size, distance, speed, location, etc.), which occured in 1967, was provided to me by my friend - in response to my questions - on Sept. 9, 2004, (~37 years after the event) and are approximate only, and are &#34;ball-park&#34; estimates given to me by him.  So, if the sketch does not agree exactly with the dimensions provided, this is why.  (Also, I would like to add that -in my opinion - memories of short duration of significant events that happened a long time ago can still be somewhat accurately remembered.  For example, did you ever break a neighbor&#39;s window as a kid with a baseball?  Can you still see the baseball shattering the glass?) **************************** Something bothers me about all of this: I cannot understand &#34;helium balloons with Aluminum-foil attached, released by kids&#34;, causing a major jam-up on the freeway, UFO reports, and major news coverage!!! Here is what I speculate: There was major UFO activity in that general area (southern California) that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFOs were reported, and the UFO sightings caused a major jam-up on the freeways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Disinformation was then released by the government in the form of a fictitious &#34;made-up&#34; story about kids with balloons and Aluminum foil (similar to other fictitious reports released by the government regarding &#34;weather balloons&#34; and &#34;swamp gas&#34;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO seen by by friend and his co-worker may have been related to the other UFOs reported earlier in that same day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And, there may have been others who sighted it who did not report it for similar reasons to my friend and his co-worker not reporting it! (I doubt that this was an experimental military craft; why would it be flying so low over a heavily populated area?!  Experimental military craft are usually tested out over the desert, or ocean, away from people.) (As I have stated, this is just my speculation.) So, I would like to ask these questions: 1. Has anyone ever seen a UFO with characteristics similar to this, anywhere? 2. Does anyone know anything about news stories of UFO reports in 1967 near Griffith Park (in southern California) causing traffic jams on the Golden State freeway? (There have been many thousands of UFO reports throughout the past half-century or more, but this one seems to be a little bit different!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
