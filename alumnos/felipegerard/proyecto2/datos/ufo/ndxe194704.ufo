4/15/47 23:00|San Deigo|CA|Triangle|10 ,seconds|The craft was V shaped with an arodinamic  body the thrust was in the form of the spectrum.|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38042.html|1|ndxe194704| The craft was V shaped with an arodinamic  body the thrust was in the form of the spectrum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a cloudy night I saw bright colored ligh trails through the clouds red was the dominant color,there was a large clear space in the clouds it appeared to be ten miles in lenght and about three miles across,Six triangular objects appeared out of the clouds they were in a V formation and trailing behind them was a long spectrum of light,they dove at a steep angle down and very low to the ground,In their dive the spectrum behind them begane to shorten and they slowed down.The craft passed before Me,and I was standing on a small hill able to see inside of the closest one It had a window about 4ft.by 3ft.and set back into the craft about 4&#34; with a metalic frame,the inside was an off white with pure white lights iminating the inside ,on the far side and forward there was a smaller window in the same shape,rounded corners.The craft was black and despit its  (V) shape frome below from the side view it had a very arodinamic shape, it had front windows that were very small and blacked out,it had no tail, the back one third was slanted down to where the particles came out of the back and the nose came to a blunt point,I felt as though I could put my hand over the blunt nose.The front windows came from the top of the craft and decended to the begenning of the nose.It passed by at a very fast speed a lot of what I saw was a blured but I did see a lot,it dissapeared behind some houses and I thought that it was going to crash,but they pulled up very steepely I got a glimpse of the top veiw but my young mind could not interpret the info. very well,the last thing I saw were the six craft linning  up vertically and acending into the sky with their spectrums trailing behind them.I forgot to mention that the spectrum of the craft I was observing fell into particles straight down into the ground as it flew on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
