Was standing looking south on 6th Street,in Philadelphia, when this fireball streaked eastwardly,not more than a block from where I was standing at a height of less than a thousand feet. This fireball was huge, it changed colors faster than my mind could register from yellow to orange to green to blue but not in any special order and like I said it changed colors so fast I couldn&#39;t tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day in the Philadelphia Inquirer there was a report of the ball of fire landing in the Atlantic Ocean one mile off of where Resorts International is.

5/24/78 01:30|Paramus (Route 4, eastbound lane)|NJ|Cigar|7 to 10 minutes|I don't remember the exact date It happened. In 1978 when i was driving home to new york state. I was driving home on route 4 west when|2/16/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05296.html|2|ndxe197805| I don&#39;t remember the exact date It happened. In 1978 when i was driving home to new york state. I was driving home on route 4 west when I noticed to my left on the east bound side of route 4. An object that i thought was a helicopter at tree top level it  was a cigar shaped craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home to New York State from River Edge New Jersey. I got onto route 4 west about 1:30 - 2:00 am I just pulled onto the highway when i noticed on my left side on the east bound lane I saw what i thought was a helicopter i slowed down to look at it and i took a good look at it and i knew it was&#39;nt a helicopter. I rolled down my window to look at it and i did&#39;nt hear any engine sound it was silent. When i noticed it was cigar shaped i got scared and steped on the gas to get away. It was odd that when i stepped on the gas it sped up the same instant as me  and when i slowed down it slowed down the same instant that i did.It was like they knew what my every move was going to be. I went up the highway looking out my window and it was still on the other side of the road following me and going the same speed as i was driving. I was approching route 17 north which was the next road for me to take to go home.Just before i got onto route 17 i pulled over to the side of the shoulder and stopped. It stopped and hovered in silence across the other side of the highway.I got out of my car and there was a dead silence it moved from the tree tops down to the front of the trees and i could see inside the windows on the side of the craft and i saw two figures that did&#39;nt look like human beings and when i saw that i jumped into my car and sped off to the on ramp of route 17 north i looked behind me and it was following me and i don&#39;t remember getting on route 17 north the next thing i remembered was i was pulling into my driveway in Middletown New York and it was daybreak the sun was starting to come up It was about 5:00am. The odd thing about it is that it takes 1 hour to get from River Edge to Middletown New York. I have about 4 hours of missing time. To this day Im still bothered about what happened to me. The next day it was in the bergen county news paper that there was alot of sightings of ufo&#39;s over paramus new jersey the same area i was driving my car. The police station was swamped with calls of alot o! f  people that saw the ufo. I am in the process of trying to get a copy of the newspaper from the hacensack public library It should be on microfilm. I was wondering if you have any knowlege of this ufo incident that happened in 1978. And if you can help me with any information about this or someone in my area of new jersey that can help me out with my missing time I would appreciate your help very much.<n>

However the incident is still real 24 or so years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a radar operator in the Royal Navy and at that time I was based on an aircraft carrier. We were doing an exercise in and around the carribean sea when I was looking at the air plot (air radar display) and assisting the fighter controller complete a search with a couple Phantom fighters and a Gannet aircraft..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything was ok and very quiet and the exercise was going through a quiet period that was until on the long range plot I saw, what could only be discribed as a very large cloud about 80-100 miles in diameter travelling at about 750-900 miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had always had some very good reports and complements about my accurate relative valocity calculations up to that date and thereafter. However, I never for got that incident and the ridicule afterwards even by senior officers who witnessed what I saw...When I reported it I was told it was nothing and to forget it and get on with the task in hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am twenty something years older now and live in Northern ((deleted)) with my wife. I know what I saw and I was right in my calculations, hence to say I never saw anything like it again... Except that is, when I saw the movie Close encounters 2-3 years later and then Independence day in the mid ninties... Often wonder if what I saw in my radar display was real or just a glitch but what I do know it travelled across my screen from 020 to 190 (nne to ssw) in a matter of minutes that would be about 4-500 miles...<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone has had a simular experience I would love to here about it!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My friend and I were walking somewhere to join other friends to &#34;hang out&#34;. Though we did at times use alcohol and marijuana at that age, we were both very sober and &#34;straight&#34; at the time of this occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked up when we noticed the very large, silent, slow-moving object passing over our heads above the trees at a slow speed. It was about the size of a football field, shaped like an elongated, irregularly shaped triangle. Its appearance was most like that of a gray rock though it did have the shape I have noted. It was silent and had a bluish glow from the back as if it were emitting some sort of flame or exhaust. This was the only light visible and we only noticed that after it passed us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we saw it we were both amazed, exclaiming to each other, &#34;what the (expletive) is that?!!&#34; We began to run after it, in the direction it was moving slowly and soundlessly (North by Northwest) until we realized that there was no way we were going to keep up with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then stood watching it fly on, as it continued to head out toward Cape Cod Bay. (though we could not see the water from where we were. It apparently continued on out over Cape Cod Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amazed at what we had seen, we returned to my house to tell our skeptical families and friends what we had seen. Later, my sister informed me that she had heard on the radio that others had seen the object including, possibly, police officers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years I have told many people about this experience. I have never doubted the validity of it but have also never been able to explain it or hear from others who have seen it or any similar object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would not be considered a person who believes in intelligent beings on other planets or other solar systems and I question the validity of many supposed UFO sightings but I do know that I did see what I have described above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

5/10/78 20:30|San Diego|CA|Changing|25 minutes|UFO hovering behind our backyard, the night of May 10,1978|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18338.html|5|ndxe197805| UFO hovering behind our backyard, the night of May 10,1978<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry it&#39;s taken so long to to tell what I&#39;ve witnessed in the past. I&#39;ll never forget that night, for it was like it happened yesterday.  It was Wednesday night, 8:30pm, and this new show I had been anticipating to watch was starting to begin...I remember, seeing the credits listed at the start of the show, then all of the sudden my sister screamed my name, and it was in such a way that I thought something had happened to her. I ran upstairs, to find her looking out of our bedroom window, ran over to the window myself, to discover a saucer-shaped object approximately 45-50 feet hovering behind our backyard, outside our fence toward the canyon. The saucer was dark, but it&#39;s outline was really defined, and the bottom of the it was silver like in color with rotating flashing lights.  Anyway, the object began to give us a show. It continued to hover over the outskirts of our yard, and it&#39;s lights began to change, first blue to red, red to white, then white to orange, and it continued doing this.  Then all of the sudden, the object disappered, then reappeared, but this time in another form.  The object looked like the letter &#34;T&#34; lying on it&#39;s side.  Actually it&#39;s reminded me somewhat of a the little twisty key like object on a container of corned beef or spam, the kind attached to the container, used to open it; I hope this makes sense.  In any case, this &#34;T&#34; shaped object was dark, but very defined as well, and then it disappered, and the saucer-shaped object reappeared. The saucer continued to rotate it&#39;s lights a little while longer, going from red to blue, white to orange, and then it started to move, swaying side to side, going west. The craft contined going west, swaying side to side, until my sister and I could no longer see it, and then it was gone.  Realizing it had been there for a while, I looked at the clock after it left, and it was 8:55pm. How we ended up seeing the object in the first place, is that my sister saw this blue flash of light coming over the hill, east of our house (which is behind my parents&#39; home). My sister mentioned two years ago--the first time we&#39;ve discussed this matter in years, that when she first saw it coming over the hill, she immediately ran to lock the front door, then called me upstairs, which explains the fear in her voice when she yelled my name. To this day, I&#39;ve always wondered how we ended up with this object hovering behind our backyard, but I will certainly carry this memory around with me the rest of my life.<n>

It was located in Grand Prairie Texas off of Great Southwest pkwy near the GP and Arlington border.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Beyond and back was the second feature. the drive in was about 50 % full.I was young so I was playiny in the gravel and my parents and brother were on the tailgate of a old truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed people flashing headlights and honking I then noticed people getting out of there cars. I heard my mom say &#34;oh my gawd----Do you see that?&#34; My father say yes as well as did my brother. By the time I looked up the UFO was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What they claimed to see was a Trinagular Ship that made no sound, the size confirmed by all 3 was as big as a football field. It had lights beneath it in a variety of colors and when it decided to leave it went from a stand still hover to the size of a star in a matter of 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more thing I need to add, the US naval airbase and a shop called Vought was less tahn 10 miles away near Moutian Creek Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this sighting was real we still talk about almost 30 years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

5/6/78 21:00|Barrington|IL|Triangle|10 minutes|Very large triangular humming (pulsing) craft with several lights moving slowly|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88536.html|7|ndxe197805| Very large triangular humming (pulsing) craft with several lights moving slowly<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1978 myself and a friend (&amp; his younger brother)went from Cary, Il. to Chicago to film a movie for a high school project.  Upon returning home on Hwy 90, I noticed several lights off to the North.  Several minutes later I noticed the lights were still there.  Just about at that moment we were exiting Hwy 90 onto Barrington Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After traveling on Barrington Rd and continuing to watch these lights we turned onto Algonquin Rd &amp; traveled several miles where Algonquin &amp; Dundee Rds intersect.  I had lost track of the lights for about a minute or so, but suddenly to my right (I was in the passenger seat)the lights were up in the air about 100-150 feet or so above us at this intersection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Screaming at the driver, I had him pull off the road and  I jumped out of the car to look up at an extremely large triangular object moving to the south west very slowly and making a pulsing humming sound. Hum-hum-hum etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it fell out of site we drove home.  The very best I can remember the lights were green &amp; blue<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I happend to see a &#34;star&#34; move.  It looked like any other star.  It wasn&#39;t the brightes and it wasn&#39;t the dimmest.  It moved in a circular pattern; that is it quickly (about 1/2 second) made one circle with a diameter of about 3/4&#34; (using my fingers at arms length to measure this and the following apparent distances), and then remained motionless for several minutes.  I didn&#39;t say anything because I felt that if it didn&#39;t move again my friends might pass it off as an eye movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It finally moved again, this time it moved in a straight line about 4 apparent inches accross the sky.  There was no appearance of accelleration or decelleration; just a quick move.  It then sat motionless again for a few minutes.  It made another circle, and one of my friend said, &#34;Did anybody see thst?&#34;  I said that I&#39;ve been watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It behaved this way for quite some time, making circles and straight lines, and remaining motionless for minutes between moves.  The circles all seemed to be the same size, but the length of the lines varied from about 4&#34; to about 18&#34;.  It always looked like a star: no flashing or colored lights, and it always held the same brightness.  The last time we saw it is when it disappeared into the sky (or over the horizon) with a long, straight-line dash.  There it was, and then darted off, out of sight in about a second or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I find interesting about this is WHERE it occurred.  It was directly over what at that time was Carswell AFB.  From where we were sitting, if there was any ground activity on base, we could have seen it.  We saw no military activity.  Not on the ground, not in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a place to report; not to speculate, but I can&#39;t help myself :) I&#39;m now under the impression that thing was being operated by our Air Force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

For years I have been trying to track down a craft's symbol my 4 yr.ol|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32307.html|9|ndxe197805| I submitted the following to a French UMMO site isn1997.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For years I have been trying to track down a craft&#39;s symbol my 4 yr. old and I saw around 1978 in Pasadena, CA- a strange &#34;Flash Gordon&#34; type of ship with a very obvious &#34;H&#34; on its side (although slightly cursive)- the ship looked almost cartoonish and flatly 2_dimensional, seemingly suspended over the San Gabriels, heading West. Although there were several people in the area and apparently interested in what we were looking at, no one else saw it. We casually talked about &#39;our sighting&#39; over the years as it was such a clear, vivid vision and it had been my son who was the first to notice it. We even drew pictures that same afternoon and, over the years, made a few sketches to maintain a fresh visual recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly, his pictures always showed a very odd perspective, as though he was viewing it in extreme close-up whereas my view was more of a typical upper sky sighting as seen from standing on the ground. One night about 10 yrs. later, I heard him gasp as CNN aired a Moscow UFO story. Apparently a ship had landed near an apartment complex where many children were playing and many of them excitedly described seeing a UFO. One of the kids had even sketched a picture and as he proudly held it up to the camera, we saw that he had drawn a similar ship with the SAME ** H ** ! Then, about a year later, TNT was running a 50&#39;s UFO quasi-documentary (OVERLORDS of the SKIES) and I was stunned to see a crude representation of an analogous craft again demonstrating the &#34;H&#34;. The narrator mentioned that the ship was said to be from the planet UMMO (!!!). I made a halfhearted effort to track down the video but discovered it was actually a motion film of which no one seemed to have current knowledge. I keep meaning to contact Turner Broadcasting and request a repeat but haven&#39;t done so. I later learned of a book with UMMO in the title and had a local bookstore run a search but was told it was out of print. Anytime I have asked about the sighting, I have been told by a few wannabe Ufologists etal that it was actually a famous &#34;hoax&#34; yet allegedly seen by about 15,000 people across the US sometime in the 50&#39;s; some say it was the 70&#39;s. Actually, I remain a bit of a skeptic (altho we sure saw something!), Have you any knowledge about this particular sighting or symbol? Even called Art Bell last year (1998)  to ask but rec&#39;d a cursory &#34;Never heard of it...&#34; and got one of his infamous quick disconnects (smile). There&#39;s more to the whole story involving both my son and I and some eerie pre and post strange events but, for now, am simply curious as to what  you think of the actual symbol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A group of engineers and scientists from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory went to Big Bear Lake for a weekend trip. We had an 8 inch Celestron telescope with a 25 mm eyepiece. We were at a campground west of the lake on a rise. We viewed small aircraft landing at the airport, east of the lake. The sun was behind us and near setting as we watched. The aircraft were landing from south to north, or right to left. With the telescope we could make out the N numbers on the planes. I noticed a few clouds, but the sky was generally clear. The aircraft seemed to be landing in front of a stationary object at some distance to the east. The object was below ten degrees above the horizon. Perhaps four or five planes landed in front of this object, which could have been miles further away. Two other people viewed the object. The object was a long cigar shape. While watching, the object suddenly changed attitude, like a disk tipping and the &#34;cigar&#34; appearance became an oval. It then moved away from us and was gone in under a few seconds. It made the impression of a thin metallic disk, seen in profile as a cigar while stationary, and then being seen more rounded as it tipped away from us. There was no sound, lights, exhaust or other features. There were no lenticular clouds in the area or evidence of inversion layers. The temperature was about 65 degrees and there were very light winds.<n>
5/1/78 00:00|Wrightstown|PA|Light|15 minutes|I was contacted years ago by NICAP about a news story that was written about my experience in Bucks County Pennsylvania in either 1978|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36902.html|13|ndxe197805| I was contacted years ago by NICAP about a news story that was written about my experience in Bucks County Pennsylvania in either 1978 or 1979.Probably 1978. I was coming home from a business meeting with lawyers and representatives from Paine Webber about a new offering. In the car ( a 1977 Lincoln Continental) was my accountant who was driving. It was midnight.. It must have been early 1978. We saw what appeared to be very bright lights in the sky on the same plane.About 6 of them.Each with intensity of search lights. We saw them from the eastern shore of the Delaware River as we were heading west to my home. The lights stood still. As we crossed the NJ/PA bridge the lights still remained in the same position. We drove up Wrightstown Road and they still were there.Comparing the height to radio towers nearby these were about twice the height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of the car and had my Minolta 35 mm camera that I had used to photograph properties for our presentation to Paine Webber. The camera worked fine. We stopped the car and looked up and the same lights were there. I tried to photograph them but the camera would not click to the next frame. I tried and tried.One flash and then the series of lights moved without a sound at such a speed that they were miles away in a second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both were shaking with excitement.My account was a very staid person and unemotional person but he was afraid to talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we started the car to leave we saw there was a deer lying in the ditch of the farm road that &#39;woke up&#39; and stretched and jumped into the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon arriving home my wife met me at the door. She sleeps early but was wake at midnight.For some reason the home phone rang and stated there was a fire alarm set off at my sister in laws house.We were on a notification list. She immediately called her to find out nothing happened there and all were sleeping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted every airport and the Willow Grove Air Force base speaking to a Colonel. No one knew a thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning at work I was telling the account to my employees and there was a newspaper advertising agent there to take our new business for the week.He called his boss at the Trentonian Newspapers.The boss asked me to tell him exactly what happened and what time. He then told me that his secretary and her husband saw the same thing moments earlier in Florence New Jersey about 320 minutes away by car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After giving the film to NICAP they kept it for 15 years and finally mailed it to me empty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
