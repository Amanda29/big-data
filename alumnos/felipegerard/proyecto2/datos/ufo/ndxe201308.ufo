Music).  We went outside, across the street to a soccer field to look at the stars because we saw on facebook that there was supposed to be a meteor shower.  It was cloudy so we were disappointed and ready to leave when we saw a bizarre flying object flying not above nor below the clouds, but directly through them.  It had no lights, but appeared to reflect some of the city lights or something because we could see the front of its disk shape because of a crescent of reflected light on the front of it.  If you held a silver dollar to the sky, that is how large it appeared to be.  It was very strange and eerie, as the object was almost like a hologram in the way it moved through the clouds in a way that made us think we were seeing an optical illusion.  Neither of us have ever touched alcohol or drugs and can confirm our mental stability.  It appeared to have vanished before our eyes, but because it was difficult to see, it may have just risen above the clouds and out of sight.  The whole sighting lasted about 6 seconds, but we both know we saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It seems to be preceded by a halo effect in the front of the object. It quietly moved closer as I tried to discern what it was, and then saw another coming from the same direction. I assumed at first it was a helicopter, but I heard no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed as they flew over our home, in silence, then noticed another cluster of three approaching from the same direction. In the meanwhile one of the first of the objects had moved significantly higher in the sky. By the time the next group of two or three were approaching I called my husband to come and see. After observing for a minute, he ran in to get his iPad and film it. (Haven’t seen it yet.)  It continued for another 7 or 8 minutes. I lost count of how many but I’d estimate 10 – 12 objects, all appearing the same, over the course of 10 – 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Whole body flexing n twisting slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an upside down &#34;hollow letter Y&#34;.  The bottom of Y was the nose. The body length and twin tails seemed to be flexible and moving..like it was alive or gel like. It also seemed to be constantly surrounded in liquid like flames (or even better, like a gaseous looking lava or plasma?) that circulated inward towards its center, and then back out and around the structure, all the way around it.  I was mildly twisting and contorting.  Like if you took your thumb and first two fingers, pointed your thumb down towards the floor and fingers up towards the ceiling, and randomly wiggled them super slow ..like worms or caterpillars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came closer and was moving rather slowly for its size.  We were in the midst of total overcast and slight drizzle with lots of heat lightning at the time.  Later in the evening we had full out lightning, thunder, pouring rain. but about 4 hrs prior, as the atmosphere was stirring up, I watched this vessel come out of the clouds and then fade back in behind them lasting for a total view of approximately 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t have the words to honestly describe this phenomenon.  I&#39;m still awestruck a day later.<n>

We had the bug zapper on and I forgot to turn it off. I walked out onto the deck at approx 10:05pm CST to unplug the bug zapper.  After I unplugged it and started walking back towards the door I looked up in the sky to admire its beauty as I always do.  I am constantly looking in the night sky and an amateur astronomer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming from the north east at a very high altitude I saw a huge light. I have a feeling many people saw this it was huge in terms of normal objects in the night sky.  If you were to extend your arm towards the night sky with your thumb up it would be the size of your thumbnail. It didn&#39;t have a finite shape on the outside. It was almost flaring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial reaction was cool, ISS must be passing over and the sun is reflecting off it. Something I have seen in the past and verified using the heavens above database.  However I quickly realized the colors were off.  It wasn&#39;t just a white bright reflecting type color and it was a lot larger. It was yellowish/white in the center and yellowish/orange on the outsides. It was like it was on fire.  The tips of the light coming off it were pointy. It was almost sparkling without the movement. The white light in the center was almost tear drop shaped with the point in the front heading in my direction.  I ran into the house and grabbed my wife who was asleep on the couch she ran out to look at it. We both witnessed it. I asked her to keep watching it while I ran in to get my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got back on the deck she said it’s almost gone it’s dimming down.  She said it never changed speed. I could still see it and now it looked more like a star moving like normal satellites looks.  However through the binoculars (celestron skymaster 15x70) I could see two star light objects moving.  One was white about the brightness of an average star and next to it was a constant red light of the same brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object never sped up or slowed down.  It’s speed was constant and it was silent. We both had the feeling it was silent because it was so high up.  From first site the object came from the north east and continued in a straight path towards south west until it was literally directly over our house then it sort of banked to the south east towards downtown Chicago.<n>

No sound or navigation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10 pm 4, professional sober adults in our 50&#39;s were fishing on my large boat in the middle of the night.  We observed satellites, shooting stars, Milky Way and various constellations in the still dark night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the group noticed a round orange object moving across the sky from NW to SE.   One person thought the shape looked like the &#39;&#39;Underarmor&#39;&#39; clothing logo.  It traversed the clear, windless night sky in about 45 seconds.  No flames, tail, material falling off or smoke was observed.  Not certain if it appeared a bit smaller when it passed out of sight beyond the SE end of the lake.  When it got to the SE end of the lake it seemed to fade- I thought the color went a bit light yellow or white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no sound, no navigation lights and no change in direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to move much more slowly than a meteor and much faster than a plane, satellite, space station (we have spotted that years ago).  It&#39;s size is hard to explain but it appeared to be about 20+ times larger than the largest star in the sky that night.  No way to describe its position since its size would affect its perceived location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported it to the Provincial Police- not because it was unusual but in case it was a manned vehicle and if it encountered engine failure the occupant(s) may crash land.  I did not believe it was a typical, manned aircraft but if there was any chance that someone was in peril I felt the police should be notified.<n>

At first I thought it was an airplane but realized the light was larger than the flashing lights you see on a plane.  I did think it might be a helicopter but ruled that out as the light became larger and was moving on a very straight path and there was no accompanying noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a red, pulsating mass of light with no definite shape that moved in a straight line from east to west.  As stated there was no noise.  There seemed to be an orange or yellow aura around the edge.  It lasted about 8-10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed over my house I had time to go to the front and pick up the light again.  It was still moving, steadily in a straight path.  I went into the house to get binoculars and was able to pick it up in the distance.  It continued on its straight path until it disappeared from my sight.<n>

It stopped over the area around Grand Ave. and Highway #580.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 seconds it made a very swift dive south easterly and disappeared behind the hill area above the Mormon Temple.  After a few seconds (about 5 seconds) it came back up at the same speed that it had used to descend.  This speed is maybe 3 to 5 times faster than an airplane&#39;s speed.  It hovered a few more seconds and then left.  There was no noise what so ever.  The light was the same color as the landing lights we seen on planes every night.  It did not blink or shut off.<n>

We were driving east on Hammond Road coming back from dinner in Traverse City, and if I remember correctly we were between 3 and 4 mile road, when my companion noticed a bright orange object (not a star!) out of the side passenger window.  She called my attention to it, so I turned right onto the nearest road, put the car in park and got out for a better look.  What we both observed was an unusually bright orange “object” (about the size of a star and approx. 2-3 times as bright as the planet Saturn has recently been), that seemed to be slowly drifting in a northerly direction towards Cherry Capital Airport.  However there were none of the blinking navigation lights that one would expect to see on an airplane, and as hard as I listened I could detect no motor noise, either jet, prop, or horizontally rotating.  The object was in full view for perhaps a minute or two in its northerly drift, suddenly it se! emed to flash red and then just disappear.  I looked for some kind of structure or fuselage where the “light” had been, but saw nothing.  Since neither one of us could figure out what this thing was we couldn’t estimate the height but we guessed maybe a mile up- at least it didn’t appear to be up higher in the sky, and except for the lack of noise, and navigation lights, it could have been an aircraft on approach to the airport had I only given it a passing glance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a technical writer by trade my companion is a graphic illustrator<n>

Thought it was a plane on fire in pieces.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving south on Mentor Park Blvd to the intersection at Elmwood Rd after coming from Sycamore Rd. I saw what seemed to be a very bright star in the sky so I slowed down to look. As I was watching it got bigger and what seemed closer, I saw that it looked like it was on fire and there were sparks coming from the back of it as it moved north-north west and lower. I literally put my flashers on and got out of the car to look because I then thought it was a plane that caught fire that was descending rapidly. Then to the left of this (or east of it and slightly &#39;behind&#39; it, came a bright red sphere with an even brighter yellow/orange center, looked like the leaf or flower of a plant called &#39;tropical anthurium&#39; that has a red leaf with a yellow thing sticking out of the center. So now I am thinking a piece of the plane has broken off and is trailing a bit far behind so I called 911 and reported it in case it was a descending plane on fire.  Within 5 minutes the first one disappeared northwest and the second one seemed to disintegrate or turn to a small pinpoint within seconds.  Never saw anything like this in my 56 years and nothing reported crashed in the news.<n>

Then it slowly began traveling in the opposite direction very slowly and the light began dimming.  After about another minute, the light became a dot of light and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only explanation I can think of is someone in the area had a remote control helicopter with a bright yellow light on it and then the light went out while in flight.  Very unusual behavior for an &#34;aircraft&#34;.  There was no sound whatsoever so I ruled out an airplane or large aircraft.<n>

This formation was soon followed by a triangular shaped craft with a red light in one corner.  The triangular shaped craft was slowly spinning, and remained visible until disappearing from my line of site.  All the ufo&#39;s appeared to be flying at a relatively low altitude.  No sound eminated from any of the Ufo&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object seemed to be moving, like jittering about but still stationary.  It kept changing colors not flashing but pulsating from red to blue to yellow to green.  Not in that exact order.  So I took out my cell phone and started taking a series of pictures.  Now with the naked eye they just look like pretty lights in the sky, but when enlarged the most amazing details stand out showing what looks to me as a UFO constantly morphing or changing shapes and then cloaking itself and coming back. I would watch the object disappear but kept shooting pictures.  When I enlarged the photos you can actually see a spot in the sky where the object is and it seems to be covering itself with some sort of shield or as said a “cloak”   During this 15mins. I watched and photographed a 2nd object slowly rise from the ground til it was level with the 1st object with perhaps a hundred yards distance between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now object # 2 behaved like object # 1..but with one difference.  Object # 2 mimicked # 1’s movements but shows like a mirror image beside it. Like object # 2 was casting a double image of itself  while # 1 remained a singular image. I would like to submit my photos of this event for investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event was witnessed by my wife and myself. Please respond if more detailed information is needed.<n>

This was witnessed by 5 people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 11 pm, we witnessed 4 new objects in the north sky,  3 of which were aligned and flasing, but hovering and the 4th was more toward the northwest sky and larger, also brighter and moved north to south alternately.   What really captivated us about these was that the object furthest north actually flashed very bright and disappeared, twice...before reappearing and maintaining the flashing pattern once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note that the whole time this was going on, there was a rumbling sound that was CONSTANT.  It did not fade, like any normal jet or plane sound.<n>

It was too early for any stars to been seen and at first it didn&#39;t look like it was moving.  As we watched, we noticed it moved slightly to the west. I used a branch on one of the 80&#39; Fir trees to fix a location because it stopped moving again.  It stayed still for several minutes and then started to move very slowly to the west and then it was gone. I look into the sky a lot because we have a beautiful view seeing eagles, osprey, Clackamas river but have never seen anything like this before.  I would guess the altitude to be very high since it looked like a bright star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The object appeared in the western sky; it moved over a field to the right of my car and then quickly moved out of my view into the eastern sky.  This object appeared to have a place to go<n>

Coming from same direction about 30 seconds apart as they near the city banked towards north and up direction . You see one coming as the last one you just saw is so far away . They would only be two in sight at all time and definitely solid lights no blinking solid orange ish color.  No noise may have been to far away to judge that tho. Definitely lower than planes on min then so far gone. The next gained altitude further it was away seems they was getting close before the bank toward north we all should of be able to hear but none of heard a sound felt more like slow motion and too busy looking and to dark to video if I knew after the 2nd one there was going to be 6 more I would of tryed to shoot a picture or videos but just to dark to thank it would of worked. Ive been around the service and this didnt seem to be chopper s nor planes we went just to pick the kids up from friends church friends. I view myself as an active observer ! of the skys this is another of only a hand full that I cant figure out .and all the year&#39;s ive seen stuff this one has led me here. Im not easy scared nor fast to say ufo. Tonight im definitely lost for word. Im hoping tomorrow I hear others seen it or at least people are saying what it was. WIERD<n>

I was with a friend who is not a police officer. I was laying down on a picnic table and observed an object moving across the sky.  I remarked to my friend saying &#34; hey look a sattelite&#34; he then saw it too.  It looked like a star or sattelite slowly moving.  It then began to pulse brightly and then dim.  We observed it pulse brightly 3 times, i did not count the time between pulses but it seemed to be the same time apart between each pulse, approximately 5-6 seconds. The object then stopped and was stationary for approximately 20 minutes.  After 20 minutes it was around 5:45, people were showing up to run an early morning 5k as part of the event and i was unable to continue sustained observance of the object.  I used some stars as a reference point so that i could look up and find the object again.  I looked up as i could and continued to see the object for a time and then another time i looked up and it was gone and i never saw it again.<n>

At this time it was dark, with a few streetlights as well as lights on the walking paths into the neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was turning onto my street after dark and happened to look out the window and observe some lights in the sky.  They were oval shaped and a little fuzzy, and it looked like there were about seven total in a formation.  What struck me was that they were glowing orange.  I live near an airport and these were not commercial planes.  They made no sound and left no trails in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that they were Chinese floating lanterns.  It was at this point I noticed they picked up speed (they had been sort of slowly meandering) and I rushed to park and get a better view.  The experience up to this point had been about three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took me 30 seconds to park and I never stopped keeping tabs on them. At this point I mentioned to my companion, who had been seeing all of this and was confused also, that they were picking up speed.  I also noticed two other cars slowing down to point and look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran under a tree and into open grass to get a better look.  There was NOTHING in the sky, other than stars, the moon and a few commercial planes.  I looked in the direction they were heading, and then frantically in every other direction from every angle, and saw no sign of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t really believe in aliens, but a UFO is not defined by being piloted by an extraterrestrial.  I do know that it was very out of the ordinary, very strange, and very unsettling.  I found it odd that I am able to find no one else discussing this online today, and no news stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also feel I should add that when I finally went into my house, my cat was staring out the window and was visibly keyed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(See previous report.)  At 9:10, last night, we (Husband, myself and 2 Children) went out to the back patio and in the same area, at the same altitude, there was the same kind of UFO as we saw the night before. It began moving up, down, left right, in one general area.  Going up and below the tree line. We found this really hard to believe because of the previous night&#39;s experience. Same object golden, orangish colored ball of light. Zigzagging flight pattern.  Moving almost effortlessly.  After observing it for about 10 minutes, it lowered down and traveled S-SW until we could no longer see it.  About 20 minutes later, we saw it again, in the SW sky, but very high up in the air.   We watched it travel a vast length of the sky before disappearing after a minute or less.  About 20 minutes after that, we saw a slow moving aircraft approaching our house from the North.  As it traveled over our heads, it ha! d a low rumbling engine sound and we saw that it had 3 bright white circular lights on the underneath, forming a triangle with a red bright light in the center.  The lights were signaling in a beaconish sort of pattern.  White would blink and then the red. We have never seen anything like that either, but suspected that it was a man-made craft of sorts.  Certainly nothing like the fiery ball of light we had witnessed two nights in a row.  But the odds of seeing this recon-like craft about 40 minutes after our 2nd night in a row of a UFO sighting in the same spot, at the same time, was pretty strange, we must admit.  We will be looking in the same area in the low sky tonight at 9:00 to see if this ball of light appears again. Honestly, the strangest thing we have ever seen.<n>

My mom noticed these orange reddish lights in the sky in clusters.  She told me to look up west of where we were traveling.  I noticed the lights in the sky.  There was about 3 glowing lights in almost a triangle form and surrounding were the same lights but of a sporadic form. We observed around 8-10 of them.  They were traveling west to east slowly.  As we traveled we lost sight and couldn&#39;t figure out what these flying objects were.  I thought it could of been some kind of air force but usually they travel in a formation. And these objects were not. They were not planes either.<n>

I have never seen anything like it in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights continued north until they vanished over the horizon.  They were much much brighter than any starts in the sky.

It was overcast and I could not see the stars. I know what jet engine exhaust at night looks like as  I live near NAS Pensacola, Eglin AFB, and Hurlbert Field and I am accustomed to seeing engine exhausts at night from various planes and helicopters. The object did not have distinct shape but gave the appearannce of fire. The orange color is compared to paint would be flat not glossy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved in a staright line direction and eventually either reduced in intensity or passed out of site into the overcast.

Before composing this report I stepped outside and used my iphone to determine that this ufo was approx. NE 60 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took out my iphone and accidentally took a picture at first but meant to record a video but I was a little frantic. I took one photo and one video that is around 1 minute long.  The object we saw looked as if it was changing shape from crescent to almost a ball.  After watching it for probably 1 minute it looked as if it was going further away and getting harder to see which was actually fairly rapid compared to the time it takes a plane to move out of eye range.  My friend that witnessed this with ! me refuses to wright a report.<n>

I sit in a truck facing East and the object was in the sky and looked much like a star.  However, it continued to hover vertically and horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is an airport not far away and I&#39;m used to seeing airplanes and knew this could not be a plane due to its unusual movement.  The craft drifted very slowly southward and occasionally would flash a brighter light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday morning the 30th, as the craft continued to hover, another craft appeared much lower and north of the craft. It seemed to appear from nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second, lower craft was moving in the same manner as the original craft but slowly drifted towards the other craft and when it was close enough to hit it, it disappeared, as if it had gone inside the other object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other (main) object continued to drift southward and looked as if it were scanning the terrain, as if mapping the landscape.  The area is remotely rural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After two hours, at 4:30 AM, a landfill that is nearby began operations and turned on two very bright flood lights to light the hill.  At that time, the craft seemed to be go stationary, as if to imitate a star. It was brighter than any star in the sky. The &#34;star&#34; remained visible, even after sunrise and eventually was the only star visible in the sky.  At that point I ended my shift and went home.  I did, however, call Coast to Coast AM with George Noory during this sighting and relayed what I was seeing on the radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In this location I have noticed at least two dozen meteorites in the past five months at this location, all coming very close to me and all burning up approximately ten feet from hitting the ground.  I mention them just because I find it unusual and don&#39;t know if they&#39;re connected to the UFO or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My location on a road map is south of Terre Haute on highway 41 to state road 246.  I was approximately 2 miles east of highway 41 and just half a mile north of highway 246.  The weather and sky was clear.<n>

My son’s iphone shows the exact location of where he took the photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this red/orange light in the sky about 10 KM before I stopped. I pulled over and stopped and this thing was about 300 metres if that off the road and maybe 300 metres in the air.  I shot the video with my blackberry Z10 and one of my sons took the picture with his iphone and that picture was in full zoom.  My video was better than his so we used it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was very large but not entirely sure how big exactly and looked like a big metal spider.  I did zoom in and out with my phone just to put in perspective about how far away it was.  We could see it better than the picture with the naked eye.  The video didn’t show that there was a spotlight pointing down towards the ground but it wasn’t very powerful.  I also recall a sort of beacon type light on it but that too doesn’t show up in the video.  This thing didn’t make a noise and seemed to be hovering there and didn’t seem to move while we were there. In total, we were there approximately 3 minutes.  The video is edited for size because the file is too big to send by email but I took two.  One was 15 seconds and the other 38 seconds.  The full video can be sent if requested. The video doesn’t show the detail that the picture shows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One vehicle passed us but didn’t stop.  When we left,  oncoming traffic on the divided highway started coming once we were about 2 miles away so they would have seen it also.  To date I have not been able to find any other report on the internet.  I’m at a loss as to what it was and hope that someone can figure out based on the zooms of the cameras just how big it was and more importantly, what it was.<n>

They appeared to my left, which would be roughly north of my position on the freeway, between mile markers 45 and 50.  Lights were elevated around 60-70 degrees to the horizontal.  Lights were circular, golden in color with a brown or reddish tint.  No color change.  Did not observe and craft/object, just the lights (too dark).  Given their size, they appeared to be too low to be stars.  Lights appeared to be initially stationary and seemed to be groups of 2-3 lights.  Approximately 1 minute after observing (I am driving on the interstate), they appeared to start moving in a circular pattern without losing or gaining altitude.  Observed for under a minute before losing sight of them (I did not stop the car and I would have to look over my left shoulder to continue to observe.  Car in front of me also slowed down and swerved some - presumed that the driver was also seeing what I did.  I got off at the next exit (50) and attempted to drive back toward the lights on County Rd ES which run parallel to I-43, but did not see them any more.<n>

We saw what looked like a planet or a star at tree line level.  Very bright.  Golden Orange in color.   We found this strange as we are not used to seeing anything like that so low in the sky.  We sat and looked at it for about 5 minutes.  As it was so still, my Husband took out his iPhone Planet/Star  Finder and nothing was indicated in that area.  At this time the object began to move slightly up, down, left and right in the same area.  It was silent.  Glowing brightly, but not casting light beyond itself.  No blinking or pulsing lights.  It did this for about 5 minutes before heading below the tree line briefly and then up and out to the N-NW at a rapid speed.  As it was traveling, it kept its sawtooth like pattern.  We watched it until it was out of our sight.  We have never seen anything like it.  About a half hour later, there were multiple aircraft in the vicinity.<n>

At 9:05 p.m. I saw an object with naked eyes that was as bright and as big around as Venus, approximately 60 degrees above the horizon above the Gulf of Mexico, traveling about as fast as a satellite, NW to SSE, but at an altitude of about 10,000 feet at the most.  I watched it through my binoculars for a little more than a minute and saw that it had very sharply defined edges and was indeed a sphere.  It was by far much larger than any of the numerous satellites I have seen.  It had a luminous, off-white exterior.  The sun may have been reflecting off of it, but I’m not sure, other than it was not a plane or satellite.  It went into a cloud as it went south and that was all I saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:12 I saw with my naked eye a bright orange “fireball”, about the size of a grape at arm’s length, just seaward and above southern Cayo Costa Island (see Map), at an altitude of around 2,000 feet.  I watched it through my 10X42 binoculars for 10 minutes as it dimmed down in brightness and changed colors to an orange-white, and then mostly a dull white, while it drifted out to sea 2 to 3 miles, and downward to approximately 1,000 feet or less, where it dimmed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the fireball went out I started seeing in the same area little pinpoint flashes of white light (one form of “flashers”), maybe 500 feet above the water. A good description I just thought of was that they were like perhaps like flashbulbs going off at great distance.  There were 4 or 5 of them in a fairly small area, strobing irregularly, on for a split second and then off for a full second, sometimes flashing quickly numerous times,  just like last night.  Then 2 of them came together, one above the other, one right on the water, and the other 200 to 300 feet directly above it.  They were lined up vertically and perfectly. I didn’t see what happened to the others because I was focusing on the two, which quickly stopped strobing and became steady, dim white lights, barely visible through my binoculars.  After a brief while they both slowly started getting brighter, stayed bright enough to see with the naked eye, and just hovered in place for about 5 minutes.  Af! ter this time the one on the water became very dim quickly, as if going into the water, and then disappeared.  Within a few seconds the light above dimmed out.  I could still see occasional dim pinpoints flashbulbs of white light in the area for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:45 two bright, deep amber, oval lights came on in the same area but closer to shore.  When I looked at them through my binocs I could see that they were “stacked,” one directly above the other, EXACTLY LIKE THE SILVER-GOLD UFOs I’D SEEN ON PREVOIUS NIGHTS!!  I actually got rather frightened, because I was alone on the beach, an it was really dark.  Except for the fact that they were amber colored, they behaved just like the ones last night with distant “flash bulbs” going off in the vicinity.  I watched these objects for a solid 10 minutes.  One was right on or very near the water and the one above it was again, 3 or so object widths above it, no more than 200 feet above the water.  They went on and off 7 or 8 times.  Right before they went out there was one fairly bright “flashbulb” that went off just to the left (seaward) of them.  During the time they were dimming on and off, the one on the bottom would just get real dim and looked like a little blob on top of the wa! ter.  I thought at the time that it was dipping in and out of the water because of the way it was acting.  I also thought at the time that they were pulsating very, very slowly.  The one on the bottom went out after about 5 minutes, and it took the one on the top another 5 minutes before it went out, slowly getting dimmer and dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:56 I was walking north on the beach to talk to a fisherman up there and asked him if he saw what I was seeing.  He said no, that he was mostly looking straight out on the Gulf, instead of 90 degrees to the right.  Then the two elongated amber lights came back on and we both looked at them for 2 or 3 minutes before they went out.  They looked through binoculars exactly like the ones I’d just seen, and they were in the same spot.  Again, the one on the bottom went out first, and then within 20 seconds or so the one on the top went out.  I did not see any “sparkles” or “flashbulbs” in the area this time.  Shortly after this last event I went back home to write up my notes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These observations know lead me to believe that these elongated/oval deep amber objects, which were of the exact kind and quality of amber light as amber/orange “fireballs,” may have been the same as the elongated dull silver-goldish craft I’d previously seen, just a different color phase.  These objects may even be shifting shapes, but I have yet to whiteness them in the act.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now have two more reports to write up, one from my friends sightings on Sanibel Island, and one of a very strange colored, bright sky-blue and red “fireball” that had a shimmer around it and was very bright and the size of an orange at arm’s length.<n>

My husband remarked that the stars were bright but that one in particular seemed very bright.  As we looked, the “star” which was bright white, shot straight up and disappeared into the sky.  The object was brighter than Venus and somewhat larger.  It was not lights from an aircraft as the colour and intensity was different, just like a very bright star.  It was about 45 degrees above the horizon and about 15 degrees east of due north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is virtually nothing to the north of us and the street lights are “low light” which gives us a nice clear view of the stars and aurora when it is visible.

It was around 9:00 am and broad daylight, fairly sunny day.  I&#39;m literally reporting this one hour after I witnessed it.  I went outside as the fish delivery man had just pulled up with his daily delivery.  I had noticed about 7 or 8 chemtrails in the sky and I was looking up at the newly forming grid of trails in the sky as I was talking to the delivery man.  That&#39;s when I noticed a light floating very smoothly from the left of the sky towards the right.  It seemed to be following the path of one of the huge chemtrails. It made absolutely no sound.  It wasn&#39;t a plane as I&#39;d seen a few of those minutes earlier and knew for sure this wasn&#39;t the same.  I pointed it out and the delivery man stood and watched this with me for about a minute.  He noticed a second light floating close to it.  As we were watching we were quite blown away and just ! questioning what they could be.  We easily ruled out anything conventional.  They seemed to be going in and out of visibilty.  We saw no shape or solidity, they were made of bright white light.  They would just dim right down to the point where we could barely see them and then light right back up.  I&#39;d say they were lower than the usual height of planes but its hard to tell.  They were moving very slowly.  If it adds anything to the report, the delivery is extremely skeptical as ive had discussions about various things before and even he was baffled and admitting he did actually believe they were UFOs.<n>

Initially, I thought it was an aircraft on fire traveling due south at about 5000 feet AGL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately the size of my thumb nail it came to a hover directly over me and hovered for approximately 30 seconds.  It then backed up roughly 3 arc seconds, moved west by the same amount, and then moved south east by about 4 arc degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then started ascending due east eventually climbing over the clouds which were in the eastern quadrant of the sky in approximately 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I snapped a picture with my IPhone as it was ascending and then called for a weather briefing.  At the time of the sighting visibility was 10 miles,  wind 310 at 3, few clouds at 7,500, scattered at 12500.  Temp was 23C, density altitude 5400, and altimeter 3002.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Consequently, based on this weather report for 0339 Zulu for Billings, MT, I estimated the ! rate of climb from a hover (5000 AGl) to disappearing over the clouds at 12,500 giving it a rate of climb of approximately 22,500 fpm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was circular, glowed brightly the color of a campfire, and made no noise.  The color of the object never changed during the 60 seconds of witnessing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For whatever reason, I feel that this object was unmanned and transitioned to a hover in order to  search for a navigation data point such as a magnetic field line or point of reference in order to begin a new displacement.<n>

Cayo Costa runs north and south and is 6.5 miles long, and just offshore there and North Captiva is where I have been seeing MUCH activity lately.  It’s south end is right on the outside edge of the horizon, to the NNW of where I normally skywatch.  House and other lights are easily visible to the naked eye on North Captiva from my vantage point, with my eye level being about 12 feet above sea level.  There is a 3-story house on the Gulf! beach, on stilts on North Captiva, in which you can see lights in windows on each floor with binoculars at night; I estimate that the roof top is about 60 feet above sea level.  I use it for estimating the size, distance and height of objects I see in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I brought the light into focus with my 10X42 binoculars and saw that it was a spherical light, versus a definable object like the elongated football shaped UFOs I previously saw.  I would estimate that it was around 100 feet in diameter, which is about the same length of the clearly defined football shaped UFO’s I’ve previously reported on (Sightings # 22 to #26).  It hovered around 150 feet  above the Gulf’s horizon for about 5 minutes, quickly rose to about 1,000 feet, hovered there for a short while, brightened up and then faded away within 30 to 40 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:15 I saw through my binocs one of the “single strobe flashers” I’ve reported on before.  It looked like it was over the right side of N. Captiva, about 400 to 500 feet above the island, maybe a quarter mile to the right of tallest house there on the beach, and around 9 miles distant.  These points of light would show up in 1 to 3 second intervals, which made it easy to follow.  Every once in a while there would be a bright flash, must mostly it stayed about the same.  I watched it drift about 2 to 3 miles over, or just beyond, the island and go out to sea as it slowly dropped in altitude.  When it got about 2 miles off shore it drifted right near the water’s surface and then went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after the strobe went out, and while I was still looking through my binoculars and started making a sweep along the horizon, I saw just to the left of where the other light went out, THE SAME “DOUBLE UFOs” I’d seen and reported on not more than a week ago!!!  These were right on the horizon, one just a tad above the water, and the second right above it by 3 craft widths.  These objects seemed more hazy (probably because there was a strong breeze), but still the same dull silver and goldish/yellow color.  They were around 100 feet long, and a little less than half the height.  The craft did not merge as they had before, at least that I saw while they were visible.  They did change brightness though, independently but not regularly, with one getting really bright, and then the other, and so on.  They would only be visible to the naked eye in their bright phase.  I got a really good look at them and watched them for a good 3 minutes before they disappeared, with first the! one on the bottom going out, and then the one on top going out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really hate to say this, and should have said it in my first report on these objects, but the fact is that they were typical “flying saucer” shape.  I don’t even use that term any more because people immediately think you are nuts – UFO with the description I’ve given covers both bases and seems to be more acceptable.    I am sending with this report a photograph that almost stunned me when I first saw it, that was in Filer’s Flyer #35 email today, submitted by MUFON from Fayetteville, on August 24, 2013.  This picture is a striking resemblance to what I’ve been seeing, except for the color and the budge in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At precisely 9:30 there was a very large white “flash” of white light just north of North Captiva Island.  It was INCREDIBLE!  It lit up almost half of the sky for a brief second.  It looked like a bomb probably would have looked like.  I saw nothing directly associated with it as I was looking in that direction for 12 minutes before I had my next sighting.  Wow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:50 I saw again the same flying saucer shaped UFOs, again one above the other, right on the horizon, except that these seemed more amber colored.  They were in pretty much the same location as the earlier ones, about 2 to 3 miles off shore, but according to my notes from that night, they were further north than earlier, north of North Captiva, probably off of Cayo Costa.  The one on the top was no more than 300 feet above the horizon.   I watched them through my binocs for a few minutes, when the one above changed colors to an off-orange color, and the one below went out.  Shortly after that the one on the bottom came back on, still amber, and then went out again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute or so later the single UFO slowly drifted upward and became a bright white and began to pulsate slowly.  It was easily visible with the naked eye at 8 plus miles away.  Then it stopped pulsating, got really bright, disappeared, and then all kinds of pinpoints of strobe light appeared, exactly like all of the “flashers” I’ve seen many times!!  WOW!  These flashes of white light were spread out to about half the width of my binocular field of view, which I’m guessing is around a quarter to a half mile at that far distance.  Most of the points of light of light would come on once every second or less, and there was an area where they were flashing rapidly, stop for a bit, and then do it again.  Then over a period of 4 to 5 minutes both the number of pinpoints of light, and the time between flashes, became slower and slower until they all stopped at 10:02.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw nothing else until 10:10 when I had to leave because of the no-see-ums.  This was an absolutely amazing sighting and I really wish I could get someone out here that has a good camera with a telephoto lens.  Both of my shark fishing friends have now independently filed UFO reports on what they have seen here, but they are only here on the weekends.  SOMETHING SPECIAL IS GOING ON OUT HERE!  I went out the following night and again saw similar things, and then the following, reports on which I will soon file.<n>
8/28/13 21:00|Sidney|OH|Sphere|20 minutes|Spotting of 8 clusters of 3 red/orange fire orbs flying over Sidney Ohio ( Took Pictures)|1/16/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106354.html|99|ndxe201308| Spotting of 8 clusters of 3 red/orange fire orbs flying over Sidney Ohio ( Took Pictures)<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 28th of 2013, outside my windows of my front room, I noticed a rather tight triangle formation of 3 red lights in the east.  I have been to dozens of airshows so it was an unusual formation to see late at night.  It was a tight triangle formation of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: Going to air shows does not make me an expert.  However, it was unusual enough for me to notice that they were in a tight formation at night with absolutely no blinker lights.  In the daytime, a tight triangle formation is dangerous.  I have to believe that the danger level would be elevated 100x at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I went outside to see what type of airplane was flying overhead, but I did not hear a sound.  The clouds were low, no stars were present, and the wind was blowing in a NE direction about 10 mph (gusts up to 22 according to my cell phone.)  I sat and watched the triangle formation of lights flatten out and become a string when the first light began to fade out.  My first guess is that this object went behind a cloud.  At least, that is what my mind told me.  However, the next two lights also began to fade out but at different spots in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I thought &#34;that was weird!&#34; and was about to head back into the house when I looked back to the east, I saw more of these red dots in the sky.  They were always in clusters of three but I saw more clusters now.  Not just a single cluster of 3 red/orange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They all were traveling East to Northwest.  Given that these objects were going against the prevailing wind, I am confident in saying that they were not Chinese Lanterns.  Furthermore, on average, it would take about 2 minutes for these lights to go from the horizon to overhead to out of sight.  So they were not wasting any time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was actually able to go into the house in order to grab my camera, tri-pod and my binoculars.  However, in my excitement, the pictures that I took are not the best.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I viewed the objects thru my binoculars, they appeared to be red rings.  When the event was over, I counted at least 24 objects in the sky (Or 8 clusters of 3).  All of which were completely quite.  This viewing lasted about 20 minutes.<n>

I looked up in the western sky and was noticing the big dipper and Arcturus when movement in the sky just left of Arcturus caught my attention.  It was a small, dim, white, semi-transparent, trapezoid shaped object that moved quickly across the sky from the west to the southeast in about 5 seconds.  The object faded off into the distance as I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the object was a trapezoid.  The long sides were oriented vertical, with the longest side being the leading edge of the object.  The leading edge appeared brighter than the rest of the object.  The object was dimly lit, about as bright as an average star.  The color was mottled white, whereby the surface of the object appeared to faintly sparkle or twinkle (similar to the twinkling of stars) randomly across the object, giving it a mottled or semi-transparent appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had no other colors or fixed exterior lights and made no sound (as aircraft would).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 60 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, it was way out there and moved fast. It took about 5 seconds to go from a west to southeast direction.  It made a straight line path and maintained the same elevation across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It left/had no trail. There were no aircraft in the sky at that time.  It was a clear night.<n>

There were 2 fireballs, moving slowly to the east.  I could see like a &#34;fire&#34; or flames in these objects which appeared to be egg shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were planes in the sky as they approached Seatac in Seattle.  These objects appeared to be at about the same level as planes that were making the approach to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not good at estimating the number of feet, but maybe about 2000 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an older woman and have been a nurse for a long time.

The 2 fireballs I saw went behind some clouds, at first one and then the other eventually, and both never came out from behind the clouds.  The clouds were thin and it seems like they should have reappeared, but didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she seemed to us to be quite serious, and sober-minded.

8/28/13 20:00|Roseville|MI|Fireball|8-10 minutes|Aware and very real.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101683.html|104|ndxe201308| Aware and very real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Fireball phenomenon”  This past week I have sited several orange orbs of what seem like fire.  Except unlike fire, no light source is being produced.  There is no smoke or any type of debris falling from or floating with orb.  There is no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every orb that I have sited has been just that, a fire like orb appearing as a deep orange color.   though these orbs have been described as fire balls.  They don’t emit a glow as a fire would and they do not flicker the way fire, especially fire floating through the air would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These orange orbs I have been siting are unique.  They are unique to me because I have seen something of a similar phenomenon in my native state.  Except the orbs I sited in my native state of Florida were red orbs of light that I saw numerous times over a course of two years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red lights always appeared in a group of three.  They never split away from each other.  They always remained close and seemed to stay in one area of the sky, but at a considerably far distance from me.  Unlike! the orange lights I have seen that separate from one another and venture close to populated areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On several occasions I have witnessed all three red lights participate in creating three formations in a particular order.  When the red lights would perform there “formation ritual” the lights were always over the Gulf of Mexico.  They would appear one at a time at first in no particular order.  They were all just close together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after appearing the red lights dimmed out reappearing in a vertical line, one at a time, top to bottom.  They would hold this formation for a remainder of less than 5 minutes and again dim out.  Less than 3 minutes later the lights would reappear in a horizontal line, turning on one at a time, left to right.  This formation was held for a remainder of less than 5 minutes until yet again the lights dim out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now less than 3 minutes later all three red lights have appeared at the same time in a triangle formation.  Very shortly after the last formatio! n they move in close together still holding there triangle for! mation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They move in towards each other, all three lights connect and then disappear.  Just last night I was able to see an orange orb up close enabling me to better monitor its movements and rule out any speculation of the mysterious orange fire balls as being Chinese lanterns or anything related to such.  These orange orbs I have seen in the sky appear to me as being some source of intelligence.  Whether it be in the form of controlled or just an unexplainable form. These things seem to me to have an agenda.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday 08-24-13	  My family and I were traveling east on 696 late in the evening.  It was dark. I looked up into the sky from the passenger window to see a very deep orange colored sphere floating very close.  It was almost as close as the tops of the freeway lights.  We were traveling at 70 mph and the orange sphere traveled with us for about 3 mins appearing in the same spot in my window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After freaking out and trying to get my husband to look at what I was seeing, when I looked again it was gone.  It really looked like a ball of fire.  It seemed to be about the size of a traffic light.  A standard round traffic light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 08-27-13 It was again late evening my husband and I were in our back yard relaxing by candle light.  I looked to the north and saw one fire ball that began to slowly drift west and eventually dimmed out.  It was over a course of five minutes.  Another fire ball appeared in the same general location as the first, but instead traveled north east and after a few short minutes slowly dimmed out.  We waited around to see another one until eventually my husband urged me to come in.  As I was stepping through the door way of my back door right before I was inside I looked to the north and saw another fire ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 08-28-13 Last night around the time of 9:30 I asked my husband to join me in our back yard. Unbeknownst to him I wanted to see the orange fire balls again.  After entering our back yard I walked to our patio table to set down the lit citronella candle I was holding.  After doing so I immediately looked to my left (which is north) up to the sky…. …and behold!  My husband and I see an orange fire ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for a duration of at least 8 to 10 minutes.  It appeared in the north and after almost five minutes it got closer and was now about to pass over our house.  While it was still approaching us and getting closer, we noticed tiny red lights blink a couple times in the bottom part of the fire ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it increased its speed.  When it did this it left a very faint trail of light that almost seemed animated.  I can’t think of a better way to describe it. It was very unusual.  What was even more unusual was when the fire ball began to pass directly over our heads.  It faded from the deep! orange/amber color to a very transparent orange.  It was so transparent that it was almost undetectable.  It looked like the orbs of light that will sometimes appear in still frame pictures.  It was as if the fire ball faded in color because it didn’t want to be detected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It emitted no sound, debris, smoke, nothing. It was so incredible and strange!  After watching the first fire ball pass over out of sight we again looked north to see another fire ball heading west.<n>

I thought perhaps the high humidity in the air caused an airplane to look this way.  Then I thought perhaps it was an airplane on fire.  Within 45-60 seconds, a second orb appeared behind the first, and I realized it was not a plane, not 2 of them that close together.  The second one followed the exact same path as the first.  They disappeared from sight before crossing over the horizon.  They moved at a much higher rate of speed than airplanes do when I see them flying a similar path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These orbs were perfectly round, and it looked like fire with the glowing orange color.<n>

As I was on the phone to you, she stated, she observed two (2) more reddish/yellow balls fall from the middle of the sky, off to the Moscow Idaho mountain range.  She stated that the (2) second object looked like it had wings. Please feel free to call her and speak with her if you would like to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was nice speaking with you Peter, Best wishes.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object I observed.  On 08/27/2013, 21:10:06hrs, my wife and I were outside in our backyard, letting our dogs out, when we both saw a reddish ball appear from the middle of the sky.  Using North as the 12:00 o&#39;clock position, this object fell from the 4:30 to 2:00 hr movement on the clock. It started out red and then went into a yellow ball.  The object fell towards the North East direction, falling behind the Moscow Idaho Mountain range.  The town I am located in is Garfield Washington. We are located approximately 74 miles south of Spokane Washington and we are approximately two miles from the Idaho State Line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the source of the report is a superlative witness.

They were all heading south east, and rapidly changed direction heading northwest. They moved slowly, and there were no blinking lights indicating human aircraft.  We tried to follow them, but eventually lost sight because of tree lines. Today (August 27) we saw the same ball of orange light.  It was only one this time. We were observing to see if it was the same thing.  We stopped our car to look more carefully when we saw the ball of orange light flicker, as if it were a light bulb.  It wasn&#39;t a blink with any kind of rhythm. It flickered about 3 times.  On the third flicker, it disappeared completely.  It was too low in the sky to be covered by clouds.  There were no trees or high buildings for it to go behind in the area. It didn&#39;t fade away, it simply flickered and disappeared.<n>

8/27/13 02:00|Columbia|ME|Light|30 minutes|Bright orange lights seen in sky making impossible maneuvers throughout the month of August.|9/9/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101921.html|124|ndxe201308| Bright orange lights seen in sky making impossible maneuvers throughout the month of August.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Working night-shift during the Maine blueberry harvest this year, I, along with several others witnessed strange craft in the sky.  The first sighting occurred early in the month of August in the town of Centerville.  It was probably about 11pm.  I had parked my car about 100 yards away from where our harvesters were and was walking back to grab my sweatshirt.  It was a clear night and something in the sky caught my eye as I got further away from the bright lights on the tractors.  It was a bright orange light (brighter than any star in the sky), and it sat lower on the horizon than anything else.  I figured it must be a planet or something, maybe Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I got to my car I stood and watched it for a moment.  Occasionally, it would appear as if it was blinking or rotating, flashing different colors: orange, red, and blue.  It started making choppy movements, a little to the right and then back, a little up, and then back. I thought I was just seeing things so I ! headed back into the field, got in my forklift and went to pick up blueberry totes. About an hour later, I looked back in the spot where the light was (North west of the field we were working in, almost in the direction of the old Over the Horizon Back Scatter Radar site, which was 8 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night, the light showed up in the same exact spot it had originally been the night before, at around 9pm. It remained still.  After one of the harvesters broke down, a few of us were standing around talking when I looked up and saw the light slowly moving east across the sky.  I said to my boss and co-worker, &#34;You see that light up there?  That&#39;s no aircraft that I know of.&#34; I told them about the night before.  They didn&#39;t seem to take it very seriously, but they couldn&#39;t explain what it was either.  That night I texted one of my buddies who was irrigating in Township 25.  I told him what happened and asked him if he had seen the light.  He hadn&#39;t, but said he would keep his eyes open.  I had no idea how close or far away the craft was.  I saw it several other nights in Centerville, but it would soon fly below the treeline, out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple nights later we were at a field in Harrington. That night I watched it fly right overhead, towards where I had first seen it in Centerville.  The next time I remember seeing it, we were on the barrens in Columbia.  From the field we were harvesting, the windmills on Bull Hill, 15 miles to the northwest, were easily visible.  My buddy who I had told about the light, was now irrigating in the fields right next to us.  While I was on the back end of a field picking up totes one night, he texted me and said that there&#39;s a weird light over by the windmills and that it might be the one I was telling him about.  Sure enough, when I got back to where his four-wheeler was, I could see that same light through the tops of the trees.  It would move one way real slow, then suddenly shoot back in the other direction.  Then it would shoot upwards, then back down. eventually it got below the treeline where we could no longer see it.  No aircraft that I have ever known of can maneuver i! n the manner that this craft was.  The night after that my buddy texted me around midnight and said, &#34;Light&#39;s back.&#34;  It was higher up in the sky this time and was moving the same way.  When it seemed to get close to the windmills, it started doing something I hadn&#39;t seen it do before.  The orange light faded out, then completely shut off, and was replaced by a dim red light that was blinking in unison with the windmills.  My buddy and I watched the light in roughly the same spot for about a week.  His girlfriend was there and saw it one night too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 26th of August, around 9:30pm, we saw it over by the windmills again, but this time there seemed to be a second one with it, a little further away.  After about a month of seeing this one light almost every night, it was really weird to see a second one with it. We watched them both fade out and disappear.  A few hours later, around 11pm, my employer and co-worker had left to find the other field that we were moving to.  There was nothing else to do, so my buddy and I sat in my truck, listened to the radio, and warmed up until they got back.  Around 1:30am I saw the light to the west, at a fairly high altitude. Pretty soon the other two guys got back.  They pulled up beside me and I told them that we were watching the UFO light.  My employer (who was one of the guys who I had showed the light to in Centerville) said, &#34;I gotta see this.&#34;  He turned his headlights off, and I showed him where the light was. It was kind of a cloudy night, but there were a lot of b! reaks in the clouds where we could watch the light.  Pretty soon, we notice there are more. Four or five more. All the same exact kind of light: bright, solid orange, but occasionally seeming to rotate and flash red, blue, and orange.  They didn&#39;t seem to be flying in any sort of formation, they were just allover the place.  Sometimes they would hover for a while, and then begin making really bizarre movements.  They would fade out, completely disappear, and then reappear.  We watched one of them slowly move right overhead of us, and then shoot back really fast in the direction from which it came.  We were the only four people for miles around at this time.  The blueberry harvest is over now, and I haven&#39;t seen the light since, but when we get another clear night I will definitely look for it.  Seeing this light/lights is probably the strangest thing I&#39;ve ever experienced.  The really weird part is that I saw it so much this past month, that it became a normal occurrence to me.   Nonetheless, it is extremely bizarre, and I would really like to! know wh at those craft were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in the Air National Guard, 101st ARW Bangor, Maine, as well is my father who is a Senior Master Sergeant and the Wing First Sergeant.  He is also a Maine Game Warden.  My employer owns a farm right around here, and his father is a retired police officer.  My other co-worker who witnessed the lights is in the Army National Guard, and my buddy that was irrigating plans on joining the Marines.  None of us have the slightest idea of what these lights could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S.  We attempted to get the light on video several times, but it would not show up on our phone cameras.<n>

I was in bed around 0:50 and heard what sounded like helicopters outside.  I went out back and looked toward town, which is directly due west, and noticed that the night sky was lit up and the helicopter noise was coming from that direction.  Out of no where, 4 Orange-Red Orbs/Fireballs/Lights rose over the tree line, moving away from each other in a North-South direction.  Shortly after, each of the balls split in half and moved toward my location (East).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the lights split, I noticed that in both the North West and South West skies, just barely above the trees, two helicopters were hovering.  4 of the lights flew directly over head and were immediately pursued by a Black Helicopter with Blue and Green flashing lights.  The helicopter turned off it&#39;s spotlight as soon as it started pursuing and as far as I could see, did not turn it back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other 4 light are still sitting in the South Western Sky.  Also, shortly after the 4 lights flew east, two Military jets flew in from the south (assuming from Dover Airforce Base, which is less than an hour flight at that speed) and headed North East.  The jets were traveling at at least Mach 1 because as they flew overhead, at a very high altitude (barely visible to the naked eye), the produced a simoultaneous sonic boom, which shook my deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UPDATE:  4 lights are slowly rising higher and higher.  Helicopter has turned off its spotlight and has ascended with the lights.  Helicopter is holding steady at about half the lights altitude.<n>

Basically, I spotted it through the top of a tree at first. It appeared to be an airplane with one flashing light and the altitude it was at seemed to make sense.  However, the speed seemed unusual for an airplane.  I thought it might be a satellite, but realized the sky was completely overcast. So this kept me watching it trying to figure out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came into plain view, from behind the tree and I could see it moving parallel to the ground, but slightly away from my point of view.  It was a bright flashing light, that seemed to flash in a pattern of threes.  But then it suddenly turned more in my direction and seemed to speed up.  It came from what I thought was some distance at first, but then it was practically overhead in a matter of a couple of seconds.  It did a very &#34;flitty&#34; S-pattern maneuver that almost seemed insect like, but much less random.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed over head, its appearance didn&#39;t seem to change - still flashing, white light. The scale did appear to change, logically, as it was now closer to my position.  It was also silent the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then simply vanished. It didn&#39;t not speed away, but simply vanished as if someone flipped off the light switch.<n>

It was a very clear night so I at first thought it was a bright planet.  I often look at the stars and also live near an airport and directly under a flight path so I am use to seeing lots of lights in the sky and am or was a ufo skeptic until a couple nights ago.  I noticed it but didn&#39;t pay much attention, and about 5 mins or so my wife walked outside and came on the porch where I was standing.  I remember thinking it was really bright to be a planet and looked awful close so I looked up to check it out a little closer and noticed that it was starting to move slowly.  I was just about to remark to my wife how close it was with no sound or normal lights for planes here as it was very low at which point it nearly doubled in brightness and then got very dim rapidly and to my amazement took off very fast at what seemed an odd angle and appeared to be getting more dim a! s it seemed to be going behind a cloud and then out of sight.  I was so excited that I realized I was truly mistaken, what appeared to be a cloud was in fact the milky way.  It was completely clear out. I know this sounds stupid but the object sat there about 5 min until my wife came out and only took off when I started to pay attention to it almost like it knew.  I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not the case but still strange.  Thankfully my wife witnessed the whole thing as well or I would even second guess what I saw.  I don&#39;t know what it was but at the very least maybe an angel.  I know my area and It WAS NOT a plane or natural phenomena.  I hope the truth on these things come out soon because I stand corrected and am now a believer.  The object was a powerfully bright light like a planet size in night sky but Much brighter, with an odd color white light, almost like the suns color light, or moons reflective color light.  One more odd thing our deaf dog was barking which never happens and looki! ng up but I never thought about it until afterward.<n>

Sometimes these objects move closer to the ground across the sky then burn out basically or disappear, sometimes they are red orb objects that turn white and shoot straight up in the air, sometimes they move around with ease north to south in somewhat fixed positions or can move anywhere on a plane, even up and down.   They don&#39;t make any noise and they are becoming more and more frequent, in fact if you sat out on my porch a couple of nights I bet you would see something at least once.  The objects usually don&#39;t disappear right away either.  Only one case did an object make an appearance then disappear right away.  Most the time we only lose sight of th! em because of the trees in our neighborhood.  I thought first of those floating lamps you can let off or if maybe there was a government base near by but, the closest one is in North Eastern Illinois. Something is going on and I can&#39;t quite explain it by conventional means, my dad who doesn&#39;t believe in unexplained phenomena thinks that it is government technology that we aren&#39;t as the public being told about.  I myself have no idea what it is or why it continues to make itself visual to my perspective on several occasions.  We tried one night flashing a spotlight at it to get a good look and it was a dark object that was inside this orange ball of light because sometimes the orange would come in waves almost as if it were surrounded by neon orange water waves and a dark black metallic object is underneath.<n>

They appeared similar to a fireball and were in close proximity to one another.  Not once did we notice it drifting apart or do anything erratic, it simply moved together in the same position.  Furthermore, it had been moving parallel in our direction as we sat at the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued towards Greensburg, we saw another similar looking ball cross Route 30 and pass right over the Greengate Walmart plaza.  It had been moving south to north. This light had the same color and size, but it was not part of the first group of lights that we saw previously.  From the first group of lights to the last one, about two minutes had passed by. I have a feeling that other people may have seen the lights because there were plenty of people out that evening.<n>

It was about 19:20 in the evening, a few moments before sunset - the sky was still light.  I was doing my rounds and I happened to look up at the sky when I first saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking towards the west, I noticed a small black object high in the sky.  It was moving towards the east in a straight line and what appeared to be a constant speed.  I first thought it might be a bird, but as it got nearer I noticed it had no wings.  Its shape also became more apparent as it approached.  It had the appearance of a diamond lying on its side.  The back half was black, but the front half was white and the latter appeared to be spinning on its axis.   could see its shape quite clearly since it was not to high up - below cloud level, and it passed right above me.  It was absolutely silent. After about two minutes it disappeared towards the east - still travelling at a constant speed and in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I work near Israel&#39;s only meteorological station, I&#39;m familiar with their weather balloons which I can see being launched.  I often track them as the rise up, and under certain conditions - like sunset, they can have the appearance of a flying saucer.  I also work near our country&#39;s only international airport, and low-flying aircraft on takeoffs and landings are a familiar sight to me.  What I saw was not a aircraft, helicopter, balloon or kite.  I cannot explain what I saw and this fact has been bugging me ever since.  What kind of diamond-shaped object can fly - let alone make no sound?  I constantly see the object in my minds eye and I&#39;m stumped as to what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took 3 pictures with my cellphone camera, but the camera was low quality and all you can see is a small black dot with a white tinge to it.  My celllphone doesn&#39;t connect to a computer, so I sent it to a friend via SMS who will transfer it to a computer and then email back to me so that I can enlarge it a bit.  I was the only witness, but the object came from the Tel Aviv area so others may have seen it - so far nothing has appeared in the local press/media.I will email the pictures as soon as soon as I can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should mention that the object was about the size of a car and appeared to be on a preprogrammed flight path.  I considered the possibility of a drone of some unusual shape - but why would someone fly a experimental drone over a populated area and near an airport with low-flying planes?  What if it crashed or fell to the ground?  My friends thought I had imagined it, and people smiled at me when I told them what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw and I&#39;m not embarrassed to tell people.  I found your site on the web and decided to send this report. If there are strange objects flying out there we need to know what they are.<n>

I told him since we were in the middle of nowhere and it was so dark there was a good chance we might see a ufo so keep an eye out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been staring at different stars for almost an hour when for whatever reason I fixated on what I believed was Venus because it was the brightest thing in the sky since dusk.  After I had been staring at it for about 5-10 minutes I saw a smaller light that seemed to come out of it or at least out from in front of it.  I blinked and squinted to make sure it wasn&#39;t just my eyes playing tricks on me and it was still there.  I blinked a few more times and before I could tell my friend to look it had completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around that time my friend that was driving kept telling me he was seeing a pulsing white light over the horizon in the opposite direction.  I looked a few times when I he said he saw it but I missed it every t! ime.  The way he described it was that there was an extremely bright light on the other side of a hill or the horizon and the light would come on it lit up the entire horizon in that direction brighter than anything he had seen.  Unfortunately after I saw my light he stopped seeing his.<n>

I sat in my car at a stop sign and witnessed the object gain and lose altitude quickly.  I believe other drivers saw it as well.  I took two still pictures with my phone that are fairly clear and show what I would describe as a mushroom shaped object.  It may have changed shap slightly, getting wider at the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I initially thought it was a hot air balloon, however oh was very dark unlike typically brightly colored hot air balloons.  I also thought it could be a skydiver but I did not see or hear any aircraft in have sky.  It also hovered in the sky then seemed to rise quickly, fall at about the same speed, the rise again slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 2 minutes in total before I realized I would be late for work and drive behind trees.<n>

It appeared to be moving from north to east.  It was slow moving.  It was pulsating from a bright whitish light to almost a non existent light.  I lost the object in some cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been out at this time of morning for over 15 years.  I have seen aircraft with landing/takeoff lights on at this time.  They are steady brightness.  I have also seen stars that flicker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This did not follow the patterns I have seen established for these types of objects in my many years on the go at this time of morning.<n>

A strange green &#34;fire-ball&#34; flew across the sky almost directly in my line of vision.  It was as if it had come from almost directly behind the apartment and made an arch in the sky like it would have if it had been thrown.  I thought maybe it was some kind of natural phenomena except it looked like it was maybe 80ft high from the ground.  There was no sound to it at all and it had a green glow as big as a street light but circular in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just over 24 hours later at 2:14 on 27/08/13 I&#39;m leaving my apartment to drive to my husbands work, when I see the exact same thing in the distance, except this time it left an orange trail and it came out of the sky at a 80 degree angle.  Both times it disappeared just before going behind the buildings.  The second &#34;fire-ball&#34; appeared around 80-100ft, before that I didn&#39;t see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing the second one I called my husband right away to tell him and there was some kind of electrical interference that we both heard and it was very loud.  I had earache for almost an hour after and my husband claims his hearing went in the one ear for a few seconds before returning.<n>

It was the size of the moon, but the shape of a stovepipe, and it was up in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed this for approximately 8 seconds.  It caught my eye while traveling from the south, I stood up, and witnessed it fly to the Northwest.  It dimmed from a moon sized, stovepipe shape, into a small orange ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4 minutes later I heard a boom.  There were no cars out in the country at the time. All the dogs in the distance started barking at the noise.  I drove up the Leavenworth/Jefferson County Kansas line to see if something could have crashed. I couldn&#39;t see anything.  There was no traffic, and no cb radio traffic as well.<n>

I live near Asheville, NC.   I saw several shooting stars and a couple of airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed, coming out of the east heading west, two brightly lit object that seemed to be pretty high up, perhaps 15 or 20,000 ft.  They were close to one another, and proceeded to move at the same speed and, while maintaining the exact same pace with one another, began to slowly diverge, with one object heading north, the other heading south.  They showed no plane lighting configurations, but seemed to be self-illuminated, of a oval or round shape, with a dark spot at the bottom of each object and another lighted section below the darkened area.  They were silent and had to have been huge in size.  This lasted 4 or 5 minutes.<n>

Also, the object had a white halo too it  and had a red light at the  very end of the ship,which was blinking.  Also no noise was admitted form the object.  The object moved just too slow to be an aircraft or helicopter, that I know of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reasoned that maybe it was a blimp but the object was just way too oval shaped to be a blimp plus the lighting on the object was  nothing close too being the Goodyear&#39;s blimp display .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a drinker or drug user and I consent of my report to being of no way a hoax.

At 21:30 I saw the object change from a bright green/yellowish white to a flaming bright red. &#34;  It was on fire so much so that you could see fire dripping down at least 100 feet off the mass.&#34;  For lack of better words the fireball came doing over top of me at Harris road and Ecorse it exploded and broke into two fireballs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one in the front being the size of a grown mans fist ( mind you I&#39;m looking straight up at both of them they are right over top of me.) the one that broke off being at least the size of a beach ball hovering seven feet above your head.

The first one burned up right over what seemed to be Willow Run Air Port.( might try checking if anyone in traffic control saw anything.)  The second fireball continued moving until i lose sight of it on the Harris Road overpass. just up the road for the cross roads giving. no ideal if the bigger one burned up as well or made impact. The New hasn&#39;t reported anything so I&#39;m assuming they both burned up before making land fall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried taking countless pictures and Video but by phone is a ten year old piece of junk so nothing I got was even remotely useable.

It just vanished. It wasn&#39;t an airplane, it just vanished!   Then about 5 minutes later higher up in the sky I saw a little dot of white moving across (not a plane) then when it got directly over my head it flashed into a big circular white light again for about 2 seconds then it dimmed down and kept moving across the sky slowly until the light vanished.  By vanish I dont mean it kept going across the sky until I could no longer see it but it died like blowing out a fire on the spot! .<n>

At about 9pm (+/- 30 min), I poured a glass of wine and had just sat down on the transom to watch an unbelievably clear sky – I have never, ever seen it this clear in Maryland.  I was facing west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 minutes, I noticed a light appear from over my left shoulder, heading east to west.  At first I assumed it was a helicopter, because it was traveling at the altitude and speed that most helicopters seem to travel at.  The light was rather bright, roundish and mostly red in the center and some yellows and maybe greens at the edges.  My best guess is that it was about 200 yards to my left and 300-400 feet up – it’s difficult to judge distance at night, especially with a bright light, and if my distance guess is correct, it was perhaps 50-80 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this object moved westward, a second one appeared same description, and maybe 100 yards behind.  Then a few seconds later a third one, but this one was farther back, maybe three times the separation of the first two.  All three traveled westward in a straight line formation at the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute, the second one moved out of formation to the left and picked up speed.  He passed the leader, still heading in the same westward direction, and then when he was well in front of the leader, his light flickered, or wavered, then perhaps half a second later it flickered and dimmed and was gone.  The original ‘leader’ continued on for another second and when he reached the spot where the other one  changed, his light also wavered, and then flickered and dimmed and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They really have my attention now.  I watched the third guy intently as he continued west and when he reached the area where the other two were, he did the same.  The light wavered, half a second later it flickered and dimmed and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the objects disappeared, it was like they flew into an invisible wall of grey jello, or maybe like on Star Trek, when the ship goes to warp drive.  A silly description, but that’s what it reminded me of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped up and grabbed my binoculars to search the area I had last seen them but there was nothing there. Nothing.  Also, I failed to mention that they were silent.  The wind was blowing at maybe 5 kts so there were no interfering noises that would have covered up the sound of their engines.  Other than the obvious fiery light and the disappearing act, the thing that most caught my attention was that there was absolutely someone at the helm, they weren’t just things floating by.<n>

The sun had gone down, but it there was still some daylight left.  It was mostly overcast.  I was in the driveway seeing off my partner&#39;s uncle.  I was watching them put their stuff in his car.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw what I initially thought was a piece of paper/cardboard ash in the floating in the air above me to the south.  I immediately wondered who would be having a fire?  I had just been in the back yard with my guests and we didn&#39;t hear anyone outside in their yards or smell any type of fire.  It&#39;s also against the town ordinance to have fires in your back yard around here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I kept watching it, wondering what it was.  When I first saw it, I swear it was flat.  It was the color of burning embers.  It was heading upwards toward in a Northeast direction, but heading more upward if that makes any sense.  As it ascended, it looked different.  It looked more like orange lights rather than burning embers.  It was a weird light, almost had a metallic glean to it.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it and it&#39;s kind of hard to describe.  It didn&#39;t seem to look as flat.  I called out to my partner&#39;s brother to look at it. He looked up and said &#34;it&#39;s probably one of those Chinese lanterns&#34;.  My partner&#39;s mother was also watching it at the time from my vantage point.  It didn&#39;t look like any type of lantern to us.   My partner&#39;s mother thought it looked like a plane having a hard time.  But it seemed too close and it made absolutely no noise.  By this time, my partner had come outside.  She tried to start video taping it with her phone, but by t! his time it was pretty high up in the sky.  It continued ascending and disappeared into the clouds before she could get her phone camera going.  This all happened in the course of about 2 minutes at most so I assume it must have been going pretty fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was motivated to write this after listening to you on a coast to coast show dated August 23, 2013.

On Monday, August 25 at around 7:00pm, I walked out of my house to get something from my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was walking to it, I glanced up and saw what I first thought was an airplane at about 5,000 ft. above my head.  I quickly realized that it had no wings, tail fin or rudder.  It was a metallic, cylinder or tube-shaped object, with no markings except a black band around the center of the object.  It was totally silent, with no contrail or other evidence of propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved across the sky and out of sight within 10 to 15 seconds.  It went from east to west.  It was slow enough to observe in the clear blue sky, but too fast for me to run into the house for a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the 4th UFO sighting I’ve had since 1973, but was the clearest and most dramatic.<n>

I got out of my car and noticed it right away in the sky from my driveway.  Had to take a double look because I couldn&#39;t make out what I was seeing.  It seemed like it was something on fire in the sky, it was round but also seemed to change shape, like it was getting larger or wiggling around?  Not sure, I watched it for a few more seconds enough to ascertain that it wasn&#39;t really moving at any high rate of speed,  so I went inside to grab the husband.  Was only in the house for half a minute and it was gone when we got back outside.  No planes or anything in the distance that we could see.  I&#39;m 35 years old, I work at a library here in town, I was sober.  What did I just see?<n>

We arrived home just before midnight.  Myself and my wife were laying in bed watching late night news.  My sixteen year old son came into the room and announced he saw some fire works or flares out of the front living room window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then jumped out of bed and walked into living room, then onto the front porch.  My wife, son and myself then observed five lights (reddish orange in color) move across the sky in sequence one after the other.  These lights were no more than two or three miles away.  They were spaced five hundred to one thousand feet apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the bedroom and got my binoculars and returned outside to observe with the binoculars.  All I saw was a more intense light.  These lights moved in my opinion the speed of helicopters, but with no sound what so ever.<n>

Line ran southwest to northeast.  Then in about 15 seconds the whole line pivoted overhead about 15-30 degree angle so that southern end stayed almost fixed and the northern shifted eastward.  Then both ends of the line moved south away from our view point as it moved it continued to turn towards a 90 degree angle from our view point (now northwest to southeast across the sky) and disappearing towards the horizon, all in less than 2 minutes.  No planes or helicopters visible with clear skies and it did not look like ground based spotlights.  Line was clean and straight with soft glow and almost no visible edge.  With my arm stretched out and with thumb held up, line was thinner than my thumb width.  At first look I thought it was contrail backlit by the moon until started to move and I realized that it did not have the same texture as a cloud or contrail does.  No puffiness, just clean blue beam of light moving in what appeared to be within the atmosphere, but height unknown.<n>

I walked to my right to get better look outside of the branches of a large tree &amp; saw 2 more Orange Spheres in  line with the 3rd.  They were moving rather slowly, like a Gaggle of Helicopters would travel, approximately 500 feet  Above Ground Level.	 		At the time, the Moon had risen to about 135! Degrees Angle &amp; the Orange Spheres were each about the size of one-tenth of the rising Moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3 Orange Spheres were also giving out a light similar to a multi-pointed Star.<n> <n><n> As I watched, I walked forward on the grass alley and with awe &amp; amazement, I kept saying out loud, “Oh, My Gosh! Oh, My Gosh! Oh, My Gosh!   Oh, My  Gosh!”<n> <n><n> The first of the 3 Spheres, went out &amp; I saw a Star in the distant which went out. The 2nd &amp; the 3rd Spheres seemed to stop moving for about 10 seconds &amp; then proceeded to follow the 1st Sphere &amp; the 2nd Sphere went out &amp; the 3rd Sphere went out.  There was no sound emitted from the Crafts. Maybe traveling about a 100 Knots per Hour?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so e xcited!  I called a TV station in Chicago, which is quite progressive, but was put on hold then disconnected 3 times. I asked before the fourth if I should call back the next day, &amp; was told “Yes.”  I then called the Berrien County Sheriff’s Office who did not know what to think of me. I asked for the telephone number to the Michigan State Police &amp; after 3 different officers, last being a shift Capt., with the same disinterest. I did ask if they received any more reports to let me know……<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went inside my motorhome &amp; looked up a reporting center for UFO’s &amp; found this one &amp; called &amp; spoke with Peter Davenport.  He told me that he had just received reports from 2 other callers before me.  Asked if I was near Detroit, Michigan. I said no, I was on the other side of the state.  Being about 22 miles direct north of Indiana &amp; about 90 miles from Chicago.  I am about 5 miles East of Lake Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I consider myself to be very! fortunate for this experience.  Just the previous day I had watched a program on satellite dish about Area 15 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, just North of Dayton, at Fairborn, Ohio.  I had worked there in the 1980’s as a Crew Chief Aircraft Mechanic on F-4D’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am retired from the USAF as a Tech Sergeant Aircraft Mechanic.  I hold an FAA  A &amp; P License.  I also hold a Student Pilot’s License.  I have been afforded 4 rides on attack &amp; fighter aircraft.  The A-37 side seat &amp; F-4D rear cockpit seat, twice each.   So I know a bit about aircraft.<n>

To my right (east), the moon was at about 45 degrees above the horizon.  I glanced towards the moon and saw a line of 3 or 4 orange lights slowly moving south to north a few degrees above the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At a specific point, they would fade away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened three or four times over about a ten minute period.  The first several lights were above the moon. The last two or three lights were below the moon.  I-71 is just a couple miles to the east of my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister used to be a flight attendant for a regional airline and told me once that when flying into CVG from the northeast or out of CVG and going to the northeast, they would follow I-71.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that the lights were planes flying out of CVG.  However, the number and spacing of the lights seems to make that implausible. I then thought they might be Chinese lanterns, but they seemed much too high for that.<n>

I have never seen Chinese lanterns but these things definitely behaved like I would imagine a Chinese lantern to behave.  They disappeared at a height that was partially obscured by my neighbor&#39;s palm tree approximately 80-100 feet away from where I was standing in my backyard.  The palm tree is approximately 25 feet tall.<n>

We live in the country on the southside of Des Moines, 1 mile from the city limits.  I spotted the formation out my bedroom window.  All lights were equally placed in the sky.  They were in a vertical pattern, perfect exact smooth motion.  They all appeared almost instantly in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My picture window is floor to ceiling in my bedroom, and we have a wonderful view.  I have lived here for over twenty years and have never seen anything like it.  I grabbed my camera ran outside and the lights made absolutely no noise.  They moved so precise.  I could not believe what I was seeing.  I called my husband to come and watch.  He was also shocked and amazed.  The lights stayed in order, then as they moved from west to east, they moved somewhat northeast and disappeared.  There were seven lights in the first group and then two lights came a few seconds later, but moved much quicker in the! same direction.  One light followed.  All of these had the same appearance.  Round and orange/red. These were not airplanes, they were not helicopters.  No sound came from them.  They were here one minute and gone the next.  It was really amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were in a stair step pattern and formed triangles.  We were standing on our deck just south of Des Moines.  We were looking north towards the city.  I tried recording the last orange/red light but my camera was not very good.  The images are unclear.  If we see anything further, I will try to capture an image with a better recording device.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We checked the internet on YouTube and it appears that someone in Des Moines posted some lights that were over Des Moines the end of July 2013.  They looked somewhat similar but what we saw tonight was in a very concise formation.

I live on a mountain and have a view of roughly 300 miles of mountain ranges. I went out on the back porch with my family and we were all struck with the &#34;omg what is that&#34; feeling.  The orange lights were solid and formed a Christmas tree pattern in the valley below me roughly 15 miles away so we had an awesome view.  At first I thought they were lanterns being sent into the air but quickly realized that was not the case as they would move in formation in pairs of two - three and then a line of fireballs behind those three that shaped a triangle. they did not ever break formation except to break apart into smaller groups but stayed the same distance from each other.  There are absolutely no roads where these objects were flying.  I tried to get picture but none would show the balls just blackness.  I can however vividly recall every formation and movement compared to my view of the mountain ranges and stationary street lights that I can see at night so I can recreated in pictures their movements if needed.  Looking forward to a call thanks, Justin<n>

It caught my attention due to color shape and distance in the sky.  I lost sight after I drove past and only observed it for 1 or so minutes.  Left an odd impression on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Day 2:  9:30 pm on 8/24/14 driving home Birdlake, MI, I observed the same exact object from the prior nite from my drivers side window this time it was in an open field about 75 ft from the roadway @ 3 stories high.  I slowed my car and observed this object motionless for 5 mins I decided to continue home which was approx. 3 blocks further this area is a lake community so my road was a small lane in order to reach my house I continued to watch the object until I lost sight of this in the tree line it never moved.  I reached my home and had planned to sit outside on my dock to watch the meteor showers the sky was clear and I was anticipating the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside sitting on my bench texting a friend about the upcoming event when from my left hand side I caught site of the red object approaching my dock at roof level crossing  the adjoining neighbors docks coming straight towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became frightened and immediately phoned my son and spoke to him about what was occurring. the object was still coming closer and I told my son I was going to film it with my cell phone which I did.   It stopped at roof top level at my next door neighbors dock and stood still.( I captured this on video) I then decided to go inside because I became afraid of the unknown object.  I called my son  as I came in the house and he suggest I call the police I did not and looked outside through the window facing my neighbors dock and the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a snack and settled down for about 20 mins and decided to go back outside to observe the meteor showers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 15 minutes, the object appeared in front of me in the middle of the lake and rapidly move forward till it reach the end of my 55 ft dock.  It hovered about 10 ft off the water surface I could now clearly see it had changed shape and became a triangle aprox 6x6x6 ft with rotating glowing orbs in each corner.  I was very scared and did not have my phone to take a picture I then heard voices from a few houses down saying something to the effect do you see that I heard them running down their dock and they proceeded to  their boat to where the object was as they got closer the object backed up to the middle of the lake quickly and then went up and over a house across the lake.  They did not notice me sitting there and the next day they stated that they had seen the same thing near my dock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did go inside and called my friend and informed him of what I had seen I did not get a picture of the object as my phone was in the house .after talking with him for approx. 30 minutes, I forget that I had left my coffee cup outside on the dock and went to retrieve it.  As I glanced up in the sky, an object appeared about 13 stories in the air and moved quickly North across the sky and dropped behind a house at the end of the lake. this object was red in color and about 6 feet long cigar shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was a starlight night with some puffy large clouds scattered about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon as I stepped into my yard, out of the corner of my eye, I caught two bright objects in the eastern sky.  I looked up and saw two glowing orange orbs that appeared to be about the height of low commercial airplanes.  I initially thought they might be satellites or bright planets.  However, they were too bright and two low and were moving across the sky to the west, much like propelled aircraft.  The more my friend and I studied them the more we couldn&#39;t figure out what they were.  We actually laughed that maybe we were witnessing UFOs. We thought the objects might be small airplanes but there was no sound or blinking lights. They seemed to be moving far too fast to be hot air balloons.  They traveled too smoothly and quickly to be helicopters. We were really mystified as we couldn&#39;t conventionally describe what we were looking at. When this pair of orange glowing balls made their way to the west, originating in a straight line formation behind them - came 5 more. My friend counted a total of 7.  I thought one of the last ones seemed to veer toward us ever briefly.  However, they all seemed to follow along one after the other on the same trajectory across the sky.  Staring at one of them, I thought there was a certain dynamic flickering light in the center of the orb, almost like a steady upright flame.  However, it seemed different than a normal fire, yet similar in an odd way.  At this point, I was mesmerized by how serene they appeared, and also awestruck.  When I initially saw the 5 additional objects that followed the original 2, I was momentarily nervous about what we were looking at.  However, as I continued to study them as they arced across the! sky fro m east to west, they seemed harmless and serene.  The objects appeared to move slowly, but after they left completely, I gather they must have been traveling at a faster velocity than a commercial airplane to cover the sky in such a short amount of time.  Watching them leave, I was filled with wonder and fascination.  My friend and I agreed we couldn&#39;t conventionally explain what we had just seen and that we had never seen anything like this in the night sky before.  The objects disappeared one after the other into the western sky.<n>

It was a beautiful night, the sky was clear and the stars were vivid.  I kept looking up at the sky every time a plane passed by and there seemed to be a lot.  That&#39;s when I noticed a moving object heading southwest around 9:20 pm.  It looked pretty much just like a bright white light, and it moved slightly slower than the airplanes.  I noticed it did pass under a plane at one point, carried on for another 15 seconds or so, and then disappeared.  After that I didn&#39;t see any planes or other lights in the sky for a good ten minutes.  I was out there from 8:30 pm too 10:00 pm and saw at least 20 planes, all of which had multiple flashing and colored lights on them.  The other object was merely a bright white light which is why I kept sight of it until it vanished.<n>

It moved slower than a falling star, but faster than any plane.  It went in a straight line, but not at a steady rate. There was no tail stream.  A second object followed it a few minutes later.  The last one was smaller about as large as the biggest star in the sky.  It flew in the same direction as the first.

Once it disappeared after about 30 seconds another one appeared just to the east and followed the same path.  Again it lasted about 30 seconds before disappearing.  We saw 3 more lights that followed the same pattern and none made any sound.  We could tell they were not airplanes because there was no flashing lights or sound.<n>

I looked away and helped my husband with disposing of the rubbish, we both then walked away and I saw that the light was still there and had not moved its position, we both looked and realized that this was the same kind of light we had seen in May this year with my parents (there were 6 orbs that time) I had my camera with me, ever since seeing the ones in May I always carry it.  I started to Video (and have made a youtube link will email over, and have taken stills from the movie will send them too)  The very bright orb of light remained in place for a long time - I was not taking count of the time, but by the time it had all finished and I was indoors it was 21:30pm - I would say the whole event was about 20 mins long.  There appeared a second and third orb these came into view for a while, one moved across the top of the main bright orb.  Eventually they all dimmed out. My husband and I plus my step son all saw these orbs.  There is aircraft in this area but they are very easy to spot as they have flashing lights on them, they were going over while we were witnessing these orbs.<n>

So ran out and had my iPhone in hand,  When I seen the objects I first looked for an explanation like maybe a Helicopter or Plane,  But there was No identifying Lights Just a Bright Orange/Red Lights One one each object,  They were pulsing on and off, they stayed at the same speed. One was above the other and ahead of it but they both stayed at the same speeds. I stood trying to Identify them first before I took out my camera.  After looking at them for about 30 seconds I realized they were completely silent, Large, and moving too slow for any Helicopter or Airplane.  They glowed a orange reddish color and then blinked out on and off at the same time.  Me and My 2 friends I believe both witnessed a UFO, I am a Researcher on Conspiracy Theories and of the Paranormal, I new what to rule out and what to look for. ! These lights were solid crafts and large. They moved off slowly. I managed to capture a Short video of them with my iPhone but it was very short because my battery in my phone went dead because of all the videos I was taking while My friends and I were in town. I will upload the short clip to my Youtube  Channel Named MrJasrene1.This was my second ufo encounter in 6 years. The lights blinked out but they moved a good amount of distance. After that My live show on Youtube was mostly about the encounter I had, that video is on My Second Channel named TheFutureTechIdeas.<n>

The objects maintained a constant speed and were traveling in a single file formation.  It was hard to tell how high they were or how fast they were traveling, but they made no discernible sound and appeared to be traveling faster than any plane or helicopter that you&#39;d normally see in the area.  At first, they looked almost like Chinese lanterns, as they flickered like they were on fire.  Their color was also orange.  Because of the flickering, you were unable to determine their exact shape.  They maintained travel until I could no longer see them over the horizon.<n>

It looked like it was high tailing away since we all saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then 30-45 seconds after we saw directly over the trees a black saucer flying into the horizon after it finally just disappeared!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We only got a picture of the orange round thing.

But tonight I am watching an object I can&#39;t identify track across the extremely clear, cloudless sky.  I also must note that the skies are extremely quiet tonight and I have only observed one other plane from my position coming in for a landing throughout this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed what appeared to be a brightly flashing star in a spot that I had not noticed one before in the ESE sky over Boston.  I watched it, could not discern any movement, but noticed that it appeared to be flashing erratically with multicolored lights. Whatever it is, it is very high up.  About 20 minutes later I looked back up (I had not moved from my seat) and noticed that it had moved about a foot in my view across the sky.  I was able to compare it to a junction on a power line which is in the foreground of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I alerted my boyfriend who is equally stumped.  I checked the ISS position which is currently over the Carribean.  I checked Weatherbug.com for visible satellites over this area and found none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve lived here and watched these skies my whole life. Planes that high up appear to move slower, but not that slow!  Currentl,y it is still moving at a barely noticeable pace toward the south. It is most definitely one of the brightest things in the sky, as I am in a very urban area with plenty of glow from the city, but can still make it out fairly easy.  It also seems to get brighter and flash quicker at times, before slowing down and twinkling steadily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s now 21:40 and it&#39;s still making its way south and still clearly visible from my window seat.  Object was too dark and far away to take pictures unfortunately.<n>

Speed and altitude appeared to be consistent with what would be expected from light aircraft.  Light intensity of all members of the formation remained consistent (no flashing or pulsating).  Orange color was deeper than that seen in Sodium vapor street lights.  Movement of the lights within their formation would best be characterized as &#34;undisciplined&#34;.  No sound came from these objects.  Objects did not seem to have any effect on surrounding environment (It was just like they were passing through).<n>

I thought it was Mars.  It stayed there for about an hour.  It changed from white light to red as if it were rolling.  Other people sitting there noticed it as well.  It was staying in the same spot for an hour until it started moving slowly until it was out of site.  I know helicopters and planes have to move so I don&#39;t know what it was.  It appeared to be round but I was not that close to it.  I did not take photos because I did not take my camera.<n>

I didnt think too much of it just figured it was the moon or a plane.  I finished smoking and turned to walk back in but it caught my eye again only this time it was a little higher threw the tree.  I really didnt want to be too curious knowin i had to get up at 600 to go to work but I had to see what it was because i knew a plane should have already been past it was just moving too slow.  I walked to the end of my porch and could see it threw the very end of the branches it appeared to be movin but i just told my self it was probably a breeze moving the leafs.  I focused on several different leafs and none of them were moving.  I went out to my shed and proped myself agianst it and lined the object up with the corner of the building and saw then it was moving without a dout.So i went in grabbed my long range rifle with a very high quality scope and bipod because it looked like a very bright star it was just too big.to be a star.  When i set the rifle up and zoomed in as far as i could.  When i looked at it threw the scope i could see it wasnt a star a all. I could see a clear shape of the object and what really stood out was 3 short black lines about 1/4 the way up on the craft from the bottom.  It was saucer shaped up to these lines and domed shape above them.  The color would be light i guess i have never seen anything like it in my life the whole object was bright white like it was being illuminated from the inside.  That&#39;s the only way i know how to describe it.  I cant explain how the three black lines were stood out so much on something that bright.  I guess the eye relief on the scope really helped.  I could see the  object was moving almost like a car would if u popped the clutch.  Then it would stabilize and not move any then do the same thing looked very deliberate but not like u would think anything functioning correctly would. It would move west every time.  And through the scope it sometimes would fall out of the recital like a stalled plane would do. I went and woke my wife she watched it awhile then became concerned and wouldn&#39;t come back out. It was very very high. I watched it for about a hour moving sporadically but still maintaining its westerly course. Then it stopped and im not sure if it turned or what but it looked like a cube just kind of all of a sudden. It stayed like this for probably ten min and never move inch. I was beginning to wonder what was going on i thought i was loosing it but a very light purple cloud formed under the cube i guess it had to be exhaust. I guess it rotated or something but i could see the original shape once more only the upper part of the craft was very light purple color. It kept movin westward very verly slow then just vanished. there wasnt a cloud in the sky and i never saw it agian. I dont understand what all i saw but the movements were too deliberate to be natural. The light it was putting off was ve! ry very bright i cant understand how the whole object was that bright. To the naked eye it looked like a huge very bright star but that scope told me a different story and i wish i could comprehend what i saw. Thats the best i know how to explain it never seen anything similar in my life. It is what it is.  What that is. Heck if I know.<n>

Then converse with 3 human like beings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This past weekend I was spending some time out by Lake Arcadia.   fraternity that I am a member of(which is part of a near by University) just finished having our back to school get together with some of our members.  The location of the site was right by the shore of the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about one o&#39;clock in the morning and I was the last one there and had been by myself for around thirty minutes. It was my responsibility that night to let no one drive back home while intoxicated and make sure the camp site was in good shape when we were done.  As a result of my duties that night I was completely sober and had not been drinking or using any drugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after I loaded the last bag of trash in the back of my truck I had this strange urge to look at the lake.  The best way to describe that feeling  was as if I had been day dreaming.  There was nothing unusual going on out on then all of the sudden there was a bright glowing light under  the water.  At this particular distance I could tell exactly how large the circle was but it was big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was circular and had a light green/yellowish glow with occasional pulsating reed and blue lights.  I starred at it dumbfounded as it was moving slowly under the water from one side of the lake to the opposite side.  The object moved from one side and back to the other two or three times for about five minutes then it stopped almost near the center of the lake.  The object glowed brighter and brighter than shot straight out of the water and into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I turned around and ran as fast as I could to my truck.  Once I got to my truck I stopped and fumbled around in my pockets for a couple of seconds looking for my keys and seemingly out of no where a bright light appeared above and slightly behind me.  	I turned around to see what was behind me and there was was this giant ship.  It wasn&#39;t a saucer shaped one that everyone talks about  but it had more of a cake shape.  It hadn&#39;t landed but just hovered around twenty to thirty feet off the ground for a couple of seconds. Then shot back up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned back to my truck door and tried to unlock it when I caught something at the corner of my.  I jumped back against the side of my truck and about 15 feet away stood three people staring at me that had not been there prior to this incident.  There were two very attractive woman and one very tall man that was at least ten feet high.  All of them had blonde hair that was almost white and blue eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not say anything to me directly but I heard one of the the woman&#39;s voice in my head. I know your probably thinking that I am crazy but it did happen.  She said, &#34;(my name) please do not be afraid.  You have an important role to play if you would like to help us.&#34; I said out loud in a shaky voice &#34;okay but I don&#39;t know how?&#34;  Then the woman said, &#34;don&#39;t worry you will know in time.&#34;  Right after she said that everything went black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually I woke up around two thirty.  Laying about thirty feet away from my last remembered position at the side of my truck.<n>

I was fishing out of this old Juan boat and there was absolutely no one else on the water.  The only other people that I saw out there that evening was a group of 12 to 15 people around a fire on a campsite on opposite side of the like.  Believe me, you could tell and hear that they were there.  However there was no one at that site for a while before the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was getting ready to leave when about 60 to 75 yards behind me, a giant bright and glowing light appeared under the lakes surface.  It was fairly large and had a light green color to it with a rhythmic flashing of red and blue lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light began moving from western side of the lakes shore to the  eastern side and back to the other side a couple of times then it stopped almost near the center of the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment, it grew brighter and slightly larger then shot straight up in the air and into the sky and seemingly disappeared for a couple of seconds and reappered hovering right over the campsite that I mentioned earlier and disappeared again.  Then reappeared again maybe a minute later and shot up into the sky and went out of sight and I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove my boat over to the site where the craft was hovering over as fast as I could get there.  However, I did not recognize anything out of the ordinary.  Just a white ford truck with several bags of trash in the bed and a couple other sitting beside it.  I did not see any one by the truck or in the immediate area.<n>

They would disappear at a certain point in the sky.  The objects were totally silent.  The lights would get bright and dim.  They would pulsate.  My husband looked at some of the objects through binoculars and they appeared to be triangular in shape.  I called someone in the neighboring county to see if they could see the objects.  They saw flashes in the sky, but nothing else.  We called several news stations and no one reported anything.  The lights were moving in straight lines in no certain pattern at various heights above treeline in the sky.<n>

Noticing an orange glowing light in the night sky, we guessed at possibilities such as a helicopter with a searchlight, or a flare.  She briefly thought she heard a muffled helicopter type sound, but we were standing near an outside AC unit which also produces a hum.  We then took notice that outside of the orange light, we could make out no other lights on the object, which moved with what seemed like a controlled &#34;floating&#34; similar to that of a helicopter.  The brightness of the color varied but was always orange as it moved basically parallel and a few hundred feet above the tree line, until eventually disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ruling out the flare theory, and assuming we had seen a helicopter equipped with searchlight, the darkness, or our angle of viewing causing the odd appearance, my employer leaves.  Three more fellow employees walk outside and as I&#39;m filling them in, one points to what appears to be two, new, similar objects.  We watched for what I&#39;d guess was around 15 minutes as they took a like path as that of the first object, but at various points seemed touch each other, fly in loose formation and be linked or connected(think one towing the other).  Again the constant orange color with varying stages of brightness.<n>

This was in South Portland Maine, The Airport (PWM) is approximately 4 air miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither Vehicle had any collision markers flashing at all only the orange glow, Both vehicles executed a slight easterly turn towards the ocean and the lights faded.  The sky was clear no clouds.  No sound could be heard coming from them either that we noticed.  Any planes approaching the airport usually come in from south to north not north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident lasted about 45 seconds to 1 min 30 seconds.  Both vehicles were heading towards oncoming aircraft approaching PWM.  Definately should not have been routed that way by air traffic control.<n>

I was sitting for a while to try to figure out what it was.  It was very quite, no sound and no wind in the trees After a while i became frightend that this might be a ufo and went inside.  I didn&#39;t talk to anybody about it because my husband does believe in aliens. I don&#39;t.  He told me today about the girl in North East reporting the same strange lights that&#39;s when I thought I send you my report<n>

My boyfriend saw 3 of them first dancing around very choreographed and puposeful and then they went into warp speed and went up and in different directions followed by another that came from from behind them.  That is when he got me because he thought I wouldn&#39;t believe him?  lol  I saw just one very bright orange silent red ball and just stayed in one spot hanging over the treeline for 2 or 3 minutes it seemed.  It started fading to a lighter orange and got elongated.  I could see auras of light barely visible shooting of from it towards the North East and then eventually it just faded out.  I almost felt like it was staring at us..lol<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>
8/23/13 22:09|Davenport|IA|Sphere|3 minutes|Fiery orbs/ spheres seen on two seperate occasions.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101639.html|231|ndxe201308| Fiery orbs/ Spheres seen on two seperate occasions<n> <n><n> <n><n> August 6th and August 23 sightings reports   On August 6th 2013 at approximately  9:40pm CST I witnessed 8 orange glowing spheres over fly my location and ascend into the clouds.  I was out in my apartment parking lot walking my dog so he could go potty, when I looked to my right, and noticed two Fiery orange spheres floating through the air side by side.  To my right (due south) was a line of pine trees perpendicular to me, and behind that a financial office and doctors office.  Beyond that even further was 53rd street as appears in the map I am sending you.  The objects, as I don’t know what else to call them were about the size of a small car.  They were evenly spaced at 50 feet apart and were directly side  by side.  These objects were to my right moving to my left, from due south on a due north heading and literally flew right over my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this hour of the night, there was no prevailing wind of any kind it was still. The cloud ceiling was approximately 500 feet with heavy overcast.  These objects were no more a couple hundred feet high if that.  They literally moved right over top of my at this low altitude, moved no more than 200-300 feet farther to my left before moving straight up in the the cloud base and disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sooner than this happened, did ANOTHER pair do exactly the same thing. In total, I witnessed four pairs of these objects take exactly the same flight path, in pairs, with exactly the same spacing between them and same altitude, everything.  At this time, the street lights in my apartment went black, and my cell phone SHUT ITSELF OFF.  This is NOT something that has happened before, and unnerved me greatly.  These objects were the size of a small car and were radiating orange light, they were VERY bright, spherical in appearance, and were casting shadows in the parking lot.  It didn’t just unnerve me, it unnerved my dog as well who was whimpering and wanting to go back in the apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not fill out a report of this initially because I did not think anyone would believe me.  Simply put I thought I was the only one who saw this, and had no pictures because of the odd behavior of my phone and the lights in the lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I have chosen to write this now is because I saw an identical object again on August 23rd 2013 at exactly 10:09pm CST.  I know the exact time because I was able to get three pictures of the object this time which was alone, and coming from the same direction and general area as last time but veered away from me and up in the clouds at what I estimate was a half mile this time.  When I spotted this object, again out for a walk with my dog, it was approximately 30 degrees off the horizon from me and the size of my thumbnail  with my arm held at arms length.  Again, there was wind this time but the wind was a easterly wind and this object was headed right for me moving north, until it made a turn and headed west, heading directly INTO the wind.  The wind speed was 6-7 mph as I measured it after this sighting with a Kestrel wind meter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am forwarding you the three photographs I managed to capture of this object as well.   The photos were captured using a Samsung Galaxy S2 Cellular telephone with the flash feature turned off. It is the model 727I phone, with an 8 megapixel camera.  I do not use any other mode than the normal one, or any aftermarket camera apps.  The images I am sending you were displayed in Microsoft office picture viewer and the brightness enhanced and size blown up.  No other edits were made and I can and will send you copies of the originals upon your request in their unaltered form.  I used the railing of my deck to steady my hand in the hopes of getting some decent pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These sightings took place in northeastern davenport iowa, near the mt joy airport, which is a small regional airport with minimal traffic and a small national guard rotary wing unit stationed there as well.  No Nat’l Guard traffic was in the air that I know of.  There were other aircraft in the air during both sightings.  Someone else HAD to have seen this..<n>

We&#39;ve both been living near the Ohio Air National Guard base/Spfld.  Municipal Airport, WPAFB, and Dayton International Airport for the majority of our lives, I think it&#39;s safe to say we know what aircraft look like, even at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just happened to look up into the sky and this thing immediately caught my eye as being unusual. It was cruising at a relatively low altitude and speed compared to other air traffic in the vicinity.  It displayed NONE of the standard FAA required lighting and made NO sound.  Surprising for how low and close it was.  Also, it appeared to have no distinguishable outline.  Basically it just looked like a ball of white light.  I said to the ladyfriend, &#34;That&#39;s kind of strange.&#34;  We both were standing there watching this thing when it suddenly faded into an orangish color then COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were absolutely no clouds in the sky and this thing was very far from the horizon where it could&#39;ve appeared to have vanished.  For the rest of the walk home we were comparing the air traffic to what we just saw.  It was apparent we saw something unusual.  No red/green or blinking lights on wing tips which were clearly visible on aircraft at a much higher altitude.  Definitely NOT a satellite because the altitude was WAY too low.<n>

It looked as if a fireball was inside a vertical triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There did not seem to be a front portion to the object and it moved in a straight line with an occasional zigzag and hovered for a short time just before it went out of our sight..<n>

We decided to park the car and go look at these lights which were so intriguing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got out and walked to the end of the street, there we saw the lights, they were normal, white lights, they were stacked vertically but not in a tight way, it was slanted and it didn&#39;t look aligned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved from what seemed so far away to closer in what seemed like no time at all. They just sort of, hovered over.  The light became a little bit bigger and we tried to figure out what it was.  Then the other witness cried out &#34;there&#39;s something between them&#34;  I didn&#39;t understand what she meant.  I looked and the light closest to the ground was now dripping, like a hot metal or something.  It didn&#39;t seem like a beam or anything but it was kind of illuminated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the witness was hysterical and went inside and was almost begging me to.  I eventually got the witness out again, where the light looked like they had faded a little, possibly getting farther away again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we just observed the lights, it didn&#39;t last long, the wits was texting and took her eyes off of the lights, I saw a shooting star that was so close, we mever ever see ones this close it was amazing.  It took all of my attention away from the light for a quick second.  And that&#39;s all they needed.  I instantly looked back and they were gone.  Completely gone.  I was freaking out.  I stayed out there to make sure they didn&#39;t just fade away and come back.  They didn&#39;t.  I had never believed in UFOs or anything but I am in tears anytime I explain this story to anyone. It was so surreal and scary.<n>

The lights were bright at first, a dark orange, definitely not “whitish” like stars or aircraft lights and moved slowly, almost gliding in a non-unison formation.  It sort of resembled someone letting go of balloons with candles in them.  The first time I saw them I actually thought maybe it was some sort of air balloon thing.  They were silent and became dimmer as they appeared to come closer, but that’s assuming they were traveling horizontally along the coast.  They just one by one slowly disappeared one by one, not in any particular order.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We heard absolutely no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t a plane, helicopter or one of those Chinese lanterns (we had seen the lanterns earlier this summer and they did not ascend very high let alone move very fast whatsoever).

The reports are well written, and the witness seems sincere, although we would be surprised if all of the sightings are about authentic UFOs, i.e. alien spacecraft.  We cannot be certain, however.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> SOME CONCLUSIONS FROM THE PAST 27 SIGHTINGS I AND OTHERS HAVE HAD ON SANIBEL AND CAPTIVA ISLANDS, FLORIDA, OVER AN EIGHT WEEK PERIOD FROM JUNE 24 TO AUGUST 20, 2013  Based on what I and friends have witnessed I believe that:  1.	There has to be some reason that all these UFOs, and especially the “city on the horizon” glows, are in this particular area.  OR are they elsewhere along the coastline of SW Florida? 2.	I have a strong feeling that there may very well be some kind of underwater base in the area, especially in light of the sightings of the past 5 nights or so.  It makes sense because one would think that they have to be coming from somewhere, and underwater is as good a place as anywhere else, again considering strong evidence pointing in this direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.	Amber, orange, and red “fireballs” are one and the same, and change colors for yet unknown reasons – they have been the predominant UFOs of the 7 different types have seen 4.	fireballs I&#39;ve seen are directly associated with both single-light and multiple light strobe “flashers 5.	fireballs I&#39;ve seen are closely associated with goldish-white elongated football shaped UFOs 6.	UGOs (Unidentified Glowing Objects) were directly associated with amber “fireball” UFOs at times, which changed color to orange and then red, just before one of them “dropped” a strobing object down to the ground or water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7.	Other UGOs seen out on the Gulf of Mexico have been seen mostly in association with fireballs, except for once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8.	Most UGO sightings have been at specific locations, but one did move to another area once 9.	Since my first sighting on June 24, 2013, I’ve been out sky watching 39 nights out of the 56 nights available to date (8/18/13) – 69.5 percent of the available time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10.	UFOs and associated phenomenon have been sighted on nearly 70 percent of our outings!  That’s 27 sightings in 39 nights!! And on most of these nights, way more than a single UFO or other object were seen.  One report I’ve listed was from a man on nearby Cape Coral who described exactly what I and others have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11.	Of the 38 times I or others have been out, we have had 27 sightings, which is 68% of the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12.	I have missed going out 18 of the available 56 nights, which is 32% of the available time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 13.	There have been 9 to 9.5 hours of darkness per night during the past 8 weeks, and I’ve primarily been out only 2 or so hours per night on average, 22 percent of the time.  What’s happening the other 80 percent of the time? 14.	It appears that the “action” has moved from where it started 2 months ago at my friends house on Sanibel Island, two miles to the south of me, to some 7 miles north off of the uninhabited island of Cayo Costa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 15.	Finally, if the right kinds of cameras were set up to view the area all night long, or if I could get some volunteers our here for a better than 50:50 chance of seeing something, then there would be a reasonable chance of figuring out what is really going on our here.<n>
8/23/13 18:15|Eleven Mile Corner|AZ|Unknown|15-20 seconds|Observed large, shimmering, translucent shape in daylight sky over Arizona.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101538.html|247|ndxe201308| Observed large, shimmering, translucent shape in daylight sky over Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 6:15PM on August 23, 2013 my wife and I were traveling South along N 11 Mile Corner Road.  We were traveling at 55 - 60 mph and had just passed the intersection of N 11 Mile Corner Road and E. Kleck Rd..  It was daylight and the sun was above the horizon and West. We were and remain unable to identify a large shape we saw moving through the sky at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, I noticed a large shape to my 10 o&#39;clock at 15-20 degrees off the horizon.  It was about three quarters of a mile distant and was moving East to West, parallel to Highway 287 and perpendicular to our direction of travel.  I was about to dismiss the shape as a flock of birds until shimmering and/or reflected light caught my eye.  I noted the shape undulated and flowed as would a flock of birds, but there were no birds visible in or around the shape.  The shape was translucent with a diffuse edge. I could see sky through the shape.  I commented to my wife, &#34;What is that?&#34; as I slowed the vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife acknowledged seeing the shape and expressed curiosity as I continued to drive. We observed for about 10 seconds before it disappeared behind some trees:  Long enough to capture our interest but not long enough to get at the iPhone to document the event.  The shape reappeared and changed direction.  We observed the shape a second time for less than 5 seconds before it seemingly blended into the background and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after initially sighting the shape, it passed behind a water tower located West of N 11 Mile Corner Road. The tower is about 60 feet in height. We were roughly a half mile from the tower as the shape passed beyond it. The shape was roughly 3 times the height of the tower with a length to height ratio of about 4 to 1. An absolute size for the shape is difficult to estimate as the shape was some distance beyond the tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no sound that we could detect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape had no markings and appeared to be under its own power.  The overall geometry was rectangular.  It narrowed slightly at West end. Corners were poorly defined and slightly rounded.  The shape was thin, almost ribbon-like.  My wife remarked it resembled a transparent advertising banner that moved like a flock of birds as it reflected sunlight and shimmered.  However, it lacked a tow plane or any notable form of propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within several seconds of passing behind the water tower the shape banked toward the ground and disappeared behind a growth of trees.  It emerged several seconds later having changed direction.  The shape was heading South at this point.  We lost sight within a few seconds of its reappearance as the it simply blended into the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a scientist by education (biochemist) and formally trained to observe.  I cannot explain what I saw. It was large. It moved under its own power.  It radiated and/or reflected light. It did not seem to belong in its surroundings.  It did not resemble any traditional flying object that I know of.<n>

Ran into my house to grab my binoculars.  Was in the house for 30 sec. +-,  When I returned the object was still in the same place.  Which was approx. the 11 o&#39;clock position to the south west.  Stayed observing the object for approx. 20 min until me neck started hurting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can best describe the object as having 6 sides which composed of 6 white orbs with 1 in the middle total of 7 orbs clustered together.  With only 1 of the outer orbs flashing on and off. My sister joined me about half way through this 20 min til the object was almost directly over head.  Tried taking photos with my cell phone. But Haven&#39;t had a chance to view it yet.  I hope this helps because I couldn&#39;t make this up if I wanted to.  But please try to track it yourselves. I wanted to report this to you asap. It&#39;s probably still there. Thank you for your time<n>

The object traveled from the northeast from the direction of lake Erie and passed my backyard and headed southwest till I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.what caught my attention was the speed to slow for a plane or chopper  it reflected light looked silver,and metallic.  what I saw next made me wonder what was going on ,  the object either changed or well in the pictures something either flashes change shapes can some o! ne tell me.  If anyone has had a similar experience l forward to see a post.<n>

As I looked closer, it seemed...irregular.  There was a bank of bright red, blue and green lights on the craft.  There were approximately 6-8 lights, all arranged in a horizontal configuration with a slight triangular positioning.  It passed slow from North to South and slowly banked to the North. Approximately at a height of 700-1500 feet high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching it proceed to the North, I noticed a second craft with similar lights, stationary to the East.  The first seemed to be approaching the second.  I opened the window and there was no noise I could discern from either.  I went for my camera, changed the lense and headed outside.  By the time I got outside, both were gone, but a singular white light had begun approaching from the distant North.  I waited and it was identified as a normal commercial Jet.  The lighting was not similar to the previous two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two years ago I saw and reported on another site a very large, translucent triangular craft moving from the South to the North in this same area over our home...so I keep my eyes open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our home is just North of the new NSA center in Lehi, and there is a nearby Helicopter base so I am familiar with the distinct differences in the types of Aircraft that overfly this route.  There are helos in the area and they make very audible noises and the commercial jet route also tracks directly over our home or also West of us from North to South or South to North, those are also audible.   These, whatever they were, were clearly different...<n>

The whole night sky light up just about every few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 10 pm when my son and I were driving home on a dark country road.  We were traveling east going 25 mph.   I happen to be enjoying the light show from the storm when all sudden I saw something within a cloud that just had lite up with electrical activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Inside this large cloud was a “HUGE” long rectangle object.   The top and bottom were very long and flat with the sides being very short in height.  There were 4 corners and on each corner where lights of yellowish/orange shining off the tips.  Inside the rectangle there seemed to be a soft whitish/silver glow throughout.  All the edges of the rectangle where very defined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happen to see this as the cloud it was hiding in had lite up.  When the cloud went dark and lite up again the object was gone.  I had my son drive back down the same spot where I saw it off in the distance.  Unfortunately, the object was gone or at least had moved out of sight.  I would have to say that it was the largest thing I had ever seen in the sky.  It was “HUGE and AMAZING.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel very fortunate to witness such an object. It seemed to be close to the lake front over the city of Sheboygan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I am quite familiar with the night sky in Missouri.  I have been observing Saturn all summer, and have lately been observing Nova Delphinus 2013.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I set up my telescope at the same location every night.  (I can be contacted privately for the exact latitude/longitude/altitude of the location.)  I align it using the stars Arcturus, Altair, and Polaris.  Once the scope is aligned, I focus on the area of the sky I plan to observe.  While I wait for my eyes to become accustomed to the dark, I look for the ISS, which passes overhead quite regularly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening the ISS passed over around 2135 (approximately).  After it had passed overhead, I turned toward the east, facing the constellations Cygnus, Saggita, and Delphinus.  Before I looked through the telescope, I planned to use binoculars to see if I could spot the nova that way first.  As I turned to pick up the binocs, I saw a moving object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was slightly larger than Venus currently appears from Earth in the evening, and its relative brightness was equal or slightly brighter than that of Venus.  It came from the North-West and crossed the visible sky going South-East.  It was moving quickly, but I was able to sight it with binoculars.  Through binocs it appeared brighter.  I then hand-tracked it with the telescope for the space of perhaps 10 heartbeats.  It was completely silent, and the lights were steady, not flashing as they would be, for example, with a B-52 or other large aircraft.  It did not change in colour, brightness, size, shape, speed, or trajectory throughout the time I observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object was directly overhead, the telescope failed.  Also at that point, all traffic noise from Missouri 13 stopped, although this may have been coincidental.  All insect and animal noises including summer cicada chirping stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought the telescope had simply come unplugged from the 12-volt outlet in my Ford Ranger, or alternatively that the battery in my truck had somehow died.  I got into the truck and tried to start the engine but was unsuccessful.  There was no click from the starter, and the engine failed to start.  I unplugged the telescope and attempted to push-start the truck (it has a standard transmission) but it failed to start.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My nose began to bleed heavily at this point.  I got out of the truck to load the telescope into it.  I noticed the object still moving South-east, toward a cell tower located near Lakeland High School.  The red hazard lights on the cell tower died away.  Both the flashing top tower lights and the constant mid-tower lights faded as the object appeared to approach them.  The tower was completely dark for several seconds before the warning lights returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I loaded the telescope into the truck.  I had left the key in the ignition and the ignition on when I got out to load my gear.  When I got back into the truck, I saw that the panel lights were now operative so I tried once again to start the engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time it did start, so I drove home immediately.  Once I arrived at home I found that the telescope’s hand computer had been completely reset.  All data had been cleared, including the boot data, and will have to be restored.  Since the telescope has battery backup, this cannot have been caused by a simple loss of power; the computer’s memory has been erased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I arrived home (a five-minute drive), the nosebleed had stopped.  However, I did (and still do as of this writing) have a headache approaching migraine proportions.  This may be coincidental, or stress-related, and nothing to do with the object itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I got in the house I telephoned to Whiteman Air Force Base, which is (relatively) near my location.  I spoke with Sergeant Fry, who advised me to telephone the National UFO Reporting Center.  She stated that there was no military activity in the area of Deepwater, MO, this evening, and that the information I gave her, including the report on my physical condition, should be reported to proper authorities at the Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea of the object’s actual size, nor of its relative velocity.  I was so astonished and upset by the experience that I also do not have a solid trajectory for it.  The best I can do is to say that it moved from slightly North-West to slightly South-East and was visible for at least five minutes.  It passed east of the star Vega, and slightly west of the star Altair as it moved across the sky — in fact, very near the constellations Delphinus and Saggita, which is why I saw it to begin with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a stellar object; it was moving too fast to be such a thing.  If it was simply a satellite, it is one with whose trajectory I am not familiar.  Given the fact that I observe this area of the sky nightly, that is unlikely.  To the best of my knowledge, the object was not a satellite; I can find no reports of satellite trajectory, IF events, or the like which match the time, date, area of the sky, or description of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never had an experience like this before, either during the time I spent on active duty, or as an amateur astronomer, and am unable to explain it.<n>

My wife was sitting facing northwest and made a comment about something moving fast in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to look, and what we first saw was a bright white light approaching from northwest to southeast.  As it got closer it appeared to get brighter.  I did not observe any flashing red or green lights, or white strobes, no engine or rotor noise, so I thought maybe a low orbit satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it flew more directly overhead, the light seemed to fade and then disappear, still traveling southeast.  As I was looking at that object, my wife and neighbor pointed out another object behind it traveling the same height and direction.  What made the second object different is, as it approached, one light turned to two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then three in a triangle shape.  Then, 4 lights, till it was overhead and you could see 6 lights arranged in ! a hexagon shape.  At this point I had grown into more disbelief because once again, no engine noise, no rotor sound, no strobes or red and green lights.  We have planes and helicopters that fly over regularly, and all of those aircraft are unmistakably what they appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two objects were traveling too fast for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed my neighbors across the street were sitting in their garage with a group of 4 or 5 other people and I had to point this out to them.  We all were watching as the six lights kept traveling together in a hexagon formation and eventually faded out as it continued traveling southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most airplanes as they pass over their strobes and lights are still visible for several miles.  These objects were not like that.  Probably more directed in front and straight down or maybe they just faded off as it went overhead and on.  I have never seen lights arranged in a hexagon formation on any aircraft I have ever seen and I used to work on aircraft years ago ! so I am familiar with how aircraft lighting is.  Whatever it w! as, it w as not civilian or commercial.  I will point out my neighbor police officer is also ex military and he was as perplexed as I was.  I waited to report this because I thought surely this could have a reasonable explanation but the more I kept thinking about it, the more I couldn&#39;t ignore what I saw.<n>

8/22/13 20:50|Isanti|MN|Fireball|6 minutes|Saw a fireball up close with my wife and 4 year old son.|9/9/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102053.html|270|ndxe201308| Saw a fireball up close with my wife and 4 year old son.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 22rd, 2013 I was in my basement when my four year old son came down to inform me there was a star outside. I thought it odd, and went upstairs to check it out. When I came upstairs, my wife was at the window telling me to look outside and that there might be a ufo outside. I grabbed my Nikon p500 camera and went outside to look, and there was in fact something on the horizon, possibly 1000ft in the air, and a few thousand yards away. I turned my camera on, zoomed in with a 36x zoom, and my camera was set on auto mode and the long exposure setting kicked in.  The picture turned out horrible.  I attempted to take another photo and while I was looking at it in the viewfinder, it disappeared before my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside, and my family was on edge. I said some words to my family and then called some people to tell them what I saw.  I was on the phone with a friend from work when I heard my wife tell me, &#34;... you have to come here and see this.&#34; I went outside and looked on the horizon where I saw the ufo before and couldn&#39;t see anything.  My wife told me to look to my left and I did. My heart sank, my adrenaline kicked in and I became scared.  A stones throw away, about 20ft off the ground was a floating ball of fire flying between me and the street light, following the path of the street.  I could see every single detail on this thing and it looked like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the center was a perfect circle maybe the size of a half dollar coin and this circle was bright orange. Radiating from the center circle was a larger spherical aura that almost looked like the mist you see when looking directly at an atomizer spray bottle (like on a Windex bottle set to mist) except that it was fire.  Around this larger sphere were flames that went upwards, just like if you were looking at a camp fire.  The flames were fire red/orange and it moved through the air very very slowly, about 1-3mph.  The total size of it was about the size of a basketball, perhaps slightly larger.  It was 100% silent. As this thing moved the fire trailed behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I prayed to Jesus Christ to protect us and this thing did a 90 degree turn, and left.  It slowly ascended, southbound, over perhaps a 2000 meter distance, climbing to maybe 500-1000ft, then it disappeared.  I tried to take photos of this object when it was up close, but I was shaking very badly.  My photos look like trash, but they are the real deal.  I still have the originals on my camera if needed.  I also took a video, and unfortunately it too is shaky, but it&#39;s there for what it&#39;s worth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These things are real, but I&#39;m telling you the truth: they are not what the world thinks they are. Having seen this thing up close, I can tell you they are very real, alive and subject to Jesus Christ. They appear and disappear at will, and It is likely that they are demonic and deliberately deceiving the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don&#39;t fall for it. If you read this, you were warned and without excuse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Repent, confess the Lord Jesus Christ with your mouth and believe in your heart that God raised him from the grave and you will be saved. It&#39;s true, I witnessed this thing first hand flee at the hand of the living God.<n>

Lights were at around a 50 degree angle ahead of me, flying towards me (heading north).<n> <n><n> <n><n> They started as two very bright lights, close together like headlights on a car about as wide as the full moon in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to observe the lights for about a mile and a half down the highway (I was driving 65 mph) as I got closer and it larger until it passed directly over my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were the two bright lights I witnessed on either side of the craft, with white lights visible underneath and another white light at the nose of the craft.  I witnessed one flash of blue light near one of the white lights.  It appeard triangular in shape, but it was after dusk so the shape was difficult to distinguish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it passed over me I lost sight of it because I was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wind was blowing WSW 1G08 at 249 ft. elevation.<n>
8/22/13 20:45|Pemberton/Fort Dix|NJ|Unknown|2 minutes?|I saw multiple unidentified lighted Objects in the sky.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101435.html|272|ndxe201308| I saw multiple unidentified lighted Objects in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving in the town of New Lisbon, NJ, heading towards Browns Mills, NJ.  I was about to turn right onto Junction RD, when I saw several good sized lights to straight ahead of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew instantly from the size and number of them (6-8 or so)that they were not something you see every day.  I decided not to make the right onto Junction Rd, and quickly went straight ahead out to the next Rd (Pemberton- Browns Mills RD) to see if I could get a better view of them.  I sped and got to the next road over in about 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came to the stop sign, I parked and got out.  I could see them objects still, but they were going behind the tree line and out of my view.  I got my cell phone out as fast as I could, and started to film.  I was a bit nervous, and it took me a few seconds to get the camera video going.  By this time, most had gone behind the tree line.  One was still very much in the open, and I decided to film that one.  For anybody that is Familiar with this area, it was over the Pemberton Twp Police Department building along the woods line, but was further back not close to Pemberton Browns Mills Rd. I could not judge the distance, but guessed it was out near Pointsville RD on Fort Dix somewhere near Emmons Dairy, a well known Farm in my area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took me a few seconds to find the object with my phone. They were lights, I didn’t see any shape of the object itself.  They seemed to flicker a bit almost to a light blue color.  There was no sound at all while I recorded, other than the sound of passing cars in front of me.  I recorded for about 30 seconds, until I became aware, I was standing in the middle of a road, and then looked around to make sure no cars were coming behind me.  The object also got behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All along, these objects were in some sort of formation or pattern, not just randomly in the sky.  Upon playing back my video, I saw it came out shaky, but I did catch the object, although it appeared smaller on the video than it did with my own eye.  I don’t know how to zoom with my camera on my phone, or perhaps the video would be better.  Other objects in the video include a street light and cars passing by horizontally in front of me. The object itself, seems to move quickly back and forth within a small area.  I don’t think this was due to my shaking hand, but I don’t know for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, the best spot I estimate the objects to have been flying directly over would be in the area of Pointsville Rd between Pemberton &amp; Fort Dix Military Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living in the area of Fort Dix &amp; McGuire AFB my whol life, I am used to seeing and hearing planes &amp; helicopters.  These were no planes as they floated way too slowly.  They may have been stealth choppers possibly, but that&#39;s the only thing I could imagine them being.  They floated with a purpose, and in a formation of some sort, all moving together in one direction towards Fort Dix and McGuire AFB.<n>

It had a light that continuously rotated around the bottom as it traveled below the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate it was a few hundred feet in the air but it was a small object, maybe the size of a small helicopter or a bit smaller.  I expected to see a tail on the object because of its&#39; size but there was definitely no tail to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over to watch the object for approximately one minute until I could no longer see it due to trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a pizza delivery driver in this area and am always watching the skies and I can tell you I have never seen this object in the skies around here or anywhere else.<n>

We looked up  to the sky and saw what looked to be an object that consisted of a bright red light on the right and a  bright green light on the left.  When we first sighted it, the object seem to be flying toward us but turned and zoomed off in another direction.  When the object first appeared, it seemed to be no more than 250-300 yards and a height that was not more than 50-100 foot above the tree line.  The object was definately being manuvered or driven by someone or something.  It darted and zoomed to a spot and then would stop and just hover.  I have never seen aircraft that would typically fly like this one.  It could raise itself straight up or down make turns easily and zoom to the next location.  When we last saw it, my husband said that it looked like it had slowly gone straight down behind a group of trees.  I did get a picture of it and were able to enhance it so you can clearly see  what we were seeing with the naked eye.<n>

When I went back outside there were 2 bright orange and yellow objects that looked like flying campfires about 30 degrees above the horizon. They were flying at the same rate of speed as they stayed the same distance apart. They left my sight in the NE sky. Then I looked to the NW and saw 2 more exactly the same coming across the sky. One was a little higher than the other, but again kept the same speed and stayed equidistant apart. Now I was debating whether to run in the house and get my camera with the telephoto lens, but was worried I&#39;d miss something. Sure enough 1 more appears in the NW sky and heads NE. It looked exactly the same. The top changed shape like a campfire would but it was basically a triangular fire with a flat bottom. This left my sight &amp; 1 last one traveled through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called Vassar College Observatory but no one saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Details follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:30pm, I decided to go for a walk and look at the large bright moon.  I ended up standing in the center of a large blacktop area; the playground just northwest of East 5th Street and Ocean Parkway/Fort Hamilton Parkway (which borders the Prospect Expressway, situated east of the playground and near the Fort Hamilton Parkway subway stop).  I chose this spot partly because the light pollution is a bit lower than in other parts of the neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From this vantage point, there is a 360 degree panoramic view of a large portion of sky/partially blocked by trees to the west and structures near the ground.  The sky was clear and winds were low, perhaps with some slight breeze.  For a few moments I observed the moon, which was southeast of my position.  I also turned to view other stars (the relative few that can be seen in Brooklyn), including Vega which appears to be visible at night (and was essentially directly overhead according to a sky map application I was using to assist me).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking slightly northwest towards Greenwood Cemetery, and the house I live in, I noticed a white light (no beam) moving in a curved trajectory southeastward towards my direction.  If the estimated lateral distance from my position to the object (0.4 miles) is accurate, the light itself could have been between 2 – 4 feet in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident took place for about 10 - 15 seconds sometime between 9:40 and 9:43pm.  This time includes the object’s approach (about 5 – 6 seconds) and several seconds of attempting to follow it with my eyes as it dimmed and disappeared (when near to my position).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its altitude seemed to vary slightly.  Though it is difficult to determine an exact average altitude, it was similar to or slightly below nearby commercial airline traffic (typically approaching JFK or LaGuardia Airports), approximately 1,500 – 2,000 feet.  This ruled out the possibility of a very large satellite (though on 8/24, at 9:49pm when revisiting I noticed a high plane or potential satellite, that appeared far, far higher and more dim, traveling northward east of the same position where I was standing).  Given the brightness and size of the light, it did not appear to be a small plane that was situated farther away than one may presume (lateral distance or altitude).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This white light varied in brightness and was not accompanied by any blinking FAA or navigation lights.  There was no sound (unlike the helicopters and planes which could be heard in the area at different moments before and after the sighting).  The curved trajectory of the light changed my view from looking northwest to slightly southwest, then almost directly south.  When I attempted to view it through my camera phone, it did not seem to register, though lights from other planes or helicopters around the same time did register (so I attempted no pictures or video).  During the 8/24 revisit, I noticed that lights from planes, etc. do show up more readily on my digital camera.  As such, perhaps the 8/22 light in questions would have been visible had I had my camera (non-phone) with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I expected to gain a view of FAA lighting or hear noise from an object, or at least see its shape as its path took it near or directly over Public School 130 (situated about 100 meters away from my vantage point, south of Ocean Parkway / Fort Hamilton Parkway and East 5th).  Instead the light increased in intensity, then simply faded out (with no visible clouds in the area to obscure it).  Again, because of the ambient light in the vicinity, the silhouetted shape and possibly some detail of any helicopter, quadcopter, drone, plane, blimp or other flying object would likely have become visible (as with other air traffic I observed around the same time and in nearby airspace from the same vantage point), even if its lights were turned off or away from my view.  However, to my astonishment, once the white light disappeared, no object could be seen in spite of my deliberate effort to follow it with my eyes.  The light appeared to be moving far too slowly, and for too long in a h! orizontal fashion, to be a meteorite.  Note that on the 8/24 revisit to the site, a meteorite / shooting star was observed at 9:46pm, traveling west on a trajectory that was slightly south of my vantage point (it seemed very different from what I saw on 8/22). Again, I estimate the visible length of distance travelled by the object to have been 0.4 miles (about 640 meters or 2,099 feet).  Therefore the speed over the 5 – 6 second approach is estimated at approximately 238 - 286mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on the potential size of the light (2 – 4 feet) and potentially achievable altitude (1,500 – 2,000 feet), the most likely prosaic explanation I could determine was quadcopter.  However, I am not confident that the approximate speed of the observed light (238 – 286 mph), or estimated distance of flight (0.4 miles) are achievable for this type of product.  Note that I did not observe any object fall from the sky or crash, as might be expected if a quadcopter simply flew beyond its maximum lateral range..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps there is a prosaic explanation for this incident; however, I am not able to determine what it may be at this time.  Perhaps others can shed further insight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE:  In an attempt to determine if others in the area may have witnessed similar phenomenon recently, I spoke with several individuals who live in or near the neighborhood.  One young man reported that on Wednesday 8/21 (same night as the sighting reported here), but at a later hour, he observed two lights in the same airspace (near the playground) move together and apart several times before departing in different/opposite directions!  Another young man reported recently seeing a beam of light near Caton Avenue in broad daylight.  While I cannot vouch for either of these accounts, I submit a summary of them to demonstrate that (a) it seems much easier than expected at this time to locate others nearby who feel they have seen something out of the ordinary and (b) there seems to be a number of incidents occurring over time (as I have observed lights /orbs in this neighborhood for years which cannot be easily explained).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The URL to view the approximate flight path of the light is: http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=6057182  The URL to view the lateral distance from my vantage point to PS130 is: http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=6057188  This is my seventh UFO sighting report to NUFORC.

Then it stopped, hovered for maybe 10&#34;, then changed directions and moved northward for perhaps about 300 feet before stopping and hovering again for about 20-30&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it flew westward and out of my visibility, and while it could have been a helicopter, I didn&#39;t hear anything that sounded like one, and I haven&#39;t known choppers to have big bright red/green lights but no white headlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shrug...

I just took the pictures in different time increments.  Usually when I thought the clouds were unique.  I took 10 pictures and thought I would look at them when I got home and downloaded them on my laptop. But I forgot about them until August 26th, 2013..<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw in my pictures is the sun high in the sky and a smaller bright orb below it, with clouds all around.  Every picture is different, and this orb goes behind some trees and sometimes in the distance and then again close up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Showed the pictures to several people who could not figure it out.  One person pointed out that if it was a glare or something like that, the orb would stay in one position.  But the orb was in several different positions.

Went in to tell my family.  Came back out with two of them, triangle was gone, but small orange lights were moving up slowing from the east horizon.  First one would appear, travel slow and steady to the north, then a second would appear, where there first one originally appeared.  It slowly moved in the same line and toward the first.  Then a third orange light would appear, same way.   While this was happening, the first orange light would fade and disappear.  This same pattern repeated for about 10 -15 minutes.  There was no sound.  I assumed whatever it was was far away, don&#39;t know.  I did get my binoculars during all this, the lights looked like orange dots.  No other colors.  Very steady.<n>

There are always planes flying around that time of night and they are easily spotted, as they always have flashing or pulsating lights.   The Moon was in the East.   I had my Binoculars out that have a tinting on the lenses, this helps when looking at a very bright object such as the Moon, you can see far more detail.  It was around 21:10 we decided to pack up the camera, put the binoculars and tripod in the car - I usually look towards the South West to see if I can see Arcturus which I have taken a few photos of recently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked up and from the West was this very strong light/orb shaped it was traveling at a steady pace but would every now and then slow down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having my binoculars with me I took a good look at the object, it was no plane, it was literally just a light - the light was heading in the direction! of the Moon to the East, I followed the light to see where it was heading.  As it reached closer to the area of sky the Moon was in the light faded and then just vanished.   My husband did take a photo of the light but you can&#39;t really get much from the photo other than it is a light in the sky.  Judging the distance it was pretty low and was in no way a Satellite (I believe ISS was supposed to be visible also that night) however it was not the right time or direction.  I estimate that it was the same height as a plane would be.  There was no sound to it.  The light stayed constant until dimming when it reached the area of sky the Moon was in.  I did also take the opportunity to view a plane that was going over in the same area of sky and could clearly see the shape of the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There has been lots of strange activity in this area since the start of the year.<n>

He called it out as a UFO.  As we looked up, I agreed with him that we weren&#39;t looking at an airplane. There was a plane flying south that was near it.  It gave us an idea of how large the object was and how fast it was moving.  A bit larger than the small passenger jet that was flying south.  I estimate it at about 3000 feet.  Looked to be flying at about the same speed as the jet.  We noticed that it was moving away from us and that it had no sound and the bright light was completely white.  Like the north star. In fact, it resembled a bright star in many ways. A friend made the comment that the light could probably be seen from 365 degrees.  It wasn&#39;t a directional light.  We compared it to the small jet and it was clear that it was flying slightly higher but was much brighter.  It also d! idn&#39;t have any flashing lights.  As we commented on the differences between the plane and the object, the object disappeared completely!  It was insane and proved to us that we weren&#39;t seeing an airplane or helicopter fly by.  The light went dim for about a second and then was gone. We were all very impressed and excited with what we had just seen.  There were 12 people in our group and all witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Observing aircraft taking off from LAX only a few minutes later,  I have to also add that the light or energy emitted from these objects must have been high in intensity as lights from aircraft were only visible at close distances, given the light fog and low clouds.  I drove my Avon inflatable to the middle of the channel where one of the four story party boats was coming back in from the Harbor entrance area.

It was dark, there was no wind and it was a completely clear sky.  He called for me to grab my phone and come out to the deck to &#39;take a look at something&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got on the deck I witnessed a red/orange fireball in the sky moving very fast and smooth towards us (Southbound).  The object never changed speed, never change direction and never changed color or brightness.  The object was moving faster than a commercial plane and was very set in its course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it passed over us, we noticed some type of debris falling from its path in the sky.  Due to the darkness it was very hard to see detail, but the falling object was round or ovoid in shape and was falling at a fairly slow, smooth pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to get 15-20 seconds of video of the fireball with my iPhone which does a great job representing speed, shape, brightness, path, as well as the conditions of the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is DEFINITELY something I have never seen before!<n>

The object covered a 180 degree span from first seeing it to the point of it trailing off in the distance.  The entire event was about two to three minutes.  The object was approximately 1/6th to 1/8th the size of a full moon, which we are close to having this evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The skies were clear and we are used to observing aircraft in the sky in all light conditions.  This was definitely something very unique and absolutely not a play on the sunset which had already passed, or the lights from an approaching aircraft.  In addition there was no sign at all of any blinking lights throughout the entire sighting and as I previously stated we watched it come toward us, pass us,! and trail off in the distance.  I thought it might be a plane on fire when I first saw it but as it neared and passed it was obvious that was not the case.  It looked like a fire ball which included various shades of red and orange.  We did observe a piece of debris fall from the sky near a radio tower and drove over to investigate.  We did not find anything.  This debris was sizable and falling at a fairly slow rate but not as slow as a piece of paper or material of that kind.<n>

I estimate the elevation was 500 to 1000 feet.  The flight path was straight. It was completely silent. It was the size of a pea held at arms length.  The light was very orange, and kind of dancing; like plasma.  At times, a small more defined and brighter center point of light was visible within the larger object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the last minute of observation, the light vanish and reappeared a couple of times, keeping the same flight path.  Also during this last minute, the overall shape was morphing more; at one point looking like a cone.  Before disappearing behind trees, the light went out completely; but at that instant a larger black object was briefly visible.  I&#39;m pretty sure this was not retinal fatigue, but an actual black object.  We all saw this.  Although it was nighttime, the black object was visible against the dark sky, but only for 2 to 3 seconds before it went behind trees.<n>

In front of Publix on Murfreesboro road Antioch, Tn.  I was in the back seat when i noticed a black squarish object heading in the opposite direction.  Ended up at a red light and mentioned it to my friends that i saw something and the passenger acknowledged it also and wondered what it was.  Driver has not seen anything by this point.  The object was behind a tree during the stop.  Light turns green and when the object became visible from behind the tree it did not seem to have the same shape that it had earlier.  Maybe 1 and a half minutes prior. I started thinking to myself maybe it was a witch commonly known as Brujas in Mexico, and right as i thought that the passenger mentioned that it looks like a human flying, and i agreed.  The object seem to have looked different from different points of view as if it were shifting in some way.  We ended up parking in a parking lot to take time to ! look at it and it seemed to have become stationary and rotating slowly heading in a perfect horizontal direction north towards Nashville.  The object must have been 200 yards to our right of the street and about 300 or 400 yards up in the sky.  Black sqaurish object that eventually didn&#39;t look like it did in the beginning.  It was more oval by the time we ended having to go with protrusions out form the bottom but were not pointed.  There was good thunderstorms that night in Nashville that continued to the next day.  So maybe there is a small connection there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I remember being very tired that afternoon so I decided to lay down outside. I looked up to the left and saw a bright red light, but I realized that the light was flashing and there was a blue one right next to it.  Of course this was an airplane, however a few seconds later a smaller WHITE light flashed turning into a BURNING/ORANGE-EMBER color before somewhat disappearing. The reason I say somewhat is because after the light vanished I could literally see the SAME light when looking indirectly at this object as if it burned a hole in the sky. Very similar to how stars appear around early dusk.  Only slightly visible, however this object was clearly surrounded by some type of LIGHTLY GLOWING BLUE&#34;cloud&#34; or &#34;wavy membrane&#34;. This may sound odd as this scared the living hell out of me. This object just came right down to where I was, and as the object was moving I c! ould clearly see it had STRIPED/CHROMATIC colors tailing behind it. It seemed to happen instantaneously and I could see it hovering a couple hundred feet above my house, moments later. I was astonished at the complexity and clarity of what I was looking at even though I was not able to look directly at it and notice it.  The only way I can explain it was like seeing a previously unknown spectrum of light, if that makes any sense... This object appeared to have had waving, spaghetti-like strands in a double-helix pattern circling around it just before it zoomed off into  a cloud. This cloud expanded at least 10-15 x its size as 5 or 6 light colored objects flew in. That was the end of my unexpected encounter with a UFO. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and if anyone else out there is... know that we are powerful beings of light . We need not give into fear and intimidation if we are to get through these challenging times . With the universal power of love anything! is possible. - Light. Love. May the best be with you all.<n>

Circular crafts, with white flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Branch Lake sighting.  My two friends and I were out on our camp dock. We had seen a circular light flashing object over by the trees, for about 30 minutes.  It disappeared into the trees suddenly.  We kept watching after it disappeared.  We saw another one across the lake.  At first we thought it was a plane. I said, &#34;If this is a plane, it will keep going, if it stops at the same place…  We know what it is.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did.  It stopped at the exact place the other one disappeared.  Then, It came bolting at us. We ran inside, and went back out about 15 minutes later.  There was another figure floating above the camp.  It was circular like the others, and had the same flashing lights.<n>

My first thought at seeing the flashing light was &#34;OK, FAA regulation lights&#34; and didn&#39;t immediately pull over to really have a look (plus I was doing 60mph).  But when I rounded the next bend about 5 seconds later and had a view of the same patch of sky, the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I started to really analyze what I saw for those 5 seconds before.  If that was a man-made craft of some sort, it would&#39;ve had a very long wingspan based on the positioning of the lights.  Plus, the sky was just lightening for dawn, yet I could see no discernible fuselage, certainly not a full-size jet with a large wingspan, nor could I hear any aircraft propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Furthermore, those lights were far below normal commercial airspace, more at about private and small aircraft altitude. If it was a large transport flying into Stewart Air Base 20 miles to the east (Newburgh, NY), why did it have lights already on and why was it flying north and not east?  Also, those lights were not nearly as bright as commercial landing lights.  If it was a small private plane or ultra-light from Orange County (NY) Airport to the south, why would it be flying in the dark at 5:30am, with such a long wingspan, and traveling fast enough to disappear in 5 seconds?  I am an art director at a leading aviation and aerospace magazine, and am well-informed in latest aircraft and UAV technologies.  There was just something too odd about the lights I saw this morning.  Plus, with Pine Bush&#39;s long history of sightings (the town itself has even adopted a &#34;gray&#34; alien character as the official mascot!), anything is possible.<n>

The object looked roughly oval, it was not round, but it did seem to have a firey glow around it.  Granted it was a foggy night - but the green light was not sharp and defined - the glow may have been due to the mist/fog in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was nearing a commercial shopping area near the highway exit, and it looked as though the object would head right down into the shopping center area - but instead before it reached what would be ground level it disappeared in the fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no airport at this exit, and the path was steep - it descended on a 45 degree angle.

(Approx. 11 pm)The sky was brighter than normal due to the full moon. I was facing my open garage thinking about a project I was working on.  I momentarily turned around facing the street when out of my peripheral vision something above caught my attention.  I looked up for a second and saw a rather large bright white light, hovering.  Thinking it was a helicopter at first,  I was about to look away when it occurred to me that there was no noise. At that very instant the light went souring across the sky as if it were a shooting star.  There was no gradual acceleration, it was instantaneous. I was a little freaked out. It was almost like it was watching me and when it noticed that I saw it, took off.  I&#39;ve heard of people seeing weird things like this, but this is the first time it&#39;s ever happened to me.  It appeared to be egg shaped as it traveled, but could’ve just been due to the speed at which it took off that made it appear to be oblong.  I don’t know. But there was second, small red light attached to the large white light when it was moving. Anyway, that’s what I saw. It all lasted maybe 3-4 seconds at the most. No noise. Complete silence. Couldn&#39;t make out any shape of the object to which the light was attached. Just the light.<n>

It wasn&#39;t cloudy out, but the sky was ever so slightly overcast so that there was a  glow visible the moon, and many stars were still visible in spite of the slight cloud.  I watched this object move from the south, &#34;upward&#34; through the sky (&#34;northward&#34;) and it approached/disappeared in  the glow of the moon.  I waited and watched and counted to see when it would proceed from the other side, but it never reappeared.  It was the comparable size of a satellite and moved in the same way (slowly and in only one direction while I was watching it).<n>

It blinked out again and appeared further away and two objects streaked away from the original light, one heading south the other west.  It blinked out again and never reappeared. There was plenty of air trafficnin the sky so someone must have seen it.  They definitely weren&#39;t moving like the planes slowly crawling across the sky with pulsing lights.

During the previous evening we saw over 35 UFOs but I was otherwise occupied with a new romantic interest to care much about grabbing my camera.  Although, on Sunday evening after she had departed I was shooting with a Sony A-65 with a standard 18-55 mm lens using a tripod doing 10 second exposures with 24 mega-pixel resolution in &#34;night mode.&#34;  I had just captured a photo of our crew singing around an open field when we saw a UFO suddenly appear in the sky.  I was easily able to swivel my camera about 90 degrees, elevate the camera and snap a photo of the UFO.  The UFO began traveling towards us over the field and did what&#39;s referred as a &#34;power up&#34; wherein the brightness increases of the UFO.  It&#39;s hard to tell the altitude of the UFO but I would estimate that it was at least a mile overhead. The UFO then phased out and vanished.  This is similar behavior that the majority of the other UFOs exhibited over that weekend.  Many times the UFOs changed direction, sped up and slowed down, zig-zaged and phased in and out of visibility.  Most where white in color and round in shape. Often there would be a couple of UFO appearing at the same time but most where single occurrences.  I did not see any metal or hear any sounds associated with the UFO craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon was almost full that night and was behind us. We had already seen the international space station fly overhead which was really bright and travelled linearly across the entire sky. I had also seen a few conventional aircraft fly overhead with their bright strobe lights clearly visible. I took a few photos of those aircraft as a reference. There were about ten other persons present in my immediate vicinity who all saw the same object and who all believed it to be a UFO. I will also clearly state that this gathering was alcohol and drug free.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a professional videographer and I also have a fair amount of experience with digital still cameras. I have never filmed or photographed a UFO before but I&#39;ve always had a big interest in airplanes and aviation history.  I have worked for Boeing for a number of years and have seen and discussed many types of conventional aircraft.  I was not able to associate these UFOs with any other craft that I have studied before.  I have worked professionally with technology for 13 years and I have spent a lot of time studying the best way to capture light.<n>

It was an orange circle that seemed to be pulsing.  We tried to take a photo but the condo owners have a screen over the balcony.  It dimmed slightly and just disappeared.  It never moved while we saw it.  It just seemed to hover.<n>

This &#34;star&#34; will move across the night sky with time as the other stars do but continues to change direction very slightly in either direction.

It was still clear daylight at that time and the sky was clearly, clearly visible, a beautiful blue sky.  I was on I-15 coming from the south and traveling northward towards Temecula.  To help pinpoint my location in travel at that time, it would have been closest to the next exit off of I-15, which was the Temecula Parkway exit on the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point in my travel, I was looking skyward as I was kind of up on a hill which heads downward into the Murrieta and Temecula areas, so I was higher up on the freeway, the hill, at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden I saw a silver, exactly round, shiny disk, high in the sky, very high up in the sky in the distance in front of me.  The silver disk was stationary, no movement at all at any time while I was watching it, which was about twenty seconds, I&#39;d guess.  It was clearly visible the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was high up in the sky, like about as high as the commercial airlines fly, but could have been higher.  It looked smaller than the moon, in comparison to that.  I at first kind of thought it looked like a very, very small moon, but it was shiny, which looked odd to me, so I kept looking at it.  I’m thinking it must have been seen by many people, as it could clearly visibly be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, all of a sudden, all I could see of the round silver disk was about half of it and it kind of looked sideways then, in that kind of way.  I’m guessing it must have quickly turned sideways (and I’m just guessing that) and it was gone!  It just disappeared out of sight.  That quickly, it was gone!  As I said previously, I didn’t see any movement of the object at any time, whatsoever, and I had constant clear view of it from my front car windshield the whole time until it disappeared.<n>

The time was 18:23 on August 18, 2013.  The sky was crisp clear daylight. While waiting in traffic  I noticed a growing trail moving away from the left of the sun which was North-West of the direction my vehicle was heading.  Initially, it seemed like a trail from a normal jet engine, yet I could not see a jet or other object from which the trail was coming from.  The speed was moderate and consistent.  The trail was not such that it remained visible the whole traveled distance (such that you could follow the whole path the object had taken).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued watching the moving trail for about 15-30 seconds when I saw the most interesting thing ever: whatever the object that was causing the trail ceased to move at once and all of a sudden it vanished with a big puff of smoke that disappeared right behind it.  Even more interesting, the trail vanished almost instantly and there was no sign of anything. It was almost like a “puff” of smoke and gone.  Shortly after (like 10 seconds), I notice a plane heading in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a sighting of one object too small that I cannot describe a colour or shape for. It could also be that the sun was just hitting my eye so I could not see the object.  But the trail it was leaving and everything else that happened were very very clear to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

After it passed we saw a very small shiny object very high in the sky. It would not be visible for a few seconds, then visible again. At first I thought it was an airplane and the sun was reflecting off it. It didn&#39;t appear to move. I next thought well it&#39;s flying towards us or away from us and it just appears that it&#39;s not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Got my astronomy binoculars out and was able to see it better. I put my elbows on the back of my boat that was in my driveway to get a steady look at it. I made sure a branch from the tree in my front yard was in the view with some leafs so I would have some kind of reference if it was moving or not. It didn&#39;t appear to move for the first ten seconds. The suddenly it dropped straight down, then straight back up to it&#39;s original position. I thought maybe I was shaking the binoculars. So I blinked my eyes for a second made sure I was steady and focus on it again through the binoculars. It was steady and I saw it move to the right super fast then back to it&#39;s original position. Then it shot down and back up again. All along I had these leafs on the branch of the tree in sight to make sure I wasn&#39;t moving my hands/arms. The leafs were steady in sight. Immediately after this quick movement I started looking with my bare eyes again and a jetliner with a contrail had just passed th! rough the same path as the object. The plane was slightly higher if not at the same altitude as the object. I  got the sense they were somewhat close to each other in the same part of the sky.  I thought at first wow I wonder if the wake of the plane made it shoot down like that. Thinking the wind from the plane forced it down like again maybe it’s a balloon of some sort. Then I realized that didn’t make sense because I also saw it shoot right and then back to the left again after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the binoculars the object was irregular shaped oval, almost a long rectangle but rounded. The middle was sort of like a pound sign. Two lines across, two lines vertical and the space in between was blue sky. So it wasn&#39;t solid everywhere.  When you looked at it, it fluctuated in blurriness like it some kind of magnetic field around it. It was very hard to see hard edges or lines. But you could still make it out. I would have thought it was some huge animal balloon like configuration if it wasn&#39;t for the rapid movements it made. Plus the size of it was huge considering how high it was.  It was pretty hard to see with the huge binoculars I was using so it had to be really high up and it was close to the same size of an airplane in the same binoculars at what appears to be the same altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 1:50pm it just disappeared. It came back a few minutes later until 1:55pm when it was just gone forever.  I witness this with one of my brother in laws. I had him draw on paper what he saw and I was able to confirm it was very similar to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So with your naked eye you could only see it when it was bright which is why I thought it was reflecting the sun on and off. But once you started looking at it through the binoculars it was always a constant brightness. Glowing white, florescent light kind of look to it.<n>

The sky was evenly overcast with haze and reflected the city lights, and buildings blocked the lower northeast sky.  I gave up on the comet, and  noticed I could spot only four or five stars even with my sports binoculars.  I turned them toward the flight path  to our airport.  I saw a jetliners following the usual pattern, above the trees and apartment complexes east of my second floor balcony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe five minutes later I focused on another set of similar lights in the same direction and elevation, and because a white light was blinking and there seemed to be an orange light at the back and a bluish white light on the front, I assumed it was another plane.  I have a table and a chair on he balcony, and tipped the table  up on end and sat in my chair steadying my binoculars.  I realized that the object did not move relative to the roofs of neighboring  complexes.   That would mean! the plane was far, far away, and enormous, but repeated observation over about seven minutes convinced me that the object in the sky was not a jetliner and was not moving toward the airport at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Daylight was coming soon, and I doubted that I could locate my digital camera and get it set up in time to photograph the unrecognized object, but I hoped that it could be done, and by steadying the camera and going to full 15x optical zoom.  I could get some 10 megapixel color videos to study at my leisure.  The binoculars are about 10x, but the images were fleeting and begged to be studied carefully.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took the camera off its tripod and rushed to the balcony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hoped the batteries would last.  The warning screen on the back of the camera showed some red lines across the battery icon, and I know my time was short.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat on my sturdy chair,  leaned the lightweight folding table against my knees, and did my best to locate the strange object using the view screen on the back of the camera.  It was a challenge, and the camera was unsteady.  The image on the screen was basically a black grey haze, and the craft was invisible.  With the naked eye I could see the craft and using a left of the table and a tree branch visible on the view screen, I aimed and shot several videos.  I finally stopped and rushed to get fresh batteries.  I changed from the view screen to the “through the lens” viewfiner.  At last I could see the UFO, and hoped that despite the shaking of the camera, I might capture at least a few images of the elusive UFO. Soon the sky was too bright for viewing the UFO, and I left the balcony.  It was about 6:30 AM and I had a lot of chores to do to prepare for a visit from a relative.  I finally got enough work done to allow me to slip the SD card into my desktop computer and chec! k my videos.  I was delighted to see that in the several videos I shot, a few second of “UFO” images appeared.  The shaky camera made it look like the UFO was zooming all over, but it was not.  With the naked eye, it appeared to be motionless in the sky.  I don’t know if my UFO was actually a set of lights on a tall tower atop a distant hill, or an actual craft in the sky.  Because I have never noticed anything like this UFO in the 29 months I’ve been in this city, even though I have been an avid airplane watcher for seventy years.  I was a Civil Air Patrol Cadet, studying at Randolph, Lackland and Barksdale AFBs in the 1950s and an aviation enthusiast the rest of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon examining the videos, it seems that the UFO was actually three or four lights, perhaps all attached to one hovering object.  On the right was a round, seemingly “shattered” white or light-greenish orb.  If the craft had been headed for a landing at the airport, the light on the right would be at the  “front.” Additionally there was a red dot of fairly bright light below and on the middle of the bottom, and a dimly lit thin horizontal line of yellowish white light at the “rear” where the vertical stabilizer would be on a jetliner.  When I first spotted the craft, there was a blinking white light where the red light appears in the videos, and I thought it was a regular aircraft strobe light.  Upon examination, I have not seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I say “front” or “rear,” I am assuming the craft was aligned with the landing approach jetliners follow from north of the city to the airport on the south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m sorry that the videos are tedious to look at, but I don’t know a thing about editing them to eliminate all the “dead” time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> August 18, 2013<n>

The lights dimmed as it flew off and it was gone in the blink of an eye.  From my vantage point he was flying through the Big Dipper in the sky and turned near the North Star.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before.  It was not any kind of aircraft since they couldn&#39;t turn and fly higher that quickly nor would they turn off their lights in our airspace.

It then make a 90 degree turn and headed east in a straight line.  It then made another 90 degree turn straight upward and went straight up and went right out of site.  It climbed right up and out of site.  Now behind it were 2 others which did the same thing and were the same size.  It was absolutely breathtaking!!<n>

I realized that these were not tower lights,  but something quite odd.  I pulled off the busy highway to get a better look, but the passing traffic was distracting my observation.

Being a trained pilot, I knew this was not a blimp or airplane.  I knew within seconds that this was something different, and ran outside my patio to take some pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description:  The UFO was a spherical/elliptal shape of flashing pulsating reddish/raspberry light.  There was no pattern to the flashing, and seemed random.  It was moving slowly from East to West, perhaps SE to NW, or thereabouts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An airliner passed above it, coming from MCO... typically airliners at this point are probably 8000-10000 feet up, and seemed to cross its path, so it was lower than that, and would estimate it was around 3000-5000&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feelings:  Excitement.  I have only seen 1 other UFO several years ago, and was excited to see another one.  I immediately ran outside my screen to take some zoomed in pictures on my cellphone before it disappeared…  I was able to get 3 in, as it traveled to the W/NW.  I tried to get my family out after taking these pictures, but in the time it took for them to get out, the object had already disappeared completely into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lost sight:  I lost sight of the object as i was trying to get my family to join me in seeing this object.<n>

The light was exceptionally bright, almost too bright and somewhat large to be a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter was playing in the yard and she seen it as well and commented on its brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked at it, I was contemplating on going inside to get my camera so I could zoom in on it to get a better look.  Just as I was on my inside, my wife and older son rode up on their bicycles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed up to the sky to show them what I had been looking at for the past few minutes and at that same time, the brightness of the object started to fade and then the object split into two separate objects.  At this time their brightness had dimed considerably, to the point they were difficult to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another 30 seconds went by and the two objects had faded out of sigh! t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were seen in the northern sky, high above my head at approximately 65-70 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon was bright, 30 degrees above the horizon, in the South-South-West sky.

Its movement was not in a straight line.  It approached in a straight line, but then moved off in somewhat of a zigzag, and then moved put of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first evening (8/15) we heard a buzzing sound, but did not hear it the next two nights.

It made no sound and did not have the three lights one usually sees on an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several seconds later, another appeared in the northwest and followed the same path to the northeast.  As we watched for ten or 15 minutes, we saw at least 15 to 20 of these glowing objects following the same path at varying distances.  They did not appear to be at as high an altitude as an airliner travels, but they were high enough that it was impossible to positively determine a shape.  (One still snapshot taken by my husband with a telephoto lens suggested a triangular shape, red with some yellow lights on it, but I hesitate to say that that was its actual shape, due to the movement.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a correction to the description submitted a few minutes ago.

They were moving slowly in a random pattern from north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right away I recognized these lights from a youtube video I saw that showed various UFO sightings from around the world.  Recognizing these I grabbed my cell phone and video recorded the lights.  By the time I was able to get the camera recording the lights started disappearing and could only get 5 on my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights slowly dimmed and disappeared after about 1 minute.  There was no sound from these lights and after dissapearing there were no blinking lights like are required on aircraft after dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not raise a big fuss to those around me because I wanted to make sure I got them on camera but unfortunately noone else around me noticed them because the movie was just starting.

As I got to the end of the driveway and looked across the street, due East, in the direction of the Space coast, I saw an oval object at about 30 degrees above the horizon.  It was traveling in what appeared to be a southerly direction along the coastal region. Thinking that I should get some kind of point of reference regarding size and such,  I held out my hand at arm&#39;s length. The UFO was gliding along very slowly, in a straight path, taking about 2 minutes to travel what measured at arm&#39;s length to be between 10 and 12 inches.  The size of the craft, using my thumbnail at arm&#39;s length, was about 1/2 an inch. And it was a medium to medium dark RASPBERRY RED...not the tone of red like on emergency vehicle lights, or on traditional aviation lights...and it pulsated slowly. The lighting of the craft seemed to come from within the object, and not from an external! light source.  It continued along its flight path at what appeared to be the same altitude and direction for the entire 2 minutes that I was able to see it.  When it was no longer visible, I came inside, marked this event on my calendar, told my husband that I just saw a UFO and that I had to report it to NUFORC.  I called your Hot Line, and have now made this written report.  Please feel free to contact me, if needed.<n>

8/16/13 23:00|Ceres|CA|Triangle|3-5 minutes|BLUE LIGHTS FORM TRIANGLE OVER CENTRAL CALIFORNIA.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101255.html|407|ndxe201308| BLUE LIGHTS FORM TRIANGLE OVER CENTRAL CALIFORNIA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8/16/2013, ceres california, 23:32 , there was little wind or cloud cover out this night it was a nice 76 degrees no clouds as far as my eye can see i had stepped out of my home to have a smoke, when i noticed a large blue light moving quickly threw the sky west to east or left to right from my eye point, as i looked and followed the light with my eyes i figured it was one of those theater lights they put on like in lasvegas that shine up to the sky, its now i noticed that light had no beam coming from the earth up wards as a spotlight would, the light came to a sudden stop and started to flash very quickly the one light instantly broke into 3 which now formed a very large triangle the lights being the 3 points of the triangle they started to rotate almost blinking in sync to appear to be rotating , at this point im almost scared and want to run inside but all i could do was look with awe, the triangle distance between the points i would say was over a 100 f! t per point very large yet i could see no structure of a ship only the lighted points but it did block out the stars behind it, as the lights on the outer continued to rotate they began doing so much faster almost as if my eye was seeing it after the fact as if it were so fast it had did 60 passes to my eyes only seeing one if you can understand that, all of a sudden one of the lights shot light into the center of the is triangle and it became 3 lights moving slower but in a circular motion in the center of this triangle, by this point im about to shit my pants, now im 29 a male and athletic but its as if this thing made me not be able to move it could have just been fear but its as if my mind knew what was going on but my muscles just couldn&#39;t work, at this point i noticed my neibor across the street coming out of his home yelling what the FUCK rather loud, i could see they were looking oowing and aweing as well , the object continued to just spin its lights, now again im ! not sure if the lights where spinning or if they were blinking! so fast it appeared to spin, im not sure how to explain i would say almost strobe light like but in sync with each other, all of this is happened in a matter of i would say 4 mins, as i continued to stare all of the lights slowly began to form one l light as if they were returning to the center until all the lights 6 in all i think were in the center and now just one like the original one that caught my eye, again no beam was seen going to this object or from it nor was there a beam of light coming down ward it was if this perfect blue circle was just there and the circle was large ,as it became one light it flickered and began to flicker even faster at this time i noticed that i could  see not clouds but almost a smoke a exhaust of some sort it looked like very thick smog clouds or what youd see coming out of a trains stack but white it was too thick to be cloud there was no other clouds in the sky and no way these clouds just appeard out of thin air, what also is a mind fucker to! me is the smoke cloud thing looked like hiroshima adom bombing  mushroom cloud type shaped only upside down , the flickering light in the center all of a sudden just whent out and darkness again took over the sky, i could no longer see the smokey cloud or any lights what i could see now was stars that when the object was there i couldnt see, i looked at my clock it was now 23:37 the object was gone, now i live in a small town in central california im not a ufo hunter avid believer or of any thing like that,i live on a normal city block in  a residential area , i have to ask my self if it was a ufo why was it here of all places in broad daylight, if its military why does it have lights that makes no sense to me as well for ufo , dont you think theyd cut the lights   why would they want to stay hidden but be seen, if it was military why are they flying over our homes?, this thing was so massive if it were military it would be like a air base of some sort? the lights were ver! y blue in color to compare i would say they looked just like H! ID headl ights on cars very distinct blue hue in perfect circles id say each circle was maybe 6-10 feet around very large, i take into consideration what it were flashlights i say ok then why i see no beam going up ward and how can they blink and spin so perfect in sync youd have to have more then one person controlling all the flashlights by hand at once perfectly and again why would any one do this for 5 mins then stop, it makes no sence to me ither way i googled blue lights in california sky in google news and seen alot of simular stories, i also found this web sight, you can take my experience as you will, i also was not high or drunk i am of perfect mental capacity i know i was not hallucinating i was in a normal state of mind, you can say this guy made it up or you can belive what i say its not going to change what i seen, i also could not here any sounds of motor noise or engine it was silent<n>

They appeared to be 10 to 20 miles to the east and just before they disappeared, they seemed to change trajectory to the north.  There was no noise that I could tell.  I had been taking pictures of the moon earlier in the evening with my Sony A58 DSLR and the sky was clear.  I managed to get 2 photos of the last object.  My wife, son &amp; daughter also saw these.  I’m an amateur astronomer and photographer and a plane buff and I’ve never seen anything like this in my life.  My first thoughts were F16’s returning to Duluth with afterburners on but the objects did not gain speed and were visible for minutes.  They appeared to be approx. 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon and there were planes departing M! SP visible and making noise higher in the sky.  These objects appeared to be approx. ¼ inch in size at an arm’s length and travelled the same direction.  Their speed was the same and I’d guess at around 250 to 300 MPH give or take, but hard to really judge not knowing the exact distance away.  It has me puzzled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I saw similar reports on the Wisconsin page like this around the same date and time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was traveling north and I saw at least 5 orange lights in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought they were street lights but then they started to come towards me; going south.  They made no noise.  I didn&#39;t know what to think.  They didn&#39;t move very fast and then the first one went into the clouds and disappeared and the rest just vansihed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to make the objects out but it was hard.  The traffic and bad glasses made it difficult.  So I just thought it had to some nonsense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back on bike and started north again and I looked up and here they came again from the north but this time only 4 orange objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third one speeded up and caught up to the second and the last just lagged behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they disappeared.<n>

The reports are well written, and the witness seems sincere, although we would be surprised if all of the sightings are about authentic UFOs, i.e. alien spacecraft.  We cannot be certain, however.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> SIGHTING # 27 – August 16, 2013 – 4th SIGHTING OF A SILVER-GOLD, GLOWING ELONGATED/FOOTBALL SHAPED UFO POSSIBLY EMERGING FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO, AND FIRST SIGHTING OF AN APPARENT PORTAL OR LARGE FIREBALL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived at my regular skywatch location at 9:20 p.m. on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, USA, just north of the rock jetty at Blind Pass.  The weather was totally overcast for the first half hour after I arrived, and then cleared to partly cloudy, with clouds over the horizon of the Gulf.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was scanning the horizon, 50 percent of the time with binoculars, and 50 percent of the time without binocs, for a whole hour and 10 minutes without seeing anything, when at 10:30, while looking through my binoculars, I briefly saw the same kind of “double-craft” UFOs I had seen on previous nights, in precisely the same location as before, one above the other, apparently having just emerged from the Gulf.  I say apparently emerging from the water because, like before, the craft on the bottom was right on the horizon or just a little tad below it, and smaller for a moment before it became the size of the one above before disappearing.  I watched it for a good 5 seconds before the lights went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got VERY lucky with this sighting because it could only have been see through binoculars, and when you think about catching something for only a few seconds out of 70 minutes of observation, it’s almost like finding a needle in a haystack.  If others are emerging and then turning out the lights this quickly – and I did see this before – who knows how many of the things could be out there.  I estimate that it was about 7 miles away from me.  That was all I saw in that northern area until I left at 11 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:50 an orange “fireball” appeared due west of me over the Gulf, about 40 degrees above the horizon, and no more than 5 miles away.  It spooked me a bit when it rapidly expanded from the size of a small pea at arms length, to the size of a baseball or large orange, and began glowing and pulsating mostly red, but with some bluish and white in it too.  After the 10 seconds it took to expand, the edges started “shimmering” with different colors, and my heart seemed to skip a few beats.  I pointed it out to a couple of people who were walking down the beach and told them it was a UFO and they were fascinated too.  By the time I remembered to look at it through my binoculars, it started shrinking down and then disappeared after about 20 to 25 seconds.  It stayed in one place during this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object looked uncannily like one of those “star gates” like you see on TV It really gave me a start because I was almost expecting for the sky to start opening up!  I continued sky watching through out for another 10 minutes or so before the sand flies drove me back home at 11 p.m.  The idea that it might have been some kind of a portal or “star gate” didn&#39;t strike me until the next morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will next report on my conclusions of the past 27 sightings I and others in the immediate area have had over 39 nights of observation, during 8 weeks since I had my first sighting here on June 24, 2013.<n>

8/16/13 22:15|Monroe|MI|Light|15 minutes|At least 17 reddish-orange lights ascending into the night sky over Monroe, Michigan 8/16/13|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101359.html|412|ndxe201308| At least 17 reddish-orange lights ascending into the night sky over Monroe, Michigan 8/16/13<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of Friday, August 16, 2013 my husband and I were passengers in a car being driven by our 21-year-old son.  We were northbound on Telegraph Road through Monroe County in Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:15 PM my husband, seated in the passenger front seat, suddenly pointed out the front side window and said something like, “Look at those lights over there!”  He pointed to the eastern sky, which was dark but clear of cloud cover.  We were somewhere between Albain and Dunbar Roads, in an area that has fields, low buildings and some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out my back seat window in the direction to which my husband was pointing and I saw 2 reddish-orange lights in the sky, not too far above the level of the low buildings &amp; trees.  They were some distance from our vehicle, possibly a mile or more.  The precise distance is hard to determine, but we did not have the sense that they were close to us or upon us in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 lights were positioned one above the other with some amount of space between them.  They both seemed to be moving upward rather slowly.  My husband and I agreed that the lights did not appear to be planes or helicopters because they did not have any obvious navigation lights on them and they were ascending into the sky, not flying in a straight line as a plane or a helicopter would do at the altitude at which they appeared to be located.  They were brighter than ordinary stars.  They were brighter than the planet Venus which we have observed many times in the evening sky in our area.  They were not white.  Their color was a reddish-orange and they glowed like stars, but did not “twinkle” or shimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because we were fascinated with the lights, we kept watching them as we continued northbound. Suddenly we saw a number of other lights appear beneath the 2 original topmost lights.  There were now about 6 or 7 lights in total.  They all looked exactly the same in color and size and they all appeared to be ascending into the sky in a fairly (yet not quite exactly) straight line.  We exclaimed to each other something like, “Where did those new lights just come from?!”<n> <n><n> <n><n> We should have told our son to pull over and stop the vehicle, but we did not.  He kept driving, and we were still able to see the lights as the entire line kept ascending higher into the sky.  Then, more lights appeared!  The newly visible lights were clustered at the bottom of the original line of lights.  They also were in lines, but in lines of their own, like the leaves growing up from the base of the stem of a flower.  My husband counted at least 17 lights in totality in the entire formation.  All had the ! exact same color and luminosity.  We agreed that we had never seen anything like this before in our lives.  We are each 58 years old.  We are retired school teachers.  Our son, a college student home on summer break, also saw the lights but could only glance over his shoulder as he drove, so his account is more limited than ours.  He did say, however, that he saw many orange lights and they appeared to him to be assembled into some sort of a geometric (box-like) formation.  His perspective from the drivers’ seat was, of course, slightly different from ours in the front and back passenger seats.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got past 7th Street in Monroe, our view became more obstructed from buildings and street lamps, etc.  We asked our son to drive to Veterans Park in Monroe, which is adjacent to Telegraph Rd., just to its west.  He did so, and we parked there to continue to watch the lights.  Only 2 lights were then visible.  We watched as they both disappeared.  They did not appear to “fly away” but seemed to “go out” light a light being switched off.<n>

As I was driving east in my neighborhood I saw an orange globe floating across the eastern sky at a medium slow speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it might have been aircraft, but it looked so odd to me that I pulled over, shut my engine off, and got out of the car to listen and see if it made any noise in the sky.  It was completely silent which is not conducive to low flying aircraft or helicopters here in Orlando being somewhat near the airports.  This ball had a burning glow effect and it was traveling medium slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a star gazer for years growing up in a very rural area and now after living in Orlando for 5 years, I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.  I almost wonder if it was some sort of a meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was very cloudy and the globe, or rather fireball, was very visible as it was flying beneath the clouds. It also did not blink, twinkle, or make any erratic movements.  I thought I saw a smoke like trail behind it, but I couldn&#39;t see that part of it as well, so I&#39;m not certain.<n>

I was coming home around 10 pm and spotted a bright white object moving across the sky about a half mile in front of me.  I thought, Ok, that&#39;s creepy.  After it disappeared, I continued on home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next few nights myself and neighbors observed two bright lights.  The lights would stay put for a while, then slowly move, then become stationary.  At first I thought one was the ‘evening star’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On wednesday night, we noticed a pulsing red/green object accompaning the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The really big show was thursday night. Using binoculars, we counted 11 pulsing red/green lights.  They were stationary and held their position about 15 miles apart from each other.  About 4:30 am, I noticed one moving off to the southwest.  As the suns glow in the east began to brighten, they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The evening of the 23rd, I stayed inside and didn&#39;t look out.  I woke up the next morning at 6 and couldn&#39;t resist looking outside.  I saw two of the objects.  They appeared to be about 5 miles distant.  I looked again at 6:20, and they had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the evening of the 24th, I was watching the sky at dusk to try to determine when and how they show up.  The ‘evening star’ was already at its station as the sun was setting.  Later, at 8:30 pm, I was talking with a neighbor on my cell phone.  We were talking about how there were six bright lights, and an orange ball over his house.  I noticed the ‘evening star’ light backing into the distance.  About 4 minutes later, an Air Force AWACS, accompanied by a fighter aircraft flew by at about a mile from me at about 2,000 to 3,000 feet altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m just guessing, but it seems someone at the pentagon is very interested in this concentration of UFO’s over Kendall County.  This is about 50 miles north of San Antonio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel unsettled about this large number of UFO’s remaining over a relatively small area for such a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been sitting outside on the patio every night for three years, just stargazing.  So, this is a whole new experience.  The other night I got on the internet to see if others had seen something like this.  I discovered people around the world have seen the red/green object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one mentioned the objects stayed in the area, or were seen for weeks at a time.<n>

8/16/13 22:00|Rabun County (unincorporated)|GA|Fireball|1 minute|Fireball observed on Lake Burton, GA|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101447.html|419|ndxe201308| Fireball observed on Lake Burton, GA<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several (approximately 5) extremely learned individuals, myself included, were occupying a boat on Lake Burton in Rabun County, GA, (approximately 90 miles north of Atlanta) at approximately 10 pm on the evening of 8/16/13.  All of us are very conservative and are extreme skeptics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on vacation in the area.  Most of the dwellings in the area are occupied only during peak vacation season.  The area was sparsely occupied on the weekend in question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our watercraft was the only watercraft on the lake at the time.  The man-made lake is beautiful and contains several small artificially constructed islands, on which multi-million dollar homes are situated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we traversed the lake the three of us sitting at the rear of the boat observed a slow-moving glowing object in the sky.  The object was red in color and looked like a large fireball.  It was hovering at a height of approximately 75 feet, above one of the islands, not 400 yards from us.  It appeared to be moving at a very slow smooth speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we saw the object we each commented on it, none of us able to comprehend what we had just seen.  The operator of our boat did not see the object and he continued driving in the direction in which we had been traveling. We excitedly notified him of what we had seen and he slowed the boat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were now on the opposite side of the island from where we had seen the object.  The trees on the island precluded us from observing the object.  The driver maneuvered the boat further from the island, to a point were we should have been able to see the object over the trees.  It was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time that had elapsed between when we lost sight of the fireball and when we should have been able to see it again was less than one minute.  Other than the trees on the island there were no other objects which could have blocked our view of any area on the lake.  There was partial cloud-cover, but several stars were visible in the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We traveled back to the other side of the island in an attempt to locate the object, but it was gone.

They were moving in formation in a northeast direction, but as they went behind a pine tree I lost visual contact for a moment, as i made it around the tree one of the objects completely vanished the other continued in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By sheer luck, so as to have a witness to something phenomenal, my girlfriend returned from Subways. I turned to flag her down.  When i turned to look for the first object it to was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I began to tell her about what i had seen, another object, same as the first two, came from the same southern sky heading in the same northeast direction.  She, too, witnessed this object that traveled a great distance in a few seconds until it was almost directly above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved  across the sky as if it were hovering.  Then it shot straight up into space and disappeared.  Not across the sky, but straight up into space and like a floating amber from a bonfire it faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was completely clear, no clouds.  The object was triangular or cone shaped, glowing/ glimmering and soundless.  It did not emit one bit of sound, this is a rural area very little light or noise pollution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time i saw the first two until the third one vanished about 1.5 minutes elapsed.<n>

We got the binoculars and we could see that it was a saucer shape, and had &#34;running lights&#34; along the entire outside perimeter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be spinning and or stretching and contracting.  It also appeared to have a tail end (that is what my mother and father saw, I did not see that).

Towards us and was the size of a van and made no noise what so ever and floated like a ballon and seemed to stop just above and then we saw it speed away over middle island which runs past our lane and i remember i could see the light of the ball on the creek water and then it went over them trees and headed south kinda slow and then it just took off as fast as could be and then took a left over the hill towards the town of Salem WV which is 12 miles from our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked at one another and thought how weird and also noticed the fire was almost gone and we had just put more wood on it, she then went to check on the 3 girls in the tent 8-10-12 years old and they were fast asleep.  I also noticed that my socks we real wet and changed them, we then both sat by the fire to get warm and then got ready for bed in the tent.  I put more wood on the fire but we both didn&#39;t sleep much that night as I keep looking outside the tent ,i woke up and my wife had everything packed to go home when it was light and I saw her still looking up into the sky.we got the kids up and drove off to the house.  We told others about all this but they just smiled at us and now we just talk to one another about it and we still see it in  our mind, but we did loose about 40 minutes or so?? we think?  It&#39;s the fire that got our attention as the wood seemed to burn really fast. and before we knew it ,it was almost 2am?? thats how it happen!

Once observing that object, we looked down for 2-3 seconds only to see that it was now gone after looking to the sky again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we didn&#39;t see the object anymore, we then heard a jet engine from a U.S. fighter jet (they fly in the area often, except not at night).  After hearing the jet we then witnessed a white light moving quietly from the west towards the east at a moderately slow pace followed by a turbine jet engine.  As we were watching the two flying craft, you could see that there was a difference between the two since the jet had the left blinking red wing light that&#39;s on the underside of the craft.  And the white light object had no blinking lights, only pure white solid light and was completely quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I myself am a college student and have been with the Army NG for 10+ years.

The spheres were approximately two or three miles away which would place them directly over lake easy, a lake we&#39;re both very familiar with.  I would say the altitude was roughly two thousand feet.  The spheres were not staggered in any way but perfectly side by side as if attached to something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first sphere simply appeared,within approximately one sec. a second sphere materialized directly to its left.  Both spheres were visible for about two or three seconds and were very close to one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first sphere to appear (on the right) simply vanished followed by the second one doing the exact same no more than one second later.  Both spheres were pure white and emitted an amazing red to orange aura.  Neither sphere made any sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the sighting the entire neighborhood as well as the surrounding area was bathed in this orange glow.  Honestly, it&#39;s hard for me to put into words just how awe inspiring this orange glow was, not to mention the vast area it covered.  Both spheres were absolutely identical in every way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Concerning the size of these objects they were simply enormous.  The white of the spheres were approximately the size of a lime if held 12 inches in front of one&#39;s face, and the aura was the size of a cantaloupe if held at the same distance.  The aura&#39;s never touched one another and there was a space roughly 1 to 1.5 inches between the two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both myself and the other witness to this event grew up together and lived only a couple miles away from one another as children.  We both lived next to an Air Force testing range and have witnessed many live fire and bombing exercises including flares being shot from aircraft as well as mortar tubes.  What we witnessed was DEFINITELY NOT a flare.<n>

The reports are well written, and the witness seems sincere, although we would be surprised if all of the sightings are about authentic UFOs, i.e. alien spacecraft.  We cannot be certain, however.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> SIGHTING # 26 – August 15, 2013 – THIRD SIGHTING IN 3 NIGHTS OF A SILVER-GOLD, ELONGATED/FOOTBALL SHAPED UFOS EMERGING FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO AND POSSIBLE SECOND SIGHTING OF A BRILLIANT BLUE-GREEN UFO THAT “SHOT” A PROJECTILE OR BEAM OF LIGHT INTO THE AIR I arrived at my regular skywatch location at 9:15 p.m. on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, USA, just north of the rock jetty at Blind Pass.  This was the third night in a row that I had been out because of what I had seen two nights ago.  The weather was totally overcast and dead calm, but there was sufficient moonlight to see the horizon of the entire Gulf of Mexico.   The moon was almost half full and high in the sky when I first arrived.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:45 a dim yellowish light appeared on the horizon just a little west/seaward of where I previously had seen the football shaped craft on previous nights.  I then got it in view with my binoculars and again saw two of the whitish-gold craft, side by side, right on the horizon at the water’s surface.  I think that they could have possibly come out of the water based on what I previously seen, except that these objects were fully formed – I did not see the little ‘blob” of light get bigger and turn into the craft like I’d previously seen.  I watched these objects for a short while as they pretty much stayed in place before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:13 p.m. I saw to the NNW of me, in the same area that the previous nights UFO’s appeared, a brilliant, “crystalline,” green-blue, flashing light, about the size of a pea at arms length.  It was no more than 4 or 5 miles away from me, well inside of the horizon.  It would come on for a short second, go off for a short second, etc. 5 to 7 times each time it came on.  It would stay off for perhaps a minute or two before coming back on.  After the first 4 or 5 times that it came on, it started slowly getting dimmer, and then I realized that it was moving way from me, just west of NNW, at an angle out to sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object for about 20 minutes before the !#@#%! Sand flies drove me off the beach.  I quickly went home across the street, soaked myself in OFF, and went back to my location.  By this time, 10:40, the light had turned mostly white with a bit of green in, and was barely visible with the naked eye.  It was still within the horizon though, close to 7 miles away.  I was watching it with my binoculars when the flashing became a consistent on and off, in a strange way.  It would take a long second to come on to the brightness that it would get, like on a slow dimmer switch, and then go off like a switch was thrown.  stay  I was somewhat, and the thought that came to mind was that it was “struggling, huffing and puffing,” getting to where it was just visible with my binocs.  Then, and this was scary, it brightened one last time and stayed on for a full second, and “shot” what looked like a short beam of light, or the light from some kind of a projectile, nearly straigh! t up in the air!  The section of “light beam” that I saw was maybe 60 to 80 feet long, perhaps even longer, as it was some distance away.  I guess it resembled the flash that comes out of the muzzle of a gun.  With 0 degrees being straight up, I would say that this short “beam flash” was at 10 degrees off of vertical, and toward the NW.  It seemed like the flash was going away from me and to the left a bit – it was very clearly defined.  I heard no sounds and it rather shocked and scared me when this happened.  I saw nothing else for about 10 minutes and I was glad to go home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve been lucky enough to see some really strange things out here, and even seeing a “normal” UFO seems like it would have been better that this.  I have absolutely no clue as to what it was that I was watching, especially considering that it changed colors and changed its rate of pulsations.  To think that it may have shot something up in the air just frightens me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While writing this report, and after having thought about it for a while, the color of this light was greener than the blue-green light I had filed in “Sighting #9” for July 12, 2013.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FOOTNOTE:  I went back out the following night from 9:15 to 11:00 p.m. and saw nothing at all.  I got rained out the following two nights, and the next report, #27, brings my reporting up to date.<n>

Both lights were moving west and one light passed overhead and to my left at around 300 feet.  The light was round and difused.  The size looked to be about 3 feet diameter.  Looked as if  object could have been a plasma ball of light.  As I was driving in a car going east on 16 mile road I could not track objects any further.  Sky conditions were clear.  Did not observe any structure of a craft just a ball of difused light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No sound, black in color triangular in shape like an enormous stingray, silent, approx 800 ft in altitude.  Tail had red green flashing light, moved south slowly and quietly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> upon sighting the duration of exposure was 10 minutes.  Checked youtube online later and saw 2 videos that captured the same object in Arizona/Colorado.<n>

Then I realized the humming noise wasn&#39;t at a consistent level. It was almost in waves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I am looking above me for this weird plane, and right when I give up I just happen to look out on the horizon and there it was!  At first, yes it looked like a plane, but then I noticed there were red and white lights (too many for a plane or satellite) in somewhat of a row, blinking in (once again) inconsistent patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I watch the large figure in the sky as it was going in all directions, at different speeds, hovering around the same area.  Then it made a weird zig-zag descent behind the tree line.   All of this happened within about two minutes.<n>

I was walking out walking my dog down|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101216.html|452|ndxe201308| Approximately between 20:45 an 21:00 on the night of Aug. 15th, 2013, in the town of Milford, NH.  I was walking out walking my dog down my street heading south.  I noticed two commercial aircraft flying overhead heading south/south-west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that exact time that I looked up I noticed an object that at the time I looked at it, it was stationary, and in a split second the object went from a stand still, to moving faster than any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen, and I served in the U.S. NAVY, and was subject to many different types of air craft and never saw anything move that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving south, it went as far as my eyes could see until it faded out of my sight.  From what I could see with my own two eyes, it appeared to be spherical.  There was no tail following this object so it did not appear to be a shooting star or meteor and was much to low in elevation to support that.<n>

Interesting part was that the object did not leave any trail like usual jets and seemed to move faster that usual jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was the space state but it seem much lower in altitude than the space station after checking the NASA website the timings of ISS do not match.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was glowing strong white in bright sunlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> May be a satellite but would be too close orbit and much larger for a satellite too.<n>

After a few minutes the lights came out from behind the trees headed from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched these lights and noticed that the lights would be lite for a few secons then go Out.  Not all at the same time.  I watched for a while and more lights came out from behind the trees headed west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were strung out about 10-15 (from ground view) inches long and five accross and they were escorting a mother ship.  I called my grandson and his friend out (5th graders) to see the UFO&#39;s fleeing the hurricane.  They became afraid and ran into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither will even speak about what they saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The two orange objects flew silently at a diagonal toward us under the clouds, so they were pretty low, like low flying aircraft would be.  No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my binoculars and we both saw the same things:  Cylinder shape objects with bright orange fire burning inside, then another bright orange light of same color up to the right in the cylinder, but round shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 objects flew to a point over us.  They hesitated for a few moments, than one flew straight behind us out of sight while the second one flew away at approximately a 45 degree angle to our right.  Again, they were completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked at each other in amazement wondering aloud and comparing our sighting with each other.   While comparing out sighting I looked up at the direction the two objects had come from and there was a third identical object.  This one was much lower and couldn’t have been more than 500 feet over us.  It flew directly towards us and then hovered directly overhead.  A few moments later it also flew off silently at a 45 angle to our right.  We were both to slow in thinking to record this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The orbs did not appear to be very large, but were a fair distance from the stadium, several miles. The first orb was flying solo, from NE to SW below cloud level , followed by two identical orbs about one minute later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were flying faster and lower than the incoming jet.  Flying in a straight trajectory but slightly rising and falling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they approached the shoreline, they took a direct path west and moved exceptionally fast out of sight; gone in the blink of an eye.  Too fast to be a known man made craft.  They were close enough to see they were not a helicopter, plane or familiar shape.<n>
8/15/13 19:45|Bauxite|AR|Sphere|20 seconds|Saw metallic spherical object, disappeared in the sky|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101241.html|457|ndxe201308| Saw metallic spherical object, disappeared in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 15th, 2013, at 7:45 pm my husband and I were driving home from a lake up north. We were on our way home.  It was still light out.  We were in Bauxite, Arkansas, near the post office there right at the Bauxite cutoff road.  My husband was driving and I was in the passenger seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up at the sky and I noticed what I thought was an airplane or some kind of aircraft. It was silver, shiny, and metallic.  I joked to my husband that I thought it was a UFO because it was rather oddly shaped, spherical but not like an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching this object in the southern sky, it made a turn and went west.  Then, all of a sudden, the object disappeared right in front of my eyes!  I immediately checked my phone app to see if there was a satellite in the vicinity.  There was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still trying to figure out how this object disappeared.  It was very high up, like an upper altitude airplane.<n>
8/15/13 19:45|Roseau (West Indies; Dominica)|AL|Fireball|Few Days|Strange blinking light over the Caribbean sea.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101480.html|458|ndxe201308| Strange blinking light over the Caribbean sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I live on the outskirts of the capital city of Roseau Dominica in the West Indies. On Thursday August 15, 2013, around 7:45pm my wife called me outside to view a white fireball moving from the south of our location to the north rather slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now my wife and I have seen a number of these objects over the past 2 years so this was not new to us.  We observed this object for about 13 minutes and then it disappeared. I went back into the house but my wife stayed outside for a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later she called me again to observe another fireball which appeared much closer to our location and this one was moving from the north of our location to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got excited because we have never seen two in the same night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after this one disappeared we saw yet again another one which appeared almost overhead and it was moving towards the east.  We were very very excited at this point and we continued looking for more but saw none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following night we saw two but on the third night August 17th we observed something that we have never seen before.  We were sitting on porch of our home facing west just having a conversation while we scanned the sky when I noticed a light come on and then go off in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not make anything of it at the time but then after a while it happened again and then again a short time later.  I turned to my wife and told her where to look for the light.  As soon as it “blinked” I noted the time.  It was 9:43pm. I took out my cellphone and activated the stopwatch application.  I managed to time the blinks at 3 minutes apart exactly.  We also noticed that this object was not over land but over the sea so it could not be a cellphone tower or anything of the sort.  We noticed that the stars and the moon all moved across the sky but this object remained stationary.  It did not move one inch and continued blinking every 3 minutes.  We went inside at 12:11 am and the light was still bli! nking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday August 18th we tried to observe the light again but could not because of cloud cover.  However, on Monday 19, we went outside at about 7:15pm with the intention of trying to observe that strange object again.  We observed one fireball and about 9:33pm that light started blinking again every 3 minutes.  We made the observation that it was affected by the clouds, in that when they came in the light would disappear and the reappear when the clouds moved away.  Again, I know of no radio towers or otherwise which is constructed in the sea and reaches the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have observed this light for every night since and we were wondering if anyone has filed a similar report.<n>

It seemed to be flying as if pulled on a string.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was thinking about getting my camera another identical object passed over as though it was on the same line as the first.  Both objects seemed to appear suddenly, had no contrail, no wings, no sound and were headed East. In fact I&#39;ve seen several jet contrails today and these two objects had none.  This is the third time I&#39;ve seen these type of objects in our area. Last year in Meadville, Ms, and several yrs ago in a rural area in a National Forest area.<n>

It was around this time and date though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were hanging out on our street.  There were 6 other people there too who did not witness the event.  My friend and I decided to leave the group of people and hide behind a flower bed to see what the groups would do.  It was a fairly clear day, no wind and about 60 degrees outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The group came looking for us and I was looking south while they were coming up the street facing north.  I watching them looking for us and  over the tree line I noticed a metallic/gray rounded/cigar shapped object.  It was moving up and down as it was flying from the east to the west.  It would drop about a 250 feet then a few seconds later go straight up to its intial attitude. It did this multiple times until it vanished about 10 seconds later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that same night about 19:00 my friend(the same one from earlier) and I were playing basketball as my friend was shooting he witnessed a blue light go across the sky. It was moving  about a moderate speed and was only one blue light there were no blinking lights which made me know its not a plane and no tell so it was not a comet, shooting star, etc... He pointed it to me while he was in shock We witnessed it about 5 seconds.  After these two events I came home and did not tell anyone due to the fear of people think I am crazy etc…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Just east or so of Blue Springs, there was what I first thought was a large black kite slowly and silently heading from North to South crossing the Hwy I was driving (Interstate 70 east).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it was overhead, I was continuing to drive and pay attention to the road so didn&#39;t have the chance to see where it eventually went or headed to.  It was headed south.  There were other cars on the highway and I thought surely someone else would have seen it and reported it but I haven&#39;t read or seen anything about it in the media.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was possibly a new type of Drone that perhaps the military was testing because it was solid black, silent and &#34;bat&#34; shaped.  I looked up Drones on google to see more of them, but didn&#39;t see any such thing.  The Drones on the internet looked completely different than what I saw and I realized I saw something that is probably unexplained.<n>

I went up my driveway and the light got brighter, I knew it was a plane when it didn&#39;t move or make any noise and how big it was..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my boyfriend over to help me indentify what I was looking at.  We both started at it until it messed with out eyes.  The longer we stated at it, the blurry it got.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend went into the grass to try and get a better view of what it was.  The light dimmed way down into two small lights then moved at a normal speed to the right.  I tried to follow the lights to where I could see behind the trees, but it disappeared.<n>

We witnessed a white thin cigar shaped craft in the north eastern sky, heading west north west.  It had no contrail it disappeared behind a cloud for several minutes, after 2 of us made hand signals.  Pointing, first at our eyes and then it.  It appeared to have little to no visible wing, flying at a high altitude and was silent.  it looked to me, what I would expect a drone to look like.  it came out of the cloud heading the opposite direction.  after a 1-2 minute trip to another cloud it exited the same cloud about 10-15 seconds later  it exited that cloud accelerating hard with a solid contrail, I didn&#39;t know our boys had jets or thrusters of any kind on our white drones, and had heard that they were invisible to the naked eye.  so what I saw did disturb me enough to report this tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> also in the same area of the sky 2 bright objects flashing from red, blue and white.  similar but not the same distance from my town in the same direction but a bit further away and lower to the ground always at night.  It seems to move faster than other stars, the closest one. it also appears to be doing zigzags, up down and at times quick up down or slanted movements.  in the north western sky, the second object flashing the same three colors is west north west in what looks like a straight line i am not centralized in the triangle you would get if you were to draw straight lines connecting me and the 2 objects .2 witnesses some times 3 or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

About 5 seconds later it reappeared and flashed again remaining in the same spot.  A split second after the second flash another, bright flash appeared to the left of the original object.  It flashed again and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood watching for severl minutes and the objects did not reappear.  I also looked for any flying aircraft from strobes but none were to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights I saw were not aircraft strobe lights plus they remained stationary, while flashing.<n>

The objects were further south, between NORAD (Cheyenne Mountain) and Fort Carson.  They seemed to be stationary, one would fade out, then another would fade out and another would re-appear; in particular pattern.  They were in small lines together, kind of lined up parallel of each other; again in no particular pattern- just random clusters of lines.  We tried to continue South on Powers to see them, and eventually they all began fading out of vision.<n>
8/15/13 00:14|Banks|MS|Sphere|5 minutes|Three bright spheres in triangle formation hovering above horizon. Slowly moved apart while one remained stationary.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101449.html|472|ndxe201308| Three bright spheres in triangle formation hovering above horizon.  Slowly moved apart while one remained stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At roughly 0:12 on August 15th 2013 I was driving west down Counce Rd. toward Mississippi Hwy. 3, when I slowed down to see if I could pinpoint an odd sound coming from my truck. I rolled the window down to listen for the sound then sped up to see if acceleration had any effect on the noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About thirty to forty-five seconds of driving at about 20mph a coyote ran out in front of the truck crossing Counce Rd. headed north causing me to stop.  I watched the coyote run down the embankment and into a field.  He stopped directly next to a telephone pole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was still stopped looking at the coyote I noticed a light that at first I believed was connected to the pole.  About 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon I saw three bright semi-pulsating lights in a triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was they were helicopters in a tight formation. Then I considered airplanes taking off from the Memphis airport.  I&#39;ve lived in Memphis most of my life and am very familiar with the take off/landing patterns of planes as FedEx has their main hub there.  This time of night was about right for the first inbound flights of the night.  I leaned over to the passenger side window and looked back east and could see planes lined up for landing in the distance...their front main white and red blinking tail and wing lights small but clearly visible.  I looked back to the lights still hoovering in the same position and considered that perhaps it was a cellphone tower that was not too far away.  I looked east again and spotted the tower blinking red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I started driving again 20-30mph only taking my eyes off the lights for a few seconds to keep the truck on the road.  This is the Delta, and farms are everywhere. There were no obstruction to my visibility and the lights were situated perfectly above one of the fields.  I was trying to figure out the distance when what I think was a helicopter passed between the two lower light in a downward angled path, thats when I realized they were either huge, or huge and farther away as the helicopter seemed like only a red blinking speck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I had reached the intersection of Counce Rd. and MS HWY 3. My view was obstructed for a second or two as I turned right on to HWY.3.  I considered trying to take video but figured it would look like every other dark and blurry night shots I&#39;d ever seen. Instead I called my friend...it was exactly 0:14.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right when she answered the bottom right light shot quickly away to the east and stopped...pulsated different colors for a short time...three seconds at most then began to slowly move east until it completely disappeared. It reminded me of someone turning off a flashlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The top and bottom left lights remained in position until I reached the intersection of HWY 3 and Old Mississippi 304/713 when the top light began to slowly pulsate as the first but did not accelerate, instead it appeared to move slowly north or northeast and disappeared as the first did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only the bottom left light remained. It did not move. It remained stationary and pulsated as the other two then slowly dimmed and disappeared. I ended the conversation with my friend, and said Id be back shortly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night was perfectly clear and cool, odd for mid-August in Mississippi, so the humidity was low as was the haze. It almost felt like fall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I returned home I made a loop re-driving my route. At 0:42 I stopped the truck again on Counce Rd., but this time got out. There were still planes lined up for landing, but realized that where I had seen the lights were well southeast of the airport. They were perfectly framed by a horizon of trees, cropland, and stars above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I cant ((deleted)) believe this!&#34; was on continuous replay in my head, and apparently vocally as well.  As my friend related after I returned home, &#34;You kept repeating their formation, movements, and the pulsating white, blue, and green lights...and I cant ((deleted)) believe this.<n>

Close to  the horizon were 2 stationary lights. They were red-orange in color.  They didn&#39;t move at all. The sky was overcast completely.  I couldn&#39;t even see the moon or any stars.  We had a severe thunderstorm about 2 hours prior.  The air was still and everything was quiet.  The lights were at a distance, but they were quite noticeable and bright.  After viewing them for about 30 seconds, I turned around to open the front door to yell for my husband.  When I turned back to the southwest, I saw that one of the lights were dimmed and then disappeared.  My husband came outside about 20 seconds later, and I showed him the remaining light.  We stared at it for about 2 minutes, then it dimmed and eventually disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My opinions-The way they seemed to &#34;burn out&#34; made me think they were fireballs.  They were not in the normal flight paths for aircraft in this area.  The way they were absolutely still was quite strange.  I wonder if there were more of the fireballs prior to me going outside in the first place.  Tomorrow I will take a photo of how the area looks during the day, and where I remember the fireballs were.<n>

As I was looking up (facing south) I noticed there were four stars in a trapezoid shape.  I thought it was strange because I’d never noticed that star constellation before, when all of a sudden the two “stars” on the right side of the trapezoid started to move upwards and westward, together. I called my fiancé out to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had a very fluid movement to them, they moved together but sort of drifted a little more together and a little more apart at times.  They moved fairly quickly for what tiny lights we could see.  They looked just like dim stars but the lights pulsated instead of twinkled the way stars do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights ended up stopping to the west aligned with a bright star.  A few seconds after the lights stopped, the biggest meteor I have ever seen streaked across the sky, and right as it happened, the craft or crafts adjusted themselves to face where the meteor had just been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to stare at the lights for about 10 minutes, but they just hung there, very still in the sky.  We decided to go inside.  A half an hour went by and my curiosity got the best of me, and I looked out to see the “stars” were still there, just frozen still.  Tonight the stars are no longer there, which is why we firmly believe we witnessed a UFO last night.<n>

The reports are well written, and the witness seems sincere, although we would be surprised if all of the sightings are about authentic UFOs, i.e. alien spacecraft.  We cannot be certain, however.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> SIGHTING # 25 – August 14, - SECOND SIGHTINGS OF GLOWING ELONGATED/FOOTBALL SHAPPED UFOS WITH A DIRECT CORRELATION TO OUR NINTH SIGHTING OF “FIREBALL” UFOs AND “FLASHERS” I arrived at my regular skywatch location at 9:30 p.m. on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, USA, just north of the rock jetty at Blind Pass.  The weather was clear and calm, with some clouds well past the horizon of the Gulf of Mexico.  The moon was almost half full and high in the sky when I first arrived.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on my previous nights sightings and knowing that I could only see the glowing, white/gold UFOs through my binoculars, I had them trained toward the NNW, just off shore of uninhabited Cayo Costa Island, when at approximately 9:50 I got really lucky and saw two of the glowing UFOs appear to “pop” out of the Gulf of Mexico, perhaps 5 or 6 miles away from me.  I estimate the miles based on the horizon being at 7 miles over water, and these objects were just inside the horizon.  I say “lucky” because I only saw them briefly, maybe 15 seconds or so, before they “turned off,” slower than a light switch, but not as long as if on a dimmer switch.  I don’t think I would have seen them from where I was without binoculars.  These two were side by side, about 2 or maybe 3 UFO lengths apart.  I’ve estimated before that the UFOs were around 100 feet long -  at least not more than 150 feet long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later I caught a brighter goldish-white light with naked eyes, but when I got my binocs on it, I saw that there were already 2 of the objects there, one right on the water, and one just above it like before.  I couldn’t tell if they “popped” out of the water or not, but I suspect that they did.  As before, the UFO on the bottom started rising up to the one above, and they looked like they were about to merge and appeared to be touching each other, when the lights went out!  Then about another 10 or 15 minutes later, while looking through my binoculars, I saw one, then two, and then three of the same colored UFOs appear to come right out of the water again!  WOW!  Two of them were fairly close together – maybe 3 or 4 lengths apart - and the third was a litter further out to sea, maybe twice as far as the first two.  I counted 7 or 8 times that various numbers of these UFOs – up to 5 at one time – appeared and the quickly disappeared, after 5 to 15 seconds.  They always appeared to be coming out of the water, and sometimes drifting maybe 3 to 5 object heights above the water before disappearing.  I say that they appeared to come out of the water because just before they became brighter, it always seemed like there was a tiny little blob of water right at the surface before the light became full strength.  Well, maybe not “full strength, because that would be really bright, but bright enough to make out a shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time I was scanning the horizon it this area, whether there were UFOs or not, I would occasionally see a single white strobe-like flash close in the area – within view of other UFOs.  I never saw more than one flash at a time within a minute or so, but they were nonetheless consistent in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here’s where it got really interesting.  The oblong lights had not come on for a good 10 minutes or so, when I saw one of the amber “fireballs” I and others have been seeing, come on, right at the same exact location where I’d been seeing the other UFOs, but not more that 400 or 500 feet above the water.  I saw this single fireball come on through my binocs as if on a “fast” dimmer,” and continued to watch in that area for another 5 minutes or so as the light dimmed on and off.  Each time it came on it stayed on around 5 or 10 seconds, went off for a minute or so, came on for 5-10 seconds, etc. for a total of 6 times.  Each time it came on it was a few degrees higher on the horizon, going straight up.  The last time it came on it was perhaps 900 feet above the horizon, about 5 miles away from me.  After the last time it came on, nothing much happened for 20 minutes or so and I went home.<n>

To the South of me a flashing or pulsating light caught my attention.  I saw an orb/fireball which seemed to pulsate changing between orange red and yellow or gold.  This object seemed to hover for a few seconds. I ran into my home to grab my cell phone and call my two teenage children out to see this object.  This orb was traveling North slightly Northwest while rising up in elevation.  This object did not make any sound. However within minutes of seeing this we could hear helicopters and airplanes in the air. Many of the helicopters were flying at a low elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The same object seen on August 29th @ 20:34 outside of my home.

I thought they might be helicopters but I found it odd that there were so many and so close together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was after 9pm and my daughter was tired, otherwise, I would have tried to get closer to the lights.  She thought it might be some kind of business on the mountains.  I have never seen the lights there before.<n>

It was not a flare, meteor, plane, helicopter, or military.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have never seen anything like it.  It was a clear night with stars out.

We got closer we realized the light was a giant spotlight shining into the sky.  At that same moment we all realized it was stationary!  This thing was hovering!  We pulled over and I jumped out to record it, but when I jumped out it flew off at an absurdly slow speed without making any noise!  I saw the bottom of the craft as it passed overhead, due to its lighrs on te bottom, and it was indeed in the shape of a triangle.  It then continued to fly away until it disappeared from view.<n>

We pulled over to take a look.  The lights were just above tree height and approx 1 mile away in a non organized staggered arrangement.  They were flying in a southerly direction when all of a sudden one by one they cut to the east and disappeared.  Speed was slow and steady.  No marker lights like an airplane would have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we thought they were gone, we stood around talking and then headed back to our car and the neighbor headed towards her front door, they were coming back from the same direction.  When they reached the tree line, they dissipated and then suddenly an upside down triangle begin to form with the same lights in no particular order.  Once formed, they broke off and headed east one-by-one again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 3-5 seconds of the lights disappearing, a Southwest jet went right through the airspace on approach to Akron Canton Airport.  They had to have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Color was reddish yellow, no sound, no tails<n>

This happened four (4) times then when it dimed again and disappeared.  The white light was very high and moving say 12 plus inches before disappearing.  Standing outside by my garage I first spotted the light say directly over my head to about 20&#39; down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought I was seeing a satilite but the object was moning from the South to North and the light changed from bright to very dime and then went so dime you could not see it any more and I never saw it get bright again.<n>

I have no clue as to what this was,but it was big, defined in shape,dark black and I could clearly see the object blanking out the the clouds as it move through the sky.  The amount of distance in such a short time, it had to be moving at a very fast pace.<n>

August) 14, 2013.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked outside, I immediately noticed an object due north of my position, approximately 40 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object moved on a west, north-west to east, south-east heading.  When it seemed to be almost overhead, but still slightly east of my position, it executed a smart left turn for a heading of approximately due east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object, then abruptly slowed, to approximately half it&#39;s previous speed.  It almost came to a full stop, but slowly continued on a due east course for about 45 seconds, then began to dim in brightness, until after another 15 to 20 seconds, the light seemed to just “turn off”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was a brilliant orange-amber light, about the size of a green pea held at arms length.  The color and intensity were very vivid, and at first dazzling.  It had a similar appearance, and brilliance to the landing flood lights of a passenger jet coming head on, except the color of the light was a very intense amber-orange.  Duration of this sighting was two and a half, to three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not think this object was some sort of “flare” tied to a balloon, although that remains a possibility. 3:30 am on a Wednesday morning does not strike me as good timing for a hoax.  Still, the thought did occur to me.  Upon returning inside my home, I examined three internet based weather stations very close to my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather conditions were, lightly scattered clouds, with calm wind conditions.  All three showed wind conditions of 1 mph or less at the time of this sighting, reporting “calm” with no wind direction indicated.  I have archived these weather stations by URL, and by taking screen captures.<n>

We spent alot of time camping this summer, mostly around Tahoe City, CA.  We&#39;d go for night hikes, watching for wildlife: bears, deer, or anything moving.  We found it strange that in all the tine we camped, there were no animals, anywhere.  I took along a digital camera a couple times.   A tourist camera with a flash.  I would take random shots as we hiked.  The first night, no pictures turned out. Weird. The second time, pictures came out, yet alot of them had interference and were not good.  It wasn&#39;t until we were home again, back to work and normal in routine, that I uploaded the pics and checked them out.  Using Imagex TO view photos, I had to brighten them a bit to zoom into the dark scenes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I have is astonishing. I have photographs of &#34;alien&#34; entities.  We went snooping up a canyon that displayed odd lights.  As the woods became denser with brush, the creeps had us turn back around.  It was at this point we both felt that we were no longer alone.  I snapped alot of pictures.  As clear as day, you can see a bulbous &#39;green&#39; head with enlarged eyes looking shocked as the flash exposes him watching us.  Within the same minute of camera log, (the same one?) a kid size &#39;entity&#39; is beside us  behind a bush.  The hike to our camp was twenty minutes.  I took camera shots as soon as the flash recovered from the last one.  I have undisputable proof.  There are pictures that show &#39;aliens&#39;? creatures? forest freaks? following us to our camp, as well as watching us through the night.  I have debunked myself, my camera, my computer, and my eyes, but nothing changes what is there in front of me.  I am not looking forward to ridicule.  Certainly do not want to die. Don&#39;t want! late night visits from conspirators or cover up artists.  Photos are innocent, not tricked photoshopped or lame.  But they spell it out.  All these reports and congregations of believers had better get a more convincing plan, because somethings going on, For these &#39;entities&#39; to be roaming freely in the cover of night, somebody is sitting on files during the day. I am sure that using my buddies computer to report this is a mistake anyway, but.... Convince me you are for real and I will show you things that will change your life forever.

In a matter of about 1 minute the flashing lights, had been approaching me this entire time, but in the course of about 1 minute the lights/ship had travelled what I would have perceived to be about 15 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m standing in a Junior High field hoping to catch some of the meteor shower, and this ship flew right over my head at a height of 500-1000&#39; appearing to slow down and hover slightly over my head like it definitely had seen me.  It appeared a spinning armor the bottom of the ship emitting faint light or vapor as it swung in my direction as if it was focusing down on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My heart was pounding in a way I&#39;ve never felt.  I thought I was going to get swooped up,  I kid you not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a 5-10 second hover over me it proceeded to fly toward the Northeast direction and it had the exact same 2 flashing white lights on its departure.  The rear was identical to the front in shape, look, and light behavior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time it got close to me, to the time it started to depart it moved at a relatively normal speed, but it was 100% silent.  I mean dead silent from what I could tell. I realized I had my phone at the last minute but it appears I managed to get nothing but black sky captured when I attempted to get a quick video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I about had a heart attack at 34, I can tell you that much for sure.  This is not my first UFO sighting but this one was overwhelming. I&#39;ve never seen one so close.  The strange thing is, I had a hard time making out the exterior shape, much beyond squarish.  Very weird and not what I was expecting to see tonight.  Probably a little better than a couple of shooting stars though.  I walked away with my head and face stinging and that lasted about 40 minutes.  I was wondering if I received a radiation blast or some sort of a firmware upgrade...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

I am willing to consider that these flashes were an optical illusion, and that I was just witnessing meteors coming directly at me, which is why I was unable to see a tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, these flashes were very similar to the event I had witnessed in the past.  I also want to add that I didnt see these flashes out if the corner of my eye, I was looking directly at them.<n>

I am an amateur astronomer in my mid 40&#39;s.  I have been looking at meteor showers and planets through several telescopes since I was a young girl growing up in the farming hillsides of northern england with my father.  My fiance also - has been an amateur astronomer growing up in Montana.  We are both fairly expert at seeing meteors and know what we are looking at in the night sky on most clear evenings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had seen several good meteors over a period of about 30 minutes prior to the strange light sighting.  We were focused on the area around Perseus and Cassiopiea in the night sky.  Looking directly west from where Cassiopeia is located at this time in our section of the hemisphere, and directly above my home - we saw a sudden and brilliant light.  It was not a meteor. It didn&#39;t move from one point to another, there was no tailing off or t! rail.  It was almost like a camera flash. It started off looking like a regular star in the night sky and the suddenly - flashed really bright - like a camera flash going off - on a much larger scale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both exclaimed as we saw it.  My fiance explaimed &#34;whoa did you see that&#34; as I pointed directly up at it to show him. It flashed in a bright purple color.  The strangest thing was however that as soon as the flash ended, the object which had previously been there - like a star - disappeared.  It got stranger however when just a few seconds after disappearing, it flashed again but this time like an explosion - with this time a green light - and then also disappeared completely.  We watch the night sky almost every night.  The skies around the San Francisco bay area are crowded with planes.  I know all the flight paths having lived here in this location for 18 years.  And I know the many different colors and flashing signals emitted by planes.  This was not one of them - bei! ng just literally a finger length from the area we were focuse! d on for the meteors, this was a star or so it seemed.  I have not really ever paid attention to UFO stuff. But after telling my father about this strange light - he directed me to look at an online video of a UFO over Jerusalem which had descended to the temple hovered, and then flashed and took off. I wasn&#39;t going to write in to report this because I didn&#39;t think this was at all a showy or really eventful sighting and I have been thinking of all of the things it could have been.  A military plane perhaps, or a meteor coming coincidentally right towards us on an angle where we couldn&#39;t see the tail -- but after seeing the Jerusalem video just now - the flash that that object emitted was almost exactly like the one I saw over my house.  However the light disappeared after it flashed over my house - it didn&#39;t speed up into the sky as the one in the Jerusalem video did. I am a professional with a twenty year career in business as is my fiance.  We are not and have never been really people! who believe in things we cannot prove with facts and science.  Yet we both were really taken aback by what we saw and - having had years of studying the night sky - we have never seen anything like that and didn&#39;t feel like the flash disappearing then reappearing and the colors it emitted - were a natural occurrence.  It wasnt a meteor. It wasnt a plane.  I am not sure if this was a UFO but it defies explanation in my mind as to what could have behaved like that.<n>

8/13/13 23:20|Lake Winnange (Canada)|ON|Sphere|2 minutes|two men blinded at Winnange Lake by a laser-like light emanating from a high fliying UFO.|10/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102957.html|500|ndxe201308| Two men blinded at Winnange Lake by a laser-like light emanating from a high fliying UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Greetings,<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were scanned by a laser-like light at night by a high flying UFO 60 km east of Kenora, Ontario.  Our location was at Lat 49° 47.8’ and Long 93° 41.7’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My name is ((name #1 deleted)) and my friend’s name is ((name #2 deleted)).  We are in our 60’s.   ((#2) is retired public servant and I am semi-retired educator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((#2)) and I have been avid wilderness canoeists for 42 years.  During the last 15 years, we have gravitated to our favourite camp site on the north eastern basin of Winnange Lake, Ontario.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday evening, August 13, 2013, ((#2)) and I were scanning the skies for the last remnants of the Perseid meteor showers.  The half moon set at around 10:40 PM so the sky was black and rich with stars and the Milky Way which reflected off the lake.  The water was calm with not even a gentle breeze, so we easily saw and heard the jet planes flying at 40,000 ft.  We sited several fast moving meteorites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, while scanning the skies at almost 11:20 PM ((#2)) excitedly exclaimed “((#1)), did you see that flash?!!”  I immediately directed my sight toward the western sky and witnessed a silent and high flying object whose dim light was continuous for about 15 seconds, then began alternately fading out and reappearing at about 5 second intervals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about one minute, the dim light seemed not to move at all, but began to grow hugely in size while changing like a kaleidoscope into many colors including yellow, orange, red, purple, green, and blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the 7 seconds or so when the object grew in size and its colors started to change, I became increasingly ill in my stomach and chest area feeling nauseous as if my body was being violated and invaded.  I felt like I was going to vomit.  ((#2)) said later that he felt a sensation of fear and his body hairs stood on end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object abruptly and unexpectedly flashed directly at us brilliant white laser-like beams of light into our eyes, which lasted at least a second and almost blinded us.  We were unable to close our eyes or blink as would be the case when a bright flashlight hits one’s eyes in a dark room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my peripheral vision, I recalled that nothing else around us was lit up so no shadows appeared around us from the trees or our camping gear, indicating that the light flash was only directed at our eyes.  Our bodies were locked during the flash.  I felt that my soul had been scanned and I became angry from this violation of my being.  ((#2)) experienced a similar sensation.  Immediately, I asked him to check the time which was 11:20 PM, so I don’t believe that we lost time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the UFO’s laser-like light beam attacked us, we watched it for another minute or so as it continued in the alternating fading and reappearing pattern it had previously exhibited, and then it totally faded from view.  The object was flying in a straight line direction of WNW at an angle of about 50 degrees above the western horizon.  We had been examining the eastern, southern and western sky for meteorites.  I believe that the object was silently flying at least 40,000 feet above the ground, while ((#2) felt that it was lower at about 10,000 ft.  The whole episode from the initial sighting to final extinction of its alternating glow lasted about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later, I talked to friends who had been camping at Big Whiteshell Lake in Manitoba on the same evening, as they too were scouring the skies for meteors with a large telescope.  Our friends stated that from their location, they and others witnessed at the same moment the object which flashed ((#2)) and me.

I looked to the north and observed 3 stationary red lights adjacent to the bridge.  As it was a rainy, hazy night I thought they were the lights atop two radio towers in WI.  By the time I realized that the towers were too far away for it to be them, I was across the bridge and well into WI.  I guess I should have turned around and investigated but I had a long journey ahead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only thing I can think is it was a UFO next to the bridge.<n>

My daughter (14) and I (36) did a jaw-drop &amp; wish to report that although I am unaware of the local ISS flyovers, (I believe) that on the night of August 13th I witnessed what I assumed was a well lit satellite.  However this particular &#34;satellite&#34; was closely followed by a second object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I measured the distance between the two objects as one finger width, from a fully outstretched arm.  The two appeared to be exactly matched in both trajectory and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told this to my daughter the next morning and we both turned toward each other (moments ago) as we listened to you describe your recent ISS flyover observation, which appeared to include a second object close behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that I am familiar with this form I will begin more thorough observations &amp; reports as we have been witness to numerous sky-based anomalies, as we are avid sky watchers.

I noticed the flying thing, had did a flash twice when it was like it was disappearing and reappearing next to where it disappeared, it was moving like ti was in a certain area it was like it was moving within a radius, it moved around the area but didn&#39;t ever leave the area, it looked like the others stars in the sky except it didn&#39;t stay still like they did, it moved around abruptly, it looked high up and appeared to have a very irrodecent light colored looking trail behind it when it moved with higher speed, it would stop then shoot over a little bit stop, go up a couple stops then do a circle , then stop, it just kept doing that, not sure what it is but the weather here was clear and no clouds , I was standing in a very dark area, so I could see the stars really well, let me know if there were ia any other sightings, it just looked like a light, and seemed to get di! m and go back and forth , but it only got really bright when i! t was sk ipping over from spot to spot, no moving but, it would suddenly disappear and reappear at the same time kinds of and when it moved from that spot it was really bright until it got to the next spot which is right next to its first location then it would remain bright for a while and move around , I am not what it was, but I saw it moving around and it did things no drone or plane I know of , its not a meteor , star, planet, space command module, it didn&#39;t have much consistency for its movement, and since it looked like the other stars it I was shocked to see it moving from place to place,it never fizzled out of brightness, the color almost looked light a blue, light blue, its hard to describe, but everyone else saw it moving to, and stopping then going again, it looked like it was not in the atmosphere, thanks<n>

Went out back around 10-11PM looked up and there was a &#34;star&#34; or SUPER BRIGHT LIGHT which appeared to be beside the moon, the moon at a distance this bright star closer to us.  I asked my boyfriend wtheck he thought the light was and he said &#34;oh, that is just a helicopter!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there a while intrigued watching and listening for movement and noise.  There was no noise and if one stood and watched it you could see it &#34;floated and moved&#34; not far but just in the spot it was in.  So I go back inside after awhile I came back out and IT WAS STILL THERE!!!  I was stunned because no matter what my boyfriend said, it was no helicopter, plane or star!!!  I still makes me obsessed to try to understand or find an explanation for the thing we saw???<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, my boyfriend agreed after awhile he did not have a clue what it was, he agreed it was amazing but really did not trip on it like me. The sighting! started around 10 or 11PM and that star, plane, helicopter, or UFO STAYED HOOVERING IN THAT SAME VACINITY TILL AROUND 3AM!!!!  I stayed up the whole time till finally I went out and it was gone.  I took a couple of pictures and recorded a video on my cell phone so glad I did!!! what is strange is the PICTURES, that is how it appeared in the sky and to the eye.  In the video that is not how it looked with my eyes only???  In the video it changes to all these colors???  It always appeared as a super bight white star.<n>

So I ran out to the road and moved south down the road about 20 feet to get a better view of the light.  It was moving back and forth, at first I thought maybe it was a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I then spotted a second red light just below it (about a ½ a hands width) and they were moving like they were sparing.  The two lights would occasionally change from blue to red and then back again.  Several times they would suddenly drop about one hand width (at arms length) then change color from red to blue and then go straight up one to two hand widths.  They continued this “dance” for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor pulled up in his car and I yelled at him to come look at this.  He saw them also and didn’t know that they were.  At about 8 minutes from seeing the first one the second one that appeared (red initially) disappeared below the horizon (neighbors 1 story roof) and the second one moved north behind the trees.  The whole thing lasted approximately 10 minutes.  I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no sounds, they appeared to be several miles away and they were only blue and red, alternating at random times.  They moved with a combination of high speeds and low speeds in all directions.<n>

We were standing near the pier when we witnessed several orange/red lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First one light appeared.  Seconds later two more appeared at about a distance of 3 or 4 times the width of the original light and to its right.  They remained absolutely still for several seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the first light went out, followed shortly by the twin lights also going out.  Several seconds later, the twin lights reappeared as before, followed by the first light again coming on.  For a minute or so, the turning on and then off of these three lights continued.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no discernible pattern.  Sometimes the first light would come on; sometimes it would be the twin lights.  Whichever appeared first would be the first to disappear.  At no time was there any movement of these lights.  They remained steadfast in their positions,! appearing and then disappearing like fire in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the conclusion of the light show described above, there appeared yet a fourth light to the left of the original light’s position.  Then a second light moved to the left of this fourth light.  Then another light moved to the left of it, and another light to the left of that one.  As I recall, there were now four lights sitting in a row, perfectly still as though they were hanging from an invisible rod.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As one of my companions described it, it seemed as though the lights had been hiding behind one another, each taking a turn to move to the left and within our sight.  There they remained for several seconds and then they were gone.  We did not see them again, but we left the beach shortly after as there was a mighty storm approaching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before the lights appeared, we had watched a distant fireworks show far up the beach to the north.  So it must have been between nine and ten o’clock.  The lights appeared about 65 degrees above the horizon.  They were straight ahead of us, out over the water.  We had earlier observed the lights of a distant barge, and the fireballs in the sky seemed to be closer to shore.  I remembered the lights as being triangular, but with rounded corners, more of an egg shape or oval.  One companion remembered them as being more circular, and my other companion said he saw “portholes” in each light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights we saw were beautiful.  They had an organic look, not like artificial light, but a warm glow like that of candle light in a pumpkin, but redder.  They emitted no beams, and were not reflected in the water below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some might think they were Chinese lanterns, but I know they were not.  It was a very windy night, and the only movement we saw was that of the final lights.  And they moved almost mechanically before standing still as the first lights had done.  Then they were gone.<n>

It was farther away from the airline traffic and was still 4 to 5 times larger than the jets.  It was immense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to myself &#34;no way!&#34; there were no navigation lights, markings of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over and removed my sunglasses, and it darted east incredibly fast and then went straight vertical and was gone in a few seconds.<n>

Through the binoculars it had a more defined rigid shape that resembled a crescent moon with peak in its middle.  It fell for a minute or so then was gone from sight.  Almost immediately after it vanished a helicopter flew overhead in the direction of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and both witnessed it and agreed that it was one of the most bizarre unexplainable objects we had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Right above my house, flying low, and the direction it was heading looked to be downwards...  But not a nosedive into the ground. I do believe there were lights.  It was so massive.

The location was along the road going to Mount Charleston, in the vicinity of Las Vegas, Nevada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two witnesses were parked along the road.  They were observing a recent meteor shower.  They were looking north, away from the city lights of Las Vegas.  Only a few meteors were spotted.  They came from the northeast direction.  Each meteor sighting lasted for about a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, a bright white light approached from the southeast.  It was in the shape of an orb.  Another object red orb shaped object appeared nearby.  Both objects moved towards the west over the Las Vegas skyline.  Both objects emitted an aura, or a haze, which was changing shape.  At various times, each object stopped and hovered still.  These events occurred until 2:30 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2:30 AM, the red orb shaped object disappeared.  It immediately reappeared about 25 miles to the southeast, about one second later.  It remained stationary for another half hour.  During this time period, the larger White shaped orb moved to the east.  It changed into a diamond shape.  Immediately thereafter, it changed into a triangular shape, with three bright lights in each corner.  This occurred for about 10 minutes, until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both witnesses returned to Las Vegas by 3:30 AM.  They were standing in a cul-de-sac observing the night sky.  At this time, the large white orb reappeared, coming from the northeast.  Two red orbs appeared nearby.  The large white orb changed into a boomerang shape.  It came closer to the neighborhood where the two witnesses were standing on the cul-de-sac.  The boomerang shaped object had bright white lights along each section or wing.  It approached even closer, and it remained stationary, hovering about 500 feet above the ground.  The two red orbs moved closer to this boomerang shaped object, hovering at about 600 feet above the ground.  By this time, the boomerang object emitted a beam of white light which was scanning from the left to right, and back again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the two red orbs each focused a red beam of light down into the cul-de-sac.  Following this, the red beams of light completely engulfed a house on the cul-de-sac.  The red beams of light created a red, green, yellow, and white spherical haze around the house.  The spherical haze had holographic properties, however it was difficult to ascertain definite shapes within the holographic properties.  This holographic type ball of light continued to change colors.  Then it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both witnesses continued to observe the three unidentified flying objects.  At 3:45 AM, witness number one decided to “ signal“ these three objects in the following manner:  Witness number one held his left  arm up and made three blinking motions with his left hand.  Then he paused for a second, held up his right arm, and made a single up and down motion, followed by a short pause, and continuing with four horizontal motions.  Continuing, the first witness walked in a circle.  The first witness did this to symbolize the number pi, as a universal mathematical constant, and to show its relationship to circles.  The first witness repeated this series of motions two more times, for a total of three times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately thereafter each object transformed into disks.  The first object had three green lights on the underside.  These lights made a circular pattern, and rotated counter clockwise three times.  This was followed by a flash of bright white light. Continuing, four bright red lights appeared in a circular fashion.  They rotated clockwise, making four circular motions.  This entire pattern was repeated by the second object.  After this pattern was completed by the second object, the same exact and entire pattern was repeated by the third object.  This was also done again, in the same manner, two more times, for a total of three times.  By 3:00 AM, the first object changed into a boomerang, hovering for several minutes until it vanished.  The next two objects changed back into red orbs, and shortly thereafter, they also disappeared.<n>

The light was oval shaped.. not a perfect oval but oval is the closest shape to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything was calm/felt calm.. not even a breeze or a sound. I felt very calm (this is unusual for me, especially when walking alone a dark neighborhood at night).

I see it coming from the west side. I just go home.  This is pretty much it.<n>

Please help!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 17 year old high school student in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, who is astonished by the universe, and nightly, I go outside to gaze upon the stars, and has been frequent  since over 4 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this duration, I have observed over three unidentifiable objects flying over me on three separate occasions, over three separate years, and all objects resembled two to three spheres appearing to float in formation at a great speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 22nd, 2011 I was sitting outside at around 10:45 p.m., watching the North Eastern sky.  I recall seeing a white glow come over the horizon, and which I had believed it was a satellite, only until I saw a second orb following, going in a circular type motion, and then a din third appeared behind it.  The craft did NOT make a single noise.  This occurred over a 105 second period and then disappeared in the south eastern sky.  I was dumbfounded at what i had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next year I researched what I had saw and found nothing,! and began to watch the skys even more.  A year later, October 2012, the EXACT same, in every detail, phenomena occurred, three orbs flying in a circular type motion.  At this point I was with two other people who also saw it, and I just had to take a picture, which came out clear as day exactly what I saw. And recently, on August 12, 2013, I saw this again, but this time, when i tried to take a video of it, the lights flew off 2x fast and I was shocked because I have never seen anything go so fast in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please if you have any information regarding this type of incident, post it online please!  I will always look for answers to my questions about what I have observed over these past years.<n>

It was a perfectly clear  night and the sky was finally dark enough to see the stars  easily.  We were standing close to the house looking up to the  south and had been there for possibly three minutes when a  craft, and I say craft although I didn&#39;t actually see any shape, it blended in with the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we actually saw were the large round lights, three pure  white lights in a triangle shape, one in the flight direction  (S) one on either side (E and W) and then one red one at  the&#34;back&#34;(N) opposite the leading white light, making a diamond  shape.  These lights were steady, not flashing.  They were not  shining down, very odd, they were just very bright white and  red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound whatsoever which is why I was completely  taken off guard, it visually broke over the roof line in silence  from the north and continued south till we couldn&#39;t see it any  longer for the trees (approx 2 minutes).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be around 200 feet off the ground, it was very  low and traveled very slowly, like you were out for a Sunday  drive and just cruising...went right over the town.  I can&#39;t  imagine anyone else didn&#39;t see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do have a small airport here which is how I&#39;m guestimating the  height of the craft.  The landing flight path here is from west  to east, very little traffic and rarely anything at that time of  night if ever. I see the planes when they come in during the day  from the same spot I was standing watching for meteor shower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am generally ready with binoculars and camera and am so very  disgusted with myself for not having my camera in hand but it  was my granddaughters first time out in the dark to look at  stars and I didn&#39;t want to leave her alone in case she would be  afraid......I was afraid it might suddenly disappear.  I was in awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m almost sorry I saw it as now I feel like the old cave  artists must have felt continually looking at the place where I  saw it....Was it extraterrestrial or some secret government spy  plane???  who knows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n>

It would fly up, hover for a bit and then fall.  When I witnessed the first “fall” of the object, I thought for sure it was a plane crashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, after its’ rapid descent, the object returned back into the sky.  My Husband and I followed the object, where it passed over into the Twelve Bridges section of Lincoln, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped the car and got out… the object slowly came towards our car, then hovered right above us.  I am unsure how high in the sky it was, all I know is it had very vibrant red, blue and green glow to it.  When I say it was flashing colors, there were not just a few lights, the entire object was glowing the colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there staring at the object for about 10 minutes as it just hovered above me, a car approached over the hill and I looked away from the object for a minute.  When I turned back I noticed it rapidly moving away from us back towards the original sighting area where it ultimately disappeared .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to chase the object again in my car, however, my attempts to find it again failed.<n>

Frequently I go for long walks at night.  Tonight I was almost back to my driveway when I noticed 2 lights in the Southwestern sky underneath about 80% cloud cover.  The one to the left was a blinking navigation light traveling in a linear fashion - obviously a plane.  The one to the right was larger, spherical, and glowing orange.  It was slightly larger than a plane&#39;s navigation light would appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the light and noticed it moving quickly and erratically, like an insect around a lamp.  The light continued this kind of frenetic motion predominately upwards before disappearing into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a month prior I had a similar, initial sighting.  That time it was much higher up and directly overhead.  I could pick out jets and stars as a reference, but this orange light moved erratically in a way that I had never seen before.  I watched it for what felt like a solid 10 minutes - just buzzing around up there nonsensically.  I realized just how high up it was when the light traveled behind a whispy cloud (one of those upper level cirrus clouds).  At that point I went back to the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend of mine observed something similar in late July, but I can&#39;t speak for him.<n>

It had a rounded center making it appear to be like a wheel of a car,hubcap in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects displayed no usual marker lights, or engine sounds.

8/12/13 19:00|Vicksburg|MI|Fireball|second|Streak of light heading up at a 60d angle.  It looked just like a meteor, but going up, not coming down.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101334.html|544|ndxe201308| Streak of light heading up at a 60d angle.  It looked just like a meteor, but going up, not coming down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was talking on the phone with my nephew when I was looking out the window to the South West.  I saw what I would describe as a reverse meteor.  It went up from the ground at about 50-60d angle at 2-3 times the speed of a meteor.   If it were coming down, I would have said it was a meteor, but to go up on an angle!!??  Now there was a storm heading our way, but I know the difference between lighting and a streak heading into the upper atmosphere.  I would say it looked similar to the way fireworks would go up, but many, many times faster.  It went as far as I could see in a flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it weren’t for a darker grey sky in the background with the storm coming, it probably would have never been noticed.<n>

At that time my daughter and I seen one of the objects shoot a green orb of light out in a southwest direction it kept traveling and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed the objects with binoculars (7 X 35) power not the best but gave a good look at the objects.

We were out during the perseids meteor shower and in the near distance was a huge storm head with amazing heat lightning erupting in and around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While fixing our eyes on the both the shooting stars and the storm we noticed a reddish orange flickering light at the edge of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it was believed to be a star or an airplane and then after many flashes of lightning we saw that it was definitely in the sky alongside the storm but appeared to be hovering in place.  It continued to move back and forth and kind of in a small circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We aren’t sure if the flashing of the storm was playing tricks on us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reddish orange light attached to what appeared to be an air-craft of some kind hovered in place for a half hr after midnight and then was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It seemed to move in a wide arc above and behind the trees in the distance. It looked fairly close to the ground, maybe tree-height, and not too far away from where we were standing, either.  I estimate the balls to be roughly a couple feet wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first ball traveled a bit and then started to fade, and as it did so, another one showed up where the first one had started (none of us saw it appear, we just noticed it out of the corner of our eyes while observing the first one), and followed the first orb&#39;s pathway and died out just the same.  They were silent and almost pulsating/fluctuating tones of color/rippling in shape.  We attempted to take video but we could not autofocus because it was too dark and the orbs disappeared when we tried to manual focus, but we do have a bit of blurry footage of one of the orbs.<n>

My son and I were watching the night sky, and suddenly a diamond shaped object appeared, traveling from a south to north trajectory.  As it passed by the Milky Way Galaxy, it blocked out the stars as it flew by.  The diamond shaped object had a charcoal gray color to it and on all four corners, it had dim white solid lights.  Its speed was very fast, as we were able to observe it for about only 7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was silent, and the size, at best guess, was if you held out your thumb out at arms length, it would cover it.  So it was very large in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two minutes later, a commercial jet liner came into view, traveling west to east, but the speed was nowhere even close to what we witnessed.  The sky was clear, no moon, no wind.  The speed it was moving, it would be very difficult to photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your interest in this subject.

We saw several aircraft, all going east-west, which were easily identified by their flashing red lights and subsequent sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 23:24 we both spotted a fast-moving white light which had no red lights and was traveling north to south.  We agreed it was not a plane.  It was moving faster than satellites but much slower than the meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the light continue along its trajectory, it began to fade, blinked bright, then disappeared.  It was definitely not a meteor.  It left no tail nor was it moving as fast as the meteors we viewed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited to see if it would reappear along its trajectory but it never showed up.  It was not the satellite Integral (which hardly moves at all), although it was in the same general vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nor was it Genesis I which passed one hour later and low on the horizon.

I heard a plane in the distance that was coming in to land at the dayton international airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing in a school field so my view was not blocked by anything.  I scanned to the west and was watching the plane with its landing lights come in and flew right over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then i started walking again and i looked back to the west where the plane just came from and there was a  bright orange fireball hanging in the sky.  I would guess it was about maybe 1000 feet up and just looked like it was sitting there or moving very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To be honest the first thing i thought and said out loud ah someone let a chinese lantern go.  I watched it for about 1 minute cause it looked really cool and then it started getting bigger and brighter.  At that point, i said hmm what the heck is that and then it took off to the west and gained altitude until was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing shot off way faster than a jet ever could of, it was like shot out of a slingshot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if anything close to this has been reported before but it kinda freaked me out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if the plane reported it to the tower cause where it was in the sky they would of seen it.<n>

And I start slowing down I&#39;m already freaking cause I know that&#39;s not normal!  There were no flashing lights like a plane or helicopter just four stadium type lights.  And I&#39;m slowing down the far right light starts moving down and that whole thing forms into a ducking triangle.  (This thing has not moved either) and it starts moving south really slow like I was now trying to catch up to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of a sudden it&#39;s a triangle with a red light and orange light and it started spinning or rotating really slowly and just cruises south!  It looked like it had wide beams pointing away from it (there were three of those) and the beams weren&#39;t bright at all just dim.  And I ducking lost it I went down a dead end road.  Just cruising south really slow.  It turned into a triangle in front of my eyes I watched it!

One object was heading approximately 140-150 degrees (SE), the other at about 210-225 degrees (SW).  The 225 degree object passed behind the path of the first, seemingly within a small distance away from the first.  A short time after passing the other object, about 10 seconds or less, the 225 degree object changed direction and headed in approximately a 180-195 degree direction.  The first object continued on its trajectory and they both continued in the direction they were until I could no longer see them due to either cloud cover or their distance from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute after those 2 objects disappeared from my sight I saw a falling object at about 90 degrees from my location, likely part of the meteor shower expected tonight.  It was dim then very bright, then gone.  This object fell like a ‘falling star’, burning up on impact with the atmosphere.<n>

It was hard to see rough the forested park, but it continued flying northwest before passing over the mountains and disappearing.  There was no response from most of the cars and people, who continued driving or walking.  It scared me, but I suppose people thought it was a kite or military aircraft.  Maybe they thought it was a weather ballon from NCAR?  It scared me and I still wonder today.  Birds migrated throughout the city and they seemed scared.<n>

That fact alone discredits this story because it’s a very, very loud and bright festival with a lot of really drugged and crazy people doing crazy things, but I know what I saw and so does my wife, and so did the other four people who witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the evening we went and found a dark corner of the festival to watch the meteor shower.  I am an avid sky watcher with a lifelong interest in astronomy and have spent most of my night life watching the sky through telescopes, binoculars and with my bare eyes, enjoying Auroras and having fun spotting satellites and aircraft and identifying  planets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a pretty clear evening and the entire milky way appeared clearly and we were spotting meteorites at a rate of one or two every couple of minutes and had seen a half dozen satellites as well.  There was a light fog beginning to move in but the stars will still clear, it just made the stage lighting visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 11:45PM we simultaneously observed a light appear from the west, as though it had “just appeared” but neither of us were looking directly at that segment of the sky, rather noticed it in our peripherals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a steady, slightly off-white light which did not flicker, and had it been moving on a ballistic path I would have identified it as another satellite however it made a sudden turn to the north and decelerated.  We were stunned and both jumped up to our feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were lighting effects from the music stages we had been watching, lasers and powerful stage lights, but those were clearly lighting effects and this was clearly an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the course of about 30 seconds it appeared to get bigger and brighter, as if coming closer.  It appeared to be about 1/10th the apparent size of the moon in the sky.  It tracked north during this time, slightly adjusting its path and varying in speed, eventually almost completely stopping.  It was definitely round from where we were but we could not distinguish any features.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other lights.  The glow was soft and it did not cast a beam in any direction, as if it were above the fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or two, I noticed a group of four people walking down the dark path towards where we’d been laying  and I ran over and interrupted them – “Do you want to see a UFO?”  They said “of course” and I pointed at it in the sky.  One of them used a flashlight to point at it and I said yes.  All four simultaneously said “oh… WHOA WHAT!?”  I was glad to have other witnesses who were as shocked as I was.  We all stood there for about another minute talking about its motion and trying to debunk it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Without a doubt in my mind, and the others agreed it was not a helicopter – its light, if it was a search light, would have been cast towards the ground, but did not cause the fog to glow at all, was omnidirectional and without glare and there were no red or green lights attached to it, but it was big enough that we could see the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The guy in the group with the flashlight told us that he had a buddy who could “call them down” using some kind of high powered light he has.  “They call it ‘Buzzing The Tower’” he told me.  “They come down to investigate.  He’s done it several times, and I’ve seen him do it too.  That’s pretty cool too man.”  We all laughed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after that someone said, “hey it’s leaving!” and in the matter of a few seconds it got smaller and fainter in a northwest direction.  Someone said “it looks like it flew off into space” and we all nodded and mumbled in disbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone else said “Did we just see that?  You saw that right?  That round light swerved around and hovered over Shambhalah and then blasted off into space?”<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all laughed nervously, shaken by the visitation.<n>

The second UFO was still traveling slower than the first but still faster than I have seen jets travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second UFO did the same thing the first did; slowly dimmed its lights, but this one was closer than the first so you could still see it travel a little ways after it had dimmed its lights.<n>

I seen these same lights last week in a different location, my friend, who lives 20 miles South of me seen them also last week and when I called her last night,  she could see the same thing closer to her place at the same time as I was witnessing these ones, so there are more than one of these hovering around this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the day here approximately 2 weeks ago, I see a silver orb heading West in the sky away from Vernon.  Three of us witnessed it.  I took a video with my iPhone and took pictures, you can see the flashing lights in the video, but the pictures aren&#39;t clear.<n>

My friend was the first to look out the window and point out.  Three were in the formation of a triangle and one other dot was to the bottom left of it.  As we drove closer, two disappeared into the night.  We continued to drive and a few seconds later another was gone as well.  The final dot remained (the one not initially from the triangle) and emitted a small light that shot away from the dot.  Although we were initially semi-believers of aliens, we can officially say that this has affirmed our belief!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This was around 10.45 on another part of the island.  He said he was freaked out and came home.he has been fishing a lot of years and said he has never seen anything like that before.  He described them as like big fireballs.  He said one went right over top of a fishing boat and light it right up.  He said at that closest point to him it looked like a lot of different shining lights in a circular moving form.  Being approximately 500 yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said that they came in a row same as the 2 I saw.  They traveled in a NE direction1 at a time.  He said as 1 went out of sight another appeared.  4 in total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 I saw I got video of the second.It is not good Quality I was driving and my friend was recording on cell phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the next day my co worker said driving home that evening something bright in the sky had caught her eye around the same time but she was driving and only got a glance.<n>

I have the time as after 10:05 p.m to 10:15 on Sat. Aug. 10, 2013.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into house to change and my friend was watching this object for a dozen or so seconds before I looked up from Orangeville looking southward; as if above the village of Alton in County of Caledon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was starry and clear and a chill as well, but I quickly got excited as what was before our eyes made no sense.  It was alone and the size and sorta shape of a double-doubledecker bus kinda but up at a height a small plane could make it up to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO as, I&#39;m comfy to call it, was flickering entirely in a random light as if it were on fire and wasn&#39;t fast but did alternate speeds a tad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a plane in the higher sky from ENE to WSW and when we saw/said that, the &#34;ufo/object&#34; is in its line and then it went in a direct and intentional southward position and moved, nut not warp or nothing; BUT THE LIGHT WENT OUT FAST AND IT WAS OVER.   Never was it bright or obviously a normal object in the sky; like a plane, chopper, balloon or meteor or an object I&#39;ll likely ever see again and never thought I would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IT&#39;S NEAT TO HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE AND HOPE TO LEARN ABOUT THIS, THROUGH LIKE THE TORONTO PEARSON AIRPORT RADAR MAYBE, I DUNNO.

Calm on the surface.  Couldn&#39;t tell the size.   The light was uneven but it was zipping along, went from SW when I first saw it, to SE behind trees in less than a minute.  We simlply could not ID the object, no implication that it was a visit from ETs or anything foolish like that.  Your suggestion/question that it could be an abduction is pretty crazy.  A light does not mean a &#34;craft&#34;.<n>

As I lay there for about an hour, I saw some good meteors and five satellites orbiting the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw what looked like a satellite and it stopped. It then proceeded West, then East.  I got excited and went to grab my wife.  Could not see much movement when we went back out, so she went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I witnessed groups of three to seven lights, signal each other across the span of my view and then two would do a kind of stand off synchronized movement with very fast back and forth and swirling movements.  They would turn off their lights and move to different areas in the sky.  They would also align themselves in a three light line and other constellation shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still going on when I went to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could not get it on film, though I tried.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Definitive evidence for me that advanced life exists!!!!<n>

This happened 4-5 times over the next hour.  Only 2 blinks and gone.  Then to reappear in a different area of the sky.  Too short for an iridium flare and certainly not an aircraft as we know it.

The beams lasted for one to two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of Saturday, August 10, 2013, my wife and I spotted a round, bright white light object travelling across the sky.  The time was approximately 10:00pm to 10:30pm. The object was moving south.  We were camping at Lion Head camp ground on the north end of Priest Lake in Coolin, Idaho.  When we spotted the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, we were gazing into the sky watching shooting stars, meteorites, and other marvels of the sky.  When I noticed the bright object, I had my wife look at it because I knew there was something unusual about it.  In fact, I said, &#34;There...look...a UFO.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was travelling at a higher speed than any plane I&#39;ve seen before and there was  no blinking lights or any other alternative explanation.  It was simply an unidentified flying object.  While my wife still doubted what she was looking at, the object shot a beam of light, perhaps a laser, the width of the object, all the way across the sky, miles in length, to a point we could not see due to trees blocking our view.  The beam of light lasted for approximately a second or two.  I said, &#34;Whoa! Did you see that?!?&#34;  And my wife did!  The object shot the beam of light the same direction two more times, but to two different locations across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the object move across the sky hoping to see more unexplainable displays from the object, but more campers showed up with their car shining its headlights near our direction, which distracted us from watching the object much longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That same night, I witnessed various objects moving across the sky that would sometimes disappear while watching.  Some may say that I saw satellites.  However, the objects moved way too fast to be satellites.  I&#39;ve seen satellites move across the sky, and these objects appeared to move 10 times as fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen UFO&#39;s before, but for some reason I feel this sense of apprehension to talk about what I&#39;ve witnessed.  I even felt apprehensive about reporting what my wife and I saw.  She doesn&#39;t even talk about it.  However, I found this UFO reporting site online and I feel it is alright to share what I witnessed when so many other people have witnessed various unidentified objects as well.<n>

I do belief there is life out there, after what I&#39;m going to tell you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all started on August the 6th, 2013, at 5:45am.  I have just woken up from sleep and to my surprise I could hear foot steps on my roof.  To my opinion I imagine that the neighbor&#39;s next door were fooling around and jumping from roof to roof.  So I went outside and looked to see if there was anyone on the roof, and there was no one on the roof to my surprise.  I questioned the footsteps that I herd that I clearly could distinguish between that of a bird or human; they were clearly foot steps of some thing on the roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August the 7th 2013 about 6:39am I was awaken to footsteps once again coming from overhead on the roof.  I proceeded to the front door to investigate.  I looked outside and walked to the outside of the house and could not see anyone on the roof.  Once again I questioned the footsteps on the roof.  This time there were two of them going in a circular shuffle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of these episodes continued for three day&#39;s and on the final day the 10th of August 2013 around 22:00hrs as I was sitting on my front steps I noticed in the sky as I was sitting down of to the East a perfect triangle shaped object in the sky.  It&#39;s approximate distance was about 2000ft to 3000ft maybe more or less.  It hand lights perfectly spaced apart at each point of the triangle and it glowed as it highlighted its summitry.  It was not like the stars were they were scattered all over the place this object had perfect shape like a triangle with three points that were light up.  I was thinking of getting my Iphone but I was too much in awe wish I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I question what could this whole encounter have been, and I have no clear answer; that&#39;s why I&#39;m writing you this report. Can you help me understand what is going on, is this real. I think in my mind it is real because it happened I was there, awake, alert, conscious. It always happened in the early in the morning around 5am or 6am. I think these things are ufo,s and extraterrestrials. Well to tell you the truth I kid you not, this was real; it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time in reading my encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> p.s ever since the lights and footsteps my back has lower back has been killing me.<n>

Neither objects had blinking lights or any other familiar characteristics of known aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately pulled off to the right side of the road as we were entering a rural village not more than 30-40 seconds after initially spotting the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed upwards to traffic behind me and oncoming traffic to which a few blinked their lights in acknowledgement.  We observed the objects for approximately 1 to 2 minutes and while doing so did not hear any discernible noise at all coming from the objects.  The objects did not look to be of a very high altitude although a good distance across the horizon from us.  There was a jet with its blinking lights noticeably higher in altitude above the two objects.  After observing the object for approximately 2 minutes, the trailing object moved in very slowly in an easterly direction and seemed to diminish in brightness and intensity until it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 30-40 seconds later, the lead object repeated the same actions as the trailing object prior.  This sighting has very, very much sparked our interest into what they may have been, but at the same time has left us with an uneasy and unsettling feeling.  These two objects were glowing with such an intensity without any discernible noise, and did not exhibit any trait or characteristics of any currently known aircraft that we are aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a U.S. Army Active Duty Veteran and have been around many forms of military and commercial aircraft and I have never seen anything the likes of these two objects.  We unfortunately were not able to obtain any photos of these objects because our cell phone was in my wife&#39;s purse which was in turn inside one of the motorcycle&#39;s saddlebags at the time of the sighting.<n>

It flew silently. It came from over the ocean and continued on over the island of Holden Beach, NC.  Its path was slow, but steady, and the altitude was extremely low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My estimate of its flying height would be 1/4 of a mile.  I estimate its distance from me to be between 3 and 6 miles.  It was only in my view for about 20 seconds when I lost sight of it, as the inland trees blocked my view.<n>

We watch them for several minutes and then they faded away, one at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we talked about what we just saw and turned to leave, another one came in from the left, stopped and hovered in the same area and as we watched for several minutes again, it, too, faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were still amazed and trying to figure out what we were seeing when another one flew in from the left, hovered, and then faded away.  We do not know what we saw but wonder if these are UFO’s.  We tried to take pictures with our phones, but couldn&#39;t get it to work.<n>

Approximately 20-25 orange oval lights were seen flying east from the Toronto direction to south west in a cluster over Lake Ontario.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light objects ascended upward, eventually they disappeared.  This lasted for about 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were very taken aback and initially thought they had to be planes, but too many were clustered together, which would be impossible for planes to take off in a similar formation especially at 21:30 at night.<n>

The intensity of the light was constant and there was no flashing or pulsating to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was either silent or high enough in the sky that there was no sound.  It did not look like a point of light (like a star or plane at high altitude), but a very slightly curved, rectangular shape with the leading edge being the longer side of the object.  I was nearly directly overhead.<n>

Since we had just returned from a car show, I still had my camera with me and caught it hovering silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was early evening, just getting dark, when the object appeared.  It glowed red and hovered, moving slightly, then stopping again.  After a minute or so, it veered off to our left, westward, then stopped and hovered some more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of the sighting, the object moved upward, hovered again, then the light went out, as if someone blew out a candle.  It did not leave our view by going east, west, up or down, it simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes later, the red glowing object reappeared, and I filmed it again, this time with a darker sky, making it harder to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the youtube video I posted of the event:  http://youtu.be/xR9dZ8t_XcY<n>

(facing west towards Towson) WE then looked up to see two reddish objects in the sky.  Then one seemed to catch fire and fall, And seconds following it exploded scattering debris.  Then coming from the South west not to far away, appeared several more reddish craft one by one following the same flight path (And not regular flight path of passenger planes).  As they were coming in some others were approaching from a slight north western approach towards Timonium.  And when each of the aircraft got to the site of explosion, their red lights would go off and appear to vanish but at least 2 that me and my son could see the silhouette of an aircraft with no lights, just black objects.  I didn&#39;t have a camera at hand but I did have some binoculars (8x30 field 7.5, if this matters).  I stabilized them on the bench out front and viewed one of the red! dish lights coming in.  The craft was moving to fast to point out a shape but I could clearly see only one light and craft.  So I panned over to a plane in the far distance.  It was farther away and I could clearly see its Red,Green,White lights and could make out the planes shape.) The whole thing lasted about 20 to 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You don&#39;t have to report this because I have no footage just my word. But it might help on any other reports. BWI, APG ,and Martins Air base should have picked something up. Not to mention anyone in the Northern Baltimore County could see it who looked westwards and up.<n>

I also noticed that the image does not appear in either the previous or subsequent frame.  You can see by the small movement of the clouds and bird how little time elapsed.  The distance in frame is approximately fifty (50) miles from Provincetown, Massachusetts to Bourne, Massachusetts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 59 years old, a private pilot and have flown over a million miles commercially.  I have lived on this bluff over 28 years and have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I enlarged the photos at much as Paint would allow and could not see any wings, tail, blades or source of thrust or lift.  I am sure you have better digital photo equipment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just can’t figure out how this image appeared and disappeared so quickly.  I frequently capture aircraft and, depending on their altitude, they can take more than 50 still frames to traverse the field of vision.<n>

It went directly over top of me.  It was a very quiet morning and as it passed over me I could hear a faint sound reminded me of the Jetson&#39;s cartoon cars or something like the 6 million dollar man noise (nah nah nah nah nah nah...etc) but very faint and sort of tin-ish.  It came out of the south east over my head toward the north west.  I live about 10 miles north west of Selfridge AirForce Base and it came straight from that direction.<n>

I stood facing east toward Bellevue, looking at the blinking lights of the transmitter towers at the top of the hill.  We had a brief electrical storm earlier so the sky was just a big cloudy haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I see something in my peripheral to the right of the tower, a dim amber colored glow moving through the haze of the clouds.  My first thought was that it was the glow from airplane lights reflecting off the haze.  But now that I was looking at it directly I could see why it couldn&#39;t possibly be an airplane.  The flight pattern was too erratic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t see what the glow was emanating from but whatever it was was zipping through the clouds at unearthly speeds and darting around like a hummingbird.  The glow also seemed to be too dim for plane lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved from the right of the towers to the left in about ten seconds which would be a considerable distance for a plane to travel in that small of a period of time.  Then it quickly faded out like it turned itself off.  I watched for another two minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Called my buddy downstairs on my cel and told him what I saw.  He said he was coming up for a look himself.  While I waited for him I kept watching the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute after that the glow comes moving through the clouds in it&#39;s rapid darting fashion but this time it&#39;s coming from behind me, from the west moving east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly call my friend demanding he get up there.  I saw it again!  Get up here! I said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the skies for another 15 min or so but other than a few, what I presume, were lightning flashes off to the distance in the east, the glow didn&#39;t return.<n>

We were traveling south on I-49 near the Bunkie, La when we exited on to highway 106 right off the interstate to quickly use the rest room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned to exit I saw something catch my eye out the window.  We then stopped so she could use the restroom and I got out and looked again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report is below:  I stopped the car got out and looked again and that’s when I saw a fuzzy or faded blue light moving in the sky towards the W/NW.  I strained hard to see it as it looked very fuzzy and then it started zig sagging so to speak and becoming clearer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this same time I was trembling not believing what I was seeing and I asked my girlfriend if she could see it as well.  She said yes and then we both watched it together, kind of zig-zag about if you will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or two of this we saw a normal aircraft(which could be heard) cruising at roughly 20,000 to 30, 000 feet traverse the sky.  There was not a light around and the stars (including the milky way) were very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The blue light then moved as a clear pin point, like a star, and shot up high into the atmosphere near where the plane was and traveled much much faster.  It then blinked out and then reappeared at another point well below where the plane had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then shot with such great speed clear across the sky, stopped, and completely changed directions back towards the west where I first observed it. The object made no sound.  I felt fear, wonder and confusion as this was happening.  My girlfriend then decided we had been there long enough and wanted to go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time, I attempted to capture the object on my iphone, but, there was not enough light to capture the image much less the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will gladly upload the images of blackness that I do have in case you can enhance them.  The event lasted for roughly 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hard to tell the distance of the object, but, my best guess would be anywhere from 5000 to 20000ft high and several miles away.  But, like I said, these distances were nothing to this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My coordinates were +30.856926 -92.222672.  Mark 293 N/ NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time was around 1:00Am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will note that Fort Polk military base is in that direction.<n>

It’s only ever been with him.  Anyway, seeing as he’s so discerning I left him to it, as I started peeing at the side of the road once he parked. It wasn’t very pleasant, because he was hollering at me all the while to look at the sky, and I’m just like “I’m peeing!”<n> <n><n> <n><n> So then, I went to look at the sky.  I saw a blue fuzzy after a moment of looking and watched it move around.  It would blink and appear in a different place almost every time it blinked.  I couldn’t tell if it was my eyes or the thing but the blue light seemed to be variably fuzzy and a smaller pinprick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the thing move erratically, at random angles, including moving back and forth! in a straight line.  At one point, it shot across the sky and straight back again.  There was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left, because it was late and I was sleepy, but we left before it left.<n>

It was about 45 degrees above the horizon (ie not low on the horizon, and not directly overhead).  It was moving along at the speed you&#39;d expect from a plane, but it was bright red like fire with no flashing lights or discernible shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my wife (more of the skeptic type) and at first she was like, &#34;it&#39;s a plane.&#34;  But then she was like &#34;what is THAT!&#34;  Behind the first object was a second, same intense fiery color, following a similar path/speed/height but this one was larger.  After watching this travel across the sky for about a minute it slowly faded out and disappeared.  It was a clear night, you could see stars.  There were no other lights or flashing lights on either object, and both were completely silent.  We have a lot of fighter jet activity out here out of the Burlington airport for the National Guard, so we&#39;re used to that type of noise and activity.<n>

It had NO flashing lights, travelled from west to east, was relatively low in the sky (at about a 45 degree angle from the ground), and the red/orange colour was so vivid that the 5 individuals who witnessed it at first wondered if it was a small plane on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was quickly established of course that this was not the case, given that the object was obviously not falling, but rather, maintaining a steady course across the sky.  From the time we noticed the object, it took approximately 2 minutes for it to travel out of our sight towards the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 5 witnesses were puzzled by this sighting, and found the experience quite unsettling.  Although our hope is that the object was a large, low-flying satellite, we have continued to feel unsettled today in light of the fact that none of us have ever given any credence to reports of UFO sightings in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have checked our local paper to ascertain if others in Guelph witnessed the object, but no mention of the incident has been noted thus far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We remain puzzled and disquieted, and hope to discover a logical explanation to calm our minds regarding what we saw last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses consist of a 54 year old teacher, a 52 year old Occupational Therapist, a 54 year old Information Technology manager at a large university, a 54 year old graphic designer, and a 19 year old university student (the son of one of the two couples present).<n>

Canada<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the heart of the city of St. Thomas Ontario Canada on Aug 9 2013 approximately 10 pm (Eastern Standard Time), a red and orange sphere like fireball had been spotted by four adult people coming from the southwestern sky heading in a northeasterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even with the city lights were very few stars are seen, this phenomenon was very prominent and did not in any way, shape a conventional craft like an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a steady course, the speed was faster than an airplane but slower than a meteor or comet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireball looking very much like a round flair but had no trail or solid debris behind it and did not dissipate during the two minutes of observation until traveling out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 10:20 pm, another sphere like fireball had been spotted with the same description, coming from the south southern sky heading in a northeasterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But here is the really strange part, it was followed by another nineteen similar, orange lights “craft” flying silently in the same west to east direction, all following about the same course.  They were spaced at about 90 second intervals.  There was no sound associated with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew over the house next door and kept going until they disappeared between the houses across the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this happened over a ten to fifteen minute period.  We followed each one until it disappeared, some behind the trees; others seem to just blink off after they passed us.  We saw no interactions between the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t have a camera, but grabbed some binoculars.  I saw nothing but the orange lights.  Some appeared to have a bright white core.  There was no sign of a solid craft that would have been visible with reflected light; or the usual navigation lights on an aircraft (red, green, white).  There were certainly no strobe lights which I see all the time on aircraft flying in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were seeing the lights, an airplane, with its bright white landing light on, flew in the area, but it looked like it was at a higher altitude and much farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night, August 10th, 2013, we were at a concert in Rockport, MA, about three miles in a straight line from the first sighting.  It was about 9 PM.  We went outdoors to watch an impending fireworks display on the other side of Sandy Bay.  The Bay was filled with stationary boats waiting for the fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next fifteen minutes, we saw five more of the same glowing orange light objects performing in the same way, this time spaced about three minutes apart.  That is, they were flying low, one at a time, following the exact same course as the previous one, this time about North to South.  In this sighting, we could see where they first came into view.  They originated low on the other side of the Bay, implying that they were at a very low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew overhead and to our right until they disappeared behind the buildings in back of us on Rockport’s Main Street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were surrounded by about ten to fifteen people who were also waiting for the fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one appeared to notice the orange lights.  If we hadn&#39;t seen the same objects the night before, we probably wouldn&#39;t have paid attention either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Not understanding what I was seeing, I pointed it out to two passer-bys who where also stumped as to what we were looking at.  Then, I walked up to a parked truck in a local tiny mall and asked the fella inside what he thought those were. He said &#34;oh those are probably hot-air balloons&#34;.  I asked if there was a hot-air field or club around and ...do they fly at night?  He didn&#39;t know the answers. I asked if those balloons fly into the clouds?  (because one did)  He didn&#39;t know.   The later eight lights slowly followed the direction of the one that rose above the clouds, but not at the same speed and not into the clouds either.  Rather, they stayed communal at an even slower pace at very similar distances apart from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Between the two middle lights and the lead light, there seemed to be a barely visible light that jetted out, so the total would be 5 when including the little one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see planes arriving and departing from the MSP airport in the NE, but these lights were not associated with any planes.  They followed an exact pattern across the sky and were solid amber in color, no blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the barely visible light disappear and then each of the large lights disappeared one by one.  I don&#39;t know whether to be disturbed or fascinated.  I hope someone else will report seeing these things at approximately the same time.<n>

I trained my binoculars on it and saw what I first thought were 2 airplane headlights because that’s how close they were together, slowly strobing, about 2 finger widths above the horizon, and maybe a mile off shore of Sanibel Island, around 4 miles distant.  But the color of the lights was wrong – they were a “crystalline” blue-white, about 50/50 blue and white.  There were no red or green navigation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it through my binocs as it hovered in one place for several minutes, when the light on the right started it started to “tilt” upwards.  It would have been like a plane coming straight at me (which I still thought it could be) making an extremely sharp bank to its right, which would have been toward the east, away from the Gulf.  But it remained in position, with the lights getting almost vertical to each other, but not quite.  After around 5 minutes of being in this position, it started coming toward me and to the NW.  When it got to the SW of me and became visible  to the naked eye, I pointed it out to the fishermen.  We then watched it as it headed toward the NNW, about 3 to 4 miles off shore and 45 degrees above the horizon.  It really started picking up speed when it got about in front of us over the gulf, and moved at least 2 or 3 times the speed of an aircraft, and then just went out of sight because it became so far away.   Weird.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> SIGHTING # 23 – August 9 , 2013 –   10th SIGHTING OF A “UGO” AND 8th SIGHTING OF MANY UFO “FIREBALLS”  This is a continuation of my other sightings on this night.  As I mentioned in my previous report (#22), I and 3 fishermen saw a dim Unidentified Glowing Object (UGO) at my “due west” location where I and others have seen it before.  The 2 other locations where this “city on the horizon” is consistently seen are northwest of my location, and very near the shoreline of Sanibel Island at Clam Bayou (no, it is not swamp gas).  I had asked the fishermen if they had seen any unusual lights before while shark fishing at this or any other location and they said no.  I told them that I had seen much and that I was making reports to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) and UFO Hunters, in addition to MUFON, and if they did see anything, to make a report to NUFORC or UFO Hunters because those were the easiest reporting forms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after I pointed out the UGO to the fishermen at 9:45 p.m., I saw another one of the amber/orange UFO “fireballs,” straight up the beach from us, just off shore of what I would guess to be Cayo Costa Island, to the NNW.  The UFO just “came on” about 3 finger widths above the horizon, slowly drifted for about 4 minutes to the west over the Gulf of Mexico, maybe 2 to 3 miles off shore, and then just dimmed off.  I and the fishermen were amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although the UGO remained relatively dim, this glow went on and off from when I first saw it and pointed it out to the fishermen, until I left at 11:00 p.m.  To my amazement, one of the fishermen made a report of it and more “fireballs” the next day (8/10/13) to UFO Hunters.  Unfortunately, their report was rather incomplete, as I found out the following Friday night when they were at the beach fishing again, and we could discuss what they saw in detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here’s what they saw for the following 3 hours after I left the beach at 11:00 p.m. that night.  They saw another orange-redish fireball come on the same location I pointed out the one seen earlier, and then a second right after.  These two objects went quickly west out to sea and then southerly to where they were just about straight in front of them, stopped, and changed direction, going back to where they started from, probably just off shore of Cayo Costa where all the activity was taking place previously.  Then they just went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A while later, they saw another of the redish-orange fireballs come on in front of them, and then another to the NW (right) of them.  These UFOs basically hovered in the same position, occasionally going on and off.  I asked them if they went on and off like on a dimmer switch and they said no – just on and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A while later, they were looking at the “city on the horizon” glow as they called it, when they got a strike on one of their shark rods furthest to their right.  They missed the hook set and came back to where they were sitting, “no more than 2 minutes later” they stressed, to be amazed that the UGO had moved some 40 degrees on the horizon to the south!  They were really excited about it when they were talking to me. We both guesstimated that the light had moved at least 25 miles, if not more.  Shortly after that the light went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From around midnight to 2 a.m., the guys said they saw the mostly red and orange-red fireballs at least 6 times, with up to 4 visible at one time.  The night I saw them again (8/16/13), nothing unusual was observed, which in and of itself seemed unusual.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> SIGHTING # 22 – August 9 , 2013 – EXTRAORDINARY SIGHTING OF SILVER-GOLD, GLOWING FOOTBALL SHAPED UFOS APPARENTLY COMING OUT OF THE GULF AND MERGING TOGETHER, AND 9TH SIGHTING OF A “UGO” I arrived at my regular skywatch location at 9:35 p.m. on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, USA, just north of the rock jetty at Blind Pass.  The beach here runs NNW to SSE.  The weather was clear and calm, with some clouds well past the horizon of the Gulf of Mexico.  Although this was my third and last sighting of the night, it was so exciting that I will report it first.  When I first arrived at my skywatch site, I saw the same UGO at the same “due west” location I and others had seen it at before.  I pointed out the UGO to some shark fishermen on the beach where I was, and they could see it too, even though it was somewhat dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other than the UGO, nothing else was happening so I walked up to the rock jetty about 150 yards to the south, to see what I would see down toward my friends house on Sanibel, where we had seem many UFOs and UGOs before.  I saw nothing down there, and after a while I had walked just about all the way back to the shark fishermen, when at around 10:30 I saw a yellowish light on the horizon with my naked eye, about a mile off shore of North Captiva.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the light through my binoculars and could clearly see two dull-silver/goldish, glowing, clearly defined, oblong-football shaped UFOs, one above the other, with the bottom one clearly visible right on the water’s surface, apparently having just come out of the water!!  The craft were not full football shaped, nor were they fully oblong.  Maybe more like an oblong with a bulge in the middle.  I think that my color description is a good one; it’s also the first color that come to mind.  I figured it was coming out of the water because when I first saw it, compared to the one above it, it was much smaller and “blob-like,” and then almost instantly got bigger and gained an identifiable shape.  It was the same shape, size and color of the one above it.  I feel comfortable estimating that it was no more than 4 miles away from me, and that the clearly defined craft were no more than 100 feet long, and perhaps 40 or 50 feet tall.  The surface of the craft was well defined! , and its skin gave them their glow and color.  There were no other lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very important here is what really struck me about the shape and color of these craft, was their possible resemblance to what my friend saw a couple of weeks earlier, not more than a half mile away from her house – see Sighting #17.  Her description of the craft could very well be better than mine simply because of the distance at which I saw it/them, and the closeness at which se saw them, at a half mile or less.  The bright white craft with “yellowish edging” that she described is very similar to my color interpretation of a a craft that was dull-silver and goldish.  This there is at least some reason that these two craft could be of the same class.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After no more than one minute, the craft below began to rise, while the one above remained stationary.  The craft were approximately 5 widths apart.  The craft ascended the 5 widths in about 15 seconds, appeared to become one with the craft above because it looked like there was a single craft but twice as wide, and then just merged with the one above!!  I figured that they merged because after it happened I could only see one well defined craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after 30 seconds or so, another craft just emerged from the Gulf and stayed on or very near the water’s surface for 15 or 20 seconds before it too ascended and merged with the craft above, which remained in place during the entire event.  Once this second craft merged with the one above, they just disappeared!!  I went and told the fishermen what I had just seen, and they were just as stunned as I was!  Wow!  I continued to look back and forth across the horizon of the Gulf, and no more than 5 minutes later I saw with my naked eye the same kind of oblong, whitish/yellow/gold light to the south of me, just off of the end of the rock jetty at Blind Pass, and maybe 3 or so miles to the SSW of me, perhaps a mile or so off of my friend house.  This is the first time I’d seen this colored light down there for quite some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just brought my binocs up and got it in focus to see that it was the same kind of “double craft” - one above the other – that I’d just seen to the north, when a car pulled into the parking lot at Turner’s Beach facing toward the southern Gulf, and “accidentally” shined it lights on it, and then it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now things get a more interesting.  When I started writing up this report it brought to mind my 4th sighting, during which I was able to get a photograph of 4 of the amber fireball lights, where I thought I saw only one.  As I wrote in that report, I thought that the object was very near the water because I could see what I thought was a reflection of it on the water.  But now that I think about it, in light of what I’d just watched to the north off of Cayo Costa, and what I had just seen, I now have to think that what saw back then was most likely what I’d just witnessed to the north!  It was not a reflection underneath of it, it was another craft coming out of the water!  Further rationale:  back during my 4th sighting, it took about a minute from the time when I decided to take a picture of the amber light, to when I dug my camera out of the bag and set it up to take a picture.  I know with certainty that there was only one light out there before I started taking photos (only 1 of 3 came out), so the only thing I can think of is that the 3 additional craft that came out in the photograph had just come out of the water!  Where else could they have come from?  If anyone would have suggested such a t thing to me back then, I would have thought that they were crazy!!  I do remember that I was sure glad I took the photos, because very shortly after I took the photos the lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something special really does seem to be going on out here, and I’m now beginning to think that it may have to do with one or more underwater “bases.”<n>

The first two were fairly close to each other, the third appeared a few seconds later.  The first two were very bright red, as bright as fire.  The last one was bright red/yellow.  All were circular in shape.  It was evening so the sun was below the tree line in the west.  It was still somewhat light out.  2100 hrs.  The way they appeared in the sky over the tree line almost looked like they took off from the ground.  They didn&#39;t appear to be moving real fast but when I looked at the amount of ground they covered they had to be moving fast.  They traveled south probably three minutes.  They then turned east, that&#39;s when the lights faded and they disappeared.  They all traveled in the same path, so couldn&#39;t be lanterns that people talk about.  They looked fairly close to us, guessing 5-8 miles, but when they turned you could see they were very far away.  I think the lights were so bright it made them! look closer than they really were.  They almost looked like UFO&#39;s that you see in a movie.  My wife and kids were actually scared.  I don&#39;t believe they were satellites because I&#39;ve seen them in the sky at dusk.  These were way lower and a thousand times brighter.  Guaranteed others saw them.  Very weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He pointed to a bright dot of light that was approximately at zenith and a magnitude brightness of about (-2).  The officer said that he was reported about the object about 15 minutes earlier.  The skies were clear blue, and the sun was bright, almost at zenith.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I set up the colleges 5 inch Celestron telescope with a 20mm objective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Under magnification, the object was indeed a disc with what appeared to be a set of “lights” in the 0-90 degree quadrant of the circle.  Another astronomy instructor, 2 more police officers and several students observed the object as it moved from zenith to the west.  It covered about 25 angular degrees in the span of about 15 minutes.  We took photographs of the object with cell phone cameras through the telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching the object, an officer saw another, similar object coming in from the east, at about the same magnitude brightness.  The object moved westward, until it was at zenith overhead and then continued west.  The time it took to travel from an altitude of about 80 degrees to zenith was about 10 minutes.  We observed this object under same magnification, and saw a silvery disc, with the same “lights” along the same quadrant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both objects left our view, passing westward.  The entire viewing time was about 1.5 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our working hypothesis is that we saw Mylar balloons, or weather balloons, with the sunlight reflecting off the “dimples” along the edge of the balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> End of report<n>

I first observed this object at 11 AM when I looked up into the trees.  The object that was visible to the naked eye seemed unnatural to me.  I called the attention to my adult daughter who agreed that we were not looking at something that was man-made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called 3 other people over to see this thing and they also had no explanation as to what this object was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also phoned my husband who, with several co-workers who work at the local college, went outside to see this &#34;UFO&#34;.  They had no explanation of its origins.  They even observed it through a high powered telescope and it still appeared to be shiny, circular, and reflective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went home and was unable to see it at 2:30 as there was now a cloud-cover in the area.  I will look again after the cloud-cover dissipates to see if it is still there.<n>

The main hull was near rounded on the underside with a “horse shoe” or “tongs” shape resembling a cloud like paint job which never changed in shape but low glow (could have been the sunlight).  The rest of the hull was blue like the sky and had it not moved would never have been seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Near perfect stealth, zero noise/sound.  Craft had no wings nor tail, that was observable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Travel was with purpose and not erratic, seeming to glide or slip through the air.

I am not crazy and at the time, I was totally within my senses.  I wasn’t drinking or doing drugs. I was totally alert and fully aware of my surroundings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was pet-sitting for a friend and at approximately 11:30 pm, I was outside in the yard while the dogs were going to the bathroom and doing their thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular night the sky was very clear.  The stars were so bright.  I started to gaze up – and just stood there looking at the stars for a couple of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s when I saw it.  At first, I thought it was a shooting star.  Because it shot across the sky—fast.  I thought I was lucky witnessing a shooting star, so I got excited and continued to watch with fascination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light I saw was very bright. Like a star.  It was high up in the sky too—just like a star.  Except this light moved fast—very fast.  The bright light then started to move upward.  Within a matter of seconds, (we are talking zero to five seconds later), this bright light ascended into the heavens and was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw scared me.  I didn’t get a warm fuzzy feeling about it either.  I was anxious and a little frightened.  I immediately went back inside.  For the rest of the night, I was on edge.  I even had trouble sleeping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends think I’m crazy whenever I mention this.  Honestly though, whatever it was—totally and completely scared me so much, that to this day, I do not gaze up at the stars anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe it was a re-fueling mission.  Maybe it was a satellite.  I don’t know. Whatever this light was, it traveled so fast that within a matter of seconds it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

It couldnt have been a plane because planes don&#39;t travel that direction where it was.  It was weird and strange but anything is possible. I know it was something i never seen before because im a skeptic and it made me want to video tape it.  Hipe ithers saw this too...

I was sitting on the roof of my jeep watching an area known for smuggling with a hand held thermal device.  I happened to look up and noticed a cylinder shaped object flying low in the sky.  The object had two solid lights and no running lights like an aircraft.  The sighting took place near abbots ford airport in bc Canada.  There were numerous aircraft flying in and out of the airport all with running and blinking lights on them.  This one had none.  I attempted to look at it with the thermal device and there was absolutely no heat source where the UFO was in the sky.  I then aimed it at the other aircraft in the area and they showed up on the device.  I them aimed the device back at the object and still no heat source could be seen on the thermal device.  The object slowly moved eastward and finally disappeared out of view.<n>

I believe the guest was Peter Davenport but I’m not certain.  He reported an object following the International Space Station.  I can report I indeed saw this object clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When Peter gave his report, I checked the location of the ISS using astroviewer.com.  It was over Australia, but I noted that it’s trajectory would take it over the region where I live, slightly to the North.  I live on Eastern Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada, roughly 49 N, 123.45 W.  I am on the outskirts of a small town on a three acre property in a relatively rural area, surrounded by ocean and trees.  There is only one street light in the area a few hundred meters away which it is hidden by trees.  Vancouver is over the horizon in the North East and obscures the stars near the horizon.  Other than that there is very low light pollution and no lights were visible other than from my home.  I could see the glow of the local spiral arm faintly but clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the graphic on astroviewer.com showed the space station approaching I went outside to watch the Western sky.  I have watched the ISS come over before.  Soon I saw it, eventually passing overhead at 10:48 p.m. PDT August 8, 2013, and slightly to the North, from West to East.  The ISS was bright white, far brighter than any star in the sky.  Trailing behind it was a distinctly reddish light.  At first my eyes drew a line between the two lights as if there was a cylinder joining them, but as it went higher in the sky I could see they were two distinct lights.  The trailing light was not as bright as the space station, several orders of magnitude less probably, but it was still as bright or brighter than the brightest star in the sky.  I held my arm out.  It trailed by about the width of the tip of my little finger held at arm’s length.  Both lights were very distinct, separate, and clear.  It was not an optical illusion or a result of blurred vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would presume it is a Soyuz or Dragon capsule.<n>

This flasher was only visible through binoculars, except for an occasional flash that was visible to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the second flasher at about 10:15.  It was very similar to the first, almost due north of me, again, low to the horizon.  It appeared to be a couple of miles off shore of North Captiva, around 5 miles north of me.  I watched this one for a couple of minutes as it traveled horizontally, slowly toward the west and open water, before it faded out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the third one a short while later, to the NW of me, directly above the second (and only) place where I and others have seen a UGO.  This one also drifted down toward the horizon for about 3 minutes before fading out of view.<n>

While we were waiting for the dog to do its thing, I noticed an odd glowing orb/circle in  the sky traveling north to south almost parallel to the coastline.  The object moved at a fast pace and was much closer than the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought at first this was a plane and patiently waited for it to pass overhead but instead it just stopped in the sky at about 75 degrees from my point of view  It flickered a lot and had an orange color but also some yellow to it. It pulsed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear something dropped from it but I&#39;m not certain.  I saw something fall but my daughter did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the stationary light it started to flicker abruptly then turned to the west and slowly started to fade away as if it was going up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was no plane. Fortunately my daughter was with me and witnessed this as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all lasted about 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept periodically going outside that evening looking for this light but it never returned.<n>

They were in a very loose trail formation and maneuvered very differently from conventional commercial or military aircraft.  The lighting on the objects was constant and non-flickering.  There were no conventional red or white anti-collision lights apparent on any of the objects.  There were no red, green, or white navigation lights evident on any of the objects.  This was in stark contrast to commercial passenger airliners approaching San Diego&#39;s Lindbergh Field for landing.  The lighting and flight paths of the objects were in stark contrast to the commercial airliners that appeared to fly under the formation of the objects.  Military helicopter flight operations at NAS North Island were also ongoing simultaneously and were in stark visual contrast to the objects.  The objects did not make any sounds or noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired Marine aviator with 4000 hours of flying experience.  What I witnessed last night was like nothing I had ever seen before.  There has been no reporting of any sightings, as I described, in any of the local San Diego media sources.  I can&#39;t imagine that no one else saw the same sight.  Close to where I was standing, four other people saw the objects and were commenting on the sighting.  I was able to take two photographs with my iPhone camera that clearly show multiple flying objects above the San Diego skyline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can this sighting be verified?<n>

ALWAYS a pleasure to hear you; hope to make your aquaintance someday at some conference or UFO event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ===========================  SPACE CHASE (Updated): On August 3rd, Japan launched a robotic spacecraft, the HTV-4, to re-supply the International Space Station (ISS). Last night, Larry Sloss saw the HTV-4 in hot pursuit of the ISS in the twilight skies over Priest Lake, Idaho:  &#34;The HTV-4 was trailing the ISS by just 3 seconds,&#34; says Sloss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many observers noted &#34;HTV-4 flares&#34; this week. Apparently sunlight is glinting off a flat surface of the spacecraft, briefly raising its luminosity to match that of the much larger ISS. Sloss saw one too: &#34;In the image, a brief, bright flare from the HTV-4 is slightly offset from the ISS trail.&#34;  HTV-4 has an interesting payload.  Among the 5.4 tons of food, spare parts, and other supplies are Kirobo, a talking robot to join the crew of the ISS, and Firestation, an experiment to study mysterious Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes.  Update:  The HTV-4 docked to the space station at 11:38 EDT on Friday, Aug. 9th.  Unloading has commenced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Turn your smartphone into a field-tested ISS tracker: Download the Simple Flybys App.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Two orbs witnessed by four adult family members including myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While my wife and I walked our son and daughter in-law to their vehicle in our driveway, I looked up to see what appeared to be the space station, travelling from West to East, slightly to the North.  It struck us as unusual,  that trailing behind the larger white orb was a smaller orange sphere.  The trailing orange sphere appeared almost tethered behind at a distance the width of a fist at arm’s length.  All saw the two objects and commented, “What the heck?”  I ran to the back deck and observed the two spheres through, Orion 9 x 63 binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have observed the space station over one hundred times and am quite familiar with its behavior.  Especially the change in brightness as it travels to the East and loses, “line of sight”, with the sun which changes its intensity of brightness as does its rotation.  The first object was a bright white appearing object twice the size of either Venus or Jupiter at their brightness and about 50% larger than my observation of the Space Station, although about the same color and luminosity.  The second orb which travelled directly behind the first was much smaller and orange, the size, color and brightness of Arcturus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to observe both spheres as the travelled through the sky at a similar speed to the space station until they both disappeared behind the tree line to the East.  Note, during the approximate ninety, (90), seconds observed through the binoculars the intensity and color of both orbs did not change, nor did the spacing.  In addition I looked for any kind of mass between the two orbs but saw none as the smaller orange orb followed directly behind and at the same angle as the leading larger white orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s it.<n>

We have a tent that has a screen ceiling so we can star gaze before going to sleep.  I awoke approximately 3:00AM  I was looking up when I opened my eyes I was looking at the tree capopy and tree line at the stars.  I noticed what i thought was a star it was alot larger than the other stars it was brighter too.  I thought it odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it began to move, very slowly along the tree line and I lost sight of it as it went into the thicker tree canopy.  It was a bright white ball of light it moved very slow it was very distrurbing; I was afraid.  I just lay there almost unable to believe what i just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never expierenced anything like that before.  I will never forget it.I wish i had grabbed my phone or woke someone up but it was such a quick incident.  Alas, it is whatever it is.I have never had any belief in UFOs or aliens prior to 2012, but after this incident and another my daughter and I had prior to this incident in Dec.2012, I have a much different opinion now.  We are not alone, there are others out there.  As unsetteling as that statement is, I know it is a fact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Heard on radio, the Japanese were sending up a supply ship with 20 tons of supplies day before yesterday.

But what caught my eye was that orange/red light not a streak.  It had been still for maybe 4-5 seconds and then it went out and then it appeared again but this time it was a bit higher.  I told brad and he seen it then but it had gone out again.  But this is the part where it weird.  From the point that it was lets say strait up &amp; down this light appeared 3 more times but in a east west direction the direction it went was east from it&#39;s original position.  Keep in mind that the fire was behind us and so we waled to the road. And again we seen it like 5 more time but it wasn&#39;t the same as before the color was it was only momentary and 5-10 minutes later it would do it again.  It almost looked like a firework like the mortars but instead it stayed in the same area no trails or such! like a model rocket engine in flight.  The single ones would be explainable but the first 5 were very odd indeed. I&#39;d say it was before Salina But could of been around Kanoplis and approx 1000 - 2000 feet high. And the first time i seen it when it moved from west to east i would guess it moved a few miles but that&#39;s hard to determine.  It was directly south of my house and a little to the west on the other singular appearance.  Also a few of you&#39;s will think how much was he drinking and the answer to that is none just water.

One witness said that he saw a structure or body attached behind each glowing circle.  All objects moved at about the same height in a west-southwest direction over northeast Seattle, but appeared to turn to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, the glowing red circles disapeared, but one person saw the barely visible structures.  In other words, the glowing orange/red circles almost appeared as huge headlights to an attached vehicle.  They appeared to be 1000-2000 ft. above the land, well below the height of most aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition, their movement didn&#39;t appear to be at a high rate of speed, made no noise and was smooth and even in movement.<n>

They stayed in perfect line and seemed to be perfectly spaced as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the lights disappeared at the same time after about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not believing what we had just witnessed, we went in to get my husband and son.  As we were describing what we had witnessed, they appeared again.  Same color, formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After witnessing the lights the second time, they did not reappear.  Directly after the disappearance, 2 jets flew over as if they were trying to catch up to the mysterious lights; and i say this as it is very unusual for jets to be flying at that time of night, especially in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, i did not have my camera on hand.<n>

It started as one light that did not flash, but would occasionally zoom in and out in brightness.  As it slowly progressed across the sky rising above the tree line, a second light followed behind doing the same.  The lights were both white. As it got a little higher a third light took up the rear.  This light was a bright red light and the three together held a perfectly formed triangle shape.  We watched it float through the sky without altering its formation at all.  It was hard to tell how high up it was, but it was definitely a very large craft.  We watched it for about a minute and a half before it floated behind a building.<n>

It was still light out since its Alaska.  I was trying to text my teenager and everytime I would text the message it would start deleting itself.  I heard this unusual silence outside the front propped open door of my office and then my 9 year old came in loudly saying &#34;MOMMY I THINK I SAW AN ALIEN&#34; I was startled and spooked because I thought there must be a dog in the yard that looked scary or maybe even a bear.  She was so scared that she ran over to me and the baby followed her and she was crying &#34;MOMMY IM AFRAID!&#34;  She put her back to me so I could protect her.  I put my phone down yelled for my husband in the shop who didn&#39;t hear me and walked out the front door to see what she may have seen.  She said, &#34;NO MOMMY, IT WAS IN THE SKY&#34;  Then my 2 year old said loudly &#34;MOMMY THAT AIRPLANE WAS SCARY.&#34;  I started to ask her what it was that she saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said that it was a diamond.  But it changed shape like it was being squished. The surface was like boiling water and sometimes one side would be like diamonds and another would be black.  Then it disappeared and reappeared in the same area in the sky all the while racing around between 10 o&#39;clock and 2 o&#39;clock.  She would not stop telling me everyday for 2 weeks that she couldn&#39;t get it out of her head and when we would go to the shop she would be very afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 3rd child was laughing at her because she said she was sitting in the car and she saw the 9 yr old witness&#39;s face scowl in fear while looking up.  However the older 3rd child in the car did not see it.  Only the 9 year old and the 2 yr old.  Weird thing is it was near the Fairbanks Airport so I can&#39;t imagine why a ufo would be hanging out around there.  I believe her based on her behavior and personality.<n>

On August 7, 2013 around 9:00 p.m., my friend and I saw a green orb-like fireball that was glowing and looked spherical. It headed east behind the trees.  It was very cloudy around this time of night and the object was clearly visible below the clouds.  The object appeared bigger than a star and did not look like any airplane, helicopter, or anything ordinary.  At first, we didn’t really think much of it and continued towards our friend’s house heading east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, around 9:10 p.m., I happened to glance west to see the same green orb-like fireball motionless in the sky.  It slowly descended down by slightly swaying left once, then right once, then straight down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We immediately tried to pursue the object on our skateboards, but did not see the object again for the rest of the night.  I spoke with Mr. Davenport later that evening.<n>

We saw it for a split second and then it disappeared.  About 30 min after the sighting we saw about 3 coast guard helicopters combing the beach area.

8/7/13 20:33|West Palm Beach|FL|Triangle|3 minutes|At approx. 20:30 hrs EST I watched a comm. aircraft transition (witnessed standard aircraft lights) from N to S just E of Fl coast.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100890.html|715|ndxe201308| At approx. 20:30 hrs EST I watched a commercial aircraft transition (witnessed standard aircraft lights) from north to south just east of the Florida coast, at what appeared to be approx. 7,000 feet.  I was curious about that aircraft for two reasons 1.  I am a private pilot and generally enjoy seeing aircraft flying over and 2. I had watched my daughter and son-in-law arrive along the same track two nights ago while they were returning on a flight from Philadelphia to Miami (I had been watching their progress via the internet flight tracking software.  I looked up a couple of minutes after that aircraft passed to the south and saw another light in the sky at about the same altitude and location.  This light was white in color and looked like a landing light.  It almost looked like a satellite but without the speed one would normally see.   Within a couple of seconds I noticed a green light behind the white light (to the left of the light, or North).  A seco! nd later there was a sudden bright intensity that looked like a rocket separating from its booster, a bright center with the shape of a brilliant triangle with the original light at the tip pointing out towards the east.  The light shape lasted only a couple of seconds and then disappeared.  I lost sight of the light for a second or two and when I next located the same position in the sky there appeared to be two green lights separated by about ¼” at arms length.  The green lights remained separated by a fixed distance while the lights appeared to move towards the east.  Living in Florida for the past 40 years I’ve seen my share of rocket launches, this was in the wrong location for a rocket coming out of Cape Canaveral.  The shape and color of the contrail looked just like a rocket separation.  My best guess was a missile that was dropped from a launch plane, engine ignited and flamed out after a few seconds.  Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a private pilot and retired Deputy fire chief.  I am an avid aviation enthusiast and monitor launch schedules from the Cape and satellite sighting via iPhone software.  This was the most unusual sighting I have seen, mostly because of the location being so close to West Palm Beach and the commercial airways to and from Ft. Lauderdale and Miami<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A launch of a Delta IV rocket from Cape Canaveral occurred at 20:29 hrs. on this date.  PD))<n>

I live in Sanford, Florida, and as the crow flies about 40 miles from The Cape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a good view of any rocket launch and have viewed multiple shuttle launches right from my yard.  I was not happy that I had missed a launch--which later this evening I did confirm was a Delta IV rocket.  This time of year, 8:30 in the evening is still daylight and hot!<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking at the curly contrail, I noticed a VERY bright round light to the left of the contrail.  It was not moving.  It was not an airplane or helicopter.  I am in the path of the airplanes coming and going from Sanford Airport. – so believe me, I know what an airplane looks like.  No stars were out yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was focusing on the bright round light, a line of smaller white lights appeared to the right of the large rou! nd light. It happened so quickly.  I am not sure if there were 4 or 6 round lights and I could not determine if the lights were parallel to the large white light horizontally or vertically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a brief moment, it seemed like I was looking at the lights through a sheer white curtain and what appeared to be an outline was visible which made me think that the smaller lights were actually part of a triangle shaped object.  It was brief and the thought or shape was no longer there but the lights remained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching the lights, I called my friend and neighbor to come outside to look too.  As it turned out, she was in her car driving to the grocery store about 3 miles away.  She was watching the white contrails and also saw the large white light but she could not see any more than 2 of the smaller lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed on the phone with each other for about 5 minutes watching the lights and the contrail.  Oddly enough, above the contrail was a very strange cloud that appeared to be brightly illuminated as if there were lights inside or above where we could not see.  There were very few other clouds in the sky and none of them had the brilliance of this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For all of this time, the large round light never moved nor did the line of smaller lights.  There were small planes off in the distance with their lights clearly visible.  As the white contrail began to disperse, a few of the smaller lights disappeared.  The bright cloud was still very bright.  The last 3 lights remaining were the large round white light and two of the smaller lights to the right of that large light.  Then all 3 lights just faded out.  The contrails faded and the very bright “cloud” was the last to disperse after I would say about 10 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  There was a rocket launch out of Cape Canaveral at 20:29 hrs. on this date.

South Florida|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100918.html|720|ndxe201308| Strange cloud and small formation.   South Florida<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first notice an anomaly in the night sky.  The sun had set on the western Horizon but it appeared as if there were a bright blue sky cut out of the darkened night sky.  The shape itself would mimic a large cloud.  Oddly you could see stars next to the blue hole in the sky.  I ran inside to grab my fiance and two other friends to come and see.  They were amazed for a few moments and then shook it off and started joking about my love for science and UFO&#39;s.  I was not expecting a UFO sighting, I just thought it was something cool for every one to see.  It is not the first sky anomaly I have witnessed here in South Fl.  The &#34;cloud shaped blue hole&#34; was slowly closing and turning a darker and darker blue.   As it did, I couldn&#39;t help but stare at it.  A bright light then appeared out the center of the darkening blue hole.  As it did (the only way I could describe it:  the ripple in a glass of water when touched or disturbed.)a ripple appeared (so fain! t to the eye I almost couldn&#39;t see it.)As the bright light got smaller, I could see two smaller lights moving with the larger light.  They started to flash simultaneously.  It lasted only a few seconds.  The main object seemed to grow in size and became bright enough to engulf the two smaller flashing lights.  And like turning off an old school television the light became small and just disappeared.  The blue cloud had become very small and was a very dark blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/7/13 20:00|Reunion|FL|Light|5-7 minutes|Big bright light and four small lights|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100896.html|721|ndxe201308| Big bright light and four small lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting on the balcony and I looked to the east and say what I thought was a low flying plane or helicopter coming towards us with its landing light on.  The object then turned and beganto fly parallel to us for a minute or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it turned upwards 45 degrees and as it rose it released four little lighted objects that were minuscule compared to the large object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The large object began to fly straight up as the little four objects alternated blinking different colored lights.  The large object then came back down and te small lights followed it away from us.  There was a bright slow flash and it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this process there was no sound but there was a squiggly smoke trail that&#39;s started a few hundred feet from the ground and continued until about 2k ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About ten minutes afterward two planes that were moving quite fast flew side by side towards where the objects were.  These planes made no sound a well and were low enough to here we should of! heard something??<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a video of nearly the entire thing.<n>
8/7/13 20:00|West Palm Beach|FL|Sphere|5 minutes|Orange glowing orb releasing blue smoke in all directions .|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100904.html|722|ndxe201308| Orange glowing orb releasing blue smoke in all directions .<n> <n><n> <n><n> To start out I live near the west palm beach airport.  Airplanes fly over our street probably 50 times a day and are generally pretty low to the ground before the gain altitude. Last evening I sat outside with my husband and neighbor while the sun was almost all the way set.  There was no particularly beautiful or colorful sunset.  In fact the clouds looked more of a muddy grey.  A plane took off and was probably right above the inlet when we noticed a bright orange, spherical orb glowing probably 20 ft. From the aircraft. At first glance we thought it was another plane, but logic kicked in and I quickly realized that there was no way two planes could fly so close to each other especially at such a low elevation.  We watched for a few seconds longer and the orb seemed to keep pace with the plane.  Then suddenly it begin to expand and the color turned it to a bright white blue color, and smoke spewed from all directions.  At this point the plane had gai! ned elevation and began to Veer off north over the Atlantic.  The small ord continued on its path at a low elevation until it disaperaed from our view.  Another odd thing is it left a NEON blue colored cloud hanging in the darkened  Sky.   We watched in amazement until it evaporated completely and snap a few photos of the cloud it left behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I went inside I hopped online a search for simular discriptions and the closest explanation I could find was &#34;Ball Lightning&#34;  almost everything matches up except for the fact that there was no stormy weather and it did not fall out of the sky.  And it also leaves me questioning the mysterious glowing blue cloud it left behind.<n>
8/7/13 20:00|Boca Raton|FL|Cigar|5 minutes|I saw the objects for minutes, local 911 calls are being withheld, local a.m. radio is reporting accurately.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100921.html|723|ndxe201308| I saw the objects for minutes, local 911 calls are being withheld, local a.m. radio is reporting accurately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a local and reputable attorney in my area, Palm Beach County, Florida. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this. I was walking out of my car to enter my condo.  I looked up and saw a huge light in the sky.  It was hard to not notice.  It was moving horizontal, from North to South along the coast line.  The cigar shaped object was followed by 2 small objects.  The lead, cigar shaped object projected a huge cone shaped light from it&#39;s front side, bright like a spotlight.  The two smaller objects followed.  The lead object would lead bright, luminescing cloud like plumes that could not be mistaken for all of the naturally occuring clouds in the skyline.   The objects moved slowly, hovered, moved forward, and turned from south to east over the ocean and disappeared.  Once the object turned east to the ocean, the huge light it emitted disappeared and the objects faded off.  The object was high in the sky, and could not be mistaken for any plane.  I saw planes that! night, and they were much smaller, much, much smaller and the planes moved in a much more predictable manner.   I am upset with the local news reports, stating it was from a airforce rocket that was launched.  A rocket only moves upwards and quickly. The rocket was launched 30 minutes before my sighting.  Local radio, 850 AM radio, played the actual, verbal launch transmissions, clearly ruling out the rocket.  Further, the many 911 calls are being withheld from public request, which is unusual and against the freedom of information act.  I did not take a camera phone picture because the objects were too far away, but the footage from the local newspaper is fairly accurate, but not as clear as I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/broward/fort-lauderdale/fl-ufo-sighting-20130808,0,4711750.story<n>

We noticed after the sun went down, three distance bright orange oblong shapes in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was very distant, miles away, over the mountain coast past Malibu, looking northwest.  These blips slowly moved individually at approximately 45 degrees, as if they were moving away from us possibly and across the sky, but not in formation.  One moved towards the earth and two slowly up and away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We assumed because of the slightly orange sunset sky, that they were orange because of reflecting the sunset, so they could have been silver or reflective in some way.   Nearer to us, Planes were taking off from Lax, moving east to west across the sky lifting off, and they were consistently silhouetted against the orange sky, without their lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So to us, whatever was in the distance was very orange (reflective possibly).  As they began to become less visible, assuming distance, one object suddenly appeared as a very brilliant light for about 3 to 5 seconds and disappeared.<n>

Then the second fireball came from west to east following the first, slightly slowed, and then proceeded.  The sky was clear w a few transparent clouds that the fireballs disapeared through and were out of site.<n>

It had bright white and blue light and occasionally flashed red lights.  It disappeared and reappeared in different spots and at one point appeared as if it was following my vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped and opened one of the truck windows and could hear an almost musical engine sound.  The object was smaller and more agile than a plane but bigger than my truck.  The whole thing lasted maybe 20 minutes.<n>

Seemed to be shooting diaganolly into the air with a jet stream behind it.  The fireball coming from the object seemed to intensify then lighten.  It seemed to stop and hover then come closer towards us very fast then seemed to have dropped something with two glowing white lights that just kept falling and then disappeared.  The fireball object then slowly moved further away into the clouds until it was out of sight.  Then out of nowhere a very bright white cloud appeared that seemed to have a glow about it.  This was at night all the other clouds in the sky are dark and not very visible.<n>

Second sighting in a couple days<n> <n><n> <n><n> So the other night I saw this exact same thing fly overhead while leaving to give a friend a ride home, and I saw it again tonight while out having a smoke.  Except it seemed to float more than fly...  I just saw it again tonight heading somewhat the same direction. NE, from Everett, WA.  It&#39;s super bright like a star almost, but it&#39;s moving.  I actually snapped a couple picts before it floated away.  The video I tried to take didn&#39;t come out. I&#39;m not crazy and I witnessed an airplane a minute after seeing this.  Airplanes lights blink or are green and red, and they usually make noise and the plane was flying a lot faster not merely floating along.  This thing seemed weird and out of place, and I can&#39;t believe I saw it again tonight.  Wtf is goin on up there?  The pict of the light I took seems transparent almost.  Approx 1000 feet up.  Flew SW to NE towards Lake Stevens.  Orb of bright white light.  Clear night sky.  I have 3  picts I can text.<n>

8/7/13 02:00|Lassen National Forest|CA|Unknown|>1 hour|Chased in our car by many lights.|2/14/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107006.html|736|ndxe201308| chased in our car by many lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> August 7, 2013<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter (age 23) and I were moving to Reno, NV.  We had driven from Seattle, down I-5, then took CA 89, then CA 139 towards Susanville, Ca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 2 in the morning.  The road we were on was a two lane, winding this way and that, curving, going up and down in the mountains, speed limit 55.  On each side of the road, there was the area that is cleared out of brush and trees.  Up ahead of us I would catch the lights of what looked like the flashing lights of a slow moving semi truck.  It was a ways ahead of us and we would see it, then it would disappear as the road wound a certain way, or trees  got in the way, then reappear again a few minutes later.  We really were not paying much attention to it.  It was a pretty night and a quiet road with very little traffic.  We had a deadline to meet in Reno, NV., and were not about to stop to sleep.  As I always seem to do while driving dark roads, I was picking out places and signs along the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were slowly catching up to the flashing lights of the slow moving semi.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were several curves away from those lights and I was wondering why the semi was going so slow, the road was neither steep nor dangerous.  We went around a couple more curves and suddenly was behind those lights.  It was not a semi truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In each of the two lanes of traffic there was a triangle of three orange lights.  Each triangle of lights was higher than my car.  Going into the ditch and area cleared of trees and brush on each side of the road, was two lights in a row, and flashing red, like emergency flashers on any vehicle.  So it was, two flashing lights in a horizontal row on the right side ditch, a triangle of three lights in my lane of the road, a triangle of three lights in the left lane of the road, and two flashing lights in a row over the ditch on the left.   Above the triangles of lights, was the distinct outline of a bridge, some kind of an overpass.  In a straight line above each of the triangles of lights there were two more lights in a horizontal row, equaling four more lights, a white-ish color. These lights were above the top of the outline of the bridge, a good ten feet higher.  Then there were three more white-ish lights in a horizontal row over the very top.  This thing was huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we came around that last curve and saw this thing, I immediately pulled over to the side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then, this thing suddenly began moving towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fear hit, I did a u-turn and made the car move.  I speed up to almost 80, that thing was staying right behind us.  I started seeing the places go by that I had mentally picked out earlier, and prayed that we didn&#39;t hit any animal.  About 10 miles down the road, I saw another vehicle coming towards us.  We didn&#39;t slow down, went flying by him.  I looked in my rear view to see what was happening.  Those lights lifted up off the highway, the truck went underneath the lights, then the lights came back down onto the road.  We were back on I-5 when we realized we couldn&#39;t see the lights anymore, but it took several more miles before the fear began to subside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dauhters dog was with us in the car, and not once did he bark or growl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went on to Hallelujah junction, slept maybe an hour, then continued on to Reno, arriving late afternoon on Aug.8th.   We found the place where we were headed to, right next to BLM land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somewhere around 2 or 3 am, I am slowly waking up, I was in a conversation with someone.  I remember being asked something about my body, and I said to go ask a scientist.  I was asked why I didn&#39;t know the answer, and said there was no excitement for me in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I am now fully awake, I am hearing this voice ask me questions in my head, telepathically.  I turned my head to look out the window, but the shade was down, and remember very clearly the sound of the voice, a bit mechanical, tingy, ask me one more question...”Why are you so afraid of us?”  Right then my daughter&#39;s dog began growling and barking and acting like it was chasing something around the living room through the kitchen and back towards the bedrooms.  For the next three nights in a row, at the same time, her dog would do those same actions.  This dog rarely seems to bark at anyone.  Yet for those four nights he would not settle down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 55,  female.  Daughter is 23.  Neither one of us had ever experienced a UFO sighting before this.<n>

The light appeared low in the sky.  Next it began to pulsate a few smaller red lights in a downward direction that trailed the larger one.  As I approached, it began trailing small green lights below the larger red and smaller red lights in the shape of a comma.  I watched it in amazement and asked the other three people in the car if they saw what I was seeing.  All confirmed. Suddenly it &#34;turned&#34; and reversed the color sequence.  It was not a plane or helicopter.  It did not move position in the sky.  I passed it and took the Tramway exit then headed north on Tramway.  I looked to the west while driving on Tramway and could see it at a distance of 2 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I don&#39;t remember seeing any blinking lights.  It looked approximately 3-4 feet in length and 3 feet wide.  It was doing loops in the sky; sort of falling for a bit and looping back upward.  I thought it was maybe a remote controlled device but there were no sounds of a motor.  It was completely quiet.  It looked like it was coming towards me (or the house or the pool lights!) so I dropped the hose and ran inside to get my son.

In the northwest sky, I saw a yellow-orange fireball (bright, spherical) traveling northwards. It was silent, and brighter than a planet.  (I have some amateur astronomy experience and am familiar with the luminosity of stars and planets).  While it moved in a single direction, its speed was inconsistent and at one point it seemed to either slow down or turn away from me.  I watched it continuously, having enough time to describe it to the person on the phone.  I got the sense that it was not in the upper atmosphere but at the level where airplanes fly.  Finally, it disappeared behind some trees.<n>

I had finished playing a song, picked up my cigarette, and looked up at the first brightest star that caught my eye (the star I have since identified as Vega).  As I was looking at it, something caught my eye underneath it, and I averted my gaze.  The moving object was as bright as Vega, but had to have appeared out of nowhere seeing as how it would have otherwise caught my eyes first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance I thought it was a satellite (It could not have been a plane because I can identify when something is or not).  As I was watching the object move, it quickly flashed white and immediately after started to glow a yellow-orange color, but the glowing grew in size.  Now if you take a nickel between your thumb and forefinger and extend your arm, that is how big the object appeared to be glowing.  It continued on like this for about six to eight seconds before returning to its previous state.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the object had returned to its normal size and shape, another moving object appeared almost in the same place as the first, but was not as bright.  This one followed the same path as the first object.  Now the distance between the two, I measured with my pinky finger and my thumb on my left hand.  The degree (relative to my hand and extended arm) was a little over 90 degrees.  The second object did not flash or glow or even grow in size, but six seconds after the second, appeared the third object.  This one was around 1.5 to 2 inches (using tip of thumb to first thumb knuckle to measure) behind the second object.  They all appeared to be following each other and they all originated from the same vicinity, roughly 2.5 inches underneath Vega.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After all three objects disappeared out of sight, I told my wife to look up the UFO hotline number and I called and left my message.  Definitely a strange experience, and one of many I’ll never forget.<n>

There appeared to be a 3-dimensional X-shaped body, in shadow, with the light at its center, but it was dark.<n>

We both spotted a light traveling almost overhead going from the South directly North.  This object was very high, but moved faster than any satellite we have seen.  As we have seen the ISS before, this light was not nearly as bright as we remembered.  As this light got almost overhead of us, it emitted an extremely bright blue/white light which lasted about a second...shorter than a camera flash.  It almost seemed like a short beam.  After the bright light we could still see the object continuing on to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 seconds it faded out or just disappeared. Just after it disappeared we spotted the ISS traveling in the direction previously mentioned.  It was much brighter than the other light.  There was also a plane which had taken off from SLC International Airport, southbound, which was gaining altitude.  But the light moving ! S-N was much much higher.<n>

I observed them flying slowly heading North East for a few seconds then they appeared to stop and hover for about 20 seconds.  I thne noticed that my cell phone was not in my pocket so I ran back inside to get it and also called for my son. I never told him what I had just saw.  He ran outside with me.  They then in synchronicity continued traveling North West and on eof them abrupty started flying upward at a much higher rate of speed.  I then asked my son to desribe what he is seeing and he told me &#34;two dark orange glowing things flying in the sky.&#34;  The first object then flew upward and an extremely high rate of speed until it was not viewable then the second object did the same.  I didn&#39;t notice any sound from either object.  By the time I got the video camera on my cell phone to work they were gone.<n>

The reports are well written, and the witness seems sincere, although we would be surprised if all of the sightings are about authentic UFOs, i.e. alien spacecraft.  We cannot be certain, however.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> SIGHTING #20 – August 6, 2013  5th SIGHTING OF A “FLASHER” I arrived at my regular skywatch location at 9:35 p.m. on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, USA, just north of the rock jetty at Blind Pass, and had not seen anything other that airplanes and a satellite, when at 10:30 p.m. I saw a very brief white and bright strobe flash with my naked eyes.  It was just a little bit south of due west, and low to the horizon – maybe 20 degrees above it.  Based on previous sightings, I quickly trained my 10X42 binoculars on that area and saw what I’ve come to call “Flashers.”  What made this one different from many others I’ve now seen in the area, is that it was a single strobe, flashing quite irregularly, with 5 or 6 flashes in a row very quickly, and then just one or 2 flashes per second.  Light intensity ranged between an occasional very bright flash, to mostly observable only through binoculars.  The quality and crispness of these strobes is quite different than an airplane strobe.  It stayed in the same location for a good 3 minutes as it drifted down toward the horizon of the Gulf of Mexico before disappearing. Fascinating was the fact that it was pretty much in the same spot that I and others have seen a “UGO” – unidentified glowing object just over the horizon of the Gulf of Mexico.  I had the feeling that it was somehow associated with this glow, as well as the slow moving and hovering “fireballs,” in addition to the UFO that landed near my friends house on Sanibel Island (see Sighting # 8).<n>

There have been instances of multiple witnesses at our home.  Last evening I was at the home while my wife was at work, across the valley, and we were tracking two of these..apparently one was following the course we always see it take, and the one she was tracking was apparently a few minutes ahead of it, same course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object is brighter than any star or planet visible in the sky at the time of it&#39;s appearance, moves rather slowly (sometimes stopping), appears to witnesses to be roughly 200-300 feet above ground level (though this is a really rough estimate), has appeared alongside a full moon and was quite a bit brighter, if the elevation estimate is accurate the object is likely at most 100 feet in diameter, no solid object is seen (just the light).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly, we took a trip to Missoula over the past weekend, and tracked what appeared to be the SAME object.  This time, we were travelling along I-90 heading East.  Time was 2100 PST (2200 MST) roughly, object appeared to the South/Southwest as we passed Haugan, crossed over the road right as we passed McGee Creek area (referencing Google Maps), and we lost site of it over a ridge as we neared DeBorgia.  A few miles down the road there are fire watch towers on some of the ridges and they have rotating strobes...the object was clearly brighter, and passed directly over the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One night, my wife and I decided to take a stroll on the beach.  As we were heading back to the beach access point, I noticed an orange glow in the sky.  I stopped to take a good look at it.  I can best describe it as a very dimly lit bonfire in the sky.  I did not hear sound (other than the crashing waves) and it did not move. Before I could mention it to my wife, it faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later, there it was again, only this time, a little farther away from the first location.  This time my wife also witnessed it.  Two minutes later, faded away.  Again, within a minute it had reappeared in a third location.  As before, it slowly faded away after about 2 minutes. We stood and watched for it again, but it never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sadly, I had no camera or cell phone with me. We could easily rule out fireworks, flares, Chinese lanterns or aircraft.  It was well above the water line to be a ship&#39;s lights. The best we could explain it was a dim fire just floating in the sky.  No noise, no movement other than appearing and disappearing in 3 different locations.<n>

We drove directly underneath it, with no effects to our vehicle.  We were able to see above and around the object so it was not in space, it was maybe 50 feet above our vehicle.

There was a layer of clouds coming in off of the ocean and I only saw it for a moment as it passed through a gap in the cloud cover.  It appeared to be made of a dark material and had a dim pulsing red light beneath it.  At first I thought it was a helicopter but the lack of sound and rotor caught my full attention.  It had an oblong shape to it, sort of like a football.<n>

But as we got just about 2 miles from zumbrota it got brighter an the other person with me pointed it out an asked what it was.  I laughed saying oh it&#39;s going to disappear probably ball Ignoring telling them of what that was while we drove past a pretty good sized hill for a moment and when we could see that portion on the sky again it really was gone in 10 seconds this huge flickering red orange light disappears in thin air I still thing ball lighting but I read there&#39;s a lot strange things that are happening with these kinda of lights so I thought I&#39;d share<n>

She ran  into her house to get her husband and by the time he came outside it just vanished.  Not into the horizon mind you.  It just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just at that same moment my brother-in-law noticed two more coming from the South West heading North East.  Now my brother-in-law was a skeptic before this event.  For it was he ship spotted the other two coming.  All three flew over our back yards and there was no sound of any propulsion system.  Just dead silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the last two passed we estimated that they were flying at helicopter height, but were five times the size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the last one passed over head we realized that there was what looked like a beam shining out of the center and that it was rotating around circumference the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch them travel North East until they just disappeared.

Me majoring in Aerospace Engineering knew that this was not a plane,not believing my eyes i ran down the street to ask the 3 gentleman that casually stood out in front of their home if they see what i am seeing and they laughed and told me they thought it was just them seeing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we spoke i took pictures of the object as it flew at high speed in a big curve as if about to land.  Then it breaks apart into 3 more little craft not as big but even brighter than the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stared in disbelief the crafts flew over the local Elementary School and all of their lights begin to dim like candles then we couldn&#39;t see them anymore due to this was at night.  Then one of the three neighbors pointed up at where the crafts previously were and we noticed this strange cloud left behind that stood out from any cloud we&#39;ve ever seen.  This cloud was glowing blue and the glow made it standout in the darkness.  This went on for about five minutes as the cloud slowly disappears leaving no evidence of this event happening.<n>

It was a cloudless day and sunny.  I was just getting on the 105 freeway going east still in the city of Los Angeles.  At that time of day the traffic is very slow so I was driving under 5 miles an hour, creeping slowly and had just about reached the crest of the fly-over when I looked up into the southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was several Mylar balloons flying extremely high in the sky.  Then the reflective orbs started appearing and reappearing randomly.  There were maybe six or eight and they would form a line, a v shape and fly back and forth vertically and horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then that I realized that balloons can&#39;t make formations or fly in a straight line back and forth or disappear and reappear.  I knew I was witnessing UFOs and was thrilled.  I looked around at other cars beside me and no one seemed to be seeing what I was seeing. It lasted perhaps thirty seconds.<n>

It was white and seemed to be stationary.  This caught my attention because I saw something similar the morning the day previous just outside my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I exited onto Business 22 towards Monroeville I continued to pay attention to it.  I had stopped at a few lights on my way to the gas station and while I was waiting I used lamp posts as reference points to determine that the object was indeed still.  I also tried to use the opportunity to take a picture, but the image didn’t come out because of all the street lights.  It was a cloudy night out and no stars were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached the gas station I noticed that it started to dim a little.  Then as I pulled into the parking spot the object became brighter again.  I attributed this to possibly some clouds covering it briefly. Once I parked it was behind the awning of the station and some trees.  It was not in view then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside of the building, bought a few things, got in my car, pulled out and when it should have been in view again it wasn’t there.  The object looked like it could have been over the Plum, Murrysville area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is Artist and small business owner. I am also an avid sky watcher and can identify common commercial aircraft.  This was neither plane nor helicopter.<n>

I was gazing at the stars as I was relaxing in my pool when I noticed two stars that appeared to be moving!!!  Yes, they were moving, flying side by side at the same exact speed.  I watched them until they flew out of my sight.  No fancy lights, just faint looking stars.  They were flying easterly because I was facing north.  I want to know if anybody else seen this.  I am a little scared because I know what I saw was real.<n>

It then flew to the left but then I lost sight of it behind the house.  I was so amazed I called out my boyfriend and then we looked for another one, and not far from the first one I saw another what looked like a moving star.  This one disapeared into the distance.  They both started movement slowly then looked like they moved off quite fast.  There were no flashing lights.  They were only as I could decribe as moving bright yellow stars.<n>

As I watched it I noticed it was moving in a north north easterly direction. It was a bright white and moved pretty rapidly, crossing to the east of my house and out of site within 2 or 3 minutes.  It seemed to have a dull red glow at the back end and kind of looked like it was moving side to side a little as it was moving.  I didn’t see any flashing lights at all and didn’t notice any sound, but the neighbors central air was running so if it was quiet I wouldn’t have heard it.<n>

During our conversation we were going back and forth and my daughter happened to look directly up into the night sky and said ,” look Mom there is one of those weird lights I’ve seen before”  I looked up attempting to see what she had seen and didn’t see it she again ,” it’s right there!”<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point she grabbed my head and tilted it to where she was looking, and that is when I saw it. I was a ball of light very very high in the sky moving extremely fast.  I started to say that is was just a plane although is had no red or blue lights and was moving faster than any plane /jet I had seen, when the object looked like it expanded as the light ball grew and then contracted back to its original size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were discussing that affect and what it could be we watched as it just disappeared in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were still looking up amazed at what we had saw we saw a second object do the exact same  thing however it came from what would have been the object right side flared and then contracted continued steadily and then just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what we saw but I know I have never seen THAT before, hence our report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks in advance for your time and attention in this matter.<n>

The last time they showed up there was 4 of them. first one appeared, then second and so on and then faded out after a few seconds in the same order they appeared in.

Then I realised it was too close and too big to be a star.  I also noticed it was actually moving, although I had to watch it for several seconds to be sure, because it was moving directly away from me towards the east/very slightly northwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Excited and intrigued, I ran into the house and called my wife, because I wanted a second person to see that it was definitely not a plane or a helicopter.  No other lights. Just shining white light, moving quite slowly. Not pulsing or flashing, just constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually my wife came out into the garden, but a little too late. I saw the light moving away and dropping behind the tree line way into the distance and tried to point it out to her, but she couldn’t locate it and finally it disappeared completely behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was about10.25pm. I had watched it for about a minute or so before calling to her. Since I realised it was moving slowly, I hoped to have had time to get her before it had gone. I estimate, quite accurately, that from the time I first noticed it, until it went out of view, was about 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS passed to the south of Cardigan, Wales, at 22:15 hrs.

They seemed randomly timed and spaced, but in the same general area.  As I was observing this phenomenon, I noticed a dimly lit orange object approaching from extremely high speed from the north, flying directly south.  It was approximately 20,000 feet in altitude and moving approximately four or five times the speed of &#34;normal&#34; jet.  I would estimate it&#39;s length to be 500 feet.  It was huge. It travelled from horizon to horizon in about eight seconds, and appeared to curve towards the east as it left.  It was shaped like a four leaf clover. with the two outside &#34;leaves&#34; approximately twice as big as the front and back leaves.  The front and back leaves were more elongated, the outside more round.  The object had a faint orange glow with dimmer half circle areas on the outside leaves.  It made absolutely no sound.   Two jets flew over in the same path in formation at the same altitude approximately five minutes later.  I could distinctly hear them, and I also noted that they seemed extremely slow and small compared with the orange object.  I noticed much more air traffic than normal in the area for about an hour after the event.<n>

The reports are well written, and the witness seems sincere, although we would be surprised if all of the sightings are about authentic UFOs, i.e. alien spacecraft.  We cannot be certain, however.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> SIGHTING #19 – August 5, 2013 7th SIGHTING OF AMBER-ORANGE UFOS (FIREBALLS) I was at my regular skywatch location on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, USA, next to the rock jetty at Blind Pass.  The weather was partly cloudy, no wind, with visibility nearly unlimited where the sky was clear of clouds.  There were several jets, common at this time of the evening, coming in from the northwest toward the Ft. Myers International Airport  At 9:46 p.m. I saw what I at first thought was the bright headlight of an oncoming airplane just inside of a cloud, due west of me, approximately 55 degrees over the horizon of the Gulf of Mexico.  The light was bright enough, about the size of a large grape at hand’s length, that it should have popped out of the cloud almost as soon as I saw it.  It did not.  I watched the light both with and without binoculars for about 4 minutes before it faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:08, just below the same cloud where the light was shortly before, I saw one of the amber-orange UFOs (aka fireballs) that I’ve reported on many times before.  Unfortunately, I was not looking directly at that part of the sky when it came on.  I watched this light for several minutes, both with and without binocs, and could confirm that it was precisely the same kind of UFO I’ve seen before.  The UFO slowly drifted downward to about 10 degrees or less above the Gulf, and then slowly faded out.  I observed this UFO almost exactly where I saw one on July 26, which I reported in “Sighting #14.”  Of great interest, this UFO dipped into the horizon ALMOST EXACTLY WHERE I AND OTHERS HAVE REPEATIDLY SEE “UGOs!  What now gets more fascinating, is that at 10:18 I saw another UFO that looked precisely as the previous one, but it was already at or very near where the one of 7/26 was.  Whether this UFO was the same one I saw earlier, or another one of the same type, remains to be determined.  It pretty much remained stationary as I watched it for a good 5 minutes, and then it faded out like the other one, and again, just like the one of 7/26.  NOW, putting together the fact that this last one was in the same location as where I saw the 5 “slow flashes” of the 7/26 NGO, this further leads me to believe more strongly that (1) these fireballs are indeed directly associated with these mysterious glowing objects, and (2) something of significance is happening in that area, and indeed, the entire area off northern Sanibel and Captiva Islands.<n>

I tried taking photos with my phone but the image didn&#39;t come out at all.

I stared at it for about 40 seconds trying to see if I could see any additional lights to discern it to be an airplane, but when I realized that it was the only blinking light I knew what I was looking at was very strange.  I turned my back to get my sister from inside and as I stepped onto the porch about 20 feet away I looked back and it had vanished from sight.<n>

My roommate is an industrial fire fighter and always makes fun of me being so adamant about some of the strange stars I see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night we were out in our back yard and I happened to notice a really bright star, brighter than all the rest.  I stood there watching it for about 3 minutes when I noticed it was moving, almost bouncing side to side and disappeared at one point.  It came back and I ran inside to get  my camera, but without a tripod I couldnt get a steady picture or video of it.  I could just tell that the brightness of the light was something inside this atmosphere. It looked soo close.  I couldn&#39;t make out a shape, but it easily blended into the sky as another star.  It looked like it could have been hovering over Tooele or Magna.  I have a few videos that are not really steady.<n>

Suddenly it moved quickly to the left and changed from white to red and green.  Then it went kind of back and forth very fast.  Next it moved left and higher before rapidly descending straight down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I often watch the sky... I&#39;ve never seen anything move like this.  It seemedmuch too high to have been some sort of toy.  My husband says a toy could&#39;t work that high in the sky. I never thought I&#39;d make a report like this.  I&#39;ve been checking the web to see if anyone else reported anything strange that night.  As I haven&#39;t seen anything, maybe submitting this will help me find out what the light was.<n>

I was in the process of unloading our vehicle when a very bright light caught my attention from the west (West being Fresno area)  I decided that it was nothingbe but a plane and continued unloading the vehicle.  At this point I noticed it was moving way faster than any plane I have ever seen...and that&#39;s saying something since there is a NGAFB with NORAD connections in Fresno.  I then decided to stop unloading temporarily to watch it&#39;s path and try to confirm to myself it was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch it my mother had come out to help unload the vehicle.  When I told her I jokingly said &#34; hey mom look a UFO, haha&#34;.  It was at that point I realized it was something I had never seen before.  As I looked up again my mother chimed in &#34;it&#39;s moving in a left to right movement&#34;.  I watched and to my amazement it indeed was moving from left t! o right very very fast!  Almost as like a radio wave on a monitor going up and down on a sort of curve.  If you can picture that but of a bright object in the sky that&#39;s exactly what it looked like.  To make it even more weird there was absolutely no sound to this object.  It continued in a NE direction until fading from view.<n>

For some reason I happened to look to my right in the sky and there was what appeared to be  a star.  It was the size of the largest stars in the sky.  This one was MOVING!. It was only visible for about 30 seconds, and it clearly did not have a tail, or trail.  No flashing lights.  Just a  light similar to the majority of the stars in the sky.  It was moving North East.  Then we saw about 4 shooting stars and then another weird moving &#34;star&#34; about 10 minutes from the first one, this one was moving south east and it did the same as the last.  Lasted about 30 seconds to a minute before getting dimmer and dimmer and fading away.  Then in the next 20 minutes we saw 3 more shooting stars.  Then suddenly I spotted another moving &#34;star&#34; moving east  north east.  As I watched in amazement I noticed there was another one almost directly in its path moving a lot slower but going in similar directions.  As the faster one approached the slower one, it seemed to slow way down and curve to the north, they passed right by each other and the fast one sped up and curved back in its original east north east direction.  I thought we were seeing satellites until I saw these two.  Obviously the fast one was being controlled for it to bank the directions it did.  They both were in the sky for several minutes before appearing to &#34;dim out&#34;.  We saw 2 more of these after that.  None lasting more than a few minutes before seeming to just dim out.  It&#39;s probably important to note that all but 2 of these things we saw, had planes take the same path minutes after they disappeared.  I have checked on nasas website and it seems one or two of them could have been the space station and the japanese shuttle that was just launched.  But that only explains two of them. I am convinced what we saw was under intelligent control, and will die a happy man knowing I finally seen what I have believed in all my life.  My wife however has be en a skeptic her entire life, but this incident seems to have made her a believer, or at the very least a researcher.  I hope somebody else seen these things, so you know I am not crazy.<n>

It then appeared to stay in one spot. It was definitely orange/orange reddish, and it appear to me to be flickering or pulsating.  I was waiting for it to move.  At first I thought it was a possible firework or something, then perhaps a plane. But when it wasn’t moving, I knew it wasn’t a plane.

It was low in the sky and traveling (the best we can estimate) from North to South in a downward path.  This object was moving on quickly and disappeared as quickly as it appeared.  We tried to follow it’s decent to see if something landed or crashed, etc. but we didn’t see anything.  We were very, very puzzled and disturbed to be honest.  This is very much a “first” for both of us.  Even though it was 8:15pm it was still daylight outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a weird experience but I am glad I saw this!<n>

My location is north east Cedar Rapids Iowa, precisely 42° 01&#39; 00&#34; N by 91° 40&#39; 30&#34; W which is the surveyed location of my back yard astronomical observatory.  I am a retired electrical engineer working in the aerospace industry over 45 years.  I am 78 years old and my hobby is astronomy.  My observatory is a slide off roof type giving me a full view of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While preparing to mount a camera on my telescope for some deep sky photographs I observed an object moving slowly almost over head in a Northerly direction.  The object trailed a blue glow.  It did not have navigational lights and the only reason I could make out the shape had to be that it was low enough to catch the glow from the city lights south end east of my location.   The object was rectangular or perhaps a flattened cylinder. Definitely not a shape I associate with aeronautics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While observing the blue glow intensified and the object disappeared over the northern horizon in perhaps 2 seconds.  My estimate of the speed was something like four to five thousand miles per hour, yet there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the past several years, I have seen different objects at various places in the sky but never paid much attention to them.  Only recently with the radio on in the observatory I became aware of other people reporting unusual events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this report is of some use and will keep and eye out for any other unusual aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

8/3/13 23:30|San Jose|CA|Fireball|30 minutes|Orange red fireball seen 4 times above San Jose, Ca.  8/3/13|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100750.html|826|ndxe201308| Orange red fireball seen 4 times above San Jose, Ca.  8/3/13<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8/4/13--  I was sitting in my back yard last night with 2 friends discussing a upcoming vacation.   It was about 11:30pm pst.   I was facing directly East,  and was looking up at the stars ( because normally you can&#39;t see them...). It was slightly cloudy,  kind of hazy out and in the mid 60&#39;s.   The eastern sky was the only area of the sky that had visible stars.   At some point around 11:30ish I noticed a bright orangish red ball flying above the the hills,  right above Mt. Hamilton.   I stared at it for almost a minute before I knew for sure that what I was looking at was something I could not understand.   It looked like a ball of light and it moved like an airplane at first.  I then pointed it out to my 2 friends,  and let them know that I had been staring at this and can&#39;t figure it out.  They immediately thought it was an airplane,  due to the size and speed.  But then it seemed to stop in mid air,  not to mention it wasn&#39;t really moving in a straight ! line.  So then we thought it was a helicopter.  This also was disproved by the size and speed.   I would say it was the size of a 3-4 bedroom house or slightly bigger.   So it moved toward us, and seemed pretty low, but then moved away,  then North,  then back to the West,  back North again before it looked to be moving away from us upward!  When it moved it was either really slow or extremely fast.  It shot up into space and disappeared within about 10 seconds!  This ball thing also seemed to be changing color from red to orange,  and I think I could see the colors moving all around the ball.  At a certain point I could see light radiating from the ball in all directions.  It looked like seeing a red light through a wet window,  or like how a bright star looks in the distance.   This lasted at least 2 minutes.   I was then walking around my yard going through every possible explanation,  and one of my friends was also doing this.  The 3rd friend was in denial and kept maki! ng up excuses as to what it was,  but non of them made sense a! nd I cou ld disprove all of them.   After a few minutes we sat back down and attempted to restart our conversation.  I however couldn&#39;t stop staring East.  Then, after about 2-3 minutes from the last occurrence,  I saw it again!  Except this time I saw it immediately,  as it rose above the East hills.   I started yelling for everyone to look at it,  and scared them because it made me jump up.  This time we all 3 saw it from start to finish.   The weird thing was that it took what seemed to be the same path as the 1st fire balls we saw.  A lot of discussion went on during this second one,  and all possible explanations were thrown out the door.  It was official,  what we were seeing defied all logic based on our knowledge and the available technology.   It was gone again,  after it shot off into space,  and we were all left staring up into the eastern sky wondering what the f@*k just happened.  Once again after a few minutes I spotted it again in almost the same spot.  The 3rd time we! were very big eyed and quiet just observing and inside freaking out.  After the 3rd occurrence I went inside the house and told my girlfriend to wake up and put her jacket on.  I had to have another witness, and someone to explain to me what was going on.   She came outside and we all told her what we saw.  By this time we were all climbing things to get a higher view,  and she thought we were nuts!  But just my luck it happened one last time.  The 4th time we saw it,  it seemed to get closer to us before it shot off into the horizon.  Also,  during the whole thing all of us saw several shooting stars each.  All of also can&#39;t remember ever seeing more than one shooting star ever in our lives,  from San Jose that is.   I got my 6ft. ladder out to get a better view,  thinking it would happen again.  What I saw over the top of my very tall fence,  on the very tops of the hills,  was some odd lights.  It looked like street lights but all the way on the top of the hills.  I&#39;ve ! lived here 32 years,  and I consider myself a very observant p! erson.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never in my life seen lights on top of these hills.  I pointed them out to everyone and mentioned they were not normally there.   Everyone thought they were lights from someone&#39;s house on the mountain,  but I knew there are no homes there.   No more strange balls of fire showed up so we went and sat back down.  About 5 minutes later,  I got up and climbed up my ladder again.  When I looked to the top of the mountains,  the lights we saw were gone!  Also,  today with the sun up I used my binoculars to get a good view of that area,  and there is nothing there...  I don&#39;t know what we saw.  But it wasn&#39;t an airplane,  helicopter, remotely operated device, wasn&#39;t a meteor, missile, rocket, weather balloon,  and took off into space.  WTF?<n>

It was bright white while rising and bright blue while falling, alternating red&amp;gt;blue&amp;gt;white while hovering, and all color transitions were extremely smooth.  Since I was viewing it across an arc of about 120 degrees, I feel confident saying there was no &#34;looping&#34; involved (like a conventional aircraft) as through the entire 120 degrees it appeared to move absolutely vertically &#34;bobbing&#34; up and down only.  I didn&#39;t see any police helicopters or other aircraft heading to the area, so I&#39;m guessing no one is treating it like a national emergency or anything, but I&#39;d sure like to know if there is a mundane, man-made explanation for this...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was beautiful and mysterious.  Too big and too bright to be a toy or something controlled by someone below,  It moved like an aircraft but much more elegantly and effortlessly.  Best way to explain it.  I don&#39;t really believe in Aliens but whatever it was, I have never seen anything quite like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After awhile it seemed like it was falling downwards like an air! plane out of control and then it dissipated.

As we were nearing the exit of my neighborhood, we all saw a red light in the shape of a circle, the easiest way to describe it would be a fireball. (Like the ones everyone have been reporting, it seems.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was a comet or meteor of some sort, but comets and meteors usually leave trails if I&#39;m correct. The ball of red light was a lot slower than a meteor, but it was slightly faster than a plane or helicopter.  It wasn&#39;t blinking, the light was constant. We watched it for approximately three minutes until it suddenly faded away, but I saw an outline around a transparent circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball didn&#39;t seem like the fireballs described by other people, though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend who was going to work, my cousin and I are only upcoming sophomores in high school.

I noticed that someone was setting off fireworks about ten miles away, and figured that was the issue, as i watched the fireworks i noticed two bright objects above the trees in the distance one was hovering and one was moving and changing color, they appeared too bright to be aircraft and were silent, i watched them for a while and decided one must be a radio tower, although it was a brighter red light and i hadn&#39;t recalled seeing a tower there, by now the color changing object was gone, but the red light remained hovering, i went inside to get binoculars, when i returned less than a minute later it was gone<n>

I observed the light flying and within a minute it was gone off into the distance.  No blinking lights, strange arching flight pattern.  Also, I noticed a strange film or layer of particles around the light, but this could just be the intensity of the light causing a glow affect versus any kind of significant detail.

The lights were equally spaced apart and would get bright and then dim in patterns.  For example, all lights would turn bright together and then dim, whereupon the bottom most light (maybe starting 250 feet above the buildings and homes) would turn a red color, the 2nd through 8th lights would go bright up the almost vertical line of light one by one, successively, after the other until the ninth and topmost light would grow bright red.  I and five other witness watched this for about 45 minutes straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The patterns of the lights glowing bright white and then fading out almost completely, was constantly changing, almost pulsing at times, and the lights were moving very slowly, not breaking formation  due West.   As we were all viewing this event, a light appeared in the sky in front of us, South of the formation and closer to us.  It shot upwards after appearing and faded out completely. Additionally, closer and to the NW, we observed another bright light appear, and  travel at high speed for a second and disappear.  Appeared high up in space.  To right of the Big Dipper.  We all also observed another shooting light orb appearing out of nowhere and shooting upwards, arcing and disappearing. this was again South of the formation to the North and lower and much closer to our viewing position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally the formation moved West at a faster speed, all lights disappearing but one, which proceeded to grow brighter and much bigger.  At peak light intensity it vanished. We could no longer see anything in the sky to the North.  About a minute or less after the final large round light went out, as we were talking about it, we looked to the North East as a huge bright light caught our eye.  It was traveling in a South Easterly direction and appeared to be a large white light traveling very fast.  It was pretty close and low, and large.  Very bright white. It too vanished by going from extremely bright to dim in milliseconds.  Then it was gone. Looked like the large light from the formation, at the end.  Don&#39;t know if it was or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again six of us observed the light formation for around 45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving and saw the formation, and stopped near our home to observe it.  So crazy we could not stop watching all of the events.  We have no idea if anyone else around the city saw it, but I am positive others observed it.  It was glaringly not helicopters or planes or flares. It was occurring pretty well in the center of Vegas and North of Vegas proper and before the mountain range.

They were orange in the center and radiating red around the outside.  They were large compared to red lights from airplane towers in the background.  They were situated between the Capitol and the West Side.  I got off on Midvale where I picked up my husband.  We drove to an elementary school on Midvale where we stopped our car and got out to look.  At this point there were now 3 fireballs. 2 hovering next to each other, and one moving southwest very slowly toward Fitchburg/Verona.  They were fairly low (helicopter height), but made no noise and did not move except for the one traveling slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back in our car to see if we could drive closer to them, got on the Beltline continuing toward the downtown area, and lost sight of them.<n>

My two daughters, 11 and 12, and one of their school friends and I were returning home from the movies Saturday evening at 9:40pm.  We were ¼ mile from home traveling west when I observed four orange lights in the sky as I looked through the trees and while rounding a turn.  As I drove through the turn I immediately pulled the car off the road, turned on the hazard lights and asked the children to start filming what I saw in the sky.  All objects were approximately three thousand feet up, made absolutely no sound and much larger than any distant star.  If you held a pencil out in front of you they would be the same size as the eraser on the end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first 4 objects were heading from SW to NE all along the same bearing.  Together they reminded me of the handle of the big dipper, referring to the formation they were in.  They, as well as the follow on groups of objects, were orange in color, almost looking as if it was a burning orange.  As the first four craft crossed my bearing, as I looked into the sky, one by one the orange craft “flickered” in color and vanished.  They all vanished at the same point in space.  It was this time that the children and I who had called family members to report what we were seeing noticed that the phone calls dropped repeatedly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next 5 objects were in a “V” formation with one single object out front followed by two and then again followed by two more.  Once again they were burning orange in color and traveled in the same direction as the first four.  At the same point in the sky the objects flickered and disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last two objects were in succession, one behind the other, and behaved as the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once home I called 911 and reported our sightings.  My daughter recorded 3.5 minutes of video which doesn’t do justice to what we saw but does capture the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite sober-minded.

I then went outside to see if I could spot them again when I saw a forth one go by in the exact same path and vanish in the same spot that the others vanished in.

We continued to watch the light move through the sky towards the SW.  There was no sound associated with the object.  All of the sudden it was gone.

In the binoculars the objects looked like a red/orange glowing orb with a black core.  When they hit a certain altitude the orbs disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another odd thing to point out is during this time, as each orb moved out of eyesight up high in the sky, seconds later we heard what sounded like a cannon being fired off, the loud sound ricocheted, which one does not hear off of something like a firework being set off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard 5 or more of these sonic booms as the orbs were moving out of sight high in the night sky.

When I looked over I could see that these were not reflections, but lights in the sky.  There were four lights of equal brightness in a row, seeming to keep pace with us driving at about 100 km/h (65 mph.)  At one point the third and fourth objects were above and below each other for a time but otherwise they stayed in a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving, and my wife was taking the pictures with my phone.  Unfortunately we did not get a picture of object 3 and 4 above and below each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light seemed to be reflected by the objects, it did not appear that they were producing the light themselves.  The brightness did seem to stay constant as the sun was going down however.  It looked almost like a small contrail in front and behind each object, and there was no colour or strobing/flashing visible, it looked like a very bright, white light as if sunlight reflected off a mirror.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They slowly gained distance on us but it never seemed that they were actually moving.  They travelled in a westerly direction toward the City of Winnipeg where we live.  At one point an airplane could be seen travelling North to South, and it was clearly different from the objects, it did not produce the bright reflection and the contrail was visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our daughter also saw the objects, and said they looked like shooting stars.<n>

8/3/13 05:15|Panoche (near; on I-5)|CA|Cone|~5 minutes|I-5 in California, two conical craft in flight formation, one steady white and one blinking white|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100754.html|856|ndxe201308| I-5 in California, two conical craft in flight formation, one steady white and one blinking white<n> <n><n> <n><n> First UFO sighting in my life.  I&#39;m an 18 wheel truck driver, 15 years experience trucking.  55 years old this month.  Eagle Scout, top of my class in high school, 4 year Engineering degree (1976-1980), private pilot&#39;s license when I was in college, and ex-airline mechanic  (A &amp; P mechanic).  I love aviation, I love aircraft, you can&#39;t put me on too many commercial flights, that&#39;s how much I love air travel, and I know a whole lot about aircraft and flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m using web site &#34;drivei5.com&#34;, the northbound exit guide, for reference right now.  Spent the night in the sleeper berth of my tractor-trailer at exit 334, west side of Interstate 5 in front of the Best Western. Today is Saturday, 8/3/13.   Went to slept last night (Friday, 8/2/13) around 7 p.m.   I had been awake and working since 3:30 a.m. Friday morning, and by the time I finished dinner at the Chinese restaurant named Oriental Express, I was dead tired.  Finished dinner, got in my tractor, put myself Off Duty on the HOS (Hours of Service, federal truck driving regulations) computer at 6:32 p.m., and was fast asleep by 7 p.m.  I awoke this morning before my alarm clock, and I hit the road at 4:32 a.m. immediately after my 10 hour HOS break.  I was driving northbound on I-5 in my tractor-trailer during the entire time of both sightings, speed set by cruise control at around 57 mph.  The sighting happened between 5:10 a.m. and 5:15 a.m.  That&#39;s a rough estimate: ! I was a little taken and preoccupied with the sighting, so it might have taken a minute or two after the sighting ended before I had the presence of mind to look at the clock, which said 5:15.  I passed the Firebaugh Rest Area, which is mile marker 386, right at 5:30 a.m., which means I was 15 miles short of the rest area when I saw the clock reading 5:15 a few moments after the sighting ended.  Working backwards, I must have been driving somewhere near the stretch of freeway between mile marker 365 and 370 during the sighting.  It was before first light, so it was still dark out. I don&#39;t remember where the moon was or what phase it&#39;s in, you can look that up.  I don&#39;t remember seeing moonlight.  It was dark except for vehicle lights and the lights of towns down in the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First sighting:  At first I saw three lights in a straight line, off to my left out the driver door window, and I thought it was a reflection.  I moved my head back and forth, but the &#34;reflection&#34; didn&#39;t move against the background outside, so I knew it was outside the truck.  I don&#39;t remember if the lights had any shape, but they were white, like LED white.  Duration was in the seconds, definitely less than 10-15 seconds total.  I thought I had hallucinated something, or seen a reflection.  What happened next, though, made it clear I probably hadn&#39;t hallucinated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second sighting:  That straight line of 3 lights disappeared very quickly, but it had drawn my attention to the left side of the freeway.  Normally, as a driver, I would just be looking ahead, and checking my mirrors for cars coming up behind me.  Next thing I remember, and it must have happened fairly quickly after the first sighting, best guesstimate 5-15 seconds later, I saw what looked like two distinct white lighted vehicles emerge from near the ground to my left heading from left to right across the freeway in front of me.  Distance away from me maybe a few hundred yards, a quarter mile, something like that.  Altitude started at ground level, which on the left side of the freeway is hilly and uneven, to anywhere from eye level to maybe the top of a telephone pole when they crossed the freeway in front of me.  The ground slopes down to the east as it heads into the valley.  The ground to the west of the freeway, to my left because I was heading northbound, is hilly and ! gets higher in elevation the more west you go.  So their AGL altitude increased the entire duration of the sighting. However, the entire sighting was at my eye level or a little above my eye level, easily visible to me through the windshield.  My windshield in this 2011 Freightliner is a single piece of glass with no divider in the middle.  Honestly, the entire show of the second sighting couldn&#39;t have been more perfectly designed for my viewing pleasure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew right away they were UFOs, something I&#39;d never seen before.  Definitely not a crop duster or any other kind of aircraft.  Movement was way, way, way too smooth and straight to be a crop duster.  Besides, no crop duster works at night.  It was completely dark.  They have to see what they&#39;re doing at those low altitudes, because they can&#39;t seed a field or spray a field with pesticide unless they can see the field they&#39;re dusting.  Also, even if they were just out flying for fun, they&#39;d fly into a power line or other ground-based obstacle and kill themselves at those low altitudes.  Plus I might have heard the engine at that short distance.  Crop dusters have very old, antiquated, and extremely loud radial engines, relics of the 1940s, all the WW2 airplanes had them.  If you&#39;ve ever heard a WW2 airplane, you know how loud those engines are.  Raucously loud.  I couldn&#39;t hear any sound above the noise my tractor was making as I was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two vehicles, that&#39;s what they seemed to be, were identical in size and shape, something like the shape of a Hershey&#39;s Kiss, completely symmetrical and sort of cone shaped, but not perfectly conical.  There was a shoulder in the close-to-conical shape.  The UFOs were heading left to right, west to east.  Both UFOs were the identical color and brightness, again a white like a white LED.  The only difference between the two craft (if that&#39;s what they were, &#34;craft&#34;): the UFO trailing in the flight formation was steady white.  The UFO leading in the flight formation was flashing on and off rapidly.  It wasn&#39;t a regular flash pattern, it was some kind of irregular flash pattern.  So the lead craft was &#34;strobing,&#34; or blinking on and off rapidly in an irregular pattern, and the trailing craft was steady light.  During the entire sighting, I don&#39;t recall either craft getting lighter or dimmer.  Just the same steady brightness for each of them.  The UFOs never ! changed speed, altitude, or direction, as far as I could tell.  If they changed direction at all, it was so gradual that I couldn&#39;t recognize it.  The brightness of the UFO trailing in the flight formation was a steady light that never changed at all, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 UFOs crossed the freeway in front of me and I realized as they got further away from me that they weren&#39;t heading due east, they were heading northeast.  So from my vantage point, they were moving slowly to the right as they got further and further away from me, basically in a line that allowed me to watch them for a long time, minutes.  The elevation stayed constant, so they were just a telephone pole&#39;s height higher than my elevation during their entire trip across the valley.  I would wild guess the speed at between 50 and 100 mph, but that&#39;s purely a wild guess, I don&#39;t know how to estimate speed that well.  It was easy to watch them, even as they passed right in front of me, and especially easy as they traveled further and further away.  I didn&#39;t have to jerk my eyes or my head or anything like that.  It took several minutes, at least, maybe longer, for them to fade away into the distance.  I didn&#39;t have the presence of mind to look at a clock until after the show! was all over and they had disappeared into the distance.  By the time they faded away, they had to have been miles away, best guess 3 to 5 miles since they weren&#39;t that large.  All UFOs were identical in size, maybe 5-15 feet tall and roughly as wide as they were tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two craft were formation flying, or so it looked, so I suppose the lights could have been attached to one craft, but I never saw any backlighting or evidence that they were part of one single craft.  They were at elevation and didn&#39;t cross over anything that would have allowed me to identify a shape or a solid object connecting the lights to each other.  The sky was completely dark, so they might have been part of one craft, but if you put me under oath and told me to swear to tell the truth, I would say I was looking at two separate flying craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they receded into the distance, heading northeast out across the valley, something unusual happened.  When the two UFOs were off in the distance, guesstimating a mile or more, suddenly the right-hand, or leading, UFO (the blinking one) disappeared, and instantaneously an identical blinking UFO appeared on the left of the steady white UFO, still leading/ahead of the steadily lit UFO.  So it looked for all the world as if the blinking UFO had disappeared on the right side of the trailing UFO and reappeared instantaneously to the left of the trailing UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At distance, if someone had seen the UFOs for the first time, a casual observer with no aviation experience might have thought they were the lights on an aircraft.  However, to this experienced aviation observer, the blinking UFO looked nothing like an actual aircraft strobe light.  It was a nearly conical, Hershey&#39;s kiss shaped object/craft that was blinking in an unusual way, not like an actual aircraft wingtip strobe light.  A true aircraft anti-collision wingtip strobe light doesn&#39;t have a size or shape.  A true strobe is far too bright to look at directly in front of you.  Also, that close to the ground, a true strobe would light up the ground around it and would even light up and reflect off the structure which it was attached to and a part of.  The leading UFO was blinking on and off rapidly, but not lighting up anything in the vicinity.  I looked directly at it with no pain or difficulty.  So even at a distance, it looked nothing like any aircraft or aircraft strobe ! I have ever seen, because it wasn&#39;t a strobe light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Remember, I replaced and operations checked anti-collision strobe lights on commercial aircraft.  I know what they look like and how they act.  At short distances, those lights will blind you.  They&#39;re incredibly bright and painful to look at from close distances.  They will light up the entire area when you turn them on at night.  These UFOs were easy to look at the entire time, never too bright to look straight at them even when they were close to me.  The lead UFO was blinking on and off rapidly, nearly as rapidly as a wingtip strobe, in a vaguely similar irregular pattern, but the wrong size, plus it had shape which a strobe light does not, and the wrong blinking pattern.  To me the lead UFO looked for all the world like it was attempting to imitate an aircraft wingtip strobe, but doing an exceptionally poor job of it because it wasn&#39;t bright enough or blinding enough, not to mention that the blink pattern was all wrong.  In short, the size and shape of the steady light,! and the size, shape and blink pattern of the light that was blinking, were unique and were something I have never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two UFOs looked for all the world like two very small craft flying in perfect formation, from the time they left the ground until they faded from view in the distance, even when one UFO disappeared and was replaced by an exact duplicate in a different location relative to the steadily lit craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, what was going on in my head and in my life.  I have read that people sometimes have unusual mental and emotional experiences.  Nothing particularly strange or unique happened to me psychologically or emotionally.  I was curious and delighted to actually see UFOs.  I wasn&#39;t fearful.  I didn&#39;t feel spooked or anything.  Nor did I feel elated, or inspired, or anything like that.  There was no telepathy or strange voices in my head, there was no experience of &#34;lost time,&#34; nothing like that.  I felt like I was fully conscious and fully myself the entire time, my normal self basically, before, during and after the sighting.  I don&#39;t recall anything unusual happening in the hours or days before or after the sighting that I would link to the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I should say I am having an unusual week for me.  I have been driving trucks for over 15 years, being a grunt delivery driver, and just this week the nature of my relationship with my career has been changing dramatically.  All I&#39;ve ever been is an employee.  I&#39;ve never supervised people.  I&#39;ve never felt qualified, or competent, or confident enough to supervise other people.  Just in the past day or two, I&#39;ve realized that I want to be in transportation management.  It has been dawning on me slowly this week that I want to start leading and managing from the front of the pack, instead of the middle of the pack, so to speak.  I don&#39;t want to &#34;manage&#34; or lead from below anymore, and I want to be acknowledged for my extensive experience and skills in transportation.  For the first time in my life, I want to be a manager, and I feel ready to supervise people.  It&#39;s a very, very new experience for me, and I am feeling more powerful and confident in myself righ! t now, this day, this moment, than ever before in my life.  SO the timing of this sighting is synchronized with the timing of me changing drastically what I want to do for work and my confidence level in myself professionally.<n>

Right before our eyes, it appeared to be very close, definitely in our atmosphere a huge very bright object appeared and shot upwards very fast and then completely dimmed out.  This object appeared so close maybe a couple kilometres away and it was very low and shot very fast upwards and immediately dimmed out. It was huge and very bright a kind of circular form.  There was light radiating from it and it shot upwards so fast that it only lasted approximately 2-3 seconds and then immediately dimmed out. After that we continued to watch and only seen a couple of shooting stars.

They can&#39;t be lightning because there is no crackle or spark of any kind, nor is there any following thunder.  The lights flash kind of like Morse code: flash-flash...flash...left flash...right flash...and then a streak of light.  Then the pattern repeats, which makes me assume it can&#39;t be a natural phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad and brothers went riding toward where they figured there must be a tower emitting the lights, but the farther they drove, the more they realized that the lights were not being emitted from anywhere on the ground.  They&#39;re positioned in the middle of the sky and they&#39;re not moving, as the lights of an aircraft would as it flies.  The flashes are also way too bright and large to be aircraft-based.

I asked my daughter &#34;Did you see that?&#34; she replied, &#34;Yeah, what was that?&#34;  My answer was &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34; after driving about 500 yards or so another set flew across the sky from right to left, there was not any hovering nor was there any sound and my car windows were down.  There were no less that 3 large red lights in a triangular formation, with one smaller white light.<n>

When we first seen them, there were 3 hovering together in a triangle pattern travelling North, then they were travelling West together. 2 more appeared above the tree line, all following the same path they turned and travelled to the East. It was a clear night, lots of stars.  They were not aircraft, no blinking lights and no sound.  They were travelling at about the height a small aircraft may travel and even lower than that.  They would hover in one spot and also appeared to move slowly and then quickly.  All happened in approximately 4 minutes.  Very strange, never seen anything like it before.<n>

I looked up to admire the bright stars, turned and noticed a white cylinder hovering over a tennis court 100 yards away.  It was upright like a big coffee can with orange flames coming out of the bottom.  It hovered back and forth for a few seconds and moved away and seemed to disappear.  I wish I had time to take a picture, but I was in shock and trying to rationalize that it was some kind of remote control toy.  I decided that it was not a toy since there were obvious flames coming out of the bottom.  I wish someone had seen this with me....I was not drinking, but I am a skeptic about these things...or I should say I was...I can&#39;t get the picture and experience out of my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All were traveling in a straight line east, taking 20-30 seconds to go from overhead to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were vaguely round amber lights. All identical.  No shape was discernible.  I had a good pair of binoculars and followed #5 for nearly 30 seconds without being able to make out a source of this light or any recognizable shape of the light.  The lights did not flash or blink, and we heard nothing but the crickets.  They sometimes flickered near the horizon as they went through cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first two flew very close to each other.  In fact, our impression was that they were the leading and tailing light of an airplane, since the second flowed closely behind the first (though as I said the color was wrong, and they were not blinking).  We were left perplexed, because while the speed and brightness suggested a low-flying aircraft, we should have heard it at that height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other three lights were distinctly singular.  They did not apparently follow the same exact flight path as the first two, but did fly west to east.  The third came less than a minute later.  The last 2 came separately  2 or 3 minutes later.  All flew at a fairly uniform, constant speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was night, but no stars were visible because of clouds.  The source of the light was not very diffuse, so it may have been near the bottom edge of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Visiting Professor of Sociology at a large University.  My wife works at a bank.  We and I are birders, so we recognize many of the ways people’s impression and memory of objects can be confused.  We have practiced methods we use to accurately describe and remember features of things we see (for example we describe objects we see out loud and verify them with one another as we’re seeing them).  I went inside to write down this description immediately thereafter.<n>

Approaching my house I see two distinct fire orange balls of light that appeared to be in tandem with each other.  They moved through the section of tree line that divides my neighborhood from the bluff and then appear to fly through the tree line heading away from my street in an easterly direction, as they cleared the trees, and in plain view of open cloudless sky they just disappeared.  Seconds later two more approach mimicking the same pattern, they flew approximately two blocks west of my home down the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They got smaller and I assumed they were either going higher or disappearing all together because I was unable to visualize them when at the end of the street.  As the two balls of light disappeared two more are moving past the tree line, again following the same pattern.  I was able to get my neighbor’s visitor’s attention and he confirmed what I was seeing.  I was able to see a few small commuter airplanes in the distance that is typical of this area as I am close to Boeing and a few miles from the Everett Naval Station.  These lights were not typical of the aircraft I have seen here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound to them; they didn’t leave any sort of trail.  However, I counted 13 of them, they flew in pairs except for the last one, and all followed the same flight pattern.  This process took approximately 5 minutes, unfortunately for fear of missing anything I did not run back to my house and get my camera.  I only had the comfort of my neighbor’s friend who was able to see what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am providing this information because this is the second sighting I have had, the first was May 3, 2012 and that one was just a singular orange light that hovered directly over my home for approximately 3min, it was also 9-9:30 in the evening.  That sighting was much closer to my house and directly above it.  It also appeared to illuminate itself to appear really big and then shrink in size and look like a tiny white star.  It disappeared when I attempted to jump the shrubbery in my front yard and bang on the window to get my husband’s attention.  I made a search of the neighborhood seconds after I lost sight of that one and walked to the bluff which overlooks the water, Port Gardner Bay, but there was no indication of it anywhere in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe these were airplanes, helicopters, weather balloons or flares.  These objects had intelligent and deliberate movement and seemed to be a team or in unison of some sort.  I am hesitant to contact the Naval Station and inquire about any sightings on the evening of August 2nd 2013 or possible unusual things seen on their radar as these types of occurrences are typically dismissed, so I decided to share it with you to see if this sounds like anything you have heard before.  I am sincerely interested since I live above the Naval Station and not far from the water.  Is their a correlation for the multiple sightings?  I don’t know, however what I saw was absolutely amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was facing the east on the porch which faces south.  Then as darkness filled the sky, while we were talking, I had noticed a bright star-like object in the eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my head and said something then looked back up and the large object became a swarm of blinking smaller white objects.  My response caused both witnesses to look to the east and what we saw was at least 8-10 blinking objects that dispersed moving rapidly in all directions and then just disappeared.  It reminded me of a swarm of lighting bugs.  Only one stayed blinking heading in a southwest direction before also disappearing.  A short while later, another bright white object which had been in a south east position during the first event started to get brighter as it moved in northwest direction and then just disappeared.  We saw several smaller objects that were star- like going in different di! rections after that.  One even made a sharp left while moving north. Some were smaller than others.  Around 23:00, two more helicopters fly over the house going south west. One was flying just above the tree tops and had a spot light of some sort turned on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did observe many planes during the event and checked to see if any satellites were passing over during the discussed time frame and found that there were in fact two.  We live close to two hospitals which do use life flights and a small airport.  In addition, we had some cloud cover overhead last night along with some clear skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the observers are over the age of twenty-one, no one was drunk, medicated, or high.  The young men are both educated and I have a M.A. in political science.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not have a logical explanation for what I witnessed on that evening.<n>

They seemed to be following a normal airplane at first, but the plane flew off.  They were pretty high up there, and flew slowly but consistently, moving southward for about 3 minutes until they just kind of disappeared into the horizon.  The &#34;10 lights&#34; looked almost the size of a plane in the distance, but they were dimly lit, and the light being emitted did not look like that of a plane.  There were no visible blinking lights on the sides like a normal airplane.  They would not show up on my cell camera, but the normal airplane did.  My girlfriend compared them to &#34;little candles floating.&#34;  Another neighbor parked and got out of car trying to take pictures.  She also had no idea what they could be.  I have lived here all my life and never seen anything like this.<n>

We could not hear any noise or photograph with with phone (resolution was to low). we observed the lights moving in the night sky for roughly 3 minutes.

In looking to the east we saw over Sunset Crater National Park four lights over the craters rim, two pairs of two.  They blinked a few times but were very bright, perfectly circular, and white.  Within a few minutes of us watching they blinked out and were gone.  We arrived home, and I looked up recent Arizona Activity on the internet and found where identical lights had been spotted two days earlier in Tucson, Arizona.

Sometimes it is appears extremely lower than other times.  It was noticeable like clockwork almost daily in the same general area but up until about a month and a half ago it has been appearing daily in a different location but still noticeable, bright and pulses.  There are other smaller lights we have noticed that are within close proximity but they almost appear to have a faint flash of colored lights (red, clear, and blue).  They are also stationary and is something we didn&#39;t notice before.  The most impressive sighting I have witnessed was on 1/21/14 as I was driving into the valley from the coast at 6:40am apprx.  I observed the same bright pulsing light extremely low almost looked like it was close to the top of the mountaino! us tree lines and kept an eye on it as I drove through the corridor and again noticed the faint colored lights in its close proximity.  What made this event more startling was the two objects that crossed its past from the bottom up in a slight diagonal position (so not anything that I could pass off as a plane or helicopter) Counted 5 objects moving in all different directions then two them disappeared as quickly as they appeared.  The pulsing light and two other colored light objects remained in sight and disappeared by the thick fog cover that was blanketing the valley when I got into town. 1/22/14 same pulsing light this morning and colored lights , no other &#34;light&#34; show similar to 1/21 but that same pulsing light was back in its usual spot where I had been observing it in August of 2013.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this because we are very curious to know what those lights are.  This is not anything we have ever witnessed or experienced before in our lifetime and it just seems to be occurring more frequently and have read about others in this general area of the State who witness the same daily phenomenon that we do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know other drivers pulled off the road to observe. I didn&#39;t take photos because my cell phone always has a haze to it when I attempt to take photos so I didn&#39;t even bother.  I&#39;m hoping others were able to document this event.  I&#39;m open to give more info via phone contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Something in the sky caught his eye and he first thought it was just a plane with the sun reflecting off it since it was a sunny day.  But he realized it seemed REALLY bright so he took another look and realized quickly that the object wasn&#39;t moving at all.  He could see some high clouds moving behind it but the object itself was not moving.  We have two very tall trees in the backyard and the object was viewed in the space between.   He couldn&#39;t give much of an estimate on the altitude of the object but it appeared to be where a small local aircraft might be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He had trouble believing what he was seeing and he kind of closed his eyes and shook his head for a second and when he looked again it was gone. He moved about the yard to look past the two trees but it was nowhere to be found in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He felt silly describing it because it sounded so cliche, but my husband is a huge skeptic so I believed him when he drew it out showing an oval/disc like shape either with windows or some kind of markings on the side. He said it was very bright, brighter than any reflection of sun would have been (on an airplane).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came home from work he showed me where he had seen it.  I&#39;m a lover of planes and flight patterns so I understand that planes may appear stationary for a few moments if they&#39;re flying directly towards or away from you but eventually you will see the movement.  The area of sky where he had seen the object would not have obstructed him from seeing a plane continue it&#39;s path if that were the case...there was a ton of sky.  The object simply disappeared.<n>

This patio is on the third floor, and her house is on the northern end of Sanibel Island, Florida, USA.  She was on her patio because she could not sleep.  I went to interview her the next day, standing on the patio where she saw the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She pointed out where she first saw a bright light, primarily white, but with a bit of red in it, RIGHT WHERE WE NORMALLY SEE THE ‘UGO’S (Unidentified Glowing Objects)!  I have previously submitted maps of where we have seen both this glow and apparently landed craft see Summary of 10 UFO Sightings).  The UGO site is about a mile away and to the NNW of her house, just behind the tree line there.  She said that it was no more than two finger-widths above the seaward tree line of Clam Bayou, which would be around 80 to 100 feet above sea level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What’s fascinatingly interesting here is that she said she became mesmerized with the light and watched it for approximately 15 minutes before it started coming toward her.  When I asked her if she was afraid, she actually had to think about it before saying no.  This is quite unlike Carol, who is 70 years old, and lives alone since her husband died less than a year ago.  She has become terribly frightened before by both the UFOs and UGOs we’ve seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 15 minutes it arrived directly in front of her house, stopped, and just hovered about two finger-widths above the tree line.  This tree line is exactly one half a mile away from her house, and is on a very narrow shoreline of the Gulf of Mexico. She said that the UFO was about the size that a 747 would have been at that distance, and in fact actually thought at first that it was a jet liner.  She said that the UFO was a bit swollen toward the middle, and that the object was not tapered at the ends, but blunt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Carol was still mesmerized, maybe even more so, when the craft arrived, stopped, and then hovered motionless for 3 minutes at least.  She said that there was a red light toward the middle of the craft, possible on or near the top, which accounts for the redness she saw at a distance when she first spotted the craft.  The red light was not clearly defined with edges.  She also said that the craft was “edged” with a yellowish glow (see my following Sighting #22 for an important correlation).  She told me there was no sound whatsoever, but for whatever reason, did not seem to take this seriously, almost like that’s the way it should have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked her if she could see any windows, and she said “I wasn’t looking for windows…it was probably too bright to have seen any anyway.  I then asked her in a serious manner if she saw anyone inside the craft, waving hello or anything.  I said this both to perhaps jog or shock her memory, and also as a joke.  She took me seriously at first, thinking about it, before she said no, and then caught on.  She also said that it was very strange that there was no sound.  When asked about “missing time,” she said no, absolutely no (she looked at the clock when she went inside, and that’s how she knew it was 2:30).”  After the few minutes she was watching, it proceeded along it’s course, following the coast line to the SSE.  She said that the craft continued on it’s southerly course “at a very high rate of speed, and was gone in just a minute or two.<n>

As I was driving South around 1:30am this morning I noticed an orange/red fireball in the sky towards where the Turnpike and I-4 meet.  It was circular, almost oval in shape and was traveling North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a plane  but it slowed down and looked like it was on fire.  I called my roommate who was at home to look outside as I had just left.  Then I noticed another one in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove a few more feet, I saw two more.  I wanted to take a picture but was not able to.  I turned West, and as I looked behind I could see they were in a perfect square formation, hovering without movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned ten minutes later, they were no longer there.  Upon my return, I did see a helicopter flying in almost the same path as the fireballs.  However, the sheriff helicopters fly around my area at least 4 times a week due to crime rate.<n>

It was about 1 am.  They live on top of a large mountain called Bent Mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving down the mountain to the city of Roanoke.  I had my high beams on because the deer are heavily populated in that area.  I saw a rustle in the bushes near the creek so I stopped the car.  A family of deer is what I was expecting to see.  Instead I saw a 3 foot alien to the right of my car.  It was very short had an almond head and long tentacle like legs.  About four to six legs.  It was milky in appearance and shiny in the moonlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stepped out from the bushes and into my view.  I was scared and started to drive without looking back.  It had dark black holes looking like eyes.  But, its eyes seemed like an intelligence was behind it and it might have been lost.  My dogs were in the car at the time and were barking and growling at the entity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Then, just before it reached the horizon it disappeared.  There was no noise from this event, and no impact as far as I know.<n>
8/1/13 23:59|Cambridge Narrows (Canada)|NB|Disk|20 minutes|A very large object, looking like a 50s Sci Fi Saucer shape with very sharp, distinct shape, but looking like a fire over Military Base|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101474.html|895|ndxe201308| A very large object, looking like a 50s Sci Fi Saucer shape with very sharp, distinct shape, but looking like a fire over Military Base<n> <n><n> <n><n> Normally I sleep very well, but my normally calm Labrador woke me and asked to go out at 11:59 on about August 1st, 2013.  It was a no breeze evening with stars in the night sky.  In the direction of Military Base Gagetown was a basketball size (bigger than a large setting sun) object.  It looked like a perfect, saucer shape -- large round bottom with a dome on the top - as one would see in a fifties Sci Fi film.  The lines were very crisp and defined.  But unlike the silver shapes in the films - this was as if it was a fire - - within the lines.  The fire like light was moving as it would within a fireplace - - but staying within the perfect lines of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would guess that it was several miles from where I saw it -- if it were over head it would be perhaps several football fields large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no noise.  My dog was riveted looking towards the horizen where it hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally - after twenty minutes it lowered towards the earth and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Normally with a fire - and I have seen a number in my life - there would be a connection between the horizon and the upper most part -- but it would be &#34;jagged&#34; shape.  In this case there was no connection between the object and the ground - there was an amount of black space beneath it till it went down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen balloons and lanterns - -this was not what this was as they are much smaller than this huge object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not normally interested in this sort of phenomena - but could not take my eyes off of it - nor could the dog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> what was it?  I have no idea.  In college and with my family&#39;s Hollywood, special effects back ground I would say it could have been a Laser, 3-D projection????  Something the military was doing with Lasers?  But why would they be doing this?  My background is a Ph.D. in psychology, advanced nine years of work at an institute and privately training in Carl Jung&#39;s work - 40 years of formal meditation training and teaching formal meditation.  I have worked in Forensics, supervised psychiatrists - and feel I am a fairly good observer.  My mother, a skeptic on most things, claimed to have seen a large saucer in 1947 abouts - which was seen by half of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and in the Pittsburgh papers.  My grandfather&#39;s close friend was Harry S. Truman, who on either side of my birth in July of 1952 had to assure the public that the UFOs over Washington were not something to be afraid of.  But I personally have not had interest in this - and when I had an opportunity in the early nineties to work with John Mack, M.D - and I did interview some of the contactee/abductees - - although I felt they had real, valid experiences - - I did not feel drawn to work with the phenomena as I was working with death and dying at the! time.  So this was a surprise - -and I kept saying to my dog - &#34;Well - it could not be a UFO - they are not golden, fire like this is - - - &#34; - - - It was only a few days later that I googled it and found that there are something called &#34;Plasma objects&#34; that I realized that might be what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Duration was slighly longer than before and it took a definitely Western vector.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after that a satelite had travered from the North to roughly south, I saw it when it was overhead, glowing red as if illuminated by &#34;a setting sun&#34;, passing east of Dameb in Cygnus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, only a couple minutes at most passed passed and bluish colored light appeared above and traversed about 10 degrees of the sky, moving slower in relation to the aircraft that were in the vicinity- fading slightly as it moved, it blinked off just east of Daneb in Cygnus and came back on in the spot it blinked off in less than 1 second, and immediately headed generally North in an erratic flight path, slowly accelerating, but in relation to the oth! er aircraft- it was moving slower than they were.  One civil aircraft had a vector slightly east of the object and was followed momentarily later by a reddish light that faded out as it headed North roughly the same vector as the aircraft as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A number of civil aircraft were present in the general vicinity almost constantly- their strobes were lit.  In fact the last reddish object had initially appeared in close proximity to one aircraft on a heading of roughly South and West as it had passed- almost in the same location as the aircraft as it appeared initially in &#34;Ophuchus&#34;, which took a heading of roughly North and East until in line approximately where the Bluish light had travelled before taking a Northerly vector.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The civil aircraft engines were audible, nothing audible from any of the other craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was with a friend, my and my cousin accompanying my brother to take his girlfriend home walking.  We were closing in, into her house and in the distance about 4.5 miles away in the sky I see 3 orangy red dots in a triangular shape.  The dots were barely visible because it was far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was going at about 45 miles an hour, then it made a “U” turn and went the other way.  i wanted to continue looking at it, but unfortunately there was a tree nearby so it prevented us from seeing where it went.  After i passed the tree, it was gone. I’m pretty sure it was not a star, nor a helicopter, nor a a plane.  I’m 100% sure of it.  Even my brother agrees. Only him and I were the witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nobody else saw anything.  I asked him, ”Did you see that!?” Him: “YES!” (Then he ran passed the tree and left us behind to see if he could still see it). As for myself, I stood there in shock.  My first UFO.  I hope it isn’t my last either.<n>

I noticed almost immediately a bright ball at 12 o&#39;clock southeast.  It was still, not flashing but bright.  I said to my husband &#34;oh wow look I think that must be Jupiter or one of the planets look how bright and close it is&#34;.  Mind you I have been watching it for almost two mins now.  I love to look up at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband said where, so he looked up to direction I was looking and I pointed.  I swear the second I pointed at the orb its light shrunk down to look like every other star and began to quickly move about two to three inches right ( but thousands of feet up) then just vanished.  It was if they knew they were spotted and took off.  I said to my husband I think we just saw a UFO. Then we both felt scared and ran inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it was not a plane.  They don&#39;t stand still and always have some flashing light and it was not a helicopter, there was no noise at all.  I do live 5 minutes from Pax River Navy base so planes and helicopters come and go all hours of the day and usually shake my house.  `Again this was silent, and looked to me like a bright close planet that just vanished.<n>

While driving close to may have been a few km outside of trenton ontario I saw and mentioned a 3 light combination hovering in the distance.  As we approached the anomaly while driving on the hwy we actually drove pretty much directly underneath it.  There were three ligjts white in colour no variation and they formed pretty much an equilateral triangle shape.  The reason I am even writing this is not the fact we saw this shape or light combination as I originally thought it would be a b2 bomber relation.  The fact is while we drove over the object it literally hovered above us with no movement   It was high enough that the entire encounter lasted a few minutes which was more than enough time for us to get a great look at it It was spectacular and with my basic understanding of our current level of technology I realized that we do not possess the tech to allow a mechanism of this size to hover in its place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was an amazing experience - it was very close to an air force base here and assume it would be related to an un announced flight tech but considered it still a ufo to the general populous...<n>

I looked up into the dark glittering sky.  Since there was no light pollution, the sky was clear. We were also up in elevation because we were driving through a plain mohave desert with mountains in the distance on both left and right.  I wore my glasses and it was clear.  I could see every speck of twinkling star in the sky.  I was looking up for about an hour, and suddenly, in space and into the universe I saw an orange, red circular object that was floating. It vanished, then came again and did this about 3 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I saw two objects that looked like air crafts with different lights beaming around them, they were right next to each other.  The lights were going up and down.  Also there was a cylinder shaped cubicle flying quickly way above airplane height and stratospheric level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, there was a flashing light that zoomed by like a comet, it was a light, but very fast.  The thing is that the light was flashing!!!<n>

I went out immediately, and noticed a light, bigger than the Palm Springs tram light in the sky above the mountain ridge. It was positioned a little to the right and up above the tram light (about an inch to the left and 2 inches up above in a visual sense). The light was big and pulsating all different kinds of colors (red, orange, yellow, blue, green, purple, and which) – simply beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly went inside to get the camera, but realized that the batteries were dead. I went out the back with my daughter and also told my wife to come and look at it outside. She’s not that surprised in UFO’s, but casually walked outside and looked up to see the same thing.  This multi-color flashing object was there for about 10 minutes in the sky before slowing descending down below the mountain ridge. It did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter and I have seen things like this here in the night sky before. I have always believed in UFO’s and have seen a few instances in the past.  I am always looking for them, but for some reason, never really ever see any, at least out here.  I have also talked to others around the area out here that have seen other similar events, but never reported them or talked about them to anybody else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t know about this site before, and have been very apprehensive about doing a report.  I just usually don’t do reports like these since I consider these events normal, and read others reports all the time.  However, I do feel better about posting this sighting.  I wish I had others to talk to that have had similar experiences, but I don’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

They came bursting inside the house and said they saw a UFO and wanted me to come and look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside, and to my amazement, there was a metal, cigar or blimp shaped craft hovering above the woods.  It was not directly above us, but aways off and hovering about as high as a low flying helicopter.  It looked about the size of a washing machine, from where we were, but cigar- or blimp-shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting lasted 10 minutes and it just dissolved away before our very eyes.  It made no noise, and it hovered in place the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The children and I saw this same craft about 3 more times this summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the last sighting, my neighbor was over talking with me in my backyard.  The children who saw it first, pointed it out to us in the sky.  We all stood and watched it for about 10 minutes and it too dissolved and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

8/1/13 03:05|Danville|VA|Other|10 minutes|Located two vertical line shaped UFOs outside of Danville.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100690.html|910|ndxe201308| Located two vertical line shaped UFOs outside of Danville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was nine miles outside of Danville near Milton, NC, with a friend just driving around in the AM.  Went to the end of a road and turned around, drove about five minutes back to a T intersection I had passed previously that morning.  Two lines appeared an estimated two hundred yards away in a grass field, containing 3 dots of light each. One of the lines was red and the other was white (and strobing).  Lines were separated about one hundred yards horizontally.  The red lights were obviously touching the ground, however, the white lights remained a constant three to five feet above the ground, and nearest to a tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped for a moment and my friend shined a light in the direction of the objects but we still couldn&#39;t clearly make them out.  Eventually, we left, wondering what we&#39;d seen. I didn&#39;t stay to find out what it was, because I got an incredibly bad feeling about what was going on.<n>

So freaked out!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving in bad rain with husband and children.  Pull into our subdivision where we live and lights kept going around the car almost like a dome.  Thought at first light from airport, nearest airport being 45 minutes away from us.  But then we saw the light coming from everywhere like in the sky both sides of us.  Kept going around the car like the lights were scanning the car in huge dome like circles every few seconds until we pulled into the garage.  We are so freaked out, me, my son, and my husband all saw them!<n>

8/1/13 01:30|Tulsa|OK|Formation|5 minutes|Bright fast light making full circle in mid town in under 5 min|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100806.html|913|ndxe201308| Bright fast light making full circle in mid town in under 5 min<n> <n><n> <n><n> While getting on the highway the craft was spotted. Our vehicle was getting on 412 east bound to 244-E when it came from West Tulsa making a counter clockwise large circle over Utica St. and then off towards North Tulsa where it made a full circle and headed back east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved extremely fast, it was all white lights, two constant bright white &#34;cigar&#34; shaped lights that made a slight &#34;\/&#34; shape but more open, almost flat but you could still see the slight &#34;v&#34; shape and blinking lights that seems to rotate around the middle just about the &#34;v&#34; shape, in an off on flashing pattern.  As it headed north, a helicopter came from the south and attempted to follow it, but the unknown craft was much more fast than the helicopter could travel, and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mind you, this traveled from west Tulsa, first climbing upward emitting a yellow color, then it took off towards down town in a white color and made a full circle in less than 5 minutes, I&#39;ve never seen a craft so fast, fly so low, with out making a sound...<n>

We noticed that the twinkling of the star was different than any star we had seen before.  When observed with a high resolution binocular there appeared to be rotating lights that changed from green to red to yellow in a continuous pattern.  The object was hovering yet changing colors in a circular rotation.<n>
