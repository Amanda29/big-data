Were brighter, iridescent, and twinkling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was looking towards Scottsdale airport, observing usual aircraft lights when I saw lights which didn&#39;t fit in. Aircraft lights were coming and going, but after five minutes or so these lights were unmoving. I went in to get a jacket, when I came back in about 20 sec. The lights were receding in the distance. they were gone in another few minutes. If I was looking at an aircraft, it was head on, and could not recede. I did not see an object, only two lights, which may or may not have been connected.<n>

We saw a bright circular object in the middle of the dipper of the Big Dipper.  It remained stationary then in a flase of intense light it went in a dew west direction at an extreme speed and disapeared.  I am 54 years old and have never seen anything like this.<n>

Immediately, we noticed 2 very bright lights in the western sky and they appeared to be flying quite low.  I assumed they were helicopters because they were too low to be planes, plus they were not going very fast.  Within a minute, we lost sight of one of the objects and it never did reappear.  What happened to it, I do not know.  The other object, however, was within view during our whole trip home.  The farther west we drove, the larger this object began to appear.  As we neared home, the object was nearly overhead and it seemed huge.  It was triangular in shape.  We were so concerned with what it was that we pulled over the car on a side street and got out to get a good look at it.  We could not figure out what the hell it was!  It was at least the size of a commercial airplane, but I believe it was possibly quite a bit bigger...it was hard to judge the actual size and distance away, but it was flying extremely low...I would estimate it was flying no higher than 1000-2000 feet above the ground.  There were a few lights on the sides and one or two in the middle...cannot remember the color of these lights, but I believe they were white and possibly blue.  The object produced absolutely NO SOUND WHATSOEVER.  That was how we were certain that it was not a plane...unless it was some kind of military craft, but rarely do any military craft fly over Rockford, and even if they did, why would they do so at 1 am?  This object was flying towards the south at a very slow but steady rate of speed, but then took an extremely sharp turn to the west, and we then lost track of it because trees were blocking our view from where we had gotten out of the car.  This is something that has never happened to me and I felt very strange and edgy the rest of that night.<n>

I looked up at the sky and I saw a triangle shaped craft flying just above the tee tops. The streetlights were reflecting off the bottom and I got a good look at this shiny silver triangle shaped craft. It had dim yellow lights on each corner. It was horizontal with the ground and then the nose of the craft tipped to a 45 degree angle and it kept flying straight forward. Then the craft turned sharply to the left and disappeared behind a group of trees. I listened for the usual airplane engine sound and heard nothing. For approximately 30 minutes after this event, I noticed low flying aircraft around the area and then they all left too.<n>

I had decided that I was not going to swim and stayed on the beach and took photos.When we returned , we developed the photos , and we were amazed to find a vapour like disc shape just above the horizon in the foreground. We have had the photo analysed and enlarged and our local photographer from the newspaper has ruled out any defects in the flim , dust or damage. Iam just enquiring if you would be interested in the photo. I am unable to release the photo due to copyright obligations but I am willing to negotiate this. Could you please email me asap if you are interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From photo evidence , I can conclude that it spinningtop shaped with the upper edge reflecting the sun/sky light and a shadow underneath. It also appears to have a vapour-like surface with a vapour whisk at the top.<n>

My friend disagreed and said that it looked like two objects going to and from each other a short distance. We looked away because we had turned and then noticed that it was farther away and in a different position.  We turned again to head north and decided to stop and look at it through binoculars.  While I was looking, I saw what appeared to be a thin wedge like about the size of 20 degrees cut from a pie shape sitting sationary.  It was dark colored and pulsated between dark and light.  I handed the binoculars to my friend so that he could look as well and he said that he couldn&#39;e see it anymore.  I looked again and it just wasn&#39;t there.<n>

The object&#39;s lights were elliptical in shape, had an outer ellipse that glowed a dark orange color and contained a smaller yellow white ellipse. The three objects moved in perfect unison with one another as they passed in the sky. They did not vary up or down but the triangle did tend to flatten as it passed across the night sky. The stars it passed in front of were blocked and could not be seen between the 3 lights giving the indication of sides to the object. The three lights did not disappear over the horizon (past trees, houses, etc.) but stayed in the sky and disappeared into the darkness. The object appeared to be very high in the sky (10-20 miles) and moved very quickly as it passed. There was no sound that could be heard. This was unlike anything ever seen by any of the three of us. I have made a drawing the next day of what I had seen the night before and this is available for you to see.<n>

Just green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was East bound on a Springfield street named MtVernon when a rapidly moving light straight ahead above in the sky caught my attention. My first thought was a shooting star then I noticed the bright green color. I then thought that it was an aircraft that was going to crash because of it&#39;s rapid descent but the light was not flashing like on aircraft. It was on solid. As I followed it to the horizen I expected there to be a flash or explosion as it hit the ground but there was none. I can only guess as to where the location of where it came down at. It looked like somewhere near the center of the city or East of there. I have seen metiors and planes before, this was not either of those. It was very unusual. When it came into my field of view I would say it was somewhere between a thousand to five hundred feet up in the air. And it also did not look like any kind of fireworks either. It had weight and moved to fast for that. And there were no sparks. I can&#39;t add much more except perhaps to say that it was coming down so fast that it startled me. It appeared to go all the way to the ground whether it landed or crashed I don&#39;t know.<n>

Looking across the street I noticed what appeared to be a very low and slow flying 747. Although I could not make out the body, what I could see were 3 bright red lights. I assumed one on each wing tip, one at the center where the leading edge of the wings would intersect (if they did),and a golden yellow light on the nose. The speed seemed so slow that I wondered how it could remain aloft. The object traveled left to right (south to north). As it came directly in front of me, it seemed to make a 90 degree bank and stop. I could only see what would be the center light and one wing tip light(now vertical). The lights also changed color from red to golden yellow. The vertical wing tip light was now strobing. It remained stationary and very stable. I could only guess as to the distance, possibly 100-150 yards. I watched the lights for roughly 30 minutes, then the objected rolled back 90 degrees to a straight and level orientation. The lights changed back to red. The object then accelerated, banked left and diappeared over the western horizon. At this point I was certian of what I saw.<n>

I live 3 block from Lake Michigan.  I was traveling west towards the lake, I stopped for a stop sign, looked left for traffic, instead I saw a bright green ball of light travel across the sky.  It was just above the tree line, it traveled real fast in a straight line, then it stopped, I mean stopped in place imediately. For just a second it remained still in the air, then it shot downward toward the ground.  At that point I lost sight of it beacause of buildings.  I sat there for awhile trying to figure out just what I saw.  But I didn&#39;t see it again, I continued on to work.<n>

With naked eye they flicker, with binoculars they demonstrate red, white and green colors at regular intervals as if rotating like a search light. They were there all night and are still there 26 December 1998. There was another one seen in November however more difficult to describe where it is.  Seems to be further west from the other two. It also flickered with those colors. Question is do many of those satallites up there have any red and green flashing lights like airplanes do and boats do to tell left from right? If so why in space? How many of those satallites up there have flashing red and green lights?<n>

There was no sound coming from the craft. It wasn&#39;t as bright as when we first seen it and we could make out a shape. It was rectagular with a couple of lights. I believe a white and a red one. It just sat there for a couple of minutes about 100ft off the ground. There is nothing that I know of that could complete this task with no noise or move that fast. After it had stopped there for a couple of minutes it started to move away slowly and then it just disappeared like it had speed away so fast it could not be seen after a second of acceleration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate<n>

Clear nite, good visibility, constellation Orion clearly visible in ese sky.  There generalized ground light pollution in this urban area but it seemed to illumate the object from underneath.  There were no lights.   Just a huge brown triangle/boomerang type of shape moving low and silently towards the east (can&#39;t say it was due east at this time, i am not there now).  The object appeared almost organic- brown with what best could be described as a morphing web pattern throughout.  We just sd &#34;wow, what the hell was that?&#34;  I have been told that it was probably a stealth fighther going back to Whiteman AFB (MO).  If it was, it was much much larger than any stealth i have seen.   Approx length/width would have to be 8-10 city blocks.  Later in a different city (Jefferson City, MO) a similar silent event took place, but I cannot remember the exact date at this time. John<n>

My brother was in the shop, working on his bike.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw a triangle shaped craft, with four lights on the bottom and two mid center.  The lights were kind of dim, almost unoticable.  It flew over the moon, heading north over the shop.  As it moved, it seemed to merge togther. It moved about 20 mph.   Then it was gone.  I was muttering, &#34;oh my god.&#34; the whole time.  My brother ran out of the shop, but by the time he did, it was gone.  Mnay dogs were barking, and planes had been flying around the area before the sighting.  When i woke up, a scar mark was on my back.  It had never been there before.  Two deeper scratches had been there, but were now gone.  The scar seemed to be like stitches into my back.  I live close by to a military base.<n>

Everything was usuall and normal; we were listening to the radio, going over our grocery list, when suddenly the radio started to make strange noises and then it just sort of exploded. There was no fire, but there was a bunch of smoke. By around 17:05 my mom had driven to the nearest car repair station and we got out of the car. The repair man was unable to fix the radio, we just left to go grocery shopping again. At this time, it was around 17:15. We were on the highway, and it seemed as though our car was the only one on the highway for miles. Then suddenly, there was this huge sphere-shaped, metallic-colored, metal sphere flying striaght at us(17:27). Luckly, my mom svered to the left just in time! But that was not the last of the monstrous metal sphere; it came back, only this time it was flyng at the exact same speed my mom was driving; it was right next to my mom&#39;s car door! After about 5 minutes of that, it just disapeared!<n>

The direction was roughly SSE of Florence and I would guess about eleven miles from HWY 93.  It was bright yellow and hovering over the first saddle of the Mountian range when I saw it.  I know that there isn&#39;t a radio tower that has that strong of a light, and I can&#39;t say that I have ever seen a radio tower over that direction.  The light stayed stationary until I reached the county line and then it was lost behind some trees.  When I past the trees the light was gone...not a trace.<n>

I noticed a strange light that was changing colors and at first thought it was an aircraft taking off from Harris- burg airport. Then I noticed it wasn&#39;t moving and joked to a coworker that ET was coming to take him away. From our warehouse the light seemed to be about 20 degree&#39;s off the horizon in a east south east direction. There were 3 light colors going from blue to white to red in that order. The size of the light was about 3/4 the size of a pencil eraser at arms length. I understand that stars somtimes (twinkle) and planets do not however no other stars doing anythig odd at this time.<n>

The object was immense, perhaps 2 inches from point to point, from where we stood.  No sound. No explanation that fits any aircraft, satellite, or meteor that we have seen on multiple occasions.  Our first sighting of something we could not explain after many years of star-gazing. We are both teachers, well-respected members of the community, and have a hard time trying to explain this one to others.  The shape remained unchanged as it shot across the sky, only to disappear silently.  Our only difference of opinion was whether the lights on each point were blue or white.  Since my friend is better at picking out colors of stars, I have to submit to his sighting of blue lights on the points.  Just plain bizarre.  Can&#39;t explain it better than how we saw it.  I probably wouldn&#39;t have posted it here, since I didn&#39;t know this site even existed, until my friend e-mailed me the similar sighting in Ohio on the same night.<n>

We watched whatever it was decend closer and closer to the pond in my back yard. The light coming from the craft was so intense, we could hardly see anything else in the night sky. It was the strangest thing because there was no sound. We live next to an air port, but planes do not hover over or around my house. Especially with those strange lights. All of the sudden, the craft just zoomed across the sky leaving a bright trail of light behind it.   My friend and I concluded that the crafte left because of an incoming airplane.<n>

I work evenings in the office of a trucking company.  One of my co-workers went outside to smoke a cigarette and saw what she originally thought was a plane coming in.  As she watched it she noticed that it did not appear to be moving.  Then it suddenly shot straight up.  When she came in we were all skeptical so we went out with her to see what she was talking about.  After watching it for a while we all agreed that it could not be a normal aircraft as we know them.  We got out some binoculars and studied the object thru them.  It appeared like a prism with somewhat of a diamond shape but all you could see were the twinkling colors that changed like a kalidescope of purple, yellow, orange, green, red and blue<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have no explanation for the sudden movement of the object reported, but the &#34;kaleidascope&#34; of colors is consistent with a &#34;twinkling star.&#34;))<n>

The object travelled from North to South in a direct path at a speed that I could not define, maybe over Mach 3.  The aircraft was out of sight within ten seconds from beginning to end.   It was orange  to orange white in color.  There were three other witnesses.  I witnessed a meteor shower only a few days before, an event created by  mother nature that I never thought could have been topped.  However, the event I witnessed tonight had no trailing particles and traveled as fast as I have ever seen  within our atmosphere.  The event seemed to be &#34;man made&#34;, not a natural annomoly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximetaly 10:30 P.M. on November 23, 1998, myself and three other witnesses saw an unidentified flying object travelling in a direct path from North to South at a very high speed slightly to the West  of us.  We were standing outside behind the house at ((address deleted)) Street in Carbondale, Illinios.  The craft appeared to be glowing orange to orange/white in color, and had two distinct sources of light.  One light possitioned on the West side of the craft,  and the other on the East.  Both balls of light seemed to be connected to each other, but there was no distinct divider or connection between the two.  However, the two sources of light appeared to be illuminating from one distinct aircraft.  The incident from beginning to end lasted about ten seconds.  Also, from my point of view, the object was traveling at a height of between 20,000 and 40,000 feet.  I am a private pilot with almost 200 hours of flight time, and am working on my instrument rating.  I have been to the Oshkosh Air Show and have seen F-14 jets flying, as well as F-18s taking off from Springfield, Illinois, as well as one F-18 flying over Carbondale a short time ago.  However, I have never witnessed any aircraft traveling at the rate of the one seen tonight.   I am convinced by the speed and  peculiar light arrangement that the aircraft witnessed tonight was either military or totally unidentified.  I must also say that while almost directly over head the ball of light on the West side of the Craft changed positions with the ball of light on the east side of the craft.  That is,  two balls of light were connected to each by no divider.  The most miraculous thing that we saw, was the ball of light to the west pass infront of the ball of light to the east and change positions with it at full speed.  In essence, the aircraft spun horizontally 180 degrees while traveling in a straigjht line, as if the craft suddenly spun around backwards, but continued to fly in the original direction of flight  at the same speed.  The craft ! never altered directiion, and flew in the same flight path, but turned around directly above our position on earth as if it could fly forward and backwards with the same flight characteristics.  The lights of the craft were of one color which does not  satisfy Federal Aviation Regulations of having anti-collision lighting systems, stroble lighting systems, or landing light systems as required on normal civillian aircraft.  As a Private Pilot and an experienced person of the flight environment, I feel that what I have witnessed tonight could have either been a Military flight or an Unidentified Flying Object, but under no circumstances was it a civilian flight.  I called Collumbia Flight Service first to see if they had any knowledge of the aircraft that I had just witnessed, and they gave me a negative response.  However, they directed me to the number for the U.F.O. Reporting Center where I left a recorded message.  I also attempted to contact Scott Airforce Base and  Kansas City Flight Center to inquire about the incident.  There was no answer at either of these facilities, but shortly thereafter I came in contact with Peter Davenport, the Director of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Washington.  He returned my message.  I have three other witnesses who saw the incident and have there own account of the story, but I was the first one to notice the event.  I am fully willing to cooperate to the best of my capabilities regarding this matter, and can be reached at any time at my Carbondale address or telephone  number.   Please contact me for further details or specific information.  This has already been a fulfilling experience, one that I will never forget.  Thank you for your time and understaniding regarding this  matter.  Hopefully, everything we have encountered tonight will only serve to further the human race. Sincerely, ((Name deleted)) Southern Illinois University at Carbondale<n>

I can&#39;t say for sure it was a UFO but planes don&#39;t fly that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home at 8:30 pm heading west on state highway 502 towards Battle Ground. I was about 3-5 miles from Battle Ground when I saw a light traveling south at approximately 1000 feet high in the distance in front of me. The object appeared to be far enough away as to be flying over Battle Ground. It&#39;s appearance was like an airplane at night. It was a white light with a smaller red light on it. At this distance, an airplane would appear to the eye to be traveling relatively slow in perspective. However the object was moving at a fairly rapid rate. My estimate based on it&#39;s altitude and distance in front me was that it would be traveling at several hundred miles per hour. It is the velicity which grabbed my attention. I am used to seeing planes fly as Portland International Airport is about 25 miles away. This moved way faster than anything I&#39;ve seen before. If it weren&#39;t for the velocity, I would have thought it was an aircraft of some sort. The total time I saw this was about 15 seconds and then it disappeared behind some trees which blocked my view.<n>

I&#39;m into astronomy so I am always looking to the night sky,beleive me,what i saw was no type of airliner or shooting star, it was definetly some type of unidentified flying object.

At the time, I did not know there was any place to report it so I just kept my notes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:05 PM on Nov 23rd 1998, I saw an object moving very quickly in the Eastern sky at about a 45 degree angle from Coon Rapids, Minnesota.  The object was a flatter oval shape from my perspective as far as I could tell, but it was quite far away.  The object had a light trail as you might expect from a falling star, but it was not moving as fast as a falling star and the light trail remained constant in brightness.  Falling stars, by contrast typically start out small as they enter the atmosphere, grow larger and then burn out.  Furthermore, you wouldn’t see any object in front of the light trail with a falling star, you would just see the glow.  The object I saw had a definite solid part followed by a stream of light equal to about three times the length of the object.   I watched it for a good 3 to 4 seconds before it went out of site below the horizon.  Given the distance it appeared to travel, the speed exceeded what even a fast military plane could go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

On one occasion there was another witness. On this particular occasion, (11-22-98), it was a misty night and I went out to feed my livestock.  At 8pm it was very dark.  As I was walking to my barn (north) in my pasture, the flash took place to my south on the other side of my house.  The light was coming from ground level, or withing 25 feet or so of ground level near a neighbors house or in the woods behind it.  I estimate it was no more than 200 yards south of my position.  The mist and fog made it possible to pinpoint the source of the light as it lite up a very large &#34;sphere&#34; of the mist around it for as many as 5 seconds, then went out abrubtly.  It was so bright, and the weather conditions seemed so ripe for lightening, that I waited for the thunderclap but it never came.  During the flash there was absolutely no sound coming from it as well. I submit this as a UFO only because it may have been, but I have no idea what it was and I have seen it now three times in the last 5 years, still with no explanation.  Is there any other reports of such phenomenon as is there an easy explanation?  In all locations this has happened, there certain have been indications of power lines, but in no case has there been any sounds, power outages, fires, or any other indication that it was electrical in nature.  And the intensity of the light is beyond any commercially available lighting source that I know of.<n>

We were returning to Spokane area after weekend of youth ice hockey in Portland. Possible others behind us saw but will have to ask at next hockey practice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> White ball of intense white light surrounded by faint white light at about 10 deg (one fist above horiz.) w/ green tail, about 1 fist length also, moving from N to S and parallel to our view of the horizon (no arc at all). Event lasted about 7-8 seconds. Object and tail just vanished at our 1 O&#39;Clock position, no fading out whatsoever. Me=USAF Acad. grad w/ astrophysics backgroung, black program experience, USAF pilot and currently fly commercial. This was not an aircraft, not a meteorite, nor anything else I would not be at liberty to discuss. Wife is college grad. Others in van were children (11&amp;13 YO). Intensity of object was approx 1/4 of full moon.  Someone else must have seen and hope they have intestinal fortitude to talk about it at next hockey practice.  Would not have believed if I did not see myself.  Too weird. What looks like this and moves from 11 O&#39;Clock to 1 O&#39;Clock in 7 or 8 seconds then just vanishes? Would like to know. Polar orbiting satellite in decaying orbit would also not fit what we saw and that was my best guess.<n>

I decided to get out the camcorder to capture it as the sun began to set even further into the horizon hoping to catch the kaleidoscope of colors. 	It took only a few moments to set the camera up on the tripod just outside the backdoor of our house and to start shooting.  I returned inside to get my cup of coffee, and coat, thinking everything would be OK leaving it running on it&#39;s own.  Well, everything did go OK, I returned and continued to let the camcorder do it&#39;s thing. 	Soon the colors began to fade and I stopped recording, removed the camcorder from the tripod and took everything back inside.  Wanting to see if the camcorder had captured the colors, I connected it to the VCR and began replaying the tape.  I was a little put off at first because the recording wasn&#39;t quite as good as I expected.  That&#39;s when &#34;it&#34; appeared and my eyes about popped out of my head.  Something came into the frame, then it appeared to change direction sharply and shot off out of the frame at a high rate of speed. A friend of ours who has knowledge of videos and computers did a video capture of that sequence of the tape.  He then made two still images from that sequence which we are sending to you.  The &#34;avi&#34;, (the video capture sequence), is rather large, but if you would like us to send it we can.  Just e-mail us at the address provided below. We would rather not release our names, street address or telephone number due to my line of work which I have also left blank, but we feel this information might be of value to you.<n>

There was broken cloudcover, and the lights would appear and disappear through the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initial observation was looking out over the ocean (east)from a hotel balcony which limited the overall field of vision. One light passed north to south in a straight line.  I assumed it was a meteor.  Then another light passed south to north within seconds and made a series of minor turns.  I don&#39;t believe that meteors follow curved paths.  My friend then came out and also observed a few of the lights many of which would disappear from our view overhead.  We went down to the beach and found the embers from a camp fire.  I assumed that we had seen flying embers though I didn&#39;t understand how they could have come from very different directions nor how they could seem to disappear through clouds implying some height.  We covered the fire with sand and saw 2 more of the lights. I am an engineer and the other observer an insurance professional.  We have both been amateur astronomers. My perception was that the objects were quite small.  There paths reminded my of wind born objects yet they traveled in very different directions; no two followed the same path.  There apparent origin points would also cover a wide expanse. The apparent brightness of the objects was minimal; no brighter than the stars in Orion&#39;s belt. Please see the 11/14 picture at the following website (http://www.((address deleted)).html). People flying burning gliders?  The changes in &#34;origin&#34; puzzle me, buit the winds were quite strong and gusty.<n>
11/21/98 20:45|Helena (north of, on highway 49)|AR|Circle|30 seconds|A large circular or oval shaped object was observed moving southward in the clear night sky over highway 49 outside of Helena, Arkansas|9/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04977.html|55|ndxe199811| A large circular or oval shaped object was observed moving southward in the clear night sky over highway 49 outside of Helena, Arkansas.  The land over which it moved was flat delta, barren of trees and homes.  The object emitted bright pulsating light, flashing on and off every second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I (age 47, professional) was driving north on highway 49 having crossed the Mississippi River into Arkansas from Missouri.  My father (age 77) sat in the right passenger seat.  My mother (age 74) sat behind him.  It was a dark, clear night.  Stars were visible.  On either side of the road were flat delta rice fields.  I don&#39;t believe there were any trees.  No homes were in sight.  The road ahead was straight and flat.  I had a clear view ahead as far as the eye could see at night.  There were no headlights ahead.  Behind me I saw the distant headlights from a car far behind.  I noticed bright white flashing lights a few hundred yards ahead, up and to my right, somewhat higher than I might expect to find the tallest treetop.  My first thought, as I recollect, was that I was seeing a light tower.  I was really rather paying scant attention to it at the time.  At about the same time I first saw the object, my mother asked, &#34;What is that?&#34;  I then noticed that the object was moving in the opposite direction in which we were headed.  I remember thinking that it must be a plane.  Again, my attention was not full; I was not particularly interested.  I watched as it flew by and out of sight.  I again directed my attention to the road ahead.  Then in the seconds that followed, for the first time I began to focus more intently on what I had just seen.  I turned back to see if I could catch sight of the object but I did not see it.  I thought then that my inability to see the object was due to the restricted view, limited to the back window and rear-view mirror.  As I gazed at the road ahead of me, the image of what I had seen sharpened.  I realized I had seen a large circular object with a panel of bright white light spaced evenly along its side.  The lights pulsated every second or two.  The object seemed to have a shell of bronze/silver metal.  This was the first time I had the thought that I had seen a &#34;UFO.&#34;  I turned toward my mother and asked, &#34;What did you just see?&#34;  She, too, described a large circular ob! ject with bright white lights around it.  My mother had a somewhat longer look at the object.  She watched the object move from the window to her right.  As she described it, she turned to her right to follow the object&#39;s flight when it suddenly disappeared.  Neither of us had heard sound.  What made this sighting especially intriguing to me is that my mother had seen this object.  Although I&#39;d never before laid claim to observing a UFO, I do maintain an interest in the phenomenon.  My mother, on the other hand, has no interest in such things and would not believe in the possibility of UFOs and visitations (of course I realize that a UFO would not necessarily imply otherwordly objects).  My mother remains convinced that she did not see an airplane or other aircraft she might identify.  She was rather stunned in fact.  At home, later that evening, my mother and I drew what we had seen.  The drawings were essentially similar, the slight difference likely accountable to the different perspective in viewing.  I might add that my father did not observe anything unusual.  I attempted to account for that.  He said that he was neither asleep nor had his eyes closed, but I&#39;m not certain of that.  I know, sadly, that my father has lost his sharpness of mind over the last several years (early stage dementia is suspected).  I also know that there was not any fuss as the event unfolded.  Other than my mother&#39;s simple question, &#34;What is that?&#34; no other words were spoken.  My father&#39;s attention was not called by these words.<n>

But it approached us from our left. Came across the highway. Crossed the hood of the truck and continued traveling to uor right. Before I describe this thing I must express the importance of our location. Hampton Tn is a small Appalacha town in the heart of the blue ridge Mtns very low populated. Where we were at it was grazing pastures and forrest. Even at this time of night there is not much traffic on the roads. What we saw was a reflection traveling on the ground. Triangle in shape, but this is the strange thing the reflection on the ground appeared glass like. It was sort of like in the superman movies wher the 3 super villians were taking away from krpton that thing that transported them. Very strange my son said we should report. I never would. Anyway here is this triangle reflection traveling on the ground cross over the hood and keeps going. So I got out to examine the area or to see if there was a logical answer for this there was none no house around to cause a reflection there are no trains in the area. The sky was clean. No helicopters in the air. It did not compare to a helicopter searchlight anyway because I know what they are like. Nothing if you could have seen this you would have said it appeared like watery glass.<n>

My wife and I were watching television on Friday night.  My wife said she thought she saw lightning in the sky.  I did&#39;t think much of it until I turned the TV set off and with the room being darker, I saw a flash myself.  I didn&#39;t see it directly, because a building next door was blocking it.  I kept looking and seconds later, there were many flashes across the eastern portion of the sky, but they were colored!  I had never seen anything like it.  The display was so remarkable, that I was literally shaking with fear.  I called my wife back to the window and she observed several flashes with me.  Some were low enough that they silhouetted the I-5 bridge before us.  It had the appearance of fireworks being obscured by clouds, except for the fact that it covered a far too great portion of the sky. From our vantage point, we can see directly to the east, and a bit to the north, with limited views to the south due to buildings close by.  At least one flash appeared to have structure to it, almost like a laser beam.  But again, this display covered a VERY large portion of the sky.  After about ten minutes the flashes stopped.  I spoke with my neighbor and he and his housemate saw them as well.  I was so taken by the experience that I called the police to report it as it was happening.  They reported some transformers were exploding, but nothing that matched what I saw.  I work at NOAA, and spoke to a meteorologist about it, and he could not offer an explanation either.  I&#39;ll never forget what I saw.  It was spectacular. Thank you.<n>

The youngest of us, who then was probably 9 or 10 years of age told us to look at the object flying in the sky.  We told him it was just a plane that was flying low over the neighborhood.  As it got closer we realized he wasn&#39;t lying and what he saw wasn&#39;t a plane but a triangle shaped object that had no sound to it, or very little because no one paid attention to the sound.  The object looked like a triangle but had smooth corners like that of a thick dorito chip.  We all stood there for a couple minutes staring at the object and it continued to move over our houses.  The object was flying much lower than any plane and had three or four main lights with smaller symmetrical lights between the main ones.  The lighting was not any different color than that of a normal halogen lightbulb, although it was much larger.  I haven&#39;t seen one since and none of us have talked about it because we lost touch.  The neighbors I saw it with were all part of the same household and I myself lived next door.  They ended up returning to their hometown in Canada, which is why we haven&#39;t talked since.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It continued straight for five seconds, then made an eighty degree left turn to the n.e. in about a quarter of a second, continued in a straight path for another four or five seconds, then made another quarter second right turn to due east. We observed it for two or three more seconds, then it appeared to vanish. As it passed through several star fields, my friend noted he could make out what appeared to be a sort of transparent triangle shape around the central light, which I did not notice. He said it was rather large,as large as the full moon. We guessed the craft was quite low to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A satellite in low earth orbit almost certainly would not be visible from the ground at 0330 hrs.

11/19/98 21:30|Surprise|AZ|Formation|0:45|Formation of stationary lights - most turning on and off and VERY similar to the infamous March 13 Phoenix sightings|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05034.html|67|ndxe199811| Formation of stationary lights - most turning on and off and VERY similar to the infamous March 13 Phoenix sightings<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:45 my father, who lives about a half mile from me, called and said he had been watching these lights go on and off for about 10 minutes and that I should meet him outside to check them out. I arrived to see a stationary yellow light (which i&#39;ll call the &#34;main&#34; light through the rest of this description) which was at least twice the magnitude of the brightest star in the southern sky.  The light was flickering somewhat like a distant light on the horizon would.  This light was located pretty much due south from our vantage point (Bell Rd. and Reems Rd.).  We watched the light for about 2 minutes and noted some lights on the ground directly below it for reference to see if the light moved east/west and it did not.  Soon another identical light appeared slightly below and to the west of the first light.  The distance between the 2 was about that of 4 fingers held at arms length.  From our location we could also see the lights from Luke AF Base which is about 2 miles east and 6 miles south of us.  So this seemed to put the lights about 2 miles west of the base. At this point we jumped in the car and began heading south to the end of Reems Rd. (1 mile south of Luke AFB).  During these 7 miles heading south, the main light was straight ahead, just barely west of the center of the road.  It went out a few times but came right back on.  The second light however now had a few companions right next to it that continued to come on and off in about 1 second intervals - VERY reminiscent of the famous sighting of March 13, which I have seen on video clips many times. The distance between each light in the &#34;set&#34; of lights to the west of the main light was about 1/4 fingers width apart held at arms length. They would turn on and off in random sequence, usually side by side with a slight arc if they had been connected with a line, and at one point came on and off in a sequence which, had they all been on simutaneously, was in the pattern of a greater than symbol.  At any one time, there were up to 3 lights on at the same time in the &#34;set&#34;. Had they all been on simultaneously there were about 7 or 8 lights total, assuming they were all stationary. As we got to the end of Reems Rd., we headed west about 2-3 miles to Highway (&#34;Loop&#34;) 303 and turned back south.  At this point, the main light was now slightly to the east of the road.  This told us that the light was a lot closer than a star, for example. And by using triangulation, the light main light would be located south and somewhere between these 2 roads. We traveled another 6-8 miles south to Broadway Rd. and stopped and got out of the car. From the time we left the house, it was approximately 30 minutes and the main light had NOT moved, while the others inconsistently but continually came on and off in the same area of the sky.  We had travelled a total of about 15 miles south and were still seemingly quite north of them.  Finally, the main light disappeared only to reappear about 15 seconds later with another light of the same magnitude RIGHT next to it.  Both of these lights then went out.  I was low on gas and my dad hadn&#39;t even told my mom he was leaving the house so we just left perplexed.  We looked back quite a few times but saw nothing. I just want to make it clear that NONE of these lights ever moved.  The &#34;set&#34; came on and off way too rapidly and continuosly in the same spot to be flares.  As for the main light, I don&#39;t know of any flare or plane that could stay in the exact same spot in the sky for 45 minutes. There was no audible sound, no smoke, no activity from the Air Force Base (i.e. no incoming/outgoing aircraft) or anything other than the glowing yellow lights - and the altitude was about that of those in the videos of the March 13 sightings.  This whole incident was just remarkably similar to what I saw on those videos.

Most of the time there was one very bright, orange colored, light, but as many as six were visible at one time during a 90 minute period from 21:00 to 22:30. While the lights did not appear to be moving much, there was some movement. The one very bright light seemed to be stationary, and several others, possibly miles away in distance appeared and disappeared at random. At one time, six could be seen at one time. Local news stations reported getting a lot of calls. The next day the military said it could have been flares...HOWEVER, I cannot imagine how a flare could remain in one place for as long as these were visible. I observed ONE identical light the previous night, November 18, which was visible for 45 to 60 minutes...it also did not move but finally disappeared abruptly not to be seen again that night. I was accompanied by my 14 and 10 year old sons while this observation was made.<n>

This was at great distance, objt small. bit def. round and very brights as if reflec. sunlight.  Lost sight of objt. after sev. mins. It traveled south and east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving to work (Deputy Sheriff) west bound on interstate 80 between Auburn and Loomis, Ca.  I drive this route many times a week both while working and off duty.  On this date, (not sure of exact date) I was momentarily confused by the location of the sun.  I observed it as I came over a hill and began a slow curve to the west.  I believed it should have been more to the north, and as I came out of the curve I realized it was.  The other bright area was to the south of the sun. The sun was behind a high band of cloud, the sky otherwise clear pale blue in color as is normal here this time of year in afternoon. I looked from the sun to the other bright area.  I have never seen this before.  I appeared as if the sun were being reflected off something.  As I watched, the clouds appeared to part in a circular pattern which also seemed curious as I had not seen that before either...I do watch the skys. After about four minutes I noted a very bright object come below the clouds and travel slowly to the south. This appeared to be very far away.  The object was very bright as if the sun were reflecting off of it.  My first thought was aircraft, but it did not appear to have wings and was moving very slowly. At work, about two minutes later, I pointed the bright area out to a co-worker, but from our location the sun was below the trees and only the other bright area could be seen.  It was quickly fading as we watched.  The object was also gone.<n>

I have to tell you it was something to see!  It moved off after a minute or so, slowly at first but then very fast. My wife quite ((deleted)). It blurred right before it sped off. It seemed lit from within.<n>

It was a clear night , I looked up and saw two white colored round objects, bigger than the stars in the night time skies which at first I thought was paper flying in the wind, but it wasn&#39;t moving around as if it was paper. I kept looking closer thinking maybe it was some birds flying at night, but it wasn&#39;t,at some point I blinked to make sure I was really seeing something there. It was moving slowly ,no noise whatsoever, one was  a little ahead of the first one and then they both began to get closer to each other and began to chase each other around , when I saw this I couldn&#39;t believe what i was watching and I was hoping to maybe see someone outside to witness the event , I then ran upstairs to look for my camcorder to try and videotape it but i couldn&#39;t find it in time and was not able to capture the lights.

The skies were clear with clear untinted windows as a passenger watching numerous jets on their paths to airports, I noticed a sudden lack of air traffic.  Then out of nowhere in the sky, from directly south over my right shoulder, I saw an aqua-green very bright blinking lighted object which appeared football shaped, elliptical shaped flying and descending object, only four to five hundred feet away at an altitude of about 300 feet, about 30 degrees upward from the ground plane.  It was traveling at a very high rate of speed, more than 1 mile per second.  It was blinking erratically and appeared to be in trouble. It felt like there was a signal or a message coming from it and I felt a strong sense of a problem within it.  It passed us blinking and occulting and appeared as if it had cra! shed ahead about 2 miles east of the road still parallel to it.  While he continued driving, there was discussion about it between us as my associate was an experienced small craft pilot and I was in the USAF in the 70&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached the area where the craft was downed, not knowing it would move again, I saw it rise to a height just above the vegetation and trees, crossing over the highway but stopping dead center over our northern middle lane facing west.  It was now extremely recognizable as a disk shaped craft which was still slightly blinking but a as a bright shadowish green in nature and clearly translucent as a night shining skin with apparent electricity flowing through it.  I wondered how this could be as I have never experienced such lighting or energy technology. It was clear visible in its entirety from top to just about underneath.  After about 15 seconds we were just 100 feet traveling slower and watching.  I couild tell it was about 3 car lengths in diameter determining its legnth as it appeared over an overpass but this could not be determined as exact as I could not tell if it was directly over the bridge, or might it have been closer or nearer to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It accelerated west and! parallel to the surface exponentially across the highway and continued to accelerate to a speed which just started to make it appear blurred at 4 seconds, quickly turned at a compound angle, 60 degrees to the right and 45 to 50 degrees upward through 2 layers of clouds.  It could be seen as it was going through the second scattered cloud layer and disappeared away from our atmosphere at an extremely high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had only average (laughable) interest in this type phenomenon prior to this encounter and was not a non-believer.  However it did require convincing until this incident.  Now I really do know.  I remained silent about this until now because of the ridicule factor having been a finance company owner.  I have seen... I believe.<n>

At one point one of the  smaller lights went to the bigger light and was absorbed by it as it was still stationary. Finally the other smaller light also went to the large stationary bright white light and also seemed to disappear into the large light and  the white light sped away in a manner that is hard to conceive. We were so dismayed we called 911,the coast guard and the local airport tower to see if they had seen anything unsual and to report the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

In searching the sky my first thot was seeing a flock of geese as moving objects in a V formation began to be visible... the &#39;objects were at fist visible as tho separate-but lighted --- obviously not geese, but in that type of formation.  As it approached slowly, keeping its shape I realized it was a craft of massive triangular size; the V-shaped forward moving sides were lighted--steady,spaced, white lights--almost like lightbulbs.The back side of the triangle was unlit--and the craft itself had an almost opaque shadow quality of color--even at night, that was more discernible as it passed beneath some brighter stars and away from the street lights.  It appeard to be flying at about the height of a low flying plane, but much more massive in size than a plane would be of the same height. It moved somewhat slowly, very steady and with absolutely no sound. Moving from northwesterly to a southeasterly direction.  This is not the usual flight path usually observed in this area for local military or non military bases.  An airplane traveling at a similar height observed three days later, at the normal size visible at that height, appeared much smaller and made tremendous sound.   It&#39;s an image that stays vividly in mind. I grew up in the air force, and lived on base much of that time -- and observed a lot of planes coming and going, and I am aware it could very well be a military craft, possibly not well publicised--but its size, lack of any sound and the pace at which it was moving were out of the norm usually visible in this area.  Is there currently a stealth-type craft that would fit this description?  And how would I find out if there actually was one in this area on that morning?<n>

A translucent object, apparently triangular in shape and about two hand widths wide, no lights whatsoever, moved through my field of view from north to south.  It was moving so rapidly that it quickly was disappearing over the house, so I ran around to the front yard and could still see it continuing directly south out of sight. I doubt that I would have even seen the object if I had not been looking directly at it when it went by. The whole event lasted only about 15 to 20 seconds.  There was no sound whatsoever connected with its passing, but stars could be seen through the object as if looking through a semi-transparent piece of glass with no clean edges. I observed no other lights or objects (and very few meteors). I am prompted to write this report (so late after the event) by the many similar sightings observed of translucent triangular shaped objects since then, most recently in Wisconsin on July 6th.<n>

I tried to convince myself that these were simply meteors, but the fact that they moved horizontally without losing any apparent altitude, combined with the duration of time I witnessed these lights, as well as the unchanging distance between all three lights throughout the event, tells me that these could not have been meteors.  The odds of THREE meteors having the same speed, and direction in a formation that makes a perfect triangle, at the exact same time... God, that&#39;s got to be one hell of an unlikely event.

The road curved ahead of me and it was at this moment when I noticed what I thought to be a falling star. I glanced at this object briefly and then turned my attention back on the road. Out of curiosity, I looked back to where I first noticed the object and did a doubletake when I noticed that it was still their. Not only was it still their, but it appeared to be even closer than before, and I was given the impression that it was travling at an enourmous volacity. As I observed this object with a keen interest, I noticed a long blue contrail behind it. This contrail appeared similar That of NASA&#39;s proposed Ion propolsion system, exept for one thing; their now appeard to be what resembled orange fireballs shooting out the back of this object, and through the contrail. This was very unsettling because I thought I was witnessing an airborne tragedy, A plane on fire, plummeting to the ground. Indeed this object appeared to be loosing altitude with great abandon, and I was surprised once more to see the object bank hard and change directions approximately 180º&#39;s changing from a South-easterly direction to more of a North-westwardly direction. The object&#39;s speed increased greatly after It had modified its waypoints. I past an orchard and momentarily lost site of this object. I thought that was the last that I would see of this object, until it the road directly ahead of me flying about twenty feet from the ground. The triangular object was now flying very slow, and its distinct triangular form was highlighted by small red lights along what appeared to be the sides of the object. These small red lights were alligned in rows along two opposite sides of the object. Their were three small bright white lights, one on each corner of the object. In the center of the object was a large red glowing light about three feet in diameter, not typical of any aircraft I know of. It crossed the highway heading twords an open residential area with many houses. I crossed over a bridge and tur! ned off of the highway onto a small sidestreet. My investigative nature becconed me to fallow this object, which is exactly what happened. I was driving along the small sidestreet, and the object was positioned completely parellel to me. I clocked it with my speedometer, it was travling at approximately 25 MPH. I rolled down my window to observe the sound which I was sure an object of this proportion (about 60 feet long) would make flying at such a low altitude. I was stunned as I concluded that this object made absolutely no sound. It did not rumble or make any vibrations. I could not hear the wind whistling through its wings, because it did not have any. I lost site of the object as it again changed course and ducked below the tree line. With the information which I was able to acertain from this encounter, I can conclude that what I observed was not an airplane. It was certainly an object, It was flying, and I failed to identify it with any object which I am familiar with. It is with sound mind and being, that I certify everything stated above as truth, and the facts stated heriegn reflect the best of my knowledge and recolection of this encounter.<n>

It looked more defined, like a shiny, metal spot (shape unknown) leading a white contrail. I&#39;m a newspaper reporter.

Slowly lost luminosity and disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching the Leonid Meteor Shower from Joshua Tree not far from interstate 10 freeway (i could see freeway in the distance). Facing the freeway (North) at approximately 4:00 am, my attention was drawn to a rather bright star-like object in motion. I would guestimate the magnitude of this object was a -1 or about the brightness of Sirius. It was slowly descending towards the mountains in the distance. Now I have seen many objects in the night sky that I could easily explain such as Meteors, planets, artificiall satellites, airplanes, etc.. But this object did not &#39;act&#39; like any of these. It was moving side to side as it descended, reminding me of a falling feather. As it descended it also seemed to be loosing some brightness but basically dissapeared very unexpectedly. The duration of this sighting was less than a minute. Conditions were mostly clear with some clouds moving in from the West. Interestingly, as I saw this object, meteors simultaneously streaked by it but my attention was focused on this strange light.<n>

I estimate the Distance to be 1/2-1mi. Distance.  The object is estimated to be 50 ft Sphere.  This object casted a Sharp shadow on the desert ground(-12 mag). Watching the object for about 2min it suddenly vanished out of sight!  I was so shocked.  After, I went over to the truck and laid down, closed my eyes, and was awakened by the same object but much closer, Brighter, and bigger!  Hovering there for at least another 2 minutes, it suddenly vanished again out of sight. I was officially getting freaked at that moment. about 5 minutes later, The object came back even closer(500feet away at least).  Also, the object was much brighter, I estimate a magnitude of a -16.  Staying there even longer,  About 5 minutes and it was gone again.Wierdest thing ive ever seen in my life.<n>

I am a police supervisor for one of the local cities in the Kansas City area.  My girlfriend called me very upset because she had just seen an object.  The following is her description as best I can remember.  She was traveling north on the street she lives and the object was seen in the sky to her north, but she stated it was towards the end of her block.  The height that she described was only described as lower than an airplane would fly.  She stated that the object was flying slowly from the east to the west.  She stated that it gave her the feeling that it was going to come after her, so she huried inside her home.  She stated that as she was walking in she was still watching it and after traveling slowly it shot west very fast.  She described it as a glowing object, and one that left a trail.  I asked her to call and she wouldn&#39;t because she was at home and  it was late. ( Her parents are elderly).  We are honest church going people and have no need to be dishonest or phoney.<n>

Upon reporting to my roommate we became suspicious of object.  For one hr. it didn&#39;t move, flashing red, yellow, white. Appeared to be 1-2 miles above far south/se Austin or just north of San Marcos.  We ruled out aircraft and planets/stars.  With binoculars I had to rack focus from stars to object.  There was obvious depth/definition/form to object. It wasn&#39;t aircraft.  It was apparently 1 mile from ground, approx. 20 miles S. of downtown Austin.  Possibly satellite? Only possibility in our opinion.  One wk later a friend in San Antonio told me he saw UFO on same night to north/northeast of SA @ same approx time.  Similar description in height/location.

I was on my way home and my brother was with me. I had just turned off Highway 18 near S.I.R. in Kent, WA. When I rounded the turn on the exit ramp I saw a very bright, round ball of orange light. It was small from my view and at treetop level.  I have no way of judging the distance because it was just hazy enough to block out any terrain refferences or landmarks.  The object appeared at about 15 degrees above the horizon, at treetop level (from my perspective).  The object was south of my position. It moved at a high rate of speed from East to West. I observed it for about 6 seconds then it was gone. When I made the turn off the highway I was headed West, the light was moving past me, not in the opposite direction as when you pass a light on a pole. About a minute after this I turned on The Art Bell Show and Peter Davenport was playing a clip from a woman who described almost exactly what I just saw. Please do not use my name as my supervisors are not a openminded about these things as we are.<n>

As we passed a truck depot, we both noticed what appeared to be a bright egg-shaped object seemingly floating in a field to our left.  It was around one hundred feet in altitude and quite large, but made no sou whatsoever.  Both myself and my friend stopped our car to get out to observe the strange object from the roadside.  Four other people who were walking at the side of the road also stopped to comment on the strange sighting and continued on their way.  Several minutes passed and the object shot up into the sky at a tremendous speed without warning and out of sight within seconds.  This manouvre alone convinced both myself and my friend that wht we saw was not of this world.  I have never seen anything like it before or since this incident, and was a non-believer - but now I am seriously open minded to say the least.  This story is fact and the first time I have reported it.<n>

They were flying in line with the river on my left side.  At first thought it was a low flying airplane headed for an approach for the Pittsburgh airport.  As I looked up again, and the plane seemed to be sitting still.  Then it seemed to move again towards Pittsburgh.  That&#39;s when I noticed the second one further to my left.  They had the same 3 lights and small twinkling red lights.  I pulled over three times to watch these objects. As we passed by in the night I went further on down the road, not looking back, but wondering what could stand still.  I then  decided to call the local TV station to ask if they could find out if there was anything unusual flying to the airport, but they didn&#39;t seem to care.  Then I called 911, they didn&#39;t seem to care.  I then called information to get the airport&#39;s number to see if they had anything on radar unusual, that might put my mind at ease.  I then saw a third and forth objects, both with 3 brighth round lights, and flashing red ones.  When I called the TV station back, they suggested I saw a helicopter.  These were not moving like helicopters and I heard no engine noises at all.  The third and forth moved theh same way as the first two.  I looked up and saw a square outline with the three bright lights, and red lights at the corners.  The forth object then hoovered close to me.  Then it left. This all took place between 10-15 min.<n>

I was heading north and this was east of me.  The object did 2 or 3 full 360 x,y,z axis rotations and I saw a blur of motion and it was gone. When I looked forward it was now over Badger Ordinance, again rotating and moving slowly up and down.  It then stoped all motion and a white lite came out of the bottom.  Then the same blur happened again.  A few minutes later when I was on Badger Hill goin past the junk yard on Hwy 12 the object reappeared above my car.  It couldn&#39;t have been more than 15 feet from point to point and it was made of a black material.  I saw the underside very clearly because it couldn&#39;t have been more than 20 feet above me.  The surface was not completely smooth, it had smooth vulcano shaped object on the bottom that a white light came out of.  Like a spot light.  I saw no markings on the object but I did see a clear amount of detail that I haven&#39;t written here.  I stopped when it was above me, I didn&#39;t know what else to do because I had no camera so I waved at it.  It hoovered about another minute and blurred away again.  I felt no wind and I didn&#39;t hear any noise from it at any time.  I did however find a picture on the internet that looks very close to it.  I also saw the infamous black helicopters in the area of the farm house for about 3 months afterward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

This was the most incredible night, as the shadow moved across the sky I thought it was a low flying plane in trouble but then as it past over me I still could not make out what was happening. I then saw what looked like a heat signture traveling west to east on a very clear night. as I was driving I was listening to WGN radio in Chicago It was the last night of the metor shower as I saw this travel east it was 3-5 degree above the horizon traveling what seemed to be out of sight then the sun caught the object as it moved I could begin to make out the shape of a very large wedge shaped ship very very large ship metalic in color as the sun caught it turned to the left paralell to the horizon with a slight lift to the outter wing it had several turbines on each wing with some sort of cabin in the center of! the wings like a flying wedge as it turned it came into focus very well, then sat stationary and began shooting green fireballs ot of its engines travling what seem to be north to south. About that time the Host on WGN began to get a whole bunch of calls about what they were seeing. I changed stations to WTMJ in Milw Wi and also they were receiving many calls and Gen. Mitchell airport was also aware of what was going on. As I traveled northeast on I-43 I lost sight of this very large ship.Then a peron called on the CB radio and was wondering if anybody else saw that(what he saw)this night was very documented as I found out tonight by google, tonight. I have dicussed this night with many others but never reported just what I saw that night. Well I just did. amazing simpily amazing.

I the caught from the corner of my eye. a streaking object appeared to be ball in shape, and leaving a long tail behind it about 2-3 miles long. this tail and the object had a slight greenish hume to it  the trail was very wide, wider than any meteor i&#39;ve ever seen. But I&#39;m not an expert.  The trail continued and the at about 2-3 miles it stopped leaving a trail. the ball object had disappeared and the trail remained for approxiamtely 45-60 secs. The direction of travel for the object was southwest away from the rising sun. I&#39;ve never seen anything i would consider UFO in Nature and I am very skeptical of it being one but I thought I could at least give you a heads up if this was some thing.   Could this have been a prelude meteor  for the up coming meteor shower?  Thank you for Your time. (Name deleted))<n>
11/16/98 02:30|Austin (Round Rock)|TX|Triangle|5 seconds|Triangular object w/three hemi-spherical 'projections' from the bottom, travelling N-S reflecting pink glow of city lights.|11/19/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04869.html|112|ndxe199811| Triangular object w/three hemi-spherical &#39;projections&#39; from the bottom, travelling N-S reflecting pink glow of city lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching the Leonids meteor shower of 11/16/98, approximately 2:30 AM +/- five minutes.  As I watched one meteor directly overhead, the meteor trail crossed the path of the object. The object appeared to be triangular in shape, with three hemi-spherical projections from the bottom.  Imagine three silver ballons with their stems tied together.  It was about the size of ones thumbnail if held at arms length, or the distance between any two of the three stars that make up Orion&#39;s belt.  It&#39;s leading edge and the leading portions of the projections seemed to be reflecting the pinkish color of a nearby streetlight, or possibly the glow from Austin, but it did not seem to be creating any other light of its own.  The wind was a dead calm and it made no sound. It was moving extrememly fast.  I approximated that it would travel from horizon to horizon in about 10-15 seconds.  I saw it first when it was almost directly overhead, and watched it for about five seconds before it was obscured by a house.  During that time it travelled N-S along a line from Polaris passing roughly between Leo and Orion. I felt it might actually be three silver ballons that someone had let go, or possibly a set of weather balloons, but the object was moving very fast and the wind was a dead calm.  I continued to watch until 3:00 AM but saw nothing else except meteors. I am an amateur astronomer with a degree in Physics.  I am very skeptical about what I saw, but I have no explanation.  I have to count out normal balloons or weather balloons due to the extremely fast movement of the object and the lack of any wind whatsoever.  I was very startled to find a similar report in your database dated 10/8/98, also in Austin.<n>

It looked something like a jellyfish, or an LED, the rounded tip as the front.  Coloring was glowing red at the front.  I do not believe this was one of the meteors because I saw shape around it, someting like Wonder Woman&#39;s tranparent airplane.  Also, this came up over the horizon from the northwest, not from above  as the meteors came into view.

WA<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were heading home late one evening (from another one of her dreaded dog shows!)  We were driving east on the very outskirts of Ellensburg, WA.  We were chatting away, trying to pass the time since it was a long trip home.  It was an extremely clear (and slightly frigid) night.  We both noticed that off to our left, about 50 feet away, was a stationary, extremely bright, orange,  seemingly burning orb.  At that close proximity, it seemed to be about 3 feet across. It was very unnerving. Niether of us talked much of it for the duration of the ride home.  I think we were struggling to rationalize it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The oddest thing that sticks in my head today: Is that it was DEFINATELY dripping something. (I haven&#39;t found anyone online that has seen one &#34;dripping&#34;. (?) It was a thicker consistency than water it seemed.  It&#39;s hard for me to guesstimate how high off the ground it was, as the hwy/road we were driving on is elevated from the valley floor below.  But from the perpective of the level of the road, It could not have been more than 30 feet.  So Maybe it was 100&#39; of the ground?  Final note:  Oddly enough, when I was trying to research this phenominon at the local liabrary - I found a small book entitled &#34;Orange Light Theory&#34;!  The information was focused on the history of similar activity in that area dating back into the native american history.  It also noted that one of the more recent and documented cases were from volunteers that were at &#34;fire look out&#34; builings located on each end of the valley.  They both continuously kept tabs with each other via radio, on whether it was something for them to dispatch firefighters.  Or whether it was one of the stationary orange lights they were getting used to seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

When the company arrived at the LZ, all of the marines and instructors put their gear down and got their sleeping bags ready for a night under the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as everyone began to get in their sleeping bags, a very large triangular shaped craft appeared over the tree-line about 100&#39; above the tops of the trees.  Everyone stopped what they were doing and all eyes and attention were fixed on this ufo, as it was nearly on top of us.  No-one was looking around or talking; it was almost like we couldn&#39;t keep from looking/watching it, as none of us has ever witnessed anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark outside, but there was enough star-light/moon-light to clearly see this craft.

On the underside of the craft there were three circular lights near each tip of the ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the ufo passed, it was like nothing ever happened and no one seemed to talk about it.  A few years later, after I got out of the marines, I was to the point were I thought it was a dream, so I called two of my close buddies and they told me everything I have told you...It was no dream, and it wasn&#39;t any military aircraft that we are capable of making.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

They contiued south for about 2 to 3 minutes covering about a 30-40 degree arc of the sky, at which point I came into the house to bring someone out, but nobody wanted to so a few moments later I stepped back outside to resume viewing, but the points of light and their trails were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was white with little blinking lights around the underside. (red,white flashes) It looked huge! It was hovering slowly back and forth not moving like any plane or helicopter would be. And the size!  I have never seen anything that large in the sky before.  We drove toward it for awhile and then we turned off the road.  We thought it too weird to be a real UFO. But I think we are in denial.  I truly believe we saw a UFO now that I know (from this site) that others have seen similar things.  I can sum it up in one word, wow.<n>

It made a lateral and diagonal move very rapidly, then spun, and shot north-northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On November 15, 1998 I was driving southbound on I-35 with my 14 year old son. I noticed two odd lights hovering about 30 to 40 feet above on the other side of the highway. they began to blink in an odd sequence, and I loudly woke my son and pointed at the lights. About this time, a row of lights appeared to the side of the first two ones. they lit up in rapid sequence and then went back out. When this happened, I could see a very large shape behind them, disk or saucer and dull gray, silver. If I were to hazard a guess, the lights dissected the craft in the middle. The craft then made several strange moves, very rapidly diagonally and laterally, unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen. As I driving, I told my son to follow it with his eyes. As our car passed it, he reported whirling lights on the top which swirled around fast in the opposite direction they had been, and the craft shot out of sight, extremely fast, headed north- northeast. It might be of note that there was a light fog when I first saw the object. As the trip progressed, it became worse. But at the time, it wasn&#39;t so dense as to cloud our vision. We also thought a few miles down the road that we saw another, smaller craft blinking lights, but that could just have been excitement. oh, and the dash lights went out in my car and the radio station went out.<n>

My brother and I had been pheasant hunting all day in the Clarkston area. I would not have seen the disc except that my headlights and the headlights of an oncoming car reflected off of it&#39;s surface. The oncoming car and mine were going to meet each other at the top of a small rise. As our headlights were pointed up the rise, they reflected off of a disc shaped object. My brother was asleep, and I did not have time to wake him. The disc was slowly moving from right to left. It was the color of wet, smooth concrete, and about as wide as the road.  Ido not know if the other car saw it or not. I went back to the same spot the next day and there was nothing haning over the road that I could have mistaken for what I saw. We drove directly underneath it (it was probably 30 feet above the road). By the time I stopped, I could not see it.<n>

They all illuminated bright white lights that would light up the surrounding sky. There were airplanes flying all around them so we ruled out aircraft. They weren&#39;t planets or stars because they kept illuminating a bright light that got brighter then dimmer.  After about ten minutes, the larger one shone a bright, bright, white light, dimmed and streaked across the entire horizon in less then a second. It was awesome. The other three hovered, then moved back and forth from east to west for about a minute then two took off west while the third took off east. My son and I witnessed this and was able to videotape about 2 minutes worth. My husband got on the roof with binoculars and said he thought it was some type of military helicopters but I&#39;m not so sure. Just curious if anyone else has reported anything or has an explanation.<n>

They glowed a white color, but they did not illuminate anything around them. I could not see any eyes or mouth. I wasn&#39;t too scared because on November 7, 1997 I saw the same kind of alien hover out of my bathroom. I watched the 3 glowing aliens for 5 minutes then I hid under the sheets. I haven&#39;t seen anymore since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report is from anonymous source.  We cannot confirm report.  PD))<n>

The five of us were returning a rental truck to lawton, we started our journey from Anadarko. We were following the rental truck, a co-worker and I were on a 58 belair, a classic, and in great shape, it was warm that night, I remember that, the windows were rolled down, anyway, we were following the truck, when we decided to pull off to get a coke. The other party kept going, we took maybe 8 minutes or so, before getting back on the road. We were traveling about 80 mph when looking forward and to our left, we noticed what appeared to be two cars chasing each other traveling perpendicular to our path. We continued our descent into the small valley, we continued to watch the cars chase. As we started our ascend up to the top, it appeared the cars would crash into us. My partner yelled &#34;hit the brakes&#34; we lost control temporarily of the car, but managed to get control back. As I looked right, I could see him pressed up againt the windsheild, staring at the object. The ship stopped, and raised up about twenty feet above us. I glanced up and seen what appeared and very prevalent to be a battleship. The warship was jet black, with red symbols all over it. The image that sticks in my mind is that of the television show battlestar galatica. It looked like a battlestar minus the downward fins it dragged. The ship was heavily armored, but did not have any turrets or missles on it. One thing I could feel from the ship it was a battlecruiser. I glanced forward up the road, I noticed no sound at all with the exception of the car. Then as I looked ahead the entire area lit up bright orange as if it was daylight. I looked up at the ship again, it was there hovering, then it just went straight up, so quickly it reminded me of Star Trek, when the enterprise goes into warp, it looked like that. It disappeared. I now know why the government has been hiding the existence of UFO&#39;s, There are many wars going on around us, we know noth! ing of t hem. That battlecruiser was here observing missle launches going on at lawton. It was not a saucer or cigar, or anything like that, this was a battleship, why would they send a battleship? We need to ((three words deleted))  together!!!!<n>

I am posting an incident that happened a couple of years ago. I was outside of a restaraunt waiting for my family to come out after dinner and I was looking at the clouds in the night sky and I noticed three white steady lights in a triangle pattern moving at an incredible rate of speed in and out of the clouds absolutely silent. I was at approx. 5500 feet in elevation and this craft must have been at 12,000 feet or more. At that altitude it traversed the sky from the time I saw it to its dissapearance in about 5 seconds! I dont know of any aircraft that I have seen from the ground travel that fast. It looked so unnatural to what I am used to seeing that it still confuses me in regards to what I saw that night.<n>

It was a chilly nov night, with a starry sky. As we were talking I happened to look up, as this large, silent black triangle shaped craft floated over the building next to us, and passed right over us. As it went by It made no noise, and was probably 100 feet up, it was huge, and black against the starry night sky. It has a small white light at each corner of the triangle, and in the middle of the bottom it had a light that glowed blood-red in color. Around the outide of the red light were 3 little white lights that rotated around it, staying the same distance apart as they rotated. I would guess when the craft floated overhead and away from us, it might of been going 30 mph or so, not very fast. What amazed me the most, was that this thing was huge and awesome, and was heading right over the main part of a town of 10,000 people. And unless you were looking up, you wouldnt even know it was passing over ! Three other people saw the craft also as it passed over us. One was a Nurse RN, the other a unit clerk, and my friend and I were janitors, we all worked at the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They observed a brilliant green flash lasting about 1 second that seemed to come from the south behind garage and lit up the entire sky.  Unknown whether source of light was close by or far away but no explosion was heard.  Second identical flash occurred about 10 seconds later coming from same direction.  Light had color of copper vapor laser.  Observers thought some kind of electrical transformer may have shorted out in the storm but power was not lost.  However, on returning inside they discovered cable T.V. was lost for one hour.  Also, our computer and a neighbor&#39;s both turned on by themselves and stayed on all night as if the screen saver had been lost on both of them.<n>

The object was pale, luminous and green/blue in color. The color and amount of &#34;glow&#34; seemed to be an attempt to make the craft &#34;inconpicuos&#34; if that is possible! I heard no unusual sounds, none that seemed to emit from the craft. It seemed to be travelling quite high in the atmospere. I would estimate that a silver dollar held at arms length would have covered the object. It was not directly overhead, slightly lower angle. As it moved further to the north I began to see small, bright white lights on the back inside curve of the &#34;boomerang&#34;. The object moved at a steady speed and did not change direction. I observed it from between one to two minutes until I lost sight of it in the tops of the trees that run along the nort side of our property. This ocurred on the morning of a meteor shower but I have never seen a meteor look or behave this way!<n>

Object hovered, did split second U-turns, appeared to be &#39;playing,&#39; or &#39;dancing.&#39; There was no sound emitted. The only light from the craft seemed to be reflected from the moon. Object when first sighted was moving towards the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of November 12, in Bend, Oregon, I was outside of my home observing the moon and the planets currently visible. My roommate had asked that if they were at all visible to let him know (it has been overcast alot here lately). It was clear. I went in and we both came out. I was pointing out a neighborhood light that was in violation of an Oregon code because it was not subdued (any amateur astronomer can relate,) when he pointed to an object in the sky and asked me what it was. I first saw the object heading due west and was about to say it must be an airliner when I saw it do an unbelievable U-turn. Astonished, we both watched this &#39;craft&#39; do maneuvers that would be impossible for any known aircraft to perform. I am a veteran, and used to work while A-10&#39;s and a variety of other aircraft flew overhead. What we saw seemed to be so unhindered by gravity that I can only describe it&#39;s behavior as playful, like it was &#39;dancing&#39; in the air. It performed multiple U-turns, and would accelerate to incredible speeds and then come to a complete halt in what seemed milliseconds. It made absolutely no sound at all. I would estimate it&#39;s distance from us to be anywhere from one to three miles away, and it&#39;s size as possibly quite large. I did see a very distinct &#39;disk&#39; shape. The thing eventually seemed to vanish, and we remained outside for about another hour watching for it before we gave up and went inside. I am an Archaeology student, my roommate is a Geologist. We are both well grounded in science and the tradition that believes empirical data adds to the human understanding of ourselves and our surroundings. If this comes off sounding like a disclaimer let me just add that our &#39;data&#39; goes against everything we have been tought to believe. I did not want, nor wish, to see such a thing. Nevertheless, I, we, saw the damned thing. For myself it calls too much into question. But there it is.<n>

(It appeared to be flying throught the &#34;cup&#34; of the big dipper!) Having witnessed militatry aircraft ABOVE our cruise altitude in the past, (ie. 60,000 feet), we thought we would query the air traffic controllers as to the source of this strobe. (Interesting to note... very shortly after we mentioned this over the radio, the blinking strobe light stopped entirely.) After mentioning this sighting to two different air traffic controllers, the second offered the UFO Center phone and web sight address...  We continue to feel that we wittnessed a military aircraft of some kind, however we could not get any confirmation from ATC.  By the way, ATC mentioned that their radar coverage reaches up to 99,000 feet! A UFO, maybe? Possibly some new military &#34;Hot Stuff&#34;?? Maybe you could confirm?! Thanx and Happy Landings!

I was in Oxford, MS on business, and stopped at a friends apartment befor going out for the night.  On the drive over, my other friends and I had japed that it was a perfect night to see a U.F.O. because of the beautiful clear sky.  I stepped out back (9:45)to light a cigarette, and happened to glance at the tree covered sky line, to see what I thought was a kite flying in the distance.  It appeared to be a black plastic triangular kite, barely reflecting the light.  As the object got closer (about the size of my hand held at arms leangth), I thought maybe someone had lost a kite and it was flying free. The only thing that seemed stange was the fact that the object was flying in a straight line. At this point I realized I could make out the shape of the object because of it&#39;s reflective or illuminated front sides.  As the thing approched almost directly overhead the it was still almost invisible, other than the nine or eleven very dim lights outlining the front.  at this time it had gone from legal pad sized to a full arms lenght across.  I new I didn&#39;t have a camera, so I called into the apartment to get some attention.  Three friend came outside to see the object pass overhead and disapear into the night on the opposit horizon.  Although the triangle seemed to light up in the front, we could not tell if it was reflecting light or self illuminated.  the triangle was so faint that if you were not looking directly at it, you couldn&#39;t see it.  It didn&#39;t stand out aginst the night at all.  The object made no sounds or sudden movements.  As a matter of fact, it did nothing spectacular at all. I&#39;v always believed in U.F.O&#39;S, but never that I would see one: until now.  I don&#39;t know what to make of this. Danny H.<n>

There were at least 10 white spotlight type lights on the leading edges of the craft and at least one of the lights seemed to move in a random manner inside the craft itself. This was all viewed by my wife and my self from the rear of the craft and the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event seemed to take place rather quickly. To be honest, my wife and I do describe the object itself in slightly different ways. My first impression of the object was that it looked impossibly large, yet somehow &#34;faked&#34; - in the sense that It reminded me of a projection or a hologram. My wife also thought it looked unreal, but her impression was that it was like an orgami shape. We both agree that it was VERY large and had at least ten bright round white lights on it. These were like spotlights except they thru down no beams, for lack of a better description. I estimate that we were no more than a mile or so away from the craft upon initially seeing it. It moved rather quickly to the north or north east and became progressively harder to see because of the cloudcover in the area at that time. 10 seconds or so after spotting it - I thought to run inside and grab my camcorder, but I had no sooner made it thru the front door, when my wife said (in a very non-plussed way) &#34;it&#39;s gone&#34;. in the interim, as I ran into the house she says that it looked like it was turning hard to the east, as if it was standing on it&#39;s edge, and then &#34;changed shape&#34; and became more spherical right before it dissapeared. When it vanished it did not speed off in any one direction - rather it simply dissapeared. As far as I&#39;m concerned, that backs up my projection theory, at least in some respects. However, that would be one heck of a powerfull projector, to put an image on cloudcover at 5000 or so feet. Now, some background. I am 29 years old and I work in Provisioning for AT&amp;T. To be honest, I have always enjoyed stargazing and have always said that I have an open mind about UFO&#39;s and would like to see one, but seeing this really blew my mind. Having said that, let me also restate the seeming &#34;unreality&#34; of the whole event in both my wifes and my own perceptions of it. By the way, my wife is 33 and she is a stay at home mom. We have a 8 month old daughter that was sleeping on the couch at the time of the sighting. Our main reason for reporting this is absolutely NOT for gain or publicity, but out of a simple curiosity... I wonder if you have recieved any similar reports from others in our area at the same time. Please call if you have any questions.<n>

Accompanying this round fireball, was a long white tail that was emitting sparks, like a fourth of July sparkler, and dropping dark unknown debris.  It was observed to be at a very low altitude.  I observed this object for approximately one and one half minutes, before it just disappeared before my eyes.  It left no trace of it&#39;s presence behind.  I am quite sure of the date, as my son&#39;s birthday was to be the next day, November 12th.  I am also sure of the time as I am scheduled to work at 8:oo P.M.

Then the &#34;tail&#34; of the object disappeared and it looked like this thing came to a stop.  It was a little far away. . .not right over us.  It was silvery/gray in color.  It was disc-shaped, but rounded on the sides and top.  It moved horizontally very quickly, then moved away from our direction.  It moved fast, but not so fast it looked like it vanished.  We watched it until it was out of our vision.<n>

My wife was out and I was up outside waiting for her looking up to see the stars.  I was hoping to see a falling star so that I could make a wish (nothing else to do I guess..) Looking towards the stars I started to not stare any any particular one but adjusted my eyes so that I could look sort of in oblivion and take in as much starlight as I could and there it was..out of the corner of my eye I saw a shooting star and looked in that direction when I saw a flash liske that of an high altitude aircraft.  It was hard to make out exactly where the flash was so while staring in the general direction I again stared not at a perticular place but took in as much strlight as I could thinking I&#39;ll track the aircraft.  No such luck, there was the flash again and in the same position and again the flash, still in the same position, I&#39;m now staring at the exact postion but looking about 3- 5 degress to the right of it because of the natural night vision the eyes have. I saw the flash about two more times and out of the corner of my eye I saw again what I thought was a meteor on re-entry.  I have given this sighting a lot of thought and in the end what I have concluded is that the speed at which the object was travelling given it&#39;s random flashing of light it appeared to me as a falling star or meteor burning up on earth entry while in fact this was not the case. This sighting was a high altitute sighting, quite possibly in the FL80 range or higher...(80,000) I also reported the sighting to the US Air Force Air Station here in Antigua and was surprised to learn that I was the second person to call confirming such a sighting.<n>

We were talking looking at the sky saying how clear it was. Then looked up at the sky again and saw an object travelling above the houses. I said something like &#34;Woah!&#34; and my friend looked up to catch it just as it was going past. It seemed to be an egg shaped thing, travelling very very fast and it was glowing green/yellow in colour. It appeared to leave a trail behind it which was also green/yellow. The trail didn&#39;t remain fo any length of time so it may have been just the light from the craft leaving a trail because of its speed. There was no noise at all. It appeared to be quite high in the sky, but not high enough to be any sort of plane or shooting star. It travelled in a very straight line, unlike shooting stars which fall rather than fly. Its difficult to judge how big it was. It looked a bit smaller than a rugby ball. Thats about it. Cynthia AND MY SISTER NAME IS LAUREN BULLARD<n>

As I traveled closer to it I saw a round white light in the center of the object and a silver sphere on either side.  I could barely see that these were fixed to an oval-shaped structure that was just longer than the width of the median.  I could not get my daughter&#39;s attention to look at the object. This did not look like an airplane or helicopter.  The round light was approximately 5 ft. in diameter, as were the silver spheres.<n>

Suddenly, one object fell at a 90 degree angle straight down, blinking continously. The other object remained hovering as the second fell. The falling object then came to a stop over the San Joaquin River(Fresno-Madera County Line) and kept blinking. Objects were lost to sight as I was driving. Weather-Cloudy and light-moderate rain. Visibility good given the circumstances.Time was 18:48 PST. Other witnesses-unknown, but there were several cars behind me, so I assume that those people in the cars saw the same objects. Interference on car: none. Interference on car radio: none.Total time of observation: 15-20 seconds. Background of observer: Grad Student at Cal State Univ Fresno-Master&#39;s Candidate in History and USMC Officer Candidate. Will be attending USMC Officer Candidate School Feb-Mar 99 as aviation officer-prospective Naval Flight Officer(Navigator). Am familiar with aircraft lights-CSUF is in the traffic pattern for Fresno-Yosemite IAP, as is my hometown of Auberry-also, given my career choice-I had better be familiar with aircraft,helicopters, etc.<n>

His first words to me were ,&#34;What the hell is that!&#34;  I looked up and saw a disk-like abject in the shy directly above Mount Baldy here in CA.  It seemed to be at a very high altitude and was turning so that the sun reflected off of it.  At that point, we both saw a small black dot with a dual jet-stream following what appeard to be a small black jet-fighter.  The object was moving at a speed of no more than an hour hand on a analog clock.  It was then when we called Edwards Air Force Base.  They got irritated when at our call and asked why we called them.  They also stated it was a, &#34;Metalic weather baloon&#34;, and told us to call the FAA. I did so and the official gave me this address.  It might be important to add, that my friend saw it at 1500hrs. but this time, while trying to get my attention, said it just vanished: also, I saw another fighter, or what seemed to be.  That is about all I can think of.<n>

The residential power on my block was out, but the street lights were still functioning. I had opened up my blinds in order to let in some of this light. With the power out, I became very bored, and called up my friend to chat (my phone was still functioning). While I talked to her, I was casually studying the sky outside my window. It was then that I noticed a green glowing ball in the sky. I informed my friend, and she causually brushed it off. I, in turn, became intrigued. Within the next hour, I saw five more of these objects. They appeared in the South-East part of the sky, and traveled soundlessly to the North-West, where they dissappeared out of my view. They flew at what appeared to be the same altitude as the planes that usually fly in the area, though, curiously, I can&#39;t recall any planes in the area at the time. I know that the objects weren&#39;t planes. I live realitively near O&#39;Hare airport, and have literaly hundreds of planes fly over me every year. I know what they look like, and sound like, and these objects were denfinatly not them. These objects were sphereical and neon green. They looked a bit like comets without tails. At this point, I have no idea what I saw on that night. My friend (the one I was on the phone with) has spent a great deal of time trying to convince me to drop the subject, saying that it was probably something very normal. I then pointed out to her that green flying balls are *not* normal. I want to know what was in the sky that night, flying over my head. I hope that reporting it can help me solve this mystery.<n>

I was facing the house, looking up at the more or less cloudy sky, when I spotted a weird light.  At first glance it appeared as another plane...or a star?  No, look again.  It was at a wierd altitude for a standard aircraft, and at a closer look, it sort of looked like two bright stars stuck together...but it was moving.  Object had no traditional aircraft lights,(i.e. blinkers, reds, blues), just plain white light.  What really perplexed me was the movement.  The object was gliding, moving along with the clouds; same speed and same direction.  I know it sounds dimpy, but I got the feeling that it was trying to hide.  Craft made no noises.<n>

In full view.. above the high rise buildings in Downtown L.A. suddenly leaving a trail as if breaking up.. and then it completely disappeared as if it vaporized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this time last week (Sunday, November 8).. as I was sitting on my balcony enjoying my pipe &#39;n quiet time.. that a most unusual event took place. (By the way.. it&#39;s good Black Cavendish tobacco.. not pot! I work as a Counselor for one of the comprehensive LAUSD high schools. And unlike Bill.. I truly never have inhaled! My brothers smoked enough for all of us.) Anyway.. I live in the heart of the city of Los Angeles with the high rise buildings framing my living room view in an exquiste panoramic style. Having lived in Downtown for several years, now.. I have grown accostumed to the several single and twin engine airplanes as well as police, News media.. and corporate helicopters that often circle round both day and night.. the several city blocks that make up Downtown. Suddenly.. and speeding through the night sky from a southern horizontal direction.. (I would say whizzing.. but it was absolutely noiseless.. there was no sound..) came a ball of fire.. approximately 2 stories high and perfectly round.. as I compared this irregular sight with the high rise buildings. This object was heading somewhat north (northeast). It definitely was NOT not a shooting star nor comet.. heading in even the slightest downward vertical direction. It was not the Moon. It was not birds. It wasn&#39;t even Superman. My first, startled.. and only impression was: &#34;Lord God?!&#34; thinking that it could have crashed into any of these buildings just as in any of those recent blockbuster movies. This fireball appeared no further than 3/4th of a mile away.. and traveled not much more than a mile from my home. The entire event was always visable. Perfectly framed by two tall buildings.. the event ended seconds later.. perhaps, directly above the Union Station (I was a MetroLink communter to Chatsworth for an entire year.. and am aware of nearby locations).  And though my estimation of height is terribly inaccurate.. I would guess.. it was the typical and same altitude that all small aircraft fly.. here in the Downtown area.  Within split seconds.. this enormously silent ball was leaving a &#34;skid mark&#34; in its wake.. before it fully vaporized and disappeared. It was moving with the silence and speed of a missle.. but there was no explosion. Well, I sat for perhaps twenty minutes to a half hour in amazement and complete disbelief as I struggled to reconstruct and understand the all too brief and all too unusual sight. In addition, I was hoping to see if some police helicopter or airplane would be in the air.. checking out the strange anomaly. Beyond that.. I saw nothing.. and heard nothing reported in the News this entire week.<n>

The object was four times the size of the north star &#34;Polaris.&#34; It was at least 10 times brighter than the brightest star in the sky. At its brightest moment it appeared to have the structure of a cross which bulbed out at each end. It traveled N.W. to S.W. at a consistent speed and appeared to be floating, instead of being propelled across the sky. Between 7-10 minutes later, as it approached the South West, it came to a complete stop for about 10 seconds. Then between 5-8 smaller objects began to fall out of the larger object. The smaller objects which fell out of the larger one fell for 15-25 seconds.  Each object that fell from the larger one, fell straight to the earth for 2-3 seconds and then another one would fall. The smaller objects were extremely bright and moved at a high consistent speed. After each of the smaller objects made their way to the earth, the bigger orange object became less bright.  After the last small object fell, the larger orange object dissappeared for a split second and then re-appeared brighter than before.  This is when the cross shape structure of the object was visible. It remained at a dead stop for a few seconds and then dissapeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I have just recently moved to the Charleston area from Denver Colorado.  She was raised in Atlanta and I was raised in Denver, Colorado and Seattle Washington. She has been living on the Isle of Palmes for about five months.  On November 7, 1998, we had just returend from dinner.  It was between 21:50 and 22:00 when we both noticed a bright orange object in the North West.  There was no clouds in the entire sky. It was about four times the size of the north star and at least ten times brighter.  It was a bright consistent orange light and it never changed color or brightness until the end. It moved towards the South West, traveling very slowly at a very consistent speed.  It appeared to be floating instread of being propelled.  It made no sound. We watched it float across the sky for at least five minutes before it came to a complete stop in the South West sky.  It stayed there for about ten seconds. The stop was extremely sudden and abrupt. After about ten seconds, smaller objects began to fall from the large orange object. They fell for about 15-25 seconds and there was between 5-8 total objects that fell from the bigger one. They were very bright and fell extremely fast. Each small object fell for about 2-4 seconds and then another one would fall.  Each time a smaller object would fall, the orange object became less bright.  After the last small object fell the orange object dissappeared for a split second and then re-appeared brighter than before.  At the objects brightest moment, it appeared to have structure.  The structure resembled two perpendicular bars that bulbed out at the end.  My girlfriend discribed it as two dog bones perpendicular to each other.<n>

We left Hobbs, NM at about 7/00pm and when we hit Sweetwater, TX, it was about 9/00 or 9/30pm.  We were on the interstate and we noticed that everyone else was stopping and getting out of their vehicles to look up into the sky.  We were headed to Dallas, TX, and didn&#39;t want to get there too late, so we didn&#39;t stop.  She said to look out the windows to see what everyone was looking at.  I did and saw two shapes doing things that conventional aircraft couldn&#39;t do.  They were doing things that were impossible.  It was a stop sign shape and a triangle shape, both outlined in red, doing things that are not possible.  They were here in the skky and then they were there, from one side to another.  Up, down, sideways, horizontial, vertical, it wasn&#39;t possible.  Then the big one, that they kept flying into and out of came by.  It was huge, shaped like a lego brick.  On the ! under layer, that we   could see, it had purple and blue lights, they weren&#39;t blingking, they were steady, it was the size, easily of three football field lenghts in shape, it looked like a lego brick.  It made no sound.  No sound.  We watched until we got clear of Sweetwater, TX, and  then it, or they werer gone.

We both saw the green light come from the northeastern part of the sky and move to the southwestern part of the sky.

It had a more &#39;determined&#39; movement to it.  It was green in color and just looked like a ball of light.  It had not really a tail, but the color made a streak in the sky, like when you take a bright light and wave it in front of your eyes.  It leaves kind of an imprint.  After we saw this and made sure that we both saw the same thing we hurried back to school and asked our friends if they had seen anything wierd...they said no.<n>

Neither of them have ever claimed to have seen or experienced any ufo sighting or anything remotely paranormal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They describe the object as being roughly twice the size of a jumbo jet (LAX&#39;s landing flight path lies just to the north of our home and while sitting on our porch we probably view more than 20 jet&#39;s coming in for landing, so i&#39;m confident of their estimation of size.)   The object had white very large white lights covering the bottom of it&#39;s boomerang shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed over and headed west(at an altitude of approximately 15-20 miles, {brother&#39;s estimation}, it came to a stop over the foothills of the city of Orange. It commenced then changed into the shape of a straight line and remained as such for approximately one minute. It then began to cange shape again, this time, the left end of the line began to curl under and spiral into itself and it&#39;s luminosity increased to the brightness of a star and remained as such when my mother and brother, a bit unnerved by the event,  came back inside in complete bewilderment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon my arrival home after work, they told me what they had experienced and my complete confidence that if, they say they saw it, someone else must have as well.<n>

My girlfriend and I were just coming back from Stevens Pass when I looked up and saw a circular(kind of lit up, maybe just shiny)object,crossing the sky at about a 15 degree angle. The object was heading south from the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was dusk, not dark out, though. I could see the object come across the sky at an angle and then shoot back towards the same direction it came from, going about half the way from where I had seen it at first. Then it was gone. It did not turn around, it just automatically shot backwards, in the direction it came from, then disappeared. It was moving VERY quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my girlfriend if she had seen it. She did not. Took so long to report it for fear of being called &#34;silly&#34;. I did see something. Too quick to be man made.<n>

There had been snow showers in the vicinity and the skys were in a broken condition with cirrus clouds also in the vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Objects were first observed almost stationary. Then, after a few seconds, I noticed they started moving in a straight line towards an approximate 330deg direction.  The speed they were traveling was about twice as fast as a satellite would be observed moving but much slower than a meteor entering the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All objects remained equi-distant from one another, approximately 1 finger-width between each. They were all white in appearance, the same as the surrounding stars. No sound, fire trail, strobe lights, running lights, flaring, or fragmentation was observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The front 3 objects were as bright as the surrounding stars. The 4th object in line was a little brighter, and the 5th object was approximately the same brilliance as Jupiter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had time to call my girlfriend over to my side of the truck to also observe this event. We watched the few remaining seconds as they seemed to fade out of sight at approximately 40deg of arc due possibly to the high cloud obscuration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 50 years old, a Vietnam Era Air Force veteran.  I was a weather observer in the Air Force and have been an amateur astronomer for appoximately 15 years. I have been staring at the heavens for as long as I can remember but I have &#39;never&#39; seen anything like these lights before.  My girlfriend is 47 years old and has a master&#39;s degree in psychology. She also has never seen anything like this before. (I might add that she says she &#39;doesn&#39;t&#39; belive in flying saucers).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this event to the Pine Mountain Observatory message center outside of Bend at approximately 19:15 11/6/98. They called me back saturday, 11/7/98 and took the information. At that time there had been no other reports of the sighting in any other part of the state or area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The local newspaper, The Bend Bulletin, also had received no calls or reports on the news wire.<n>

One seemed to &#34;land&#34; or fly VERY low, stop and wasn&#39;t to be seen agian.  4 other &#34;bubbly&#34; type objects followed after the object appearing to land.  I say land because it was moving slowy.  Numerous jets quickly appeared in this precise area for a long period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a call from my mother this morning about 7:25 asking me to come over and look at what she was seeing.  I live in Bothell, just blocks from her place so I went over right away.  She lives high on a wide open hillside overlooking all of the Cascade mountains from about the Carnation foothills going out to the east and from about the Darrington foothills further north going out and over to the east.  The view goes well over the Cascade mountain pass encompassing the Eastern Washinton areas of Whenatchee, Chelan and Brewster areas.  I got to her place about 7:40.  I did not see the objects that my mother said were so unlike anything she had ever seen (she will write out her personal discription in a message to you after she gets off work as a computer programmer today).  What I was clearly seeing though were many jet contrail lines in and out of the precise spot she saw these UFO&#39;s.  What seemed curious where the amount of these contrails.  After 15 destinctly seperate trails within 1 hour of arriving I just stoped counting.  It was as if I were at an air show watching the those plans that leave those patterns of smoke trails except these planes were fast.  From the best I can position them, they were flying in a tight area that seemed to be right over the Whenatchee area.  The jets seemed to be coming in from the south. &#34;Well, I certainly have never seen such a force of jets at work like this before&#34;.  I would like to hear what people in the Wenatchee area know or saw. We did take some later pictures, only of the contrails, if they are clear enough we can scan and send them latter if wanted.

Another oval one came out of the same cloud the earlier ones had. All objects SLOWLY descending past Cascades. Jets flew in from the South, about 1 or 2 at a time. Jets in the area past 9:30.

It had a long tail, much like a comet, except it too was green.  It was very low, beneath the overcast cieling, and seemed to fall to earth before it reached the horizion.

During those years i rode a mountain bicycle to and from work daily.A bicycle trail that day i rode on my way back home i saw some black figures in the sky .At first i thought they were large raven sorta black birds or something ,thought nothing of it about 1 /16 away .As i concentrated steering my way down the trail and around a corner of the trail one of the objects somehow focused its attention on me and moved closer in front of me , about 30 feet in front 25 feet in the air. I came to a complete /quick stop on my bike. Then i heard noise to my left ,There were two males doing clean up work (raking weeds ,trash,etc.)About 50 feet across large rain channel/ditch, behind  alot of industrial fenced areas.They looked at what was in front of me and they got extremely frightened .They must of been mexican nationals seasonal workers .They were saying prayers out loud tone making signs of the cross and throwing their tools /rakes /shovels into their truck ,to get out of there in a hury.As for me ,i stayed still kinda frightened but ,curious at the same time.I took my riding glasses off and the object came a few feet closer and stayed perfectly still.It was a pitch black color and no sound came from it .A shape of oval or as  a shape of a large eye ,kinda glossy -it became as it moved up and to the right part of the bike trail.The other 4 or 5 figures seemed to stayed away or as to wait for the one close to me  to rejoin them.After a few minutes ,it slowly went back into a formation with the others and then extremely disapeared fast.       This was amazing for me to see those objects ,on that day ,confusing  although.Because i couldnt figure out what they were . They didnt look like transport ships or saucers ,But maybe a port hole to examine ?Unknown is! what i still call it. But very intelligent is a word to describe that occurance.     After they disapeared i kept riding on the trail back home ,kinda trembling and nervous at what i just saw.When i got home my girlfriend asked me &#34;What Happened&#34;? I couldnt talk for a minute still shooken up.I drank water then told her .After i told her she and i noyiced a scent on my clothes.She asked me was i working with fuel or around a generator motor.I told her no I wasnt working around any thing like that . A very strange scent ,almost like the scent around a railroad track where metal wheels travel at a high rate of speed like a burning metal smell.    Strange .   And to this day i never seen those 2 workers over there by the trail. But i might consider to advertise in a local paper to get in contact with them ,if there still here in albuquerque.But if i dont find them or they wouldnt want to talk,its ok .At least i know i wasnt halucinating ,they saw it too.And i want to see the objects again ,maybe to communicate .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The fireball was about the width of my thumb at arms length and had a glare similar to a magnesium flare (only green, not white). The tail had a length about 7 times the size of the fireball. In all, the object was as long as my middle finger held at arms length. It came straight down, 260 degrees by magnetic compass. It made no sound. I have no clue about its distance from me. Weather conditions reported at San Carlos (2 miles from here) at 8:45pm: Clear sky Wind WSW at 7mph Temp 59 degrees Pressure 30.12 (steady) Visibility 10 miles I&#39;ve spent many years watching meteor showers and have never seen anything like this. Unlike meteors I&#39;m used to seeing, this had a very shaprly defined shape, the magnesium flare like light was unusual and the tail had a constant length. I have no doubt this is a natural phenonmenon, but I know there have been many reports of unusual green fireballs in this area of the country over the last couple of years. Hope this is of some use to you.<n>

It appeared to be a yellow orange fireball with a medium tail trailing behind moving faster than an aircraft going away from me.  The angle from horizon to overhead was 70 degrees when I spotted it. As it moved towards the horizon and got farther away, what appeared to be another very small round fireball was ejected straight down beneath this object and appeared to burn up and tnen disappeared as it separated a distance below the larger object.  The larger object continued on its path for a few minutes until at about 20 degrees from the horizon it suddenly disappeared.  It instantly vanished as quick as you could snap your fingers.  The object made no movements other than a straight glide across the sky and was bright making it clearly visible.  As I am involved with astronomy I am certain it was not a meteor, comet or a satellite burning up in the atmosphere because those objects move rapidly through it and the burn rate is quite quick.  A comet that close would have caused destruction as this object was in the lower level of the atmosphere.  Since the object made no sound at all which it would have that close it was not a meteor. Additionally the object moved too slow for a meteor or comet or satellite. It was not an aircraft in trouble because the object moved too fast with no sound. The shape was definitely a compact ball! I have checked various professional astronomy resources and have received no explanations as yet. The object appeared to be too low to have skipped off or grazed the atmosphere and then back out into space. My background is that of 31 years as a teacher in ((technical field deleted)) science and presently ((title/company deleted))  Institute, Inc.- MS degree plus 15 graduate hours in Astro-Physics.<n>

A large perfectly shaped green sphere faintly illuminated the clouds of an area approx. 5 times it&#39;s size as it passed very quickly through the clouds at a 30degree angle toward the ground. It dissappeared behind a hill giving no evidence that it had stuck anything.This object was almost a candy green.It was not glowing. I stopped to pay my toll an asked the female toll person if she had just seen the sphere.She replied no.My guess is,it must have fallen well past the toll booth into NH<n>

I tried to keep watch the object and drive which isn&#39;t easy. I notice an airplane that was heading towards the mountains and you could tell it was an airplane because of the white trail it left. the UFO had to be at the same altitude. Once the airliner got to close the object made a sharpe 45º turn toward the south then after a few seconds I lost sight of it. My back ground is I am 34 years old, I have a degree in Visual Communications and currently in school studing computer networking. I usually don&#39;t see strange objects in the sky. I don&#39;t know if this sighting will be helpful to your oganization but I felt like I had to tell someone. Thank you for listing.<n>

I&#39;v worked nights for 13 years, and have seen many shooting stars, but none like this. It was a Bright Green ball, followed by a trail of orange sparks. It was about softball sized, to the North, falling from West to East. It disapeared behind the building next to me after only a sec or two. The sky was very clear and starry, and although the siting was brief, the image was very clear.<n>

Approx. 5 miles North-East of, center of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. I was standing outdoors at the above mentioned location watching aircraft on final approach (landing to the South) at DFW Airport.  Looking approx. West-North-West, upwards at approx. 45 degrees, I witnessed what I belive to be a &#34;shooting star&#34; or metorite.  A very bright, greenish dot, streaked downward and faded.  The entire sighting was no more than 2 seconds in length.  The dot was very bright, white/greenish in color.  Could compare it to burnning magnesium.  The size of the dot was approx. 1/4 - 1/8 the size of the Moon at the time.  The dot also left a faint, whiteish trail behind it.  The dot moved in a straight line, straight downward (no movement across the horizon, i.e. South-to-North).  The dot appeared approx. 45 degrees above the horizon, streaked straight downward, and faded at approx. 10-15 degress above the horizon.  Its speed was extremely fast and constant.  It DID NOT speed up, slow down, change direction, hover, etc. The dot appeared to have faded above the Grapevine Lake / Grapevine,TX / Coppell, TX area.<n>

Above me a cloudless starry sky, no moon, but I could see one, two then five seven stars disappearing there was something there alright, slowly gliding in a northern direction, no sound just what must have been a quater acre patch of ominous blackness. The only thought I had when I saw this was &#39;go back inside&#39;, my body once more dragged me away, this time inside my home. You always read of bright shining lights and colours, not black stealth. You can imagine my amazement, and relief to know they really are there, real, and hidden. They watch us in the shadows, camoflaged, shop keepers, scientists studying life like we do and would with circumstances diferent.

I noticed two strange craft in the sky .I asked my girlfriend to pull the car over. We got out and viewed for three minutes two craft that were flashing like strobe lights.They started out hovering together, then , each craft took one turn at some sort of a flight pattern.While one craft hovered , the other would fly extremly fast across the horizon where it instantly turned at a right angle, then flew quickly across the sky in that direction while at the same time losing altitute ,  then it disapppeared instantly. Afew seconds later it appeared in the sky in another location. Then it flew across the horizon back to the other stationary craft. Then the stationary craft did a similar flight pattern to the first craft ,while the other remained stationary. When the second craft had finished its flight pattern , both craft hovered together for a few seconds and then before our eyes without a blink they both diappeared. Each craft was a light like a strobe light doing spectacular flight patterns.Both craft were completely silent with no exhaust trail . Due to the brightness of the strobe type lights there was an aura or haze around them, a glow.<n>

It lasted less than 2 seconds and due to the angle of travel I ran outside thinking it may have been a meteor which could have hit or come close to it.  Though I was not looking directly at the event, it did appear to have a tail of some sort and seemed to be relatively close to my geographic location.  It was a cloudless, moonlit night and visibility was excellent from my home at 9200 feet elevation.  If further contact with me is necessary please contact me via the information below.

The details are a bit fuzzy for me, not out of lack of memory, but the effects of the craft on me.  My cousin and grandma claim not to remember the latter part of the sighting (only the star-like lights and for my cousin the explosion).  I remember them standing there just staring blankly up into the sky.  They claim that we got &#34;freaked out&#34; and went back inside before anything too detailed happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin and I procrastinated feeding the cats outside, so we had to do it in the dark.  I stood outside of the cat pen to make sure none got out and looked into the northeastern sky where I observed two lights.  One beam shot from the other and there was an explosion, which my cousin witnessed.  We ran inside and grabbed my grandmother and we stood in the front yard.  There was still residual light in the sky from the explosion, and more lights started appearing, looking like stars.  Then, as the numbers increased, they grew closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no set formation and they were all traveling at different altitudes and distances from each other.  I can&#39;t recall how many there were -- not that I was counting.  I was in a state of shock and awe.  One craft flew at about treetop level right above our heads as if saying, &#34;Get a look at me!&#34;  It hovered over us for about 2 minutes.  It was triangular shaped, probably about 15-20 at the base (back end) of the craft.  The edges of the triangle were rounded out.  The color of the craft was a gunmetal gray with a greenish tinge.  I got the impression that it was a soft metal.  There were geometric shapes etched in the metal -- lines and shapes formed together to create symbols.  There were semi-bright, rounded, amber colored lights at each point of the triangle.  They never dimmed or pulsed.  There was no sound, only a humming which seemed to come from inside of my head and the air seemed electrically charged.  It continued on, moving at about 10mph with it&#39;s buddies and gradually gained it&#39;s altitude.  I&#39;m really not too clear on what happened after this, honestly.  I recall feeling very strange though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The strange thing is that we never talked about this incredible experience after we saw it or told anyone only after we broke up did i say somthing and we have still never talked about what we say even though we havent seen eachother in three years the experience still amazes me to the point of dwelling on it.

It was a fairly solid light source, with another smaller light at the rear of the craft.  It was about an 1/8 to 1/10 the size of a full moon, and seemed to be fairly low, about 1000-1200 feet.  It was moving north by north west, at an average speed, compared to commercial planes in our area from the Nashville terminals.  This object was a solid light, though, so I was interested in it, and I took two or three camara shots of it.  When the object was nearly due East of my position, it seemed as if it grew or swelled in proportions.  It dimmed, and an object with running lights exactly like a plane shot out of it, the new object hovered in position to the East of the first object, then began moving to the West.  When I next looked to the first object(I was taking photos of the second object)it had reversed it&#39;s course, and was rapidly losing altitude.  At this point it nearly left a trail in the dark sky it moved so fast.  When it neared the ground, it began moving slower, and dimmed considerably once or twice before resolving(Don&#39;t ask me how, I didn&#39;t see this, it just happened between one moment and the next)into what looked like a larger object than it&#39;s original appearance, however this one had a cross of 4 small lights underneath, and red and blue lights, like a jumbo-jet that had it&#39;s landing lights on, but much dimmer.  I took a total of maybe 10 shots and, though I&#39;m fairly handy with a camera, I&#39;m by no means a pro.<n>

It was fairly cold and pretty well lit by the moon in the sky, not necessarily full or anything with some very. very high wispy clouds (stratus I believe).  Anyhow, we were leaving the woods at some point between midnight and 2 in the morning (EST).  I remember a bright blue flash that looked like lightning, it lit up everything and refelcted well off of the snow.  We looked to the north to see what looked at first like a bright blue firework (with trails) shooting straight into the air from ground level.  It kept getting higher and higher to the point we both realized it was not a firework.  It got VERY high into the sky and then quickly it turned south at a 90 degree angle and shot across the entire sky.  I should have reported this years ago, but I could not remember exactly when it happened.  This would have been very visible to anyone driving north on US-131.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
