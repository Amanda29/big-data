There was no noise, lights, smoke or any sounds of any type of engines. The craft appeared slowly as if it was coming out of a fog bank, yet the sky was clear and blue sky was seen thru the cross beams of craft. Craft was not moving in any direction and was stationary over a football field at Henderson Jr. High. I was running track practice at the football field when I seen the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran home to get my daddy to bring his 8mm movie camera but when we returned the object was not seen. I never heard of anyone else in the area every seeing this object I seen. Is there many people who have seen such a shaped object with no sounds and no movement and seemed to slowly appear in our sky and then just disappear slowly as if fading into clear sky? Thanks for any replys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name and e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

4/15/69 21:30|At sea (Between Panama & Hawaii)|HI|Light|5 minutes|High speed track with gunfire control radar at sea.|4/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97035.html|2|ndxe196904| High speed track with gunfire control radar at sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were aboard the USS Boston CAG-1, a heavy cruiser in the Pacific ocean about 10 days out from Panama enroute to Hawaii and then ultimately Viet Nam.  I was an e-5 fire control technician in charge of the 5&#34; gun radar which was a Mk 25 mod 3.  It had a range of 100,000 yds. with a plus or mines 10 ft accuracy.  I had been in Viet Nam in both 1967 and 1968 and was the radar operator and range spotter.  I had experience tracking all targets both surface and air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was after work hours and a group of fire control techs were up on the o-7 deck lounging around when I noticed a light off to our port side (south) and assumed it was a passenger plane going to Hawaii.  My assumption was such because of the light that I figured could only be from the windows of a plane.  Since there were not many targets out in the middle of the ocean I wanted to track it to check the radars function ability.  Myself and two others climbed into the director and the rest of the men departed below decks.  It took three men to work the director.  A pointer, a trainer, and a radar operator.  I was the radar operator, which was my usual station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We trained left and visually picked up the contact and and when it was locked into the radar, I ordered it to be &#34;kicked in&#34; to automatic track.  The director did just that and I was then observing it through the range finder as well as on the radar screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to my experience I could tell that the &#34;plane&#34; or object had a very high rate of speed.  It was at a range of 20 to 30 thousand yard out (I forget just exactly) and so I called down to the plotting room below decks and asked the technicians there to put it on the computer and give me a speed.  The technicians there were playing card at the time.  I asked for the speed several times and there was no response at first.  I was then asked what I had up there.  I responded that we were tracking a plane that seemed very fast and when I again asked for the speed he informed me that the speed indication was &#34;pegged&#34; or at maximum.  That would have indicated a speed over 2800 miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to a visual fix through the range finder and the object went from a horizontal to a vertical aspect without any arc what so ever.  It then accelerated with such ferocity that the motor drives of the director actually screamed or roared to keep up.  It was such a noise that I actually lifted the deck plate I was standing on to see if they were all right.  The optics of the range finder had gone 90 degrees so fast that I could not view them any longer so I just watched the radar screen as the target went to 100,000 yards straight up over the ship.  It maintained an auto lock through the entire time and then just went out of our range.  The time from the abrupt directional change until it was out of range was a fraction of a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a subsequent call to CIC (combat information center) to see if there were any ship (carriers) in the vicinity and was informed that we were alone.  I did this because anything with great speed  would not have the range to be out here.  The fellow I talked to had no contacts, either surface or air, and so we shut down the director and called it a night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

A few people get lucky and capture ..........<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1967, in Vietnam I witness a light that moved like a skipping rock.  It moved so fast that all 50 Marines present were at awe.  We kept looking at it until it disappeared into the heavens.  In 1969 a year after my discharged from active duty I drove out to visit a friend.  I parked my car in the drive way blocking the side walk. I just happend to turn my head as I was closing the door and I say this cigar shaped flying craft with fire coming out the back.  My first thought was this plane is going to crash.  It was low and close.  I expected a crash and burn, but it kept going until it disapeared in the horizon.  In the mid 70&#39;s my brother and I were driving home one night at about 22:30 hours and we saw this strange light, light up the ground close to us.  It caused us and another vehicle to swerve off the road.  Since then I have not had any sightings.  I just retired from government service.  I was a top level manager so I couldn&#39;t bring this up.  Not a good career move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m retired now and don&#39;t have to worry about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My question is, what am I suppose to do about this?  What did all this mean?

4/4/69 22:30|Dillon|SC|Disk|~1 minute|Myself and one other person saw a parked spacecraft on the ground with humanoid-type beings walking in the area and on craft decks.|4/8/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/118/S118259.html|5|ndxe196904| Myself and one other person saw a parked spacecraft on the ground with humanoid-type beings walking in the area and on craft decks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Friday, April 4th, 1969, just a few days before Easter.  My pal, Charlie, and I - two very bored soldiers - were setting out on a hitchhiking expedition from Fort Bragg, North Carolina to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, with vague hopes of scoring with some partying college coeds taking their Spring Break in the popular seaside town.  Leaving the base with our backpacks and sleeping bags at about sunset, we headed south out of Fayetteville on Interstate 95.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reaching the large rest stop, South of the Border, a few hours later, we stopped at a coffee shop to grab a cup and get our bearings before continuing on.  SoB, as the soldiers called it, was located just across the border in South Carolina outside the town of Dillon.  While drinking our coffees and looking over our map we couldn&#39;t help but notice a rather loud group of local rowdies, talking shit and throwing dirty looks our way.  This was the way it was during the rambunctious 1960s. In the area of the South we were in it could be dangerous for hitchhiking strangers, especially blacks, hippies, Yankees and soldiers. Accordingly, Charlie and I took the leering snarls very seriously, finishing up quickly and moving on down the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon, we were walking through downtown Dillon toward route 25, the old Latta highway cutoff toward Myrtle Beach, still 70 miles away.  One good ride would get us there and at the same time get us away from the trouble we both sensed.  And sure enough, it wasn&#39;t all that long before two cars showed up with our friends from the coffee shop on board, hootin&#39; and hollerin&#39; as they went by.  As empty as the town was at this time of night (nearly 10 PM) it didn&#39;t bother us too much because of the street lights and the occasional traffic on the road.  But, as we reached the edge of town near the cutoff - with the rowdies going by every few minutes and the chances of a ride looking increasingly doubtful - the two of us began looking for an escape hatch.  After the loudmouths passed by us again and drove out of sight we took the opportunity to slip off the road into a dimly lit area behind a vacant, broken-down gas station.  Walking by the left side of the deserted building we followed a w! heel-rutted dirt path up and over a small crest, by now barely able to see more than a few feet in front of us as we passed by trees on the edge of the gas station lot into almost complete darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, as the two of us picked our way carefully down the car path, the whole area suddenly lit up in an aqua-green glow showing a small field no more than a few acres in size.  Now I could see clearly, and what I saw amazed me; there was a three- or four-story high, multi-decked UFO standing on what seemed to be metal legs. In addition, there were beings similar to humans - a head with two eyes, two arms and upright on two legs - but colored green, either an effect of the ambient light or the result of my extreme confusion and fear.  They were walking in the field and on decks which curved around the ship, with the nearest one about 20 feet away.  He/she/it turned our way, and said firmly (I believe telepathically) &#34;LEAVE!  NOW!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> In spite of the danger that had caused us leave the highway in the first place, both Charlie and myself, like the trained soldiers we were, executed a smart about-face and marched right back toward trouble.  We hiked at a pretty quick route step down the road a few miles without saying a word to, or looking at, each other, hoofing just as fast as we could out of Dillon into some farming and pasturage area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Presently, the rowdies showed up once more in their cars, making it clear we were their targets for this night.  Once again, as the cars went out of sight we left the highway, into a cow pasture this time.  From a spot a few hundred yards off the road we watched them as they returned looking for us.  Eventually, the night settled down the cars were gone and we climbed into our sleeping bags.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning we continued on to Myrtle Beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s the best part.  As far as I can recall we had forgotten about the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day, thirty years later my buddy called up from out of the blue and asked me,  &#34;Do you remember Dillon?&#34;  I had no idea what he was talking about.  But as soon as he said, &#34;The UFO,&#34; the whole experience came back in a flash.<n>

They picked up a little girl who was hysterical, she said an object bigger than the bus was above the pond across the road from her house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the bus came up over the hill, the object began to ascend.  The bus driver and all the kids on board exited the bus and saw the object. It was cigar shaped with three lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mom says it was silver.  It was still rising then the three lights separated and shot off into different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they arrived at school, no one believed the bus driver or any of the students.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mom saw this same little girl now an adult years later and asked if she remembered the event and she said she did and would never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is some confusion as to if the object rose from the pond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
