My mother, father, my fathers 2 brothers, and my fathers mother were in there living room, and heard a low hum, and they all went outside, and this craft was very slowly hovering and moving approximately 300 feet above the house, and it moved down toward them,hovered closer to them after they were in the yard, and stopped for about 10 seconds, and a car came up and over the bend in the road and the headlights shone on the craft, and the craft swooshed away with no sound, away from them and into the nearby field, stopped, and then swooshed a 90 degree turn to the left, and off quickly through the field and out of sight.  The car that came over the bend in the road did not stop, but slowed, and my family never spoke to the occupants in the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fathers brother at the time was a civilian worker at McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento California, and he called them and he was told there was no activity in the area and no other reports phoned in, and he was told the same thing the following day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 days later, my fathers younger adult brother was awoken by a low hum, and looked out his bedroom window, and saw the same craft hovering in the trees near the house about 100 feet away and a little above the height of the house.  He watched it for 10 minutes, and it just stayed in that one spot, and then it flew off rapidly straight up, and the craft was never seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is almost word for word of what all the witnesses in my family have told me for the last 30 years.  One day ago, I asked again, and the same incident was told except for my grandma, she passed away 14 years ago, and my fathers older brother is dying of cancer and he gave his account to me on August 22, 2013.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a coast fan and I have heard you on Noory show and I have been as detailed as I have heard you say on the show.  My parents are very private people, and they do not know if they will speak to you about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent my mother over 50 pictures of UFOs from the web and she picked one out that she said was 95 percent certain was just like the craft they saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will send it to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this is helpful, and I heard you say that any report was good even if it was years, and years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Time passed and the hour began to get late.  We, a group of children and adults saw lights that were beneath a football shaped object that hovered over our project complex.   This object covered an entire apartment unit in length. The object would take off at great speeds and return just a few minutes later..<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all ran back and forth through the house trying to make out what this object could possibly be..Finally the object took off at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight.  The next morning mother purchased the newspaper….Winston-Salem Journal and Sentinel..  There was a photograph of two young boys holding what looked like some type of remote control and there was a circular disc laying between them.   The newspaper reported that this is what we saw hovering in the night….<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a young child, but have never ever forgotten what I saw and what was pictured in the ! paper the next morning.  Even then I knew that what was being fed as truth could not possibly be what my siblings friends mother and others saw.  I have searched for that article for years and have never been able to find it again..  I just wanted to review that story as an adult because still at the age of 54 now I have still not forgotten what I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

However, it was not flying vertically [i.e. flying up]; rather, it was flying horizontally, parallel with the ground, as you would watch an airplane or helicopter flying over. Again, there were no wings and no helicopter blades that I could see. The object was cigar-shaped like a rocket or missile, even though it was flying over land instead of up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like an airplane, the object simply flew over. Within a half-minute or less, it was gone. I assume the object must have made some type of sound [although I do not remember the sound], that caught my attention so I looked up to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot give an exact date, but it was seen sometime between the middle of June and the middle of August in 1966. This is when I was attending a summer camp at the Valley Forge Military Academy in Wayne, Pennsylvania, about fourteen miles west of Philadelphia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time of day was, as I recall, late afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time, I was standing near one of the barracks/dormitories {I believe it may have been Wheeler Hall] of the Valley Forge Military Academy. I believe this was the barracks where my dormitory room was located.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, I was ten years old; I would turn eleven in the Autumn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not notify anyone of the siting. It went so fast, I had no time to call anyone. And, since the vehicle was gone after a few moments, it did not seem to be of much value to tell anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the object looked like a rocket or missile, I assumed it was of terrestrial origin. However, I did wonder why a rocket or missile was flying over suburban Philadelphia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

They were classic saucers, but only about 2 feet in diameter, and with what looked like &#34;antennae&#34; sprouting from the top center.  They came within about 30-40 feet from my cousin and me, and were also observed by several other family members within about 100 feet.  One was my aunt, about 30 years old at the time and standing about 30 feet behind me - perhaps 60 feet from the craft.  She also saw them clearly as did two other, older cousins.  This occurred on my uncle&#39;s farm in northern California roughly 1965-66.  There were a number of animals nearby that reacted violently to the objects - especially one calf that was tethered and unable to run away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also a 3rd UFO nearby - but that one was roughly 30 feet in diameter and was seen only as the smaller ones flew directly away from us and the large craft joined in front of the smaller two.  It came from the side, from several hundred yards away when first noticed, and was seen only in silhouette against the afternoon sky.  The small ones, however, were so close we could see them _very_ well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were gray and black, spinning about 30 RPM, exhibited the characteristic &#34;falling leaf&#34; motion when descending, and one discharged &#34;angel hair&#34; at it&#39;s lowest point (about 15-20 feet altitude).  No residue was seen later, and the material seemed to &#34;dissolve&#34; in the air while falling.  The objects made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The small objects hovered in and around some eucalyptus trees about 30 feet from us and perhaps 20 feet in altitude - so we saw them both behind and in front of the trees giving a good visual &#34;fix&#34; of their size and position.  They never remained completely still, but made small movements in a jerky way constantly.  After about 3-4 minutes of watching them, they rose vertically to about 100 ft altitude and flew slowly directly away from us slowly ascending.  The larger craft flew in front of the smaller two, then all 3 flew rather slowly out of sight in a straight line, continuously ascending until they flew out of sight.  The total sighting lasted about 5 minutes - which seemed like a _very_ long time under the circumstances.  Unfortunately, no camera was available, for there was plenty of time to take photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other family members remembered a report being made to the Air Force and, perhaps, a small article in the local newspaper, but I do not remember the latter.  No one involved has had another sighting before or since, to the best of my knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I happened to look up and saw a disk like shape with big multi colored (red, green, yellow) lights moving around its outer edge.  It was just quietly floating over the trees that bordered our back yard.  So it was low to the ground and big.  Its position was still and in a slight angle, left side down, right side up.  It seemed as I stood staring at it…it was staring at me.  I wasn’t frightened.  It was interesting.  Then it just moved on.  That evening I told my father what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think of this occurrence from time to time and mentioned it to my father not to long ago.  I was surprised that he remembered.

It was a sunny afternoon and I was out exploring the lake with a boy a bit younger than I.  I was about eleven or tweleve at the time.  The boy and I were startled by a lound roaring noise coming out of the east.  We spied a dark streak roar into the lake and moments later fly OUT of the lake continuing on in a western -up at a sharp angle direction.

It was about 2 feet in diameter and between 15 and 20 feet off the ground traveling south when I saw it coming from behind my friend. I immediately yelled,&#34;look a boomarang, lets catch it.&#34;  He looked up and saw it and we both waited for it to come down but it continued traveling on a straight steady course and did not come down as we expected it to. We ran and grabbed our sling shots and ran after it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran into a large open field behind his house and watched it as it traveled over a tree, which was in the yard of a house about 1 block away.  We knew that a large woods was immediaately behind that house and so we ran across the open field to the woods and then ran about 1 mile through the woods to find out if we could still see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We peered out over what was then a city trash dump but could no longer see the object.  It was traveling at about 10 miles per hour when it came between the houses and made no noise what so ever.

The object looked to me like a boomarang spinning so fast as to appear as a solid disc, but it may have actually been solid, I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I chose to classify it as circular instead of disc because I don&#39;t believe it was very thick at all.

We were traveling to PA in the family station wagon and in the car were my parents, my sister, 2 brothers and myself.  I believe I was about 6 to 8 years old, my sister was about 12 years old and my brothers were a year younger and a year older then me.  The traffic was light and the sky was clear and bright enough that the cars did not need to have there headlights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were probably about 2/3 of the way across the bridge, my entire family other than my parents recall seeing an extremely large light green glowing orb hovering above the bridge and so close to it that we all remember my sister screaming because she thought this orb was going to hit the bridge and knock it down.  This entire sighting lasted probably no longer than 10 seconds and no one remembers observing this orb flying away as it just seemed to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An explanation as to why my parents who were in the front seat did not observe this orb is possibly because my sister and I were seated in the far back of the station wagon which were rear facing seats and that orb did not appear until we were 2/3 of the way across the bridge and it was behind when it 1st appeared.  My parents remember everyone screaming and yelling about what we had seen and they clearly remember the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This orb had no distinguishing marks and the entire family agrees that it was not the moon or the sun. As for the size of the orb, I would say at least 300 yds in diameter and I might be underestimating it by quite a bit.  The distance that it was from the bridge I would estimate 300yds or maybe even closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident was never discussed again until about 20 years later at a family reunion when someone brought up ufos and for some reason we all remembered the incident like it happened yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Without a doubt there had to be numerous other witnesses to this sighting because of the clear day, the size of the object and how close it was to the bridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

6/25/66 21:30|Rapid City (Ellsworth AFB)|SD|Disk|several hours|UFOs visited our Minuteman ICBMS during the summer of 1966 and I was there.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36146.html|21|ndxe196606| UFOs visited our Minuteman ICBMS during the summer of 1966 and I was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another old sighting.  I was a System Analyst for SAC in the early 1960 and stationed at Ellsworth AFB, SD.   I  held the nation&#39;s highest security clearances, daily handled nuclear weapons and carried launch codes and keys.  I thus took no drugs, was a tea toddler and have never hallucinated in my life.  I was on active duty at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was early summer 1966.  I was on base during the evening, when excited reports of UFOs on our silos were being passed around in the living quarters among the men person to person.  &#34;Excited utterances,&#34; they are called in legal jargon.  I went down to Job Control, which tracked the 150 missiles and the ten Launch Control Centers.  These Centers were manned, twenty-four seven, while the missiles are unmanned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That evening, in Hotel Flight, as I recall, we had an &#34;outer zone security violation,&#34; meaning that something had passed over the silo....this is often blowing vegetation or a light footed animal. The system will generally reset with the manual override.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However this silo did not reset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Worse it was soon followed by an &#34;inter zone violation,&#34; meaning that something large enough to set off the vibration sensors or to touch the combinations locks, etc., was on the site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the violations happen in this order, the manual calls for  a &#34;strike team&#34; to be dispatched from the LCC&#39;s above ground facility, which would be between ten and twenty miles distant. These teams generally consisted of two Air Policeman with automatic weapons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These men having no training in the weapon system, no clearances and are the worst educated airmen on active duty.   However they are in constant radio contract with their dispatcher and through them with the MCCCs in the LCC, a hundred feet or so below ground and via patch with Job Control back on the base, about 100 miles, in this case to the WSW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These men reported seeing a &#34;fly saucer&#34; on the silo cover, inside the silo and smaller objects around it, that appeared to be lights &#34;floating&#34; in the air.  The larger saucer was sitting on the silo door, a massive 30 ton concret &#34;hatch,&#34; on a short rail track.  It was thus well  inside the fence and entirely unauthorized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this was an armed and targeted missile, aimed at the Soviet Union, this flagrant breach of security was taken very seriously by all concerned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Minutes after these objects were spotted, the call came excitedly to our quarters, so I arrived within thirty minutes of the initial OZ security violation.  I actually arrived before the AP s arrived at the silo in question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time of my arrival, at JC, the JC Commander had taken it upon himself to send the nearest team, then at work on the missiles.   This team turned out to be about thirty or forty minutes away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this was entirely &#34;out of the book.&#34;  No open silo, as the one left was, was ever to be left without authorized personnel on it, since it would be launched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nevertheless, the need to have a qualified observer at the site being probed by the UFOs, obviously overrode the Technical Orders of Operation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So the EMT team, that was nearby, was dispatched from their silo, which was under going some form of routine maintenance .  I believe this was an EMT team consisting of two Analysts and an Air Policeman.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Command decision, backed by SAC in Offitt AFB, lay behind this unusual order.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thus one AP and one Analyst were sent to the silo in question, leaving the open silo (and its deadly missile, in the hands of one man, hence the security breach).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember not only overhearing the radio conversation as these Airmen approached the silo, a conversation that confirmed what the other AP s had seen, &#34;holly shit, there is a fuckin saucer on that silo...&#34;  but I talked with this man, a day or so later, myself.  He had been ordered to say nothing to anyone about what he saw.  But did confirm these orders and the facts as I knew them to be.  An Analyst, he, like me had spent an year in technical school, so we were close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this same period, our helicopters were roused and dispatched.  Arriving as the UFO was rising up out of the silo.  They gave chase, but were unable to close, as the objects accelerated towards the NNE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sightings continued for about a week with the same pattern.  First an Outer Zone beach and then an Inter Zone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had no smaller aircraft, being a tanker and bomber wing, but evidently were able to call in a nearby KC-135 ( i.e., a 707 tanker) that must have been on &#34;rotation&#34; nearby.  I myself overheard the conversation between the pilots and &#34;base operations&#34; confirming the sighting of the or a UFO in the area.  Said UFO followed the KC 135 back towards the base, with a strong radar image, but no visual image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane was required to &#34;fly by&#34; so it could be observed and nothing was seen where the radar said something was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time the Base Commander and the Wing Commander, were in the area in staff cars.  I spoke briefly with the Wing Commander, who I knew well, Col. Burrell, that evening.   As the helicopters returned, with then was a photographer who had been rousted from his bunk.  He was loaded into the staff car and driven away under escort to the photo lab.  I did not speak with him, but clearly saw his photographic gear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see these UFOs.  I did, however, speak directly with airmen who had seen them and indeed were seeing them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During that week there were numerous reports, so numerous that the Air Force announced that B-58 bombers were flying over on &#34;maneuvers.&#34;  But, of course, whatever landed on Hotel 6 wasn&#39;t a B-52.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am fully confident that during the summer of 1966 UFOs visited our Minuteman silos in the Dakotas, landed upon and penetrated those silos.  We were powerless to stop them and the USAF covered up this entire chapter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suspect it is still classified and that I should not be talking about these events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I vaguely remember being instructed not to speak about these matters and was, of course, operating under very tight above Top Secret security clearances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I come forth because the missiles are non longer on active duty, the silos decommissioned and the time long past.  I can think of no reason why these events should be covered up in the name or color of national security.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something major happened that summer.  And it happened to nuclear weapon systems that were armed and on duty at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/25/66 15:00|Philadelphia|PA|Cigar|5 minutes|Brilliantly Lit Cigar Shaped Vessel 40 feet long - Hovered over roofs - looked like surface of The Sun|11/21/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115459.html|22|ndxe196606| Brilliantly Lit Cigar Shaped Vessel 40 feet long - Hovered over roofs - looked like surface of The Sun<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO report I am making took place in Philadelphia on June 25, 1965.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was eleven years old.  I am a retired Air Force Intelligence Officer (Major), and Veteran of The Gulf War.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting looking out a window when I saw a large bright object descending at a fast rate of speed. It was coming down at a 45% angle at perhaps fifty miles per hour. I thought it was a rocket, because of its shape, a cylinder with rounded ends. I ran and hid behind the couch away from the window.  I expected an explosion but heard nothing, so I looked out. I saw the UFO hovering a block down the street over roof tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO had descended at 22nd Street, descending at the intersection of 22nd and Mount Vernon Street, moving North then stopping at 22nd and Wallace Street.  I was viewing the object from my Grandmother and Grandfather&#39;s 3rd floor apartment window at 643 North 22nd Street, Philadelphia Pa on June 25th 1968.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO followed the outline of all the homes and buildings-opposite my side of the street, including a church.  It flew just feet above the roof tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would pause, descend, and rise, hovering about ten feet above all the roof tops. It was as if it was viewing inside the homes.  It moved slowly traveling at walking pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was the length of a city bus, with rounded ends, but wider in circumference.  It was a large cylinder, it had no markings of any kind, no wings, no visible engines, no windows. The entire surface was made up of a plasma field, like a close up image of the Sun. These gases or ions spun and disappeared under the surface, diving and rising like a gas. The brightness was intense.  It was composed of several colors, white, yellow and orange. It reminded me of someone mixing giant cans of paint.  It was very beautiful but hard on the eyes because of its brilliance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point in my life I think what I saw then was a fusion powered ship.  I&#39;m also glad it did not damage my eyesight.  They sky was clear, it was a hot summer&#39;s day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point I turned around looking behind me into the apartment and noticed the patterns of light also produced shadows on my Grandmothers walls.  The patterns it produced on the walls were dark with light edges.  The patterns matched the moving patterns of the vessel&#39;s surface.  The only thing I&#39;ve ever seen similar are close up films of The Sun. In addition to the swirling patterns of light I noticed it was layered in a raised dimple pattern that covered it&#39;s entire surface.  The dimples appeared to vibrate but stayed in place like those on a basketball while plumes of gas rose and fell like filaments of a magnet.  This was truly amazing to see!  At times I used my hands to shield my eyes. It was the brightest light I&#39;ve ever seen and today I&#39;m sixty years old, as of November 2014. I was alone viewing the object.  My Grandfather was at work and my Grandmother went downstairs to another apartment for a short time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It approached my location stopping directly in front of me.  I was in the third floor apartment. I did not feel any heat.  At this point it was about 80 feet away, close enough to throw a ball to it! I was able to observe this object for perhaps five minutes in total, which seemed then to be a long time.  As I said it paused several times over apartments, then would move and stop again several times.  It flew over the bell tower of The Olivet Covenant Presbyterian church (current name) at 22nd and Wallace Streets, just across from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before the UFO changed direction (descending, or rising, stopping or starting to move forward) it emitted a loud sound.  The sound always preceded its change in movement by about two seconds each time.  So I knew when it was going to move again.  The sound reminded me of a loud hiss from an old steam train.  I&#39;m not saying there was steam just that the sound was similar to that or when a large truck makes releasing air brakes. It was strange hearing an anachronistic sound and seeing an advanced flying vehicle!  Once the UFO got to the last building at the intersection of 22nd and Fairmont Streets it angled at 45 degrees, with its front end pointing up, it rose about fifty feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to another window on the side facing Wallace Street, so was able to watch it again.  It leveled off, then flew over the walls of the Eastern State Penitentiary, (This spooky relic is now open to the public for tours) it picked up speed at about 35 miles per hour flying North. It continued flying North at a level constant speed until I lost view of it.  This craft was definitely controlled by some form of intelligence.  It was not a blimp,  I had seen these vessels before for the Philadelphia Army Navy games traditionally held in Philadelphia in those years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my Grandmother came in I told her what I had witnessed.  We were both very religious, she had difficulty believing my story and asked me to swear by placing my hand on The Bible, which I did.  She was convinced and saddened that she had missed this wonderful sight by just minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That evening or perhaps the next night we watched a TV program that highlighted the vessel I had seen and their close encounter with it.  The program was &#34;The Arthur Godfrey Show&#34;, or one of his &#34;Specials&#34;.  Arthur Godfrey was a respected pilot, and was a Colonel in the Air Force Reserve.  Arthur Godfrey and Frank Munciello another experienced pilot were flying in a small aircraft from New York to the Washington DC area.  Their flight path took them over or near Philadelphia on the same day of my encounter.  Live on national TV Author Godfrey described that a brilliantly lit vessel followed and maneuvered around his aircraft. He said it matched his course and speed.  He admitted he was scared of the vessel&#39;s close maneuvers until it finally veered off.  Arthur Godfrey was a well know TV producer and TV host.   His TV program was viewed by millions of Americans.  My grandparents and I knew he was describing the same vessel I had seen. An account of Arthur Godfrey&#39;s! story can be read on Ufodocarchiv.org. In 1993 I happened across a book, &#34;The UFO Encyclopedia&#34; by John Spencer. On page 129 I read the account by Arthur Godfrey validating my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later accounts of Arthur Godfrey&#39;s story have been muddied. Some report the incident online as 1964, 1965 and 1966, some report it was during the evening, or say he was reporting an event he witnessed years earlier. The actual date he saw the vessel was June 25 1965, then he reported it in the evening. He was not in both places at the same time. As I viewed his broadcast myself, I was stunned at his anger and asking for an explanation as to what had happened. He was mad because this event had just happened, and was not years prior as some recent reports are now saying. I hope someone can track down a recording of that broadcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can recall to this day my Grandparents discussing me and what to do about the sighting. My Grandmother wanted to call Mr Arthur Godfrey who had just reported the sighting on national TV.  My Grandfather opposed it saying I would be tagged as the Flying Saucer Boy or some other bad thing that would only cause me harm. I remember my Grandmother wanting to talk to someone at The Franklin Institute Planetarium in Philadelphia. She wanted to know if others had reported seeing the vessel.  I stayed several weeks with my Grandparents, finally they told me not to mention it to anyone.  Years later, as an Intelligence Officer, I often gave my Air Force squadron current intelligence briefings.  I was an Intelligence Officer in the 732nd Military Airlift Squadron at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey,  I served in this position for approximately ten years, including during The Gulf War. During one briefing an Aircrew explained to me they encountered a Ball Lightening Encounter, also called Saint Elmo&#39;s Fire.  A sphere of charged particles entered the airframe of their aircraft while cruising at 40,000 feet.  The aircraft was a C-141 Starlifter.  The sphere about three feet in diameter entered the cockpit then floated inside the aircraft to the cargo bay where it hovered for a time then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire crew witnesses the sphere and actually enjoyed the event.  They asked if I knew of any UFO sightings.  I then told them my story.  This upset my Squadron Training Officer who verbally reprimanded me, I was ordered to never speak about UFO&#39;s again.  I eventually retired from the military as a Major in 1997<n>

From our deck, which was quite high, as we lived in a split-level, could be seen the Connecticut Light &amp; Power Building that was on a hill alongside the turnpike.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been visiting a friend’s house the next street over and instead of cutting through their backyard and the neighbor’s directly across from our house, I chose to walk down her street, which was perhaps 200 yards, turn left facing the CLP Bldg., which was Meadow St., go perhaps another 200 yards, and then left again onto Ralph Ave. which was where my house was, perhaps another 100 yards.  After I had walked about halfway on Meadow St., I happened to look up and noticed something above me, moving at my rate of speed.  It was not very wide, perhaps 25 ft., but it had a small orange or red light on either side of it, the length was perhaps 25 ft. also, and it was completely noiseless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued walking home, but do not really remember it.  I know when I walked into the foyer which was in the middle of the levels of the house, I closed the door leaning against it.  My father happened to be at the top of the upper level by the kitchen and looked at me, and said, &#34;You look like you’ve seen a ghost.&#34;   I told him what I had seen and he and I went out through the kitchen door to the deck and looked to see if we could see the object.  It appeared from around the right side of the house, and then it accelerated at tremendous speed passing over the CLP Bldg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father swore and ran into the house, and got on the phone to report the sighting, but I’m not sure who he reported it to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At approx. 2100 hours, I received a call from the Wing Security controller asking me to tune my radio to the base frequency.  I did and started listening to a series of events that began with a missile site losing power and a strike team being dispatched to the site only to see this saucer shaped device hovering over the site.  When the team was ordered to advance onto the site, the device backed away and power returned as soon as it was away from the site.  This happened in the southernmost flight area OF THE MISSILE COMPLEX.  tHE DEVICE BEGAN A SLOW NORTHERLY ROUTE, TRACKING OVER MISSILE SITES AS IT WENT.  eACH TIME IT WOULD CROSS A SITE, THE POWER WOULD BE LOST AND RETURN SAS SOON AS IT PASSED AWAY.  tHE DEVICE CAME NEARLY OVER THE BASE AND WAS VISUALLY SIGHTED BY THE WEATHER OBSERVERS AND CONTROL TOWER PERSONNEL.  iT CONTINUED NORTH OUT OF THE WING AREA WITHOUT INCIDENT EXCEPT FOR THE POWER OUTAGES.

I was between 10-12 (have have to go back to where my bed was placed in my bedroom [which wall gives me a point of reference to my age, yet it was before my parents purchaced new furniture that I picked out in Maquoketa, Iowa.] And my headboarded was on the south wall.) I first heard a noise outside in a field, we did not have many plane fly over our property so it woke me up. I went to the center window and looked out. The sound was coming from this very well lit disk. Then suddenly one of the lights in a fragment of a second ,it appeared, shot over to me standing and looking at this lit craft. I hit the floor, in that southwest corner covering my face feeling my room was flooded with light and trembling with such fear I could nver forget. But we were a family that talked about nothing. Just before lite I found myself on the floor not asleep and not awake. Got back into bed and tried to forget about this all my life. And as a adult realized you better keep quiet, women never have credibility, you may never get a job. Now I don&#39;t work anyway, have health problems and I don&#39;t care what people think. Yet I don&#39;t want press. This is just a report. I felt there was a 90% chance of someone beening in my room. But fear of what I might see, and never recover from, I kept my eyes closed as tight as possible and covered with my hands. But hours did pass. How many I didn&#39;t know. I told my father about this just last year. Not to my surpise he told me to get this out of my mind, just forget about this it never happened. I said, well didn&#39;t you have a cow that had utters missing in that field. He said yes. (we were talking about the same time period.) I remembered his saying that the next morning after I experienced the saucer the night before. But arguing with out father was out of the question. It just would not be done.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date to the case so that it sorts to the year 1966.  PD))<n>

Craft banked to the east then disappeared over towards Toronto direction not far from Pearson Airport.  No noise was heard.  Several other area witnesses came around asking if we saw the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Similar craft was seen in an old UFO magazine my parents picked up for me in the USA during the summer.

Also the CF 105 AVRO Arrow a nuclear aged supersonic bomber  was developed earlier at this location but was destroyed on orders of the Conservative Government.  AVRO later closed with many of their employees heading to NASA and had a hand in the development of the Space Shuttle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting could have been an experimental aircraft for the US military having to have a forced landing at Pearson or Downsview Military Airport in North York.

It was a very dark night with no visible stars. We were all outside at a private home and were not drinking. The home was along the Seine River about one mile from the old Patton Bridge near Samois sur Seine. We (the three USAF Officers) talked later in private and were in concert with what we had seen.

Does anyone else remember this event??  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brillant light engulfs Mt Rainier Campsite (1966-67)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was told I should report this to the best of my memory by friends. My parents often camped at this campsite near Tootle River (Creek?)where my father loved to fish. One evening during the Summer Months when I was about 16 yrs old after we retired to our trailer (among about 6 other trailers)we were woke up by a brillant light that engulfed the entire campsite. I was on the top bunk where I had a small window (10X24 inches) to look out of.  The light was of emmense bright light that made the trees appear almost white ... there was kinda a &#34;sudden low base blast sound&#34; which is hard to describe when it appeared (There was no visible craft to be seen - only light).  The light seem to come from straight above the campsite shining over the entire area.  My parents were sleeping in the dining/converted bed area where they had the bigger window, I remember My dad replying &#34;What the SH&amp;t is that?&#34; and wanting to go outside which my mother urged him not too because she had a bad feeling about it, So they both stared at it through the windows. I could hear other campers making sounds of alarm and some movement.  I tried to see as much as I could through my tiny window but it was hard. Then suddenly the light blinked off and we were in total darkness again (as there were no street lights in the area).  I then heard one of the campers yelling at his family to pack up so they could leave.....hearing them drive off later.  But other campers stayed the night til morning. When we got up the following morning there was a Forest Ranger going to each of the campers asking questions and getting names of everybody. When he went to talk to my parents he said &#34;I heard there was a bit of excitement here last night could you fill me in&#34;. My Mom looked at my Dad and then looked at me &amp; my brother and told us to go down to the River, so I was unable to hear any other detail. But when we went back to the campsite, the other trailers were gone except for ours and one other.  My father refused to leave because he was determined to have his fishing trip.  That following night we were woke again t! o someth ing shaking our trailer violently which suddenly stopped as it began. We left the following morning. I don&#39;t know if this incident is searchable through Mt Rainier records or not but if someone remembers this, I sure like to find out more.<n>

This meant that the vehicle would be over 50000 ft above sea level to be visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident simply confirmed to my father what he had full believe in, that life did exist outside of planet earth.  For the rest of his life until his pasing at 98 years of age, he tied this sighting to an event that took place in 1924 when he did most of his flying up the coast of British Columbia.  That year his comrade was lost in Sept  on a flying patrol up the coast to Prince Rupert, and they set out to try and find him in an old Cutris H2SL flying boat. After a day of unproductive searching they flew into an olf fishing village at Bella Bella, where they had fuel stored, and a wharf.  They tied up for the night in the small harbor, and were awaken at 02:00 hrs by the sounds of gushing water.  In the harbor, lit only by moonlight was a killer whale, with floating bebris nearby.  My father armed with his 3030 went down to the warf where the whale has made his way along side.  They made eye contact for a few seconds, a profound moment in my fathers life, the whale retreated leaving the debris exposed, where the log book of the downed flying boat was retrieved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ebbing tide then took the rest of the debris out to sea and the whale disappeared.  The search was over, however this event which I was told about since I was a kid, coupled with the UFO sighting in 1966, convinced by father that the forces which produced the UFO where the same as those that directed the whale to the village.  I have attached a photo taken in 1924 of dad and his flying boat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I can vaguely remember a small open field area that may have had a swing set or some kind of park equipment located on the Officers side of the base housing area.  Because I was only ~7 years old at the time, I only remember that to this day I believe I saw a UFO at very close range.  It seemed to appear out of nowhere, as I don&#39;t remember having any feelings of fright that something was coming towards me.  All I can remember is that while walking towards the housing from the Non-commissioned officers housing side of the road to the officers side, I crossed a small open grassy/weedy space when I felt different and I believe I heard something when this huge &#34;thing&#34; seemed to appear out of nowhere impairing my ability to see straight above me. I remember it seemed to be hovering just above tree line straight above me.  It displayed moving colored lights.  At one time I could have said what colors, but the only color I am mostly sure of this many years later is blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You would think at age ~7 I would have been horribly frightened.  I was quite the rascal when I was young, so I was likely analyzing everything and at the same time I was a little afraid.  I remember feeling uncomfortable and a little scared, and I did run home after about a minute or so of being awe struck.  I can&#39;t remember if I told my mother or father upon my return.  I have made mention of this to my father over the years, but I think he believes it was just a childs memory of something easily explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father was an A.F. pilot - ((rank and name deleted)), who was ((deleted--military and flying career officially and formally acknowledged)) for his honorable military career.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say this much, since that time; I have never written about my experience nor really spoke of it much to others because I don&#39;t think I was ever taken serious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know the experience was real. I know my feelings while it was happening, and trust what instinct and intuition I had at that time.  I know it was an event that I will remember for the rest of my life, and that children don&#39;t remember events all through their life unless there is good reason.  I remain to believe to this day that I saw something that was technologically impossible for that time.  It just took years later to understand that as a child I didn&#39;t have much of an idea about technological abilities for that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t sleep so thought I would finally see what I could find about Luke AFB around 1967 with any links to UFO sightings.  I found one specific link that summarized a UFO being right above Luke AFB.  As soon as I saw this, I felt compelled to write something about my experience no matter if it fell into the abyss somewhere or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Really the sighting itself has not been that big of a deal.  It&#39;s only that I have wondered about things all these years:  What was it, who or what was inside, why was it right above me, was something watching me?  One strange thing too is that since I couldn&#39;t really remember how it appeared when it did without me noticing anything before, I had often wondered about the sound or the feeling that something was wrong before it actually happened.  Like I had some instinctive alarm that there was some impending danger, but then dismissed it and ran off.  Or, if something affected me in some way prior to its suddenly appearing above me.  If it hadn&#39;t been so fast at seemingly coming out of nowhere, maybe I never would have questioned what it was.  I don&#39;t know, and never will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I never had a camera but I looked out of the upstairs window and saw these bright lights coming in the sky from the direction of Crosley Field.  I ran down stairs and went outside.  There was a ball field for children just over the bank from our building.  There was a saucer shape object coming over slowly It looked like two plates put together with bright white lights running around it in the middle.  It made no noise other than a swish/  My neighbor woman and I followed it up the street.  It went up to the area where the trees were  and stopped in mid air, It was too low to go over the trees. It up straight up and was out of sight in seconds.  Then later an announcement came over the same station that it was just an advertising plane.  But the plane that came over was from a different direction, looked like a regular plane,made noise like a plane and had red and green lights.  We talked about it to our selves but did not say anything to  anyone else.   Jean Dixon had made a prediction about aliens coming down to get the teenagers about that time, so all the children were hid.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It later moved slowly over the rifle range and then  a row of colored lites appeared around the bottom of it before it disappeared.  There was nothing on TV or papers. With the military base and Language Institute being there, I know a lot of people had to see it.  Yes, I&#39;ve had abduction experiences as a child and adult.  I even went to a shrink in the mid 70&#39;s just to tell this, and never went back due to being in law enforcement and my need to just tell someone and maybe get an answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it was summer 1965-1967, I don&#39;t remember having to attend school. We were leaving our house on FT Ord to drive to a store in Seaside, when we observed a large shiney metallic object hovering over MontereyBay. My brothers and I watched it out of the car window until we returned from the store and then sat in the yard watching as other neighbors watched also.  After hovering over the bay for awhile, it slowly moved over to the rifle range and I guess it hovered for approx 10 minutes, a row of colored lites appeared around the bottom of it (the sun had not quite set) and then it disappeared.  My brother had called the TV station (channel 4 or 8) but they didn&#39;t know anything. I know that with the Monterey Airport being nearby, FT Ord and the Navy Language Institute being based on the Monterey Peninsula; some of those people had to see it too.  It was not a plane or weather balloon!  It stayed in one place to long before moving, and the sun did reflect off of it, the sun moved, it didn&#39;t. I&#39;m almost 46yrs old.  I can still remember that day, I don&#39;t really talk about it.  I&#39;m a military brat (my day did 20yrs), I&#39;m an AirForce Vet. I&#39;ve worked in LawEnforcemnet,Airline Industry, collge educ., teaching, and now I&#39;m in Law Enforcement in Georgia.  My husbandjust retired 20yrs Mil. I&#39;ve tried to explain it all away over the years through religion. No, I don&#39;t attend any sort of religious services. I believe in God, but I also know what I&#39;ve experienced over the course of my life is real too.  I always knew when they were coming.  They always came in the fall time of the year.  I&#39;d get ear ringing an then paralized, but my mind was very much aware. They materialized out of thin air and then I was some place else.  I seem to have been the only one in my family who has been abducted.  One of my brothers who is now 42, had an experience as a toddler, that I&#39;ll never forget.  He was standing in his crib screaming that the big eyed dogs were afer him, my parents had to rush him to Walter Reed Army Hosp. in Wash.DC (my dad was stationed in Va.) he was hysterical and couldnt be put down on the floor.  I remember getting a sneak peek at him while he was in the Hosp. he had white patches on both eyes, he was never the same again after that.  I could go on, but this is not what you want to hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Oakdale has a radar facility.  I&#39;m unsure of the exact month and year of this event, guessing summer 66. This happened on a late Friday afternoon as we were off duty and preparing for the weekend. Guys were packing, showering, rushing around, when all of a sudden some guy says &#34;good Lord look out your windows&#34;.  So everyone pushed their way to windows and to see a huge gunmetal grey craft just hanging low in the sky near the radar. I&#39;m not good at measurements and distance but it was no more than a football field away. There was no sound coming from the craft and around the edge were colored rotating windows/lights. Everyone who was outside the barracks were just standing transfixed with their mouths hanging open as were those inside looking from the windows. I have no idea how many guys were there I&#39;m guessing at least 100. This event lasted 10 minutes at the most and the craft shot away in a flash. What a buzz of chatter afterwards. Someone who worked at the radar station phoned to see what was going on and to explain what we had just seen. They answered that nothing showed up on the radar and to forget what we just saw and not talk about it. I don&#39;t remember much talk about it after the weekend. I never did forget. It was a spectacular sight to see a craft so close in bright daylight and not so easily dismissed by me. The odd thing is that every guy there probably had a camera but they were so transfixed and no one got a photo. You can&#39;t tell me they don&#39;t exist.<n>

From what I can recall of the people present, there were probably five or six of us playing baseball in a large lot between two buildings. Don’t remember who said look at that up in the sky but we all froze when we saw the object. I recently checked out on google-earth the direction the object was traveling and it seems that it was going exactly south to north. The object was a large ball, but not fire. It had molten liquid flowing over its entire surface. The colors were blending and constantly moving. I can still picture it after all this time. The colors were green, purple and red and with other colors. It was moving horizontally with the earth. It also was an overcast day but not raining. The sky gave a good backdrop of the object. It was the size of a hardball if it was at ceiling height. There was no wind that could be felt at the time. As it went past overhead you could hear it make a slight whooshing sound. Its speed was probably about that of a single engine plane, not fast at all. I remember saying to my brother how can it stay up in the air going so slow. I also thought it odd that the liquid stayed on the object and did not drop off of it. I just can’t remember what year it was exactly, probably 1966 or 1967. At the time I was fourteen or fifteen. It has just bothered me all these years as to what it was. I wonder if you have heard of anything like this from other people? It’s just something you can’t forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You For Your Time<n>

6/15/66 11:00|Roseburg|OR|Other|about an hour|i saw YHVH and afterwards there apopeared a ufo in the following week that took me from a tent and tatooed me, project blue book there.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51879.html|41|ndxe196606| i saw YHVH and afterwards there apopeared a ufo in the following week that took me from a tent and tatooed me, project blue book there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i had just finished my 7th grade class and had been given the advice to use the summer to think about what vocation i might have an interest in for the rest of my life.  i came home and talked about it with my favorite person, my foster dad, who worked for the veterans administration in town. we were living in the melrose edenbower addition and were in thhe foothills next to the Callahan Mtn. on doerner rd. we lived as devout roman catholics, and he said to pray about it and smiled. so i fasted and prayed in my bedroom for seven days. i felt a breakthrough in the spirit on the seventh day, a mind image of a path that was unmarked but available and i then quit and resumed household duties.  i expected i&#39;d just be shown something, but i was unprepared as to what was about to happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was a summer mornming on the farm; everyone went outside after breakfast, leaving me alone to clean the living room. i was idly thinking while i cleaned about a career in either anthropology or egyptology or in vetrinary science  while i was cleaning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i heard a man calling my name, each time of the three times getting louder and louder! the last time it felt like i was being defragged like a computer program.  i was bewildered! i thought that i t ws my two playful practical joker brothers and a microphone, but there was neither of them at the house at that time, and when i asked who it was, i smelled the fragrance of frakincense and sandalwood and myrrh, like old style Roman Catholic high church incense....and as i looked around the room my attention ws directed to the ceiling and i heard a voice say, &#34;this is my beloved daughter in whom i am well pleased&#34;...i did a dougle take, amazed because i was adsopted and didn&#39;t know who or where (not much) about where i was from)and i sensed but at this point i did not see another dimension which contained a large kings throne room and many people assembled all around a mighty King.  they were in a previously not seen or felt space above my head and i was below their feet - about four feet. then i said weakly, who are you? tell me who you are? i thought i was hallucinating, and i was scared! i was also only about 13 years old! then i looked up above the top of an opening &#34;arch&#34; doorway into the dining room, and the wall, the ceiling above as well, disappeared and i was looking upon a large object in the sky!  it was far away of about at least 10 miiles from me but it was huge! it was a waterfall of what looked like molten gold, and it was surrounded on both sides by thunder clouds flashing thunder and lightningm and surmounting the waterfall and its pool which was outrageous with detail of molten gold for water and golden flames, but also the powdered golden &#34;mist&#34; that arose from it and a huge rainbow over the top, with a white crystal throne and two persons radiating immense light that made me feel like i ws dying every time i looked up at them- a man standing to the right in long white robe, red robe that went over one shoulder and he looked just like the popular Jesus Christ pictures.  the wone sitting down had a long grey beard and wore a long flowing white robe.  One voice very powerfully vibrated through the air and me said, &#34;I AM JEHOVAH, the Father Almighty, the Creator Almighty.&#34; (note: this means the tetragrammaton. i was standing there amazed, with a broom in my hand and i noticed i was still holding it and i immediately thought of the moses movie and took off my shoes and put the broom on the ground and did the same thing, got on the floor on my knees, and started praising God.  i thought to ask HIM. HE asked me to be HIS Wayshower, and showed me a vison of a misty white large road in the sky with viscous black walls on either side, and that the light of the Creator fell on on this road.  HE said, &#34;If anyone argues with you about what you think, do say and testify to leave them by the wayside.&#34; i was shown a image of me grown up as an adult showing a indian man into the viscous wayside, where GOD looked down on his entrapped form crying and turned away from him with finality.  i then said l&#34;let everything i think, do say and testify to be of you and not of myself so that otheres will know you have sent me.&#34; then i worshipped THEM and i looked up from where i was bowed and they were gone.  in the afterward, my foster monm and two child siblings entered the house and said to me &#34;what happpened? you&#39;re glowing very bright.&#34; I was lit up like a neon sign, and they put a sheer curtain over my head so they could look at me.  afterwards, there was a ufo silver disk, with a bulging ring of protholes, about 15&#39; across that landed in the next week while i was up at the nextdoor neighbors camping out and i ws &#34;abducted&#34; from the tent, given a physical examination and tatooed with an egyptian heiroglyphic that is the name for NIT- a weaving shuttle- on my right groin area over the ovary.  my stomach bulgeed and i felt like i had radiation sickness for the next 2 weeks, causing my family to be tightlipped and very worried, but they refused to tell anyone because my dad worked for the government.  the blue book came out and white curtained the area of the landing, because the craft burnt depressions into the asphalt road at the bend right past the house where i lived.  I peeked over the edge of the hill and was pspotted and photographed (glowing) because i wanted to see what was going on behind the white curtains. that fall, the family doctor gave everyone a complete physical examination and photographed my tatoo for the FBI (i saw the markings card marked FBI which the doctor with alot of excalamations filled out and took a one step polaroid picture of the mark.  i didn&#39;t tell him the truth.  and that began to be the first of countless ufo contacts with the good guys of Heaven.  unfortunately, years later, the two other girls with me in the tent have succumbed to cancer, although that didn&#39;t happen till they hit their adult years.  i began to be very talented and did amazing things which my foster family couldn&#39;t get over, like levitation and fire shooting from my hands and body.  i was a pretty good little girl, and i was known as a mindreader and very pronounced psi talented.  athere were other events, but this is where it first started, although i remember instances in milpitas california as a baby where shadowy &#34;white&#34; people like ghosts used to come into our house and visit me, telling me not to forget what i was here for, to be with me when i was scared at night, etc.  alot about don&#39;t forget the promise, the plan.  that&#39;s all for now.  these are not all the details of what happened the first time for me on doerner road in oregon.  oh, and the guys that got off the craft were humanlike, with golden blonde short, curly hair and gold and purple close fitting jumpsuits and white silverish boots.  they didn&#39;t seem to have seams in the clothes who piloted the craft that burnt the holes in the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I also don’t remember the time of year but it seems to me it was summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stepped out of the back door of our apartment building, there was an object directly overhead and was stationary.

6/15/66 04:00|Stoughton|WI|Sphere|one hour|Our family abducted by aliens near Stoughton, Wisconsin in Summer of 1966|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88640.html|43|ndxe196606| Our family abducted by aliens near Stoughton, Wisconsin in Summer of 1966  500 Lights On Object0: Yes<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the info was obtained either in hypnotherapy sessions or by a method of self-hypnosis taught to me by the hypnotherapist.  I am putting all of the events together in somewhat chronological order. I feel this event occurred when I was about 5 or 6 years old while our family was driving from our home in suburban Chicago, Illinois.  My mom&#39;s parents owned a resort on a lake in northern Wisconsin. We used to leave our house in the early hours of the morning on these family trips in the Summer. Under hypnosis I recalled the events basically beginning like this.  Seeing a huge ball of light in front of us. As if the moon had come down out of the sky.  The light was all contained within the big globe of light. It did not refract like a flashlight or other kind of light. I also recall seeing curved kind of diamond shaped different colored lights reflected either on the windshield or on the dashboard. Our car was stopped on the side of the road.  Behind our car dow! n the road there was a blue light. There were three tall figures silhouetted coming from that light toward our car. I was very upset at this point in the hypnotherapy.  Then there was a figure at the driver&#39;s window. It looked like someone with an orange monkey face.  He reached in through the open window and did something with the ignition or steering wheel. I was not upset at all about this but very calm. I recall seeing my dad either staring straight ahead in a daze or slumped over the wheel.  Then several of us (Mom from the passenger seat directly in front of me; brother a year younger; sister two years younger than me; and myself) were taken from the vehicle and led by very tall beings whom I cannot completely recall. Our baby sister was in her carseat in the back and we left her behind. She was crying. One of the beings picked up my sister 2 years younger than me. She touched it&#39;s face. I could not recall what the face looked like. A being took my hand in its hand and l! ed me out of the car. The closest I can describe the feeling o! f its ha nd is like those rubber toys that have the wires inside and how they feel when you bend them. Its fingers felt like that. Then we were inside the craft. It was sectioned like orange sections inside in crescent shapes. The floor had kind of ribbed raised strips and was like foam rubber. It was gradually curving just like an orange section would be. There was a man who was standing on the side of an entrance. He looked like a movie star. His skin color was pink but extreme pink like carnation pink. Not a natural human pink skin color. He was wearing what looked like a snowmobile suit. Then I looked again and in his place was some kind of robot or metal kind of statue with a base and a pole and top like for a head. I then saw my mother laying down. She was rubbing the right side of her head. Then I saw my brother laying down and he was also rubbing the right side of his head. I did not see my sister on board the craft. Then I was laying down. They took something and shoved it u! p my right nostril and I felt a pain like a headache on the right side of my head and I rubbed my head as well. I could not &#39;see&#39; the beings standing around me very well at first. But since that time I have had more information come to me and they were what I would call &#34;The Whites&#34;. Their skin is chalk white. They have big eyes like fish eyes and they have large appendages on the sides of their heads like big ears. They wear clothes which are black and shiny like the cloth is of spun shiny metal. Thinking about that cloth gives me a creepy feeling. They pulled down my pants and used a sharp object on me. During that time I thought they only touched the end of my penis with it. But since that time it has come to me that they shoved it up inside the shaft. It was a long needle. That is all I have recalled about being on the ship. I have a vague memory of being back in the car and nobody saying anything for quite some time. And dad also just driving silently for a ways before! we gradually started talking again and being I guess aware of! where w e were.<n>

This sighting was in 1966, not sure what month.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One time I swear someone (or something) saved our guys on four River Gun Boats (three man crews) when around 0300 they did their best to hold five North Vietnam Junks full of guns and explosives until the sun came up so they could check them for weapons and such and to also take prisoners.  I was on duty on the Bridge with my Flak Jacket and Helmet when suddenly just before the sun came up all hell broke loose.  The Junks all began to fire at the River Boats (at me too).  The River Boat crews held their own as best they could, but I saw several of the crew hit badly during the fire fight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the sudden four of the five Junks were blown out of the water by some unseen friend overhead.  They just exploded into oblivion, no residual left.  I saw only one flash, what looked like a lightning bolt, hit a Junk and it exploded.  I hit the deck when bullets from the junks started hitting all around my head.  The last Junk gave up quickly, and our ship took credit for the save.  I saw it!  I know we did not do it, but since truth is stranger than fiction I left it at that.  Thank you friends whoever you were.  You saved our guys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, all I have to offer is my word, no pics. I had pics, though not of the unseen craft that fired on the Junks.  I took pics because that was part of my job to document the firing activity of our ship, but we were never allowed to keep a private camera (because of what we saw daily with the Russians).  The only pics I had were OKd by the raining head of Naval Security Headquarters at ComSecGruAct West Pacific Station, Yokosuka, Japan.  Wish I had hidden a few rolls, they were something to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attest to this as fact, and to other sightings during various conflict actions during the years 1966 and 1968 in and around the Viet Nam conflict area when I served aboard a U.S. Naval vessel.  When on duty in Plotting I saw numerous blips on my screens that we all knew were not our aircraft and had no idea who’s they were.  I assume some of these blips were our unseen friends who saved our guys.  I know there are other military personnel who can also attest to such happenings during this same period because being Naval Security I heard the stories.  I hope they have the courage to come forward as I just have and risk being humiliation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite eloquent and sober-minede.

Our house had a large open field that ended in woods. My aunt &amp; uncle lived in the house next to us, large field separated our houses. I remember the weather being a cool summer evening; remember the grass being cool on my bare feet, light warm breeze, just before dark.  I was in my Aunts kitchen when my mother took my hand and followed my aunt into her back yard where the other children were, everyone was standing still, staring about 4-6 ft maybe at one, maybe more, flat oval shaped,  glowing softly sphere, that was silent. The colors inside reminded of the colorful swirls you see in a soap bubble. I remember thinking to myself if I could touch it my hand would go right through it. It felt like it was watching us too. I stood there holding my mother’s hand, motionless, like everyone for what it seemed like an hour, more likely 15-20minutes. I remember hearing someone whisper “what is it” but no one answered, maybe for fear it would go away, we all just stared in silence, then all of a sudden…like a camera flash, it was gone? I never recall our families ever talking about it? Maybe the older ones did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m now 45 years old, recently, talking family and friends about UFO’s unexplained things etc... I asked my older sister, who was there that night, if she&#39;d remember the lighted sphere or was I just recalling a stupid childhood dream that stayed with me? She immediately replied, &#34;Oh my God!! That is so weird! I was just thinking of that the other day and telling a co-worker about it. I had never brought it up before, just one of those things, you store away until something brings it to mind. I though it would be interesting to know if anyone else in that area around the same time recalled seeing this<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We watched it as it zig zagged across over us all the way home.  Then it went to the west of town and just stayed hoovering there for about 3 hours or more.  We didn&#39;t call anyone cause my Mom was afraid to.  We told friends and some even saw it.  I have seen UFOs at least 2 more times after that.  Once in Tucson, Az, in 1976, and again in 1985 or 1986.  The one in 1976 was again an oval hoovering over the Air Plane Grave Yard  There, and 6 or more saw that.

It was very bright and the incident occured in open sky with no clouds to obstruct anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then I have had various sightings through the years in which I observed something moving at appartently thousands of miles an hour.  They would leave a light trail behind them and seemed jerky in their movements.  Sometimes they would make a sharp 90 degree turn without any arc at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One very clear sighting was a object bright green in color and at first looke like a meteor coming down.

These lights were nothing like flares and had their own qualities that set them apart.  They had a clarity about them like no lights I had seen.  They did not flicker or seem to float.  A flare with flicker from near to black to bright and then eventually burn out.  When these lights disapeared it was as if someone had turned off a switch.  They were also about thirty miles further south from where the Air Force reserve range is supposed to be.  What these craft are, I do not know but they are nothing I know of along with the manuvers they make.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years I have learned to differentiate from other objects and some of the many sightings I have made, stand as outright UFO&#39;s.<n>

Was not able to estimate distance from ground.  We observed light moving against clear black star covered sky.  We thought that the light was an air plane but it stopped moving and made a circular motion.  We then thought it may be a helicopter but we were not sure if they could fly in a tight circle, we did not think so.  We kept our eyes fixed on the light.  It started moving in a northern direction and accelerated and dissappeard over the Santa Monica Mountains so quickly, less than a second that it was quite disturbing, to me at least.  I estimate the distance to be more than 50 miles or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it was but I knew even then that nothing could move so fast and so far in such a short time.<n>

Very late, probably around one am, we drove back to my parents’ home near the city limits. Just as we approached, a bright light three blocks away attracted our attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This being the neighborhood where I had grown up, I assumed the floodlight was from an Edison power crew working on a large transformer that sat in a fenced-off corner of Congress Street and Owendale and located at one end of land owed by the school district. Since we were still wide awake, we continued on to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To our astonishment, there  was no  Edison truck. Instead, the floodlight came from directly above the treetops. Its light source was a circular-shaped craft outlined by pulsating colored lights and hovering silently perhaps thirty feet or so over the power station. I remember shouting to my son asleep in  the back  seat and  trying to wake him. (He was only four and remembers  little of it  today.)  Certainly aware that the three occupants of a VW beetle posed no threat, the craft slowly lifted above treetop level and silently accelerated about a quarter mile over the trees  lining the road when it abruptly stopped, almost as though it  waited for us to catch up.  Of course I tried. When I drew near, the craft raced another quarter mile or so and again stopped just above tree level. It repeated this strange “catch us if you can’’ maneuver a  final time. Then suddenly it rose. I remember jumping out of  the car  and watching as the craft  accelerated and merged with  the stars. The entire encounter was over in probably two or three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hurried home, burst into my  sleeping parents’ bedroom, awakened them, and  shared our experience. My Mom believed us; my dad, probably not. What I do know is that my wife and I had encountered and tried  to chase an  extra- terrestrial craft one early morning. And as long as I live, I will never forget the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was dark and we could see only the lights but I estimate it to have been 300 feet in diameter (a perfectly round disk or squat cylinder with slightly domed top) and perhaps 50 feet tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a band of lights around the perimeter through which lights pulsated in a teardrop pattern (a band of teardrops moving head to tail around the perimeter of the object).  The faster the ship moved, the faster the light pattern went around the perimeter.  The lights were white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I surmise it had a domed top is because there was a blue light on top that moved around in a semi-spherical motion.  The object was utterly silent and incredibly swift.  If you did not look, you would not have known it was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were other witnesses but no one spoke of it.  The object disappeared over a hill behind us and did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The following message is submitted on July 10, 2001, by the individual who submitted the report above.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am one of the two people who have reported the disk in Hickory NC in June 1966.  The other reported sighting corroborates exactly what I saw but they reported seeing it about 2 days after I saw it, ...it has been a long time...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also seen a report elsewhere on a very similar craft around the same time in Venice, California.  It could also be the craft of Hingham, Mass., sighting of 4/1/66.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also a similar craft illustrated on a UFO documentary a few years ago (it looked like the craft I saw, with the teardrop shaped lights rotating in a band around the perimeter but was much smaller than the craft I saw).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My question is, how best can I research this particular craft at that time?  It was quite large, probably 300&#39; diameter and 50&#39; thick.  It had a pattern of large white teardrop shaped lights rotating in a band around the perimeter of the disk.  There was a blue light either above or below.  Other than that there were no visible features, except that it blocked out the! stars as it flew over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks,<n> <n><n> ((name deleted))  ph 678-((number deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Response to July 10, 2001, message))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for the message, and for the information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With regard to researching the events, there is probably no better way than going to local newspapers.  If even just a small group of people witnessed the object, newspaper reports might have been generated in the local publications.  Since UFO materials usually get front page coverage in local papers, you can usually scan just the front page of every issue, and that will tell you whether you are looking at the correct edition.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have had sightings that you have not submitted to our Online Report Form, I would welcome such reports.  If you could take just a few minutes to generate a description of each sighting and submit it, using that form, that will preserve the sighting, and make it available to others to read.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, if you would like to submit an illustration of the objects you have witnessed, we will scan them, and post them with your report in the future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END JULY 10, 2001, REPLY))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((SECOND CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a correction for a sighting that I posted several years ago. I posted that the sighting was June 8, 1966. That was an approximate date. My mother passed away recently and, going thru her effects I found an entry in her journal for the noted event. The date that she wrote down was June 10, 1966. Ibelieve that her date is more accurate than my date. If you like, please change the date from the 8th to the 10th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the witness for investigating the sighting further, and obtaining the precise date for the sighting.

MY MOTHER WAS IN THE KITCHEN TALKING TO A FRIEND ON THE TELEPHONE. THE KITCHEN LITE WAS OFF BUT IT WAS NOT DARK IN THERE. MY MOTHER CALLED FOR US KIDS TO COME INTO THE KITCHEN TO LOOK AT SOMETHING. SHE SAID SHE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT THIS SMALL LITE IN THE SKY OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW WHILE SHE WAS TALKING ON THE PHONE. THE LITE HAD BEEN GETTING BIGGER BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING CLOSER TO THE HOUSE. IT WAS PROBABLY ABOUT 9 PM SO THE SKY WAS DARK. WHAT REALLY GOT HER INTERESTED IN THE LITE WAS IT WOULD MOVE AND THEN STOP IN THE SKY FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN MOVE AGAIN. BY THE TIME SHE CALLED US IN THE KITCHEN YOU COULD SEE ABOUT 10 WHITE LITES AROUND THE OBJECT. THE CRAFT HAD NO BLINKING LITES OR COLORED LITES ON IT LIKE A REGULAR PLANE OR HELICOPTER HAS. THE CRAFT WAS NOW JUST SITTING STILL UP IN THE SKY. IT IS HARD TO TELL HOW CLOSE IT WAS BUT I WOULD ESTIMATE ANYWHERE BETWEEN 1/4 MILE TO 1 MILE AWAY DEPENDING ON ITS SIZE. THE CRAFT THEN SLOWLY TURNED WHERE THE FRONT OR THE BRIGHTEST LITES WERE FACING US. THE ROOM FILLED WITH LITE FROM THE CRAFT AND CAST MY SHADOW ON THE BACK WALL. I GOT REALLY SCARED LIKE THIS CRAFT KNEW WE WERE WATCHING IT. IT THEN SLOWLY ROTATED A QUARTER TURN AND STARTED MOVING PARALLEL AND AWAY FROM US. WHEN IT TURNED YOU COULD REALLY TELL IT WAS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE. IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT IN A FEW MINUTES AND WE NEVER SAW IT AGAIN. MY MOTHER CALLED THE AIRPORT TO SEE IF THERE WAS A FLIGHT PLAN FOR ANY AIRCRAFT OVER OUR AREA. WE LIVED ON HUFFMAN COVE ROAD IN NORTH HICKORY. THE AIRPORT SAID THERE WAS NOT SUSPOSED TO BE ANY AIR CRAFTS IN THE AREA AT THAT TIME. IT REALLY DIDNT MATTER WHAT THEY TOLD US BECAUSE THIS WAS NO CRAFT LIKE WE HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE. I TALKED TO MY MOTHER THE OTHER NITE ABOUT THE OBJECT AND THE ONE THING THAT STANDS OUT IN OUR MINDS IS HOW WHEN IT TURNED TOWARDS US WE ALL HAD THE ERIE FEELING THAT THIS THING NEW WE SAW IT.

It was a clear day as the bus rolled through the rolling hills of Central California.  I glanced through the right side window where I sat to admire the golden California countryside.  I saw hovering over the mountains in the distance a huge object.  I assumed it was a dirigible the Navy used to use during the Second World War to observe the ocean front property where they kept an eye open for enemy subs and such.  Then I realized it had been keeping up with the bus for over an hour.  The mountains in the distance were high, but this cigar shaped thing dwarfed the mountains it hovered over.  I knew then and there it was a different kind of craft than a dirigible because I had studied the history of dirigibles and knew they could not move that fast.  I also realized that dirigibles were not as big as this thing was.  Keeping in mind that I was in Central California where things look closer than they really are, it had to be longer than fourteen football fields, it was huge, far longer than any conventional dirigibles being used at the time, or at any other time in military history.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way to a secret Naval Security Base with a Top Secret Clearance, so there was no way I was going to report the incident or I would have been chipping paint on a submarine for the rest of my Naval career.  I was trained as a Communications Tech and knew how to spot unusual objects in the sky (because that was my job), and spent years on a ship (in plotting) during the Viet Nam era, where I used all available equipment to track and plot each aircraft over and off Viet Nam soil.  I had pics but we were never allowed to keep a private camera (because of what we saw daily).  The only pics I had were OKd by the training head of Naval Security in our sector, which I do not want to mention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wish I had hidden a few, they were something to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attest to this fact, and to other sightings during various conflict actions during the years 1966 and 1968 in and around the Viet Nam conflict.  The cigar shaped one was only the first, many more followed.  I guess this happened because my job in the military always had to do with Top Secret Operations, and I’m sure they (whoever they are) kept an open eye on everything we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One time I swear someone (or something) saved our guys on four River Gun Boats (three man crews) when they did their best to hold five North Vietnam Junks full of guns and explosives until the sun came up so they could check them for illegal weapons and such and to take prisoners.  I was on duty on the Bridge with my Flak Jacket and Helmet when suddenly all hell broke loose.  The Junks all began to fire at the River Boats (at me too).  The River Boat crews held their own as best they could, but I saw several of the crew hit badly during the fight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the sudden four of the five Junks were blown out of the water by some unseen friend overhead. They just exploded into oblivion, no residual left.  I saw only one flash, what looked like a lightning strike, hit a Junk and it exploded.  I hit the deck when bullets started hitting all around my head.  The last Junk gave up quickly, and our ship took credit for the save.  I saw it, I know we did not do it, but since truth is stranger than fiction so I left it at that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you friends whoever you were.  You saved our guys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But all I have to offer is my word, no pics.  Please do not ever mention my name over the air because I am still bound by my Top Secret Clearance (for life) and could be in lots of do-do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We can just refer to me as Henry B.

I observed a bright white round fully illuminated object at very high altitude &amp; would guess that it was not in the atmosphere.  It was slightly brighter and larger than the planet Jupiter traveling from east to west and suddenly stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All illumination was gone the second it stopped, about 4 seconds later the light came back on and it immediately started moving to the east again for about 4 seconds.  It only moved when it was illuminated and would come to an abrupt stop if not illuminated.  At arms length it traveled about four inches and repeated the same movement to the east about five times.  Traveling the same distance each time, it appeared that when the light went out that it would lock in that possession with no drifting.  I noticed by the background stars that when it stopped there was no noticeable drift, very sudden stops and starts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object was straight overhead it did its stop and light our routine again but this time when it moved again it headed straight north.  It continued the same start and stop travel, same amount of time stopped (no light) and then traveling illuminated.  It disappeared over the northern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always wondered if any one else has observed something like this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

My grandmother lived at the end of rowhouses and I was facing the other backyards and my aunt was facing the street behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Along the street behind me were maple trees that were about 20-30 ft. tall and the yards all were separated by fences but they had no tall trees in them.  My grandmother&#39;s house was a 2 1/2 story house not quite as tall as the trees along the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was talking to my aunt with my arms crossed something came into view above her head and I watched in amazement as a gun metal grey disk with orange/white lights around the edges of the whole craft (I describe the color as orange/white because it is very hard to describe the color correctly)floated towards us over the yards.  I was in shock and did not say a word to my aunt I just kept staring at it as it came to rest right above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My aunt looked up to see what I was looking at and we both stood there transfixed by what we saw.  When the object stopped right over us, we didn&#39;t hear anything, but you could feel a pulsing, I always thought that it may have been magnetic pulsing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My aunts husband who was a physicist for the government was sitting by the kitchen door and out of the corner of my eye I saw him look out the back door and jump up knocking the kitchen chair backwards in the process; he disappeared and then he reappeared with a camera and at that point the craft took off so fast that it was out of sight in the blink of an eye.  It made no sound when it took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of my other aunts was in the kitchen at the time I found out later and she witnessed the whole thing also.  To this day only my aunt in the kitchen will acknowledge that this thing happened.

Stoped car race. everyone saw, no one remembers ? Has anyone else seen this ?<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was younger, I was at a stock car race in Pennsylvania.  During the race I noticed 3 lights in the sky all round, and different colors of red, green, and yellow.  I yelled to my dad to look at the approaching lights far off in the distance when they started to intertwine with each other almost like a figure eight.  My dad and his brother were there and they both started pointing in the sky.  Soon everyone in the stadium was pointing in the sky.  Soon I noticed there was no more noise from the engines of the cars.  When I looked down at the cars, the drivers were out of their cars and pointing at the lights also.  Can’t remember the lights leaving, or my dad and brother talking about it and do not remember the race starting again.  Remember walking out to the car in the field after the race.  I do remember my mother being upset with my dad for being so late getting home.  Brought it up to my dad many times throughout his life, but he would just say he doesn’t remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad’s brother never remembered the incident either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 58 years old now and remember it like it happened yesterday.

My Dad noticed what appeared to be a spacecraft in low orbit, illuminated by the sun which had just set. I saw it, then we both saw a second spacecraft (both pinpoints of light) &#34;below&#34; it, or in formation, abeam it and maybe 100 miles &lt;?&gt;to the side of the other. We watched these for a few minutes, tracking our heads in the direction of travel, when we noticed with our peripheral vison a third light approaching from the opposite, and slightly below, other direction. They abruptly stopped when they met to form a perfect equilateral triangle. Then they paused, and moved off in a third direction. A short time later a family friend screeched to halt in front of our house, asked if we saw it and repeated our observation adding that he had had a yard full of people who also saw it.<n>

At that time, the area road was a very wooded, lonely road and a very sparsely populated area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden a ‘quiet, oval saucer  shaped object confronted me hovering directly above my car windshield, with extremely bright lights all around. Approximately 300 to 400 ft. above me.  Whatever the object was, it ‘stopped’ my automobile, in the middle of the road, and just sat there for several minutes, making absolutely no noise! Then, just as it appeared, it lifted up and was completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not a sound had I heard during the entire sighting. Then my car engine began to run again, and I hurried to my apartment, quiet sure of what I had seen. A Prince George’s County police officer and his family lived in the apartment directly above me and I immediately went to their apartment to report what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The police officer’s wife was home and immediately tried to call her husband at the Police station. Finally, upon reaching him and reporting my incident, he informed us that the reason she had trouble getting through was there were ‘dozens’ of calls coming into the station of ‘Sightings’!

I was going from Dearborn to Plymouth.  I was told not to use Hines Drive because it is deserted and if I had car problems I would be in trouble.  Hines Drive was the shortest way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a chance and went down Hines Drive.  It was very dark and deserted.  Although, I had choosen the route, I became to regret it.  All of a sudden I saw a large shiney object on the right side of the road.  Round shaped with bright blinking lights.  I would have never pulled over, but, there was one other car with a women already stopped, in front of me.  She was out of her car.  I pulled off the road behind her and got out of the car. I said to her, &#34;Do you see what I see&#34; and she said &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;I think so&#34;.  It was like seeing something and not believing what you are seeing.  I wish I had taken her number or she had taken mine.  I said it must be some kind of publicity stunt for an upcoming movie or a radio station promotion or something like that.  We stood there and stared in fascination and amazement shaking our heads.  We both got back into our cars and I preceeded to go to the shower.  Although, I had left early, took the shortest route, I arrived at the shower very late.  I kept saying, you just wonuldn&#39;t believe what just happened to me.  We all agreed it had to be a radio thing.  The next day a called several popular radio statations and the newspapers and they weren&#39;t aware of anything of that nature taking place.  I really never thought about it for a long time until I saw a story on TV about a couple that had been abducted.  I still have never mentioned it to anyone since that incident.  I developed skin cancer of my back which they claimed was from the sun.  I never exposed my body, (the middle of my back) to the sun.  I have been sick in one way or other every since.  I often wonder it something happened and I just don&#39;t remember it.  I would be willing to take a lie detector test or sodium petathal or hypnosis.  I swear on my life this happene! d.  The craft was landed not hoovering. It was deadly silent but visually active.  I was in my 20&#39;s.  At that time you were considered nuts, it you told somethone this story.  In light of things I have seen lately, I am rethinking the incident.  I don&#39;t know how to cut and paste.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I belive previously it was the Tommy Mansville estate. I believe they were working on lasers. There used to be danger signs of laser experimation on the windows of certain buildings. Was dusk one evening when myself and a friend of mine were walking through the property. The guards would always chase us of the property all the time. We looked out into a small field above a parking lot and observed some type of capsule. The closest thing I can recall it was like the Renaults of the time. Rounded corners like a little roller skate. We decided to investigate this. As we walked into the perimiter of the craft?we thought is was a car and could not figure out how this could have got into the field. About a hundred feet from the car we were shocked 2 find two people wxit the vehicle. I can only remember they were around 5 ft tall. When we saw the faces, just like the pictures I see on TV. Small with large heads and large eyes. We paniced and decided to run for the fences surrounding the property. Each and every time I looked back they were about a foot above the grass and right on our tails. ((name deleted)), my buddie crossed the road into his house and I was left trying to reach my parents property approx an 1/8 mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom can recall the day I dashed into the basement totally out of controll. She said I went down stairs and lqayed in a fetal position for eight hours. She still does not know what went on that night.

My family lived in Crooksville, OH, approximately 40  miles,  We visited my family about three, or more, times a week.  Mostly in the evenings, after he got off work.  We were traveling East on State Route 40 when one of us, (I can&#39;t remember who saw it first.) noticed the object in the sky, to the right.  It looked as if it was some distance away.  It was approximately 5:30 or 6:00 PM, and still light outside but there was a lighter oblong shape in the sky.  I&#39;ve always said it looked like an &#34;opening&#34; in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the bottom end of it small (looked small to us) black frisbee shaped object would come out, and fly around close to the area it seemed to emerge from and fly back in.  When it went back in it would disappear from view. I think there may have been three or four that would be visible at the same time, and they would disappear into the end of the oblong lite and come back.  Maybe the same ones; maybe not. We continued to watch it, and made a turn back into Cambridge,  To be honest I don&#39;t know when we lost view.  I was surprised that no one else said anything about it, as there was a lot of traffic on the highway that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to drive back into Cambridge hoping to keep the objects in sight.  Upon entering  the city saw to the left of us a large blimp like object, black or dark gray, which seemed rather close to the ground, seemingly not far above tree level. Didn&#39;t look like it was moving.  On the side was a red, white and blue insignia.  Keep thinking it looked like an American flag, but can&#39;t remember for sure. It seemed such an unusual object to see at that time, and I wondered for what reason was it there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There had been a couple of incidents, but no other witnesses, so I don&#39;t know if you would be interested in them or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

My youngest sister (age 11 in 1966) and brother (age 8), and a boy friend (age 9?), were alone at our farm house 9 miles from Coyanosa, Texas (near Pecos).  They were looking south and saw one saucer flying close to the house and close to the ground.  It flew from west to east and landed 1/4 mile from the house in the Coyanosa Draw (a dry creek).  It then took off and flew away.  Myself (age 17 in 1966) and my brother (age 15) arrived at home at suppertime and were told about the UFO.  We believed what the kids said.  We went to the creek bed to see the landing site.  I walked directly to the site. My brother rode his horse but the horse would not approach the site...he had to also walk to the site.  The weeds/brush were flattened in a circular shape as if something about 30-40 feet in diameter had crushed them.  There was no evidence of fire or heat, and no major indentations other than the crushed weeds/brush.  I walked back to the house and called the Midland/Odessa airport control tower (about 120 miles away) to ask about radar observations or unusual aircraft and they reported that they saw nothing out of the ordinary.  We occasionally discuss this UFO at family gatherings.  To this day the three (now adults) who actually saw the UFO swear that this event happened, and my brother and I did see the spot where the UFO landed and took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Clear, cloudless sky. I was installing a television antenna on a rooftop in Odessa, Texas. While looking upward to align the antenna, I saw a motionless silvery-metallic, football shaped object in the sky, straight above. It was smooth and shiny without any surface features that I could see. However, the metallic nature of the surface was very apparent against the blue sky with sunlight reflecting off of it.. As I watched, it began to turn slowly end-over-end, accelerated vertically at a great speed, and then disappeared. The entire duration of the event was approximately 10 seconds. It was not possible to guage the size or the altitude of the object, since I had nothing to reference it to. My subjective impression is that it was about the size of an automobile, a couple thousand feet up. From the time I first noticed it, the object stayed motionless for about 5 seconds. It then rotated in a &#34;wobbly&#34; end-over-end manner  3 or 4 times and began to accelerate upward very fast. The total time from when it began to accelerate until was out of sight was less than a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There were between 3 to 5 kids all about 11 years of age. The year was approximately, 1966. We heard what we thought was the wind blowing through a stack of irrigation pipes. It was very loud and strange. We noticed that there was no wind blowing across the pond and the hillsides were only about 20&#39; higher than the water level. We ran to the top of the hill where the sound came from and there wasn&#39;t any irrigation pipe to create the sound. The wind was blowing straight down on us, moving the pasture grass as if by a leaf blower and the sound seemed to be coming from above us. We looked up and did not see anything even though the sky was clear. As we stood there the wind and the sound moved off to the east at an increasing rate of speed. We talked about this for awhile with the reasoning of an 11 year old and went back to fishing never bringing this event up again. I never forgot what happened that day and while talking one day about 3 years ago to one of the other persons that was there I brought it up. I said &#34;You know, we&#39;ve been friends for over 40 years and there is one thing we have never talked about, you know what that is?&#34; and he just looked straight ahead and said &#34; You mean the day we went fishing?&#34;. He just kept looking straight ahead and said he didn&#39;t want to talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Are there any similar reports?

We thought it was somthing fun looking so ran towards it and it shot up in a zig zag fashion then disappeared. Later my mother found a circle of coffee can sized holes in the field. A family outside of town had a strange craft hover over their house near the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cosin and I were both 7. We were playing in a small field behind our Great grand mother&#39;s ,on the north edge of town. I don&#39;t remember exactly when but we both became aware of a silver metal object in the field. I remember thinking it was a metal pig hut because my older brother showed me one in the woods and told me that the pigs had gone feral and they would kill me if I went in the woods. I guess that was his attempt to protect me! Anyway, the object seemed to shimmer with heat waves and at some point we saw that it was a disc about twice as tall as a car and 3 times as long. I seem to remember that I could see under it like it was hovering close to the ground. We were not afraid at that time and decided to run up to it. we were about 50 feet away when it shot up on an angle to the right and appeared to be the size of a nickle , barely paused then shot up again on an angle to the left till at appeaed the size of a small pea then shot up to the right and disappeared. I !don&#39;t remember leaving the field but I remember running into my gramma&#39;s house and being very excited. My cousin moved to Washington state in the 70&#39;s. In 1983 he came to our grampa&#39;s funeral and I asked if he remembered it. He did. My mother did not believe us until we went on about it for several days. When she finally looked there was a series of coffee can sized holes near where the object was. A woman who lived 2 miles north of town told that at about that same time she and her kids (around my age) were watching TV at night when they heard sound like roof shingles slapping and the kids ran and looked out the windows. The kids claimed there was something hovering over the house with colored lights but the mother wouldn&#39;t look because she was afraid. I as female and my cousin is male. As far as I can nail it down, this was about 1966.<n>

These are the events that I remember, as time may have clouded|4/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96815.html|72|ndxe196606| What I’m describing took place in the mid 1960’s or a little after that.  These are the events that I remember, as time may have clouded out other information, this is what happened to my cousins, friends and myself all in the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania as I can remember.  I use lived in the town were the movie Ground Hog day was filmed.  In fact, as a kid, I use to play in the same park where they filmed the movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As kids aged 8-14, growing up in that time frame and area, we spent a lot of time out doors.  In fact, we were outdoors crazy.  Hiking, camping, hunting, and playing were our normal activities.  We were very much in tune with our surroundings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day, while out hiking in our little group, we were returning from a long hike and about a mile from home. We noticed in the sky 3 black, dark looking clouds.  These clouds did not look normal to us and in fact, bothered us.  The sky was clear, except for these three black clouds about a quarter of a mile away, or at least they looked like clouds from our vantage point.  They moved in a very odd way, not really floating it seemed, like they were looking for something in unison, sort of back and forth. In only a few moments after observing them, we ‘felt’ like we were being watched.  It bothered everyone in the group to the point that we got scared and ran into an old concrete, abandoned building nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never left that place for a long ! time, fearing something was out there observing us. We ran home sometime later.  Those clouds were very strange, in that it was very windy out and they just did not move like normal clouds would, but stayed in a certain area in the sky.  The only thing around there was a gravel pit, old coke mining ovens and a nearby military school/base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of us lived near this military base/school.  Soldiers marched around and sometimes they held live Howitzer cannon firing exercises.  There were, it seemed like UFO reports in the news daily back then. One night, I was sitting outside on a very hot night. It was clear out with stars visible.  I sat for some time and started getting that feeling I was being watched, again.  This time I looked up and saw three lights rotating in unison and in different colors, red, blue, and white directly above me. About as half the height that airplanes traveled, but these lights, never moved, just rotated around.  I became nervous and went inside and hid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On another night, one of my cousin’s and I decided to camp out in the field behind his house. Again, later that night, we felt we were being watched and became very nervous and decided to go to the porch and try to sleep.  Within a few minutes after settling down on the porch a very bright light was noticed at the edge of the roof over the po! rch.  We ran into the house. The dog was barking like crazy, his sister wanted to know where the bright light was coming from as it penetrated everywhere it seemed.  We heard a scraping sound outside, like something had scratched the side of the house.  After that we don’t remember much of what happened.  The next day, we remembered only the noise against the house and there was a huge, long scratch along the side of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On another occasion, my cousin was playing baseball in that same field behind his house. He said a saucer type craft came over the hill behind his house and toward the field that he and some other kids were playing in. It did not stay long though.  Over the years, I have had very strange things happen to me with things like ESP events, involving my father’s passing away, another was a car crash I was involved with and more, much more.  Also, there was a feeling of being observed or followed for years thereafter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also know many people who have seen or know people who have encountered crafts and beings.  It was like it was meant to be that I meet these people for some reason.  It was very odd how all of it came about.  There is more to all of this than can be wrote here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The sky was clear that day....I saw a disk &amp; oval shaped spacecraft, the length of an airplane. It was in the late morning or early afternoon. I was looking outside my bedroom window and noticed an object coming across the sky horizontally, I looked and thought it could be an airplane but it wasn&#39;t, then I thought it could be a blimp, but it wasn&#39;t. As it came closer I knew it was something I never seen before, it hovered directly across from me, in the sky. It stood there for at least 5 minutes. I called out to my family to come and see....my two brothers stood there and watched it with me. Then the spacecraft started to move in a straight forward motion...and on an angle, straight up into the sky and it disappeared. There were no lights on this spacecraft. It was dark silver in color and I heard no noise at all from it. I will never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had been out for probably 30 minutes when I had a sudden feeling that I should look up.  I will never forget what I saw.  It was a single disk shaped craft, directly overhead.  It flew at an altitude that could only be described as miles high.  I would guess 25 or 30 thousand feet minimum.  It was very large.  Approximately the size of a dime held at arm’s length.  It was traveling from south to north appearing to have just flown over Carson City NV when first seen.  It traveled from directly overhead to out of sight on the horizon in the direction of Reno NV in about 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the off chance that this could be confirmed in any way, I could lead anyone to within a couple of hundred feet of where the encounter took place and demonstrate the movement of the craft.

I have hesitated to write about it until now.  No one would have (nor did) take me seriously in 1966.  Perhaps there were other sightings by people who did not think that such things happened in the 1960&#39;s.  I was 13 years old.  I had been sleeping soundly in my bed when I awoke for some reason.  My bed was just below the window in my bedroom.  For some reason, I got on my knees and stared out the window.  At the end of the cul-de-sac, directly in front on my window, there was a UFO hovering above the ground.  It was very large, circular in shape, but with many layers to it.  Nothing that looked like the shape of an eye. Many straight edges, and lots of colored lights.  I was on my knees staring at it for the longest time.  I didn&#39;t doubt that I was awake as I pinched myself numerous times and in the morning I noticed the welts I myself had inflicted.  My sister was in the room with me but she was sound asleep.  My parents in the next room but I knew I would catch &#34;heck&#34; if I awakened them..  It was a working day the next day for the both of them.  I also KNEW that if I uttered a single sound, whoever was in the UFO would hear, and leave.  And I didn&#39;t want that just yet.  I watched the object to see if anything was going in or out or if there was any movement at all.  There wasn&#39;t.  I was able to see it quite clearly as at the end of the cul-de-sac there was a street lamp.  It gave a little illumination, but the colored lights themselves provided quite a bit.  I was in awe of this object.  It hovered precisely between two houses, on an empty lot that had yet to be developed.  I summoned up enough courage to open the window.  I hung my head out, listening.  Not a single sound.  I mean, not a SINGLE sound.  I pulled my head back in and latched the window.  I continued to watch.  After about 10 minutes, the lights started flickering, and something underneath began to rotate.  The UFO rose very slowly up into the air.  And hovered again.  It then started to move, across the tops of trees, he! ading in a westerly direction.  It moved with the speed of a helicopter, over the tops of many trees, until just as I thought it would move completely out of sight, it took off on a steep angle and climbed to the stars.  There had been no sound at all the entire time.  I marvelled at what I had seen and went back to bed.  The next day I told my story to anyone who would listen and was met with complete skepticism.  I don&#39;t tell the tale unless the subject comes up.<n>

6/1/66|International Falls|MN|Disk|20 min.|2-UFO's wake three/eight yr. old children at different addresses and took control of our minds, emotions, heart and soul!|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78739.html|79|ndxe196606| 2-UFO&#39;s wake three/eight yr. old children at different addresses and took control of our minds, emotions, heart and soul!<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was eight and terrified of the dark, I was awakened on night by a power that led me out of bed and walked me to the window.  I opened the curtain and looked out at the end of our race-track backyard and there was a small disc UFO slowly going up inside of what I quessed was the mothership.  All I thougth was to wake up my twin sister.  She came and looked out the window with me and in only a minute, it again controlled us to walk to our beds and immediately fall asleep.  No fear, no panic, dought or apprehension.  Our actions were involuntary, as was our emotions, judgement and bodies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I just llooked at eachother that morning and were not supposed to tell our parents.  My sister went to call her best friend Kathy who lived across the street.  When my sister reached to get the phone to call, IT RANG, I watched her hand get an inch away from it and it wrang.  She answered it and it was Kathy, she was calling to reveal the identical experience.  Her upstairs bedroom window was alignined on a parralell w/our house and the UFO&#39;S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We spoke of it at our 20 year class reunion, having not seen each other since 1972!  We graduated in 1977.  Figure it out.  We descibed everything in detail with each other and drew the same pictures.<n>
