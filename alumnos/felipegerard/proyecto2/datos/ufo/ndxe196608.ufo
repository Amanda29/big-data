While I was looking upwards at her, something caught my eye to the right but somewhat almost overhead in the clouds, and I looked over and saw a dark gray disk come straight down from the clouds and hover underneath the clouds, in total silence, hovering with just the slightest of movement (there was a bulbous shape in the center of the disc of the UFO) and as I stared at it in shock for 15 seconds or so, it slowly lifted up and back into the clouds again, where nobody could see it. I was in shock and it felt surreal. I am 49 years old now and have looked for one over since because I KNOW they exist. I hope to see another sighting in my lifetime! I was not afraid at all -- it just seemed like they were looking at us, and then they went on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for this website.

It wasnt until 25 year later that i was thinking about that day and realized that rocketa dont just fly over north central Indiana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> my first thought was that it didnt happen maybe it was one of those memorys of a dream that children confuse with actual experience. I called my brother up and asked him if he rememberd it and he did. the only diference we had was the direction they were traveling. although we both remember them on a sw to ne angle across the sky. i dont know what we saw that day but Ive never found any posibilty that woulndt be pretty strange. ps our father was a pilot. so we would have known if it was a couple of jets in bank making there wings unpreceptable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Me, my younger sister and Mother and Father had gotten up early on this August day (1:00 am) to pack up our car to start a week&#39;s long vacation trip out West through seven states.  As we were packing up the trunk of our 1963 Chevy something caught my eye in the yard next to ours.   Back then the yard to the left of our house had a large apple tree growing in it.  Now I never would have even glanced at the blackened yard or tree.  But what caught my attention immediately was a small red orb just sitting there half way up in the tree facing our driveway.  The red light did not reflect on the leaves.  It was a dull red color.  Well, when I saw that light the hairs went up on the back of neck and I was immediately spooked.  And I think everyone knows when they are seeing something that is unnatural and shouldn&#39;t be there.  And because I was a kid and my father was packing up the car with military precision I didn&#39;t say anything about it while we were finishing up loading  the car.  As we were backing up the darkened driveway I was so frightened I didn&#39;t look at the light but I knew it was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 minutes of driving we got out on the highway and I said to my Mom, &#34;did you see that light in the tree&#39;?   She said, yeah I saw that what was it?? She added that maybe it was the light up on top of the telephone pole.  Back then the poles had glass transformers on top and when they had an overload they would turn red.  Well I thought maybe that was it and forgot about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we returned from our trip a week later I looked at the tree and the spot where the light had been was just about 5 feet above my head.  The transformer is about 20 feet away from the tree and 25 feet above it.  So that could not have been the explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this happened I have read that sometimes UFO&#39;s send down small red balls or orbs and maybe they are observation things.  It sure did look like it was watching us and we interrupted whatever it was up to.  And I know this light did not belong in that tree.  I never saw anthing like that ever again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked up at the sky and thought I was seeing a falling star; I pointed it out to my friend, as we were watching it, it stopped and made a sharp turn, like a sharp left turn.  We were both stunned and I asked whether she saw what I saw and she confirmed that she saw the same thing. It was very high in the sky and looked like a star.  We both agreed that it could not be a plane,a jet, a satellite, or anything we could recognize, and it certainly was not a shooting star.  It was moving very fast.  This was the second sighting I have had in my life thus far.  Once, when I was very young and then, this sighting, as a young adult.  How can mankind be so vain to think we are the only forms of intelligence in the entire universe.  It was amazing . . . a bright star (it was bright) looking object, coming down like a shooting star and pausing and then making a sharp turn.  I really don&#39;t believe we had, nor have, anything that can move like that moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

One late afternoon we were out and decided to drive by his Mother&#39;s house.  When we arrived, we spotted a telescope on her front porch aimed toward the sky.  Since she was a bit off the wall, my husband said, &#34;I don&#39;t even want to know what that&#39;s about&#34; and kept on driving.  A couple of days later his mother and sister who lived with the Mother came by for a visit. During the conversation they mentioned that they had been watching flying saucers and one was above our house.  They lived further up from us on Sunset Hill about a mile.  I told them that if they ever see these flying saucers again to please let us know because we want to see them also.  A couple of nights later at about 10:30 pm there was a terrible banging on our back door.  It was the Mother and sister saying that the flying saucer was out in front of our house.  So we all four ran out to see and sure enough, off toward the Magnolia neighborhood we could see something in the sky and it was coming our way.  It was round with a dome on top and had two or three different colored lights around the area where the dome met the saucer - it is hard after all this time to recall the color of the lights but to guess I&#39;d say they were red, green and white.  When it got closer and we could see the bottom the lights were all one color and maybe whitish or off white color.  This thing came over by us and hovered above us about 200&#39; or 250&#39; and possibly less.  It just stayed in that spot and did not move for a long time -- maybe 10 or 15 minutes.  In that circumstance, one does not think about time.   Eventually, the saucer/dome moved toward the locks and out toward Shilshole Bay and out of our sight.  I don&#39;t remember hearing any type of engine or other noise.  My husband and I only say this the one time but my Mother-in-law and her daughter saw it many times durin! g that Summer.  There was never anything in the papers or news about anyone else seeing this thing.  I was careful who I told this story to but it did get out a little and a few other people came up to me at work and said they too had seen such things but none were in the Seattle area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was returning from the county fair with my mother, aunt, and younger brother. As we pulled in to the driveway of my home, the headlights of our car were shining on a huge disk that was hovering above the next door neighbor&#39;s home. It had several different colored  lights on it and was absolutely silent. I can still remember the awe I felt. This thing was as big, if not bigger, then the house and so silent! As the car lights hit it, it began to slowly rise, straight in to the air, still making no discernable noise. We backed out of the drive and followed the object all over the SE part of town. It moved slowly and made random turns, flying very low the entire time. It then suddenly starting moving away at an incredibly rapid pace and disappeared before our eyes. It made a believer out of me!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness describes self as a successful business woman, and apparently works in an academic capacity.  PD))<n>

It was saucer shape, the same angles on the top 1/3 as the bottom 1/3 with the window section also about 1/3 high and straight vertical. It appeared flat on top and bottom. I saw a ring on the bottom which rotated a little. It was about 20 feet above our single story house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I went back inside the house after what seemed a few minutes I did not see my brother or parents I felt alone in the house.

It trailed and then circled it, forward of the tail section twice then went at high speed to the west and disappeared.  The plane took no evasive action.  The next day when I went to my job at Boeing(designer/drafter)  I promptly asked one of the engineers what the funny new aircraft was that Boeing was testing, and told what I had seen.  The persons I talked to quickly told me to hush up, and not say a word to anyone else about it; that Boeing did NOT LIKE for their people to see such things and I could be fired.  Interesting.

8/10/66 03:30|Ovando|MT|Oval|20 minutes|UFO Sighting in 1966 – Blackfoot Valley, Ovando, Montana|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97259.html|14|ndxe196608| UFO Sighting in 1966 – Blackfoot Valley, Ovando, Montana   I worked on a fire lookout tower in Western Montana during the summer of 1966.  The lookout was on Monture Hill, west of Ovando, Montana.  Ovando is located in the Blackfoot Valley, about 45 miles NE of Missoula, Montana.  I was nineteen years old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During that summer there were several reports of UFO sighting in the Blackfoot Valley; I was skeptical of those reports.  However, in the very early morning of the first or second week of August I changed my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been trained to look for fires during my duty as a fire lookout, and thus was very sensitive to any new light that might have shone through the lookout’s glass window “walls” (the lookout building was about fifty feet above the ground, mounted on poles).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 3:30 am, I awoke to a bright light shining through the windows.  Being a light sleeper, and having been trained to look for fires, I had no problem getting up to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright light was actually two brightly lit objects, both hovering over the top of Ovando Mountain.  Ovando Mountain is in direct line-of-sight from Monture Hill.  Its summit is approximately seven to eight miles away (north east) from Monture Hill, and is one of the more prominent mountains on the other side of the Blackfoot Valley from Monture Hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects were yellow-orange in color.  Both had a similar oval shape (side view).  I estimate the larger object to be between 75 – 125 feet wide (this is only a guess).  One was significantly larger than the other.  The larger object hovered an estimated 30 to 40 feet above the top of Ovando Mountain; the smaller object hovered above the larger object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the objects I observed them to hover over Ovando Mountain in what seemed to be perfect formation.  I watched the objects for at least twenty minutes as they slowly hovered up, down and around the summit of Ovando Mountain.  They then made a swift ascent and disappeared in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what the objects were, but to my death, I’ll always believe they were something I’ve never seen before or after.  The U.S. was becoming heavily involved in the Vietnam War in 1966 and there were armed forces training exercises in Western Montana that summer.  These objects could have been part of a training exercise, a secret military weapon or something else.  But I definitely saw something.  That’s reason why these sighting are correctly called “Unidentified Flying Objects”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were playing baseball in the baseball field behind our grade school.  There were about 8 of us.  There is woodland beyond the school ground for many miles.  We saw a very bright orange spherical object, over 1/2 the size of the moon at about 40 degrees above.  We stopped playing baseball, stood and stared as it was so strange.  Nothing anyone would normally see.  Five of the kids ran home in fright as all of us and they thought it was a UFO. It was hovering above the trees in the horizon, looking south.  Three of us, the eldest of the 8 kids there and best friends remained and stared at the object for about 15 minutes.  We were only 13-15 years of age then.  It appeared to be about 2 miles away.  The object moved very erratically, hovering and then moving at an incredible speed away from us then back towards us then to the left, right, up, down and at different angles. This was no weather balloon or man made object.  It glowed orange.  After about 14 minutes of this since we first spotted it, it started to dart away extremely fast as it got so small in a 45 degree angle, then shift back and forth, zig-zagging its way to the point that we could not see it any more.  A few years ago I met my friend who saw this, he said to his wife, &#34;See, I told you so, that I saw UFO and that I was there too.&#34;  No one ever believed him and I try not saying anything to anyone as I feel that anyone would think I am &#39;not all there&#39;.  I am a very rational, intelligent person and somewhat skeptical of these matters, difficult to convince, yet I have seen it and am now left still perplexed, bewildered and confused about it all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

(My parents had some Canadian relatives over and they were playing cards inside at our kitchen table.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon getting out the front door I noticed four neighbors out on their front lawn two house north of mine.  They were talking about something and had a telescope outside with them on a tripod.  I remember thinking that that was pretty cool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at them and then looked in the direction that their telescope was pointed just in time to see a glowing, bright powder blue football shaped object come towards us.  It traveled in a straight line trajectory very low (maybe a few hundred feet up) and passed right over us without a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear cloudness summer night and this was no searchlight beam or airplane.  I had never seen anything like then or since!  I immediately ran inside to get my parents but it never returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know why the people two houses down had a telescpoe out but ! suspected that it may have been around before I saw it.

8/1/66 20:00|Moshi (Tanzania)||Other|10-15 mins|We still do not have the technology to acieve what these objects did judging from the capabilities of our current space and aircraft|6/12/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23133.html|19|ndxe196608| We still do not have the technology to acieve what these objects did judging from the capabilities of our current space and aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not bothered about reporting this officially to anyone , but the event was witnesed in 1966 from the roof top terrace of our house in Moshi, Tanzania, at the foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro. The area is often cloudless giving a very clear sky My parents were on the terrace, and called me to see something strange. By the time I got to see the group of three star like objects( three lights) moving North very slowly, my parents had been watching the objects for about 10 mins, moving slowly and then stopping. When I saw the object(s), it stopped and remained that way for approximately 10 mins or so. In those days there were no aircraft in those parts, and the only things we were used to seeing were shooting stars or the Gemini or Russian spacecraft occasionally orbiting the earth at a pedesrian pace One of the lights then detached itself from the group, seemed to hover for a few seconds and then accelerated upwards at a phenominal rate. After a few minutes, a second light detached itself and shot upwards in a different direction at a phenominal rate. Finally the third remaining light did the same after a few minutes. They all disappeared, and were not seen again. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We agree with the witness that if the objects were, in fact, observed for 10 minutes, or longer, they could not have been man-made, artificial satellites.  PD))<n>
8/1/66 05:30|Columbus|OH|Circle|Seconds|Glowing orange sphere, stationary and silent|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49573.html|20|ndxe196608| Glowing orange sphere, stationary and silent<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I both had paper routes and had just left our apartment building to go pick up our papers. This was several years ago (1966) in the early morning hours. This object was circular and was orange in color. It was about the size of the moon when the moon is overhead. &#39;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my twelve-year-old brother to look and he looked up and said that it was probably the moon. It wasn&#39;t the moon because the moon was elsewhere in the sky, low but not on the horizon. I didn’t know what to make of it as it was stationary and glowing orange from dim to bright. The intensity of the light was not extremely bright closer to dim but clear. It only appeared for a short time probably 30 to 45 seconds and the disappeared. There was no sound associated with it. I have thought of this from time to time over the years and have tried to think of what it could have been. The only thing I could ever come up with was a UFO. This all took place in Columbus, Ohio on the west side of what was then called Westgate Manor We lived at ((deleted)) Briggs Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
