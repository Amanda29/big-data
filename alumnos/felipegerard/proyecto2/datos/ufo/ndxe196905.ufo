I hesitated at first and wanted to say something, but nobody would beleive me, so I watched it myself as it would ever so slightly move the same direction as the car and suddenly stop. It just dissapeared after one blink.<n>

No noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was a single white light that came slowly toward us about 200 yards above our heads and stopped. It was a circular shape and made no noise at all.  After a couple seconds it shot off.  We had been sitting outside the old radio station at Buckner Childrens Home sneaking a cigarette.  We then ran back to our dorm and after asking each other what we thought we saw, we never talked about it again.<n>

We where in the midle of the desert returning from Tacna the border of Peru to Arica the city we use to live. the most amazing thing was that the sphere was changing colors from blue to green,to red yellow and the colors where moving on the sphere like floating on its surface and giving a look of a gaseoous and solid object at the same time.Look like liquid metal. We saw it disapear slowly to the east and after that we start the car without saying word at least for 15 minutes after the observation,there wasn&#39;t anything to say it was an extreme shocking experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Individual who submitted this report holds a very responsible position in the fishing industry.

5/1/69 22:00|Estill|SC|Cigar|45 minutes|shining object frightens SC family|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49098.html|5|ndxe196905| shining object frightens SC family<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was born and raised on a small family farm in the lower part of South Carolina.  Our farm is located in Hampton County, near a small town called Furman, about 40 miles north of Savannah, Georgia, and 90 miles west of Charleston, SC.  This event took place in May of 1969 on a Thursday night, beginning around 9:00 PM (I remmber the day because we had a service every Thursday night called Training Union; it was a Southern Baptist church).  My entire family witnessed the event, including my father, born 1924, and a veteran of 31 combat missions in WWII as a tail gunner on a B-24 Liberator bomber, my mother (a nurse), myself, born in 1969, and my two older sisters born 1960 and 1962.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were planting crops (I think either soybeans or corn) in a 25 acres field that was maybe 600 yards from our main house, seperated by a strip of woods.  My father was on the tractor (an old Farmall), and my mother and the rest of us kept the tractor filled with seed for the planting process.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed a very bright star which, because the area is so rural, and the fact that we often worked at night, we were familiar with the night sky.  I brought this observation to my mothers attention who paid me little attention.  As the light approaced (across the highway over the woods in a westerly direction) my mother finally looked up to see what I was talking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked now to have approached closer, just above the woods.  My mom ordered us kids into the truck (a white 1963 international).  My dad, we later learned from him, had stopped the tractor at the opposite end of the field, and by his own admission was afraid to come back toward us.  He was, i&#39;s estimate 400 or 500 yards distant at that point.  I remember that my mother started crying and the rest of us did also when the truck wouldn&#39;t start.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course, when your six years old and you see your mon panic, you panic.  I do not remember viewing the object after getting in the pickup truck.  But I remember daddy returning on the tractor, saying he didn&#39;t know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the characteristics of the object:  oblong in shape, somewhat luminous, made absolutely no soound; appeared as a small star that got larger.  Do not remember a  color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THis incident was often discussed in our family, and a few years before my fathers death, three of the five witnesses drew independent sketches of what we could remember.  The oblong shape matched, although we were in disagreement about a protrusion on top or the bottom of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident has never been reported to any offical agency until the writing of this letter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with the witness, and he will attempt to have his older sister submit a report, as well.  He sounds like a very responsible witness to us, and we suspect that he is quite credible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness indicates that the event occurred in May 1969, but he is not certain of the day of that month.  However, he remembers that it occurred on a Thursday night.  PD))<n>
5/1/69 20:00|Wheaton|MD|Disk|30 seconds|large saucer-shaped  object sighted in Wheaton, MD in late 1960's|1/29/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21521.html|6|ndxe196905| large saucer-shaped  object sighted in Wheaton, MD in late 1960&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m going by memory, so the date of 5/69 is a wild guess (though it was a warm evening so it was either spring or fall).  I was 8 or 9 years old growing up in Wheaton, MD.  I was visiting a friends house, and for some reason stepped onto his front porch, and overhead was a very large saucer-shaped craft flying silently in a direct line overhead.  I remember bright colored lights rotating around the perimeter of the craft.  I watched in awe as the object just moved silently through the sky no more than 1-2000 feet overhead.  Interestingly, I did not feel compelled to tell anyone about this event.  I don&#39;t think I mentioned it to anyone until I was in my 20&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

5/1/69 06:00|Ridgefield|CT|Unknown|unknown|Translocation and "knowing" I could fly onto elevated deck.|11/8/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32797.html|8|ndxe196905| Translocation and &#34;knowing&#34; I could fly onto elevated deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One early morning in either 1968 or 1969, when I was about seven years old, I woke up at about 6 o&#39;clock in a different location.  I was on the couch downstairs in the living room, covered up with a blanket that my mother always kept there.  Thinking my parents had decided to paint our bedroom, and had therefore moved me and my brother in our sleep, I curiously went back upstairs, and found my brother sleeping away in his own bed.  My bed had obviously been slept in part of the night, and the room was unpainted.  I had never sleep-walked before then, nor have I ever done so since then.  I determined to get to the bottom of this mystery, so I made a point to &#34;interview&#34; each of my four older sisters, to see which one of them had played this trick on me.  None ever admitted to such a prank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about the same time, I have another memory which in retrospect may be related to the couch incident.  I remember being outside in the backyard, looking up at our deck, which was built directly off the living room, and &#34;knowing&#34; that I could fly onto and off of, that deck.  It was more than a simple wish -- it was a conviction.  The deck was some seven or eight feet off the ground, which sloped away from the back of the house.  So adamant was I of my conviction, that I got a piece of rope (old clothesline, I think), tied it onto a kitchen chair, and wedged that chair into one corner of the deck.  Don&#39;t ask me why I did it this way, but that&#39;s the way I did it.  Once this was done, I slid down the rope to the ground, burning my hands in the process.  I had never heard of a flying saucer or UFO at this time, much less the apparent abduction phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
