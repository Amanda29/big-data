WE NOTICED MY SKIN WAS GLOWING TOO. MY CAR WAS BLACK INSIDE. NOTHING HAD THIS GLOW BUT OUR SKIN. WE NOTICE WHAT LOOKED LIKE A PLANE. IT HAD MULTICOLORED LIGHTS BLINKING ON IT. THE PLANE LOOKED NORMAL AND VERY FAR AWAY. THEN OUR SKIN STATED FLASHING BLUE. THIS TIME I JUST KNEW I POLICE. STILL THERE WAS NOTHING JUST THIS FAR AWAY PLANE. I TOLD HER I THOUGHT IT WAS A UFO. SHE SAID LET&#39;S GO. I REALY JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A PLANE AT THAT TIME. MY CAR WOULDN&#39;T DO ANYTHING. THEN WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A PLANE WAS ABOUT 10 FEET ABOVE MY CAR. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO TAKE US AND THE CAR. IT JUST SIT THERE. LIGHTS WERE FLASHING BRIGHT FROM ALL AROUND IT. IT COULD HAVE BEEN DISK SHAPED. IF YOU SAW THIS THING IN THE NIGHT SKY. IT WOULD LOOK JUST LIKE A PLANE. BEFORE THAT DAY. I THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A UFO. I HAVE NEVER  BEEN THAT AFRAID IN MY LIFE. THEY COULD DO ANYTHING TO YOU.  WHEN IT LEFT. I WAS ABOUT AN HOUR LATE GETTING HER HOME. WHERE DID THE TIME GO? IT WAS NEWYEARS. WE DIDN&#39;T DRINK OR DO DRUGS.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/31/79 22:35|Kansas City|MO|Circle|2 MINUTES|Large light blue sphere, made no sound, and no light reflected off of it.|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17110.html|2|ndxe197912| Large light blue sphere, made no sound, and no light reflected off of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just picked my mom up from work we were driving down our own street, and all at the same time we noticed a very large circular ball it was light blue in color, and was hovering over a local park (Loose Park), there was total snow covered ground, what I notice was there was no light reflecting off the snow, I could not belive this. I never believed in ufo&#39;s befor this night.  as we drove near the object it raised up and started moving away from us then it just shrinked up to a small dot and zoom away very fast it left a white streek in the sky,  My mom kept saying we need to call somebody about this, I reminded here that it was new years eve and that no one would belive it.  None of us where drinking at or befor that time. The following Monday I asked my astromer proffessor at U.M.K.C. If he believed in UFO&#39;s or alien life outside of our solor system, He responded that you would have to be extremly arrogent not too. I believe now.<n>

The lights were really dim, just barely a dull glow. The object was about 1000 feet high and never gave off any sound what so ever.I just slowly went overhead traveling directly north. There was snow on the ground and it was cloudy, so the lights from the town reflected off the snow and lit up the bottoms of the clouds so I could see the craft very well.<n>
12/15/79 19:00|Morris|IL|Light|5 min|strange light from sky came down in field then back up again.|2/22/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42054.html|5|ndxe197912| strange light from sky came down in field then back up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> my father and i was hunting with his dog in a corn feild on the edge of a timber line. i was watching a light in the sky, it was a different color whit and brighter than the other stars. as we was walking it made a move in a cork screw motion down toward the ground. i thought it was a air plane,then it stoped just of the ground with no noise of any kind. it was the size of a house and about 200 ft. from where we where standing. i still was waiting to hear a engine noise from a helocopter because it just stoped with out touching the ground. it stayed what seemed like 3 or 4 min. then went back up as fast as it came down . with the same cork screw motion and back to the same highth in the sky.it looked like any other star but the light was not the same. the light was so brite that it was brighter than the day lite and you could not make out any shape. till this day i still watch the night ski and can pick it out, it is best in the winter months. i have shown this to other people and they can belive what they see. if you steady your self aganist some thing you can see that it moves around in a small area with a bounce motion and from side to side. it has been a problem i wish i had an answer to, may be i could sleep better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

12/8/79 20:30|Albuquerque|NM|Circle|10-minutes|The night when I saw the disk UFO!|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54413.html|6|ndxe197912| The night when I saw the disk UFO!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were leaving Albuquerque, New Mexico going up the highway at night, and as we were going I looked down to the city below and in the darkness there were some blinking lights between the city below and highway that we were on, and then we were going to stop for some coffee so we pulled off the highway we had to go under the freeway overpass to get to the other side where the coffee shop was ,and when we were coming out from underneath the freeway there it was drifting along that frontage road where the coffee shop was ,it had blinking lights going when we came out from underneath the overpass when it knew we was there the lights stop blinking and its stop drifting along, it stood still it just sat there no noise not even a window or anything for lights it was close enough to the streetlights that the lights reflected off of it! it looked like stainless steel!!  It was a stainless steel disk and I really thought it was going to zap us before we got out of there but it didn&#39;t, any other blinking lights that I saw in the darkness that&#39;s why I think there was two of them, about the size of a good-sized living room, since there was two of them they look like smaller ships from the mothership , and I knew our technology hadn&#39;t advance to that point, to stop in midair no no waste we just don&#39;t have anything like that and I&#39;m sure I should have reported this a long time ago, but I just saw this report on TV talking about the UFO and I got a name so here I am telling my story, when you see something like that it&#39;s really hard for you to believe what you have just witnessed!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s what I saw!!  And that&#39;s my story !!<n>
12/5/79 22:00|Arkansas (rural)|AR|Fireball|20:00 minutes|A friend and i were driving on a country road when we saw something very strange.|2/24/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04119.html|7|ndxe197912| A friend and i were driving on a country road when we saw something very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and i were driving down a country road and he saw a very large ball in the sky. He made a remark that the moon sure does look strange. I then looked up and said the moon is over to the left. I don&#39;t know what we were looking at but it was the same size as the moon. It had a yellow red color. I&#39;ve always wondered what the heck that was we were looking at that night. Some people say it was northern lights but i&#39;m almost sure it wasn&#39;t. It was huge and round and looked alot like the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  The &#34;northern lights&#34; only extremely rarely are visible as far south as Arkansas, and they generally appear as &#34;sheets&#34; of light, not as an individual clump.  PD))<n>

12/1/79 01:00|Water Valley|MS|Cigar|20 seconds|the strange object  in the sky that I do not talk about but will always remember|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43207.html|9|ndxe197912| the strange object  in the sky that I do not talk about but will always remember<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I came home late from a party one night. As we were walking into the house a strange craft appeared from nowhere. It made no sound and stopped just above us. I remember seeing very bright lights and a shape of something looking at me from the object. I do not remember anything after that until I woke up the next morning in bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date may be off as much as 3 years it was a long time ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To tell the truth my friend and I never spoke of this event until some twenty years later. After my friend brought it up we were surprised to find out that we had both seen the object and remembered nothing after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why did we not talk about it for twenty years?  We decided that it was because we thought no one would believe us and we wasn&#39;t sure the other had seen it.  STRANGE!!!!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>
