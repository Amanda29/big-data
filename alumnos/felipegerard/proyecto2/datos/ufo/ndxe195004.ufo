He has regretted not having reported the sighting previously and I wanted to make sure that the event was recorded on his behalf.  He says that his biggest regret to this day is that he wishes that he had yelled out so that all of the teachers and kids on the field could have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, he was afraid that he would have gotten in trouble for calling out at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fishburne Military School is located in the Shenandoah valley of Virginia, within the city limits of Waynesborough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Text of Report:<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;While on the drill field during my junior year, I noticed a silver (metallic) saucer-shaped craft flying from just outside the city limits to DuPont which it circled at least two times at a very slow rate of speed (about the speed of a Piper Cub - which is what I thought it was at first).  It was at low altitude (about half the elevation of the mountains that surround town) which I would estimate to be 2000 feet or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were approximately 1/2 mile from the object at the closest point and we heard no sound from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After circling DuPont twice the saucer turned on it side at a 90 degree angle and shot over the mountain at a tremendous speed.  It left so quickly that all we saw was a flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had whispered to the other members of my squad which contained 9 members, and I believe most, if not all of them witnessed the ufo.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the gentleman who witnessed the object, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent and sincere in his description of the event.  His recollection of the circumstances of the sighting seemed to us to be crystal clear.  We believe that the witness is an exceptionally qualified observer.  PD))<n>

We watched the object remain motionless over the highway then go off away from us instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not know the names or homes of the other two witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to Maryland, the Sunday edition of a Baltimore Sun newspaper had a photo on the upper right corner of the front page in which the same shape object was shown in the distance over a house which had a chimney.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In or about 1990, I tried to locate a copy of this newspaper and was told by the newspaper to contact the Maryland Archives which I did.  They responded to my inquiry that the photo to which I referred had been blacked out of the microfilm image with a notation of a security step, which was totally stupid to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was like the typical drawing of UFO&#39;s of a disk shape and was at an angle of about 30 off horizontal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no observable lights and no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two interesting reports from the same source.<n>
