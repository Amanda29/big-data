Hopping between clouds, as it moved in to the cloud, cloud was glowing<n> <n><n> <n><n> One small light moving slowly but steadily moving, more like drifting among sea of stars;. My uncle was a reporter at that time, he had good knowledge of air planes, when I told him about the light in the sky, he briefly told me that the light must be a some secret air plane because it was moving too fast for it to be a conventional air plane at that altitude. It was so high up there we could not hear a thing. I watch it for another 10 min. or so when it stated to decent and you could realize it was moving radically. That&#39;s when my uncle paid full attentions to that moving light, before you know it was right above us, where our family was gather to eat water melons and strawberries on the roof top of my uncles house. My mother screamed without loud sound; every one get down stairs. But I was glued to the object in the air, as if I move it was going get me; then it hover right above me. I can not make out the duration of the time it stood still in the air. Then suddenly it split in to three different glowing objects, now the movement of the object was indescribable; it was one but many at the same time; I remember the color changes as it danced. When I realized it is all happening in real life time;.  It started to move away  from us. We all looked at each other in silence. Then I saw red more orange light glowing from my sisters eye. I turned around, I saw a giant flames of  huge rock like object just gliding over us. It came so close to us that we could see all the small burning craters, we dropped on the floor expecting to feel the great heat from it, but it just gently glided over us with out any interventions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

I noticed it thru the bathroom window. The light was bright but dim all at once....The disk seemed to just float in space at about 100 feet from the ground. It that point I yelled at my father to come over and look at the light. Mysister  was also there. Then my father went outside to get a closer look... He rushed in and called the local police...The police officers came over.They preceeded to take pictures of the craft. From that point on I cannot remeber much from this encounter. But not long after this, the neighbour had a barn about 500 yards from my parents house. One nite we awoke to this loud rucuss coming from the barn, you could hear the cows going crazy...making such a loud noise...something quite unnatural . That same nite, i remember this experience in every minute details....I awoke later that night, i cried out to my father to get me a glass of water....he got up and i followed him into the kitchen.As we are walking down the hall I could smell an odd smell; you could smell something like smoke and mildew but with a sweetness to it. Asmell i&#39;ve yet to ever experience again. So  my father was about ten feet ahead of me,  I was walking behind him, when i got to the edge of the hall I noticed soemthing behind me....A small figure about 4 feet high a grayish, greensich color with no visible eyes, ears mouth, or nose. I t had some sort of bag that it threw over me.. The last thing I remeber is the look on my fathers face. He could not move, he was frozen in mid movement, but the look on his face was shear terror. Then after wards I remember waking up. Nothing strange,nothing different. I only seemed to remeber this event about ten years ago...nothing traumatic or special happened at that time in my life. i just remembered. After I told my parent about this story, my father thaught i was going insane.....but my mother seemed to beleive me. After wards she took me aside, and admitted to me that she has seen the craft that nite, in the back feild. She remebers seeing it lanf and seeing people come out of the craft. She does not remember that much about the event. But she distinctivley remebers the event happenning on the same nite .<n>

I was only 16 at the time and about 6-8 mos. pregnant with my daughter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with my best girlfriend, at the time, driving home from the Eastwood Mall.  We started joking.  We both seen these HUGE 3 bright lights in the sky. they were not moving at the time. As I was nearing her farm, to drop her off at her home, it became obvious that it was no longer a joke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled into her drive, we both got out, curiosity overcoming us both.  It was the hugest thing I had ever seen, just hovering with no sound at all, over her field.  It was lower than very tall tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both started walking underneath of it. The metal was unlike anything yet, I have ever seen.  It was as big as a football field, with the three huge round white lights.  I could see all of these little compartments making up the whole bottom, that was coming down diamond shaped also. The only common thing that I have ever read was the same red light that was going around at the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The overall shape was like the one I seen in the Star Wars Movie that same year. That was just so uncanny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we finally started yelling for her sister and husband to come out of the house, and they did, it started moving slow, for a second or two, then made noise and sped off faster than anything I had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went home and told my mother, who said for me not to say anything for people would call me crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, however, it was seen by the workers out on break at Denman Rubber in Leavittsburg, where my husband was working at the time, and they reported it in the Tribune Chronicle of Warren, Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As it did so, it appeared to &#39;jettison&#39; a stream of falling lights as it rose. This caught our attention, and we stopped to watch this strange object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main light continued to move, and over the next minute of watching it became clear it was coming our way. I&#39;m not sure how we realised this, time having dimmed my recollection. But, we were aware of a shape that blocked out the stars as it moved (it was a very clear night), and in the event the craft moved directly over us. Its shape was like a triangle added to a square - so a &#39;squat arrow&#39; shape. The triangle point was the &#39;nose&#39;. It was completely silent. As it passed over us it was larger than a hand-span at arm&#39;s length. Once we were viewing the flat rear of the craft as it moved away from us, three large round white &#39;engine ports&#39; were clearly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it slowly flew out over the Solent, we saw a commercial aircraft (probably a passenger jet) flying across the sky also. It was in the same &#39;general&#39; airspace, so I&#39;ve wondered whether anything else was reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s all so long now that I can&#39;t be sure of the precise year it happened, let alone the date. But I know I was about 15, it was a cold, clear dark night, and I remember hurrying home with my friend to tell my mum and dad. They weren&#39;t particularly interested. I wrote it all down, but the notes have long since disappeared. I often wonder whether other reports might describe something similar. But I am also interested by my own lack of drive to research more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The cabin owner came out and asked if we wanted to see the northern lights.  We went down to the lake and saw a pyramid of laser like lights emanating from a vertex 500 to 1000 feet above the lake.  There were six or eight beams of light that had no deflections in them like a flashlight beam has. These were like lasers shining into the water so that the base of the pyramid had to be at least 200 yards across. Each beam was probably 12 to 18 inches in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We returned to the cabin to finish our pinochle game and no one ever mentioned it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occasionally I think of the event and wonder what it could have been.

9/15/78 20:00|Pampa|TX|Light|10 minutes|Had UFO come within 30 to 40 feet from us. Then took off very very fast into space. No doubt there is other life out there, none at all|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37160.html|11|ndxe197809| Had UFO come within 30 to 40 feet from us. Then took off very very fast into space. No doubt there is other life out there, none at all<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never told my story to anyone but a few friends in recent years. Myself (witness #1--name deleted) and a friend of mine at the time ((witness #2--name deleted)), which were 15 and 16 years old at the time had gone out on the side of town to a small wheat field that was ready to be harvested on a beautiful clear warm Friday evening and parked in a circle in the middle of the wheat field that had been made by the farmer from turning around in, I assume, (his barn and tractor were behind us off the side of circle. To be honest my friend had bought a six pack of Michelob beer and we were going to drink a couple beers though at the time of this incident we had not yet opened one beer and were completely sober and straight. Anyway, it was just getting dark but still a little bit of light. We were talking and I was sitting in passenger seat anf ((witness #2)) in drivers seat and I was staring at this red flashing light blinking like a heart beat up in the sky directly in front of me. I thought it was a radio tower with its red warning lights so a plane does not fly into it but after a short bit it started moving to my right very slowly. At that time I asked my friend &#34;hey what is that?&#34; and we both thought it was a small cessna airplane flying extremely low. It kept getting lower and lower and swung around to the far side of the wheat field and came right over the top of the wheat, still with its light blinking. It started coming right towards us and it came so close that our skin and face and car and the wheat around us was glowing red when it blinked. We both kept saying to each other &#34;What is it?, what is it?&#34;. I had my head stuck out the window trying to get a look at what it was but even with it that close I could not make out a shape nor could I hear any sound what so ever. It kept coming towards us then my friend paniced and started his car to take off because I guess he was more frightened than I was. When he started his car the light stopped for a few seconds then started going back the way it had been coming accro! ss field but then took off at an incredible speed up into the sky. We drove as fast as we could to the dirt road and went in the direction it was and by then it was higher than commercial jets fly and kept going higher into the atmosphere until it could no longer be seen. There is no possible way that anyone on earth had anything that could go that fast, I mean it was fast. The human body could not handle that kind of &#39;G&#39; Force as far as I know. Then it was gone.  The following Monday in the newspaper someone else had seen the same light/craft (UFO) but they saw it on the west side of town we were on the North side of town and by the time they quoted seeing it they had to of seen it about 30 minutes before us. We never reported seeing anything to anyone thinking people would think we were nuts plus because we were out there to drink a few beers and were only 15 and 16 years old and that would get us in trouble with the parents. Now that I am 40 it is of no concern to me anymore. ** There is no doubt in my mind that that UFO was from some other life form and planet or where ever, no doubt what so ever. There is no way what I saw could of been from Earth, none what so ever! I am 100% convinced that we are being visited by beings from another planet or where ever here on earth and that the government has to know about it and is keeping what they know from us. They must tell us everything that they know which I&#39;m sure is a lot. When they finally are forced to do so then everyone is really going to be upset with the government for keeping it from them for so long. Us mere earthlings can handle the truth. I already know the truth, somewhat, I know they do exist with out a doubt and so do many other people who have had encounters with them. The aliens I&#39;m sure think that every human being has been informed of their presence, but this is far from the truth. I think it is stupid for the government not to tell what they know, if they would then everyone could come together with their info they have and maybe we c! ould become a bit more savy on their ways and maybe what to expect in the future. They could be sizing us up to take over our planet and with their technology that would not be very hard at all, probably with a snap of the fingers or whatever they snap. I often wondor what would of happened if my friend would not of started the car. We could of had it land right next to us and met the aliens or then we could of been abducted also! Yikes, maybe it was good he did start the car, I&#39;ll never know I guess. As far as the date goes I only remember it was 1978 because I was 15 but I really not sure what month and what day, but there was a story that following Monday in the paper and it happoened the Friday before that. The wheat was ready for harvest because I went back out there next time I had someone with a car to check out and see if wheat was singed or burnt or partly harvested or anything strange but when I got there it had already been harvested. What about radio activity on a geiger counter? Would that possibly pick up something? It has been 26 years ago this happened, I thought I should document it somewhere, do you not agree. I live in Hawaii now and Jeff still lives in Pampa, Texas. Also, the final assembly point for all nuclear weapons is 45 miles from where this happened which is like a baby step to these aliens I&#39;m sure. Pantex is the name of the place. I know they have interest in our nuclear sights, weapons and such so I thought I would throw that in. That is possibly why they were by this little hick town of Pampa Texas either that or needed some wheat to make some bread with. My tele.# is ((two numbers deleted)). ((witness #2)) is probably listed in the phone book in Pampa Texas if anyone ever wants to talk about this sighting. I always wodered if I were to get hipnotized if I would remember anything more. Maybe I was abducted  and don&#39;t even know it. You never know! Well that is about it I guess. Thank You for your time reding this.

It was first seen in Souther sky as a light with same luminescence as Venus. It approached and to the North and began descending at a 45 degree angle when it was approximately a mile away. We stood up when the disc was roughly 300 years away. The disc hovered over our home, directly over head, and we got out from under it in order to see it. After a minute of looking at it a white strobe light flashed at us for 5-10 seconds and then stopped. Before it took off, the ship hummed like a bench grinder, the oscillations building to an apex and when the oscillations &#39;fell into phase&#39; the entire ship visably &#39;clicked&#39; into gear, moving less than an inch, and then headed West at a slow speed (5 mph) for a few seconds and then flew straight across the sky so fast it was a blur until it was so small on the horizon I couldn&#39;t see it. Then, the object seemed to &#39;draw a line of light&#39; from its point on the horizon to the stars, at a 45 degree angle; the line of light caught up with the point of origin and it looked like a star in the Western sky, and then the light went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were heading due west on county road 318 into a small town called Flemington Florida, SW of Gainesville Florida approximately 20 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 17 year old brother was driving his Impala down a slight hill and I was in the passenger seat and for some odd reason was looking to my left, which is the driver&#39;s side and seen a large oval bright white object heading in a south to north direction which would have put it directly in front of my brother&#39;s car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to both my brother&#39;s look look what is it?  Nobody knew, so I told my brother to pull over to the shoulder of the road and he did hesitantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The car was still running and in park, as the object go closer he said I am leaving, and  I said no I want to see what this is, I than grabbed the keys out of the ignition put them in my hand, got out of the car and sat on the hood of the car while this object came closer and closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was oval shaped, no lights, but a very bright white glow that did not hurt your eyes.  By this time it was moving right over the front of the car at a very slow rate of speed, and was absolutely quiet.  I would estimate the object was about 100 feet in diameter and it nearly directly over us and I could hear my brother saying lets get out of here.  My response to him was why if they wanted to do anything to us we couldn&#39;t do anything about it anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So while I was sitting on the hood looking at this thing I had a really weird feeling that they knew everything about me.  It&#39;s hard to explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So then after a few more minutes as it started going away from the car to the north of us I noticed it higher in the sky and in a blinking of an eye it flew off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear evening right around twilight when all this happened!.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finally got home about 5 minutes later and I remember the first thing my mother said as my 17 year old brother walked into the house (my god you look like you have seen a ghost).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We saw an enormous craft, perhaps 3 football fields long come out of the east at a low altitude and pass over our heads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This immense craft then disappeared to the west.  It was diamond shape, and I could see details on the underside as it passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years sightings expanded from the saucer or ball shapes to include triangle UFO&#39;s, but the UFO I sighted did something that as far as I know has never been reported.  It flew with the base of the triangle forward, not point forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

As i looked over the dune toward the ocean I could see (but heard no sound) a craft that resembled a helicopter.  The cockpit area was lit in a yellowish light and I could see a pilot in the cockpit wearing an oxygen mask.  It hovered a while and then flew off over the ocean.  I had to walk back the 4 or 5 blocks to my apt not knowing how I got there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I stood under it for about 30 to 40 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was back in the late summer, early fall of 1978 in Bartlett, Ill. My mom, my sister and I were on our way home from Bingo in (Streamwood, Il), which was a Friday evening. We had just gotten to Rt 20 and a block from turning onto North Ave when my sister who was sitting in the front seat noticed some lights in the sky blinking. She pointed this out to both me and our mother. What I seen was BIG and saucer shape. When I say big, I mean bigger than a commercial Air plane. This UFO was about 100 ft just about above us. My mom , who was driving, became scared and did a U-turn on Rt 20 and drove down the road about 2 miles. The UFO continued to be just about above us. She then turned around again and she at this point decided to go report it to the police dept. She was scared and I guess she felt that she would be ok if we just went to the police dept since it was following us. It followed us all the way to the police dept (I know it sounds strange a UFO following you, but it is true). When we got to the police dept, it disappeared, just gone in a split second! We talked to a police officer and told him about what we seen. He told us that “100’s of people have reported seeing this”. He just acted nonchalant like no big deal. The UFO that hovered above us did not make any sound what so ever. It was quiet, no vibration, the only way you knew it was there was the lights that went around the craft in a circular motion.  The officer reassured my mom that it was ok and when we went to leave we looked to see if it was there and it was not. The police station was about 10 blocks to our apartment on Wayne Ct, in Bartlett. We were heading down the road and as we got to the corner of N. Marion Ave, Wayne Ct and E. Taylor it suddenly appeared out of nowhere.  We continued on to our apartment on Wayne Ct. My mom pulled in the drive way and my sister jumped out of the car scared and ran into the apartment and told my boyfriend ( Derrick Fender, of Elgin, Il) and my other sister and her boyfriend (Mike ! Kessel l of Hanover Park, Il) that there was a UFO at the end of the street. They all ran out of the apartment and went to where My mom stood by the car. I walked down to the end of the street where the UFO was hovering.  Again no noise at ALL none. No wind, no noise just the lights making a circular pattern around the ship.  My sister, who had been in the car with me and my mom, came back outside and yelled at me “Get back here they are going to take you”. I was several months pregnant with my first child. I did not feel fear at all. I was more curious that fearful.  I stood under the ship, which I looked up to and it was about 100 ft above me and was much, much bigger than an airplane. As I stood there looking up I could not see what it looked like at all. It was as if it was transparent and I could see the stars through it. However I could also see the lights (green, yellow, red, and orange) going around the perimeter of the ship that outlined it circular shape.  I stood there looking, for awhile about 30 to 45 minutes, so I was told by my family. However, to me it was as if I was only there for a couple of minutes, it was as if time stood still. I know that the neighbors seen this also as some of them where outside watching.  Suddenly it just disappeared in thin air, did not fly off, just disappeared in a split second.  I stood there for a few moments and then walked back to where my family was.  There has only been one picture I have found on the internet that closely resembles what I seen and that is this (note this is NOT the actual UFO just what it looks like) This is Similar to the ship I seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://s35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/heaven-sent/?action=view&amp;current=UFOthatIseen.gif&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/heaven-sent/UFOthatIseen.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Photobucket&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  [IMG]http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/heaven-sent/UFOthatIseen.gif[/IMG] http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/heaven-sent/UFOthatIseen.gif<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The writer dated the event 5/12/1980 but said he wasn&#39;t sure.  I think the event was approximately September of 1978 or 1979.  I was 16 or 17 and driving home from work on interstate 70.  I was headed east from Indianapolis to Greenfield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say somewhere between the Mt. Comfort Rd. exit and the Greenfield exit, I saw 3 lights in a triangular shape.  The lights were primarily white but I do remember some occasional red and blue.  It would have been around 9:15 based on where I was on my trip home.  The lights moved in relation to each other and formed different sizes of the same triangle. I exited interstate 70 at Greenfield and turned north on highway 9.  I then went approximately 1 mile until I reached 300 north and turned west. (I was still headed home)  Very shortly after I turned onto 300 north, I could see something above me.  I have always described it as a &#34;density&#34;.  It was too close above me to make out a shape.  When I looked up, it was big enough that I couldn&#39;t see sky on any side of the object.  I have also always said it was probably bigger that two 2 story houses.  I have also said it would be like standing under a large passenger jet, that is on the ground, and looking up.  You could just see the underneath.  I couldn&#39;t see the lights at that time and I could not make out the color of the object, just that there was something above me. There was no sound. I am guessing this lasted for just a few seconds until I drove past it.  I went home and made it by my normal time which was approximately 9:30.  I told my parents and they could tell I was visibly excited.  The next morning, I was sitting in my high school home room and they came over the intercom and said the National Enquirer was in the office and wanted to interview anyone having seen a UFO.  I did not go because I was too embarrassed to get up in front of the home room.  I do not know if anybody went.  That evening, the Greenfield Daily Reporter ran a front page article.  In that article, it reported finding markings in a field.  These markings were found somewhere on the opposite side of highway 9 than I had turned.  I turned to the west of 9 and these were found on the east of 9 and at about the same area as 300 north.  I feel it must have been headed east when I saw it.  I match my dates due to where I was working.  I really felt it was in the fall because of feeling new in the home room class.  I did go back to the Hancock County Library a couple of years ago and tried to find the paper.  I was unable to find any article, but I did concentrate on the fall only.  I will make an attempt to go back soon and start checking all of 1978 and 1979.  I will also check to make sure that all of the papers are there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

So did half the law enforcement in Shelby as well as Desoto county, Ms.  It was on the front page of the paper the next day.  Unexplainible is was.  Pushed under the carpet I guess. 77, or 78, the fall or late summer.  It seemed as though we lost some time while underneath whatever it was.  None of us felt the same as we had before.  It hovered over my car for about 30-45 seconds and then sped off at an aeronautically unimaginable speed.  I have always been fascinated by aircraft ever since childhood have spent almost my entire life learning everthing i could about their characteristics, however, never have i seen nor do i want again to see anything like that again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There were four of us and I don&#39;t remember Who it was, But they looked up and said, &#34;hey! look at that falling star;&#34; and we all looked up and it was a bright falling star, &#34;we thought&#34; heading right for us.  Then as it dropped closer to us it was actually a few miles to the south west at about the center of the city of Sunnyside. I thought it would hit and then it slowed down and stopped about a half mile above the city. it stayed there about 20 seconds to the best of my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started to kid around and said things like, &#34;You see that?.....No, I didn&#39;t see anything...You...no not me&#34;  Then in the blink of an eye it was over Mabton, about 6 miles to the south of Sunnyside. The light still in Sunnyside then followed to Mabton. Almost like the flash of a sparkler when you Swing it around in the dark during the fourth of July as a kid. Same light anyway, then after another 20 seconds or so it shot toward Toppenish and arched up into the sky till is blended into the stars and was gone. One guy joined the Air Force later after High School and I have never talked to him about it, maybe some day. He did want to know more about what we seen that day. (This was a very bright round light, like a florecent only brighter)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

9/1/78 03:00|San Francisco|CA|Circle|5 minutes|RED OBJECT IN THE SKY!|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14403.html|23|ndxe197809| RED OBJECT IN THE SKY!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 11 or 12 years old and I remember still to this day what occured around September, 1978, I am not sure of the exact date.  I was home sick with a cold and not in school.  My brother stayed home as well, because he too did not feel well.  My mother is a housewife, so she was taking care of us.  It was around 3:00 p.m. which is when school lets out my older brother was coming home from school.  I knew that he would be coming home soon.  My brother played the violin so I knew that he would be carrying his violin case with him.  For some reason around 3:10 to 3:15 p.m. I had an urge to want to go out the front door.  So I opened the door and I did!  I began to run down the stairs, my brother followed me out and my mother ran after me to get me back into the house.  At that exact time I saw my older brother coming around the corner of the Street.  He was looking up into the sky and walking really fast.  I noticed that he seemed nervous looking into the sky ever so many seconds.  I later looked up into the sky and noticed that what he was starting at was a large &amp; I mean large object that was bright red and a perfect circle.  My mother stoped pulling on my shirt at that time because I noticed that she noticed it too, and so did my brother.  The object had to be the half size of a house, thats how large it was in the sky.  The bright red object moved as if it was following my brother and my brother at that time started running to the house.  I noticed that then the object came closer and then it just hoovered in a stationary position for about 10 to 12 seconds and then the object took off in a matter of 2 to 3 seconds and it was gone.  The one main thing that caught my attention about this object was that their was no sound, not when it stayed in stationary position and not when it took off.  It was a beautiful bright red, but it didn&#39;t blind you.  I saw no patterns of any kind to on the red object to see if it had any form of a design.  Later that evening it came out on channel 7 news and it was ! seen in the entire city of San Francisco.  But they dismissed the object to be a red air balloon.  I may have been 11 and my brother 13 and my older brother 16 and my mother about 49 years old, but I could tell you this the government might want to fool the people, this was no red air balloon.  I have seen lots of red air balloons, and not one of them ever looked like the object that I saw in the sky. Did any one ever see this object, I wanted to find an article that came out in the news paper, but I cannot seem to find one.  If you have this article of the object that was seen around 1977 to 1978, please email me at: ((e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
