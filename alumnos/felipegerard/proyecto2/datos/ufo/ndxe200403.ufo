3/31/04 21:30|West Central|MN|Unknown|approx: 5 minutes|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  V Shaped Lights.|4/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35939.html|2|ndxe200403| V Shaped Lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photos can be viewed at: http://www.hbccufo.com/index.php  I have continued to see various assorted craft off and on for well, years. Tonights craft was particulary interesting because of the apparent shape. Which was different to me. I noticed a bright flash and went for my camera. The lights hovered in the eastern sky for about 5 minutes and then diappeared by imploding or shutting off all at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me know what enhancements might show on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional Information Below&#34;  In describing the brilliant flash - I would say an electric white/blue, as lightening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In describing movement – It would be best to say it was like something that had been moving very fast and suddenly stopping. It had a hanging sense to it as if an unstable slight spin. The turning was slow and it gave an appearance of adjusting the actual lights. The lights appeared to have a sequencing effect. To say they went from odd positions to a more uniform alignment. After they came into ‘straight line’ forming a V with an odd nose. A ‘W’ type of nose. Then they just faded down and a quick white/blue flash and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what direction it came from. I can only say it ‘materialised’ in the eastern sky. With the exception of maneuvering the lights it made no drastic moves. I do not know which way it went because it seemed to implode or leave in the manner in which it appeared. Flash and gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear. All other natural and satellite features were in normal placement. The temperature was in the 20’sF. Slight breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To take a wild guess as to elevation of object I would say just above small craft path. The placement was toward the lake. I think it was above the lake. The lake is 7 blocks east downhill from my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To describe structure I would call it a very interesting bit of ‘piecework’. I mean to say it was not in alignment when it first ‘appeared’. It performed some kind of structuring act.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may be best to call it W shaped. I say that because though it was V in overall shape, at least by the manipulating of the lights it also formed an indent like the W or a ^ at the V center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not detect any sound other then a humming sensation at the top of my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and my dog and cat were the witnesses for this that I am aware of. The cat a HUGE Orange Tom Tabby went to the west in the bit of thicket to hunt. The dog a miniature Schnauzer/Lhasa (Benji) was mildly distressed. He could hear something and wanted to go into the house. He growled for sometime but that could be because he does not like his cat to be hunting in the dark! We have sighted strange black dogs…they look like hienna’s in stature, they stalk the deer trail through the west hillside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time. I bring this one up because its shape was new to me. I see allot of oval shaped objects and Spheres. Orbs abound! I stand contrary to ALL digital orbs being Blurfos. I have seen hundreds of orbs pass through this part of the world. They can be seen with the naked eye. They are not an aftershot. Another words they are there before a picture is even taken. I have seen ‘cloud’ forms in a number of locations in this area. They appear to be intelligent and have a set purpose what that purpose is…I do not profess to know!  Hope all is well or as well as can be for you and yours Brian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Is following up on this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>

I stopped the car because I wanted to see what would happen. The lights went out in sequence from left to right. I have no idea what it was. It was partly cloudy out, but it did not look like a reflection off of the clouds. I live near Fort Gordon, so it could have been some kind of army manuever. A local talk show host suggested I report it to you, so there it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/31/04 21:00|Naples|FL|Sphere|40 minutes|Triangle shaped light formation of Florida golf coast.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58237.html|4|ndxe200403| Triangle shaped light formation of Florida golf coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A large Light appeared off the golf coast looking north from Vanderbilt Beach towards Sanibel Island. It was redish white and it brightened enough to make a reflective streak across the water within seconds. It seemed to have been sitting there for a couple of minutes before it brightened and grabbed our attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowly started moving away from the coast and then out of nowhere streaked out of view at the horizon. Needless to say it was a jaw-dropping sight that grabbed our attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than a minute later there was a bright &#34;ping&#34; of light that came from the horizon in the same redish white hue. It seemed to signal the original light to come back. It&#39;s difficult to say how far this was happening away from us on the beach but if i had to guess i would say at least a mile away. My friend disagreed and claimed to have seen a rounded triangle solid object but i could not make out enough detail to verify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved across the sky slowly the object/light split in 3 objects and moved apart to form a triangle formation that moved in a way that kept the exact proportions of the triangle. Abruptly all three lights shot across the sky and disappeared. The acceleration and speed i could not guess but it was like nothing i&#39;ve seen; hundred of miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole process repeated a few times of reappearing and shooting off until it just stopped leaving me and my friend baffled and mystified by what was just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My name is Daniel and my friend Brett was also there. It was the last night of a vacation and it was a very silent night with the exception of the event. Never before had i given much thought to people describing their &#34;UFO&#34; events until this had happened. I don&#39;t claim to know what i saw but i do know as much as i can that it wasn&#39;t man made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

3/31/04 19:45|Norman|OK|Chevron|5-8 seconds|Almost Transparent Chevron Shaped Objects- Norman Oklahoma|4/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35933.html|5|ndxe200403| Almost Transparent Chevron Shaped Objects- Norman Oklahoma<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I were out in the back yard, he was playing with the dog and I was staring at the sky hoping to spot a dusk-time satellite to point out to him, something we have done several times over the years.  I was facing almost due west, looking almost straight up to 45 degrees- scanning the sky.  Something, coming into my peripheral vision from my left, caught my eye and I turned to focus on it.  I could not make it out clearly.  I could tell it was chevron to bow shaped, clear to orange-ish, but very faint colored.  There was either another, but smaller, or a same sized but higher object to the left of it, both were chevron/bow shaped.  My first thought was that it was a flock of geese, but before I could tell my son to &#34;look at the geese&#34;, I realized it was traveling entirely too fast for birds and there was no &#34;honking&#34; or sound what so ever normally associated with geese.  The only thing that I could say was,&#34;son, tell me you see that.&#34; and his response was &#34;that is awesome.&#34;  From the time I first spotted it to losing sight of it over some trees in the neighbors yard was 5-8 seconds.  It was almost directly overhead.  It was somewhere in the neighborhood of 2000-2500 feet off the ground.  Size of the object??  All that I can honestly say was that it was big.  It was not just a dot or a line.   For lack of scale, looking up in the sky, it was 10&#34; to 12&#34; in the sky and the smaller one was 6&#34; to 8&#34;.  The &#34;body&#34; of the object was 1&#34; (middle) to pointed end (actually it faded to nothing at the &#34;wing-tips&#34;), it was hazy looking almost like a cloud. It travelled south to north.  Sky was clear (not a cloud in the sky) with light wind out of the northeast (6mph). I have worked in the aircraft industry for almost 10 years and I know what an airplane is, and I know what geese look like flying in formation.  This was not either. I live 10-15 minutes south of Tinker AFB and see military aircraft daily, it wasn&#39;t anything I have seen flying overhead from there. (Also, note, I did see either a 7! 07 or AWAC on final approach around 5-10 minutes following my sighting of the objects.  It was east of me, and I could clearly see the strobes and landing lights as well as hear it, it was several miles away.)  There were also several small aircraft (3-4) in the sky each going in different directions at different flight levels.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was facing him and suddenly a bright light flashed in an upside down mushroom formation, in the sky and lit up a bright white round disk.  THe disc appeared to be flat.  Then the light seemed to suck back up into the sky in the same mushroom formation as it had appeared.  My husband did not see it.  I asked him if he saw something light up our house (behind me) or light up my face and he said no.  The disc appeared to be right above our trees in the back yard.   When I looked away into the dark, I had blue circles in my eyes, as though I had just been looking at a light bulb or something.  We live in the country.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It caught my eye because it was such a &#34;frothy&#34; plume coming out the back of the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a shot and put the camera down.  As I did so, I noticed the &#34;contrail-shadow&#34; effect I have wanted to get a picture of for a long time.  I grabbed my camera and took another shot, when the black line was dark.  The line lasted about 30 seconds, then began to fade.  I took another shot to show it fading, then put the camera down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went about my business for the next ten or so minutes, and then decided to takes a shot, showing the contrail beginning to &#34;fan&#34; out, spreading into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That evening, after I downloaded these images to a computer, I noticed an &#34;foreign&#34; object in at least three of my pictures.  The first shows it as more luminous than the surrounding sky.  The second shot, the one of the &#34;black-line&#34;, shown the object has moved, is much lower in altitude, and has turned black also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third shot, the one of the fanning contrail taken several minutes later, shown something &#34;in&#34; the trail itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My camera is a Sony Cybershot, digital camera.

I live on the side of the mountain. The street that I live on is at the highest point on the mountain side. That evening I woke up at 3AM. For reason&#39;s that most people over 50 get up for! I looked out the back door that faces the mountain--straight up where the mountain ends and the sky is seen(horizon) I saw three circular shaped lights. They were the size of the moon --each of them. The light being emitted from them was white just like the moon. At first I thought that the light I saw coming into the room from the window was the moon. Then looking out the window,,I noticed the three white lights--giving off as much light as the moon! I watched them for a while. They remained in place..never moving. At times the light would stop and then come back on again. Two of them remained next to each other. The other was spaced a little further away. But they were lined up in a row. Straight along the top of the mountain horizon approximately 14,000 ft. This is just a guess. I had gotten up again at about 5AM. They were still there in the same position and flashing on and off every once in a while. This was not the only time I have seen these objects. That particular week, four days in a row...but I can definately say I saw them on March 28,29,30,31. I hope that you will find this of some interest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed.  PD))<n>

Hood, Texas. We walked outside around 2300 and noticed a very bright, and unusual object in the western sky. After staring at it for a few minutes, we agreed we saw red and blue lights flashing along with the white light, but it did not appear to move. It seemed to fade and brighten, and appeared to be spinning in place. After watching a few other aircraft in the area, one of which kept changing direction, we were certain it was not an aircraft. After wacthing for about 10 minutes we went inside, waited another 10 minutes and went outside. It had moved lower in the sky, but in relation with the moon and stars. We again watched for a few minutes, with no noticable movement across the sky. It is still in the western sky, and still appears to be simply hovering and flashing red and blue lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had just gotten back from Disney in the hotel parking lot. My wife &amp; kids were out of the car, I was gathering up our stuff. My wife suddenly yelled &#34;look up what&#39;s that in the sky?&#34; I walked over to where she was standing and saw 3 lights in a triangle formation moving rapidly overhead. Suddenly they began making rapid, intricate manuvers. They converged, separated, then one quickly orbited another. It all happened too quickly to remember precisely, about 30 seconds in all. While they were making these seemingly impossible manuvers they also continued their forward motion until we couldn&#39;t see them anymore. They made no sound. The 4 of us were stunned and we had an eerie feeling I can&#39;t explain. My wife said when she first saw them they were lower (or larger). She thought they were planes that were going to crash. The way she describes them they seem about the size of a 1 inch finger space held at arms length. By the time my sons and I looked they were about a quarter that size. So they appeared to be moving away as well. We seem to differ a little on the color. I &amp; one son thought they were silver grey. My wife &amp; my other son thought they were slighty yellow then became silvery. The sky overhead was pretty clear. There was some haze lower down that began to obscure them at the end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an actor on Broadway. I was a biology &amp; physics major in college.

The conditions for 8:48 P.M. 03-30-04 were clear and warm. My possition on the ground was 1 mile north and 1 mile West of the town of Arlee. I turned West on the country road towards my house. After taking a turn, the road paralleled Highway 93. I was facing South. To the East at an altitude of approximatly 4000 ft. was an Orange light. It was a dark orange with a flashing white light. At first sighting, it seemed to have an erratic movement. Then it smoothed out and continued South at the same altitude. I stopped the car and told my passengers to look. I rolled down the window and turned the engine off. I wanted to listen for distinct airplane or helicopter sounds. I could not hear any, only the sounds of the dogs in town barking wildly. I asked my passenger to get our new Sony Cybershot digital camera out of the glove box. I fumbled out of the car and tried to take some pictures. The first picture the flash went off. After I turned the flash off, I tried to take a couple more pictures. By then the object had continued heading South, and went beyond the mountains. I got back into the car and proceeded to drive South towards Missoula. I got to the Missoula valley, and searched the sky. I also checked the airport runway. There was an airplane just taking off. There were no recently landed aircraft as far as I could see. I observe aircraft constantly, and am very fimiliar with the lighting and flight paths of air traffic. I am also an amatuer astronomer. My other pictures did not capture the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m 100% sure it wasn&#39;t a plane or helicopter, balloon or whatever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was grey or black I can&#39;t remember and there was some sorts of tubings or smaller rectangular shapes on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m the only witness because I didn&#39;t dare to ask anyone else if they were seeing it,  I was kind of hypnotized and feeling so calm, it&#39;s weird to describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it for about 20 seconds until I couldn&#39;t see it because of the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never thought much about it, kinda forgot about it, until now.  I&#39;m really curious to know if there is any other similar ufo sightings (I havn&#39;t seen a lot of rectangular ufos on the internet) and if you know what kind of alien species have this type of engine?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n>

And walking up the steps to my apartment that has an open courtyard. When I got about half way up I looked up through the courtyard and saw something so colorful and bright. It moved towards the north. It had no shape it looked almost natural. Huge. I ran to the back of the apartments to see where it went, but it was gone. I waited and stared at the night sky hoping to see something. I must say that when I saw it, I kept waiting to hear a big boom. I got this overwhelming feeling that the ghostly sight with rainbow colored, soft, round orbs with in it, was some sort of attack. My friend who had picked me up from work, caught something she describes as angelic. She froze. I ran. We compared what it was we experienced by not explaining it to one another, but, by writting it down and letting each other read it. So as if not to allow our emotions to find a bond. The only thing about this that made me decide to share it, is that it flew to the north across us. Towards Burbank Airport. Which does not allow flights over the area after 10:00 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And also that while I looked up to the sky hoping for more I noticed that about 1 minute after we saw it, something flew out of Burbank Airport quietly and headed west.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were quite far off so we didn&#39;t think they were unusual at first, maybe planes. At first two appeared to be flying towards each other, then they avoided each other. One went high and one went low. The first light continued west while the other one stopped and just hung there. A third one appeared above the light that was moving, sort of flickered a little and then went dark. The two remaining lights stayed still after that for about 10 minutes. We drove through Nanton and were still able to see the lights though they seemed much closer now. I pulled over to the shoulder of the road and got my video camera out and and was standing on the side of the road waiting to see if the lights would move again. The third light reappeared and it was much, much closer now. I was able to film a about 15-20 seconds of it. It appears brightly , fades, then reappears then seems to turn to the east and there appears to be lights surrounding it flickering on and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While trying to orient myself I saw a four or five faint lights in a tight formation pass directly overhead in a NNW direction. I thought that it might be a plane, a single object but I had a sense that they were separate because the lights were of different intesities. Because of the faintness of the lights they seemed high yet if they were high then they were going FAST! There was no Sonic boom or anything. It was weird! The objects cleared a 90 degree arc in less than three seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It is half moon or so, a crater would be exposed to light from one side and casting a shadow in the inner crater and the other side of the crater.  It was inside the crater in the shadow part that I noticed this oddity.  The only physical way that this could happen is that a feature inside the crater must at least crest the crater to be hit by the light.  I can&#39;t think of anything that high inside of a moon crater.  My humble conclusion is that it is generating its own light.  My regret is not having a powerful enough telescope to investigate it.  I hope to see it next time ( I had to leave the site after clouds rolled in)<n>

I saw what looked like stars appearing far in the distance, about four of them and then it looked like they were flashing on and off. It was a very clear night and the moon was out and visability was good. I could see the mountains in the background and they were below the objects.  All at once the bright white lights shut off and then re-appeared over the town which was about two miles ahead of me.  Four to five of the lights flashed off and on and were about 300 to 400 feet off of the ground.  Suddenly about fifteen of them appeared in two separate rows with the lower row about 300 feet over the town and the second row about 400 ft.  They stopped flashing and they all just lit up at the same time.  They stretched out to the south side of town for about half a mile.  I got within less than a mile of them and they all shut off at once and disappeared.  This is the third time I have seen activity in this area and decided that it was time to start reporting it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded exceptionally sober-minded to us.

I am familiar with most types of commercial and private aircraft since my home falls within normal flight paths of air traffic (incoming and outgoing aircraft) for Ottawa international Airport. The light I saw displayed none of the usual flashing navigational, running, collision lights and moved quickly and steadily from west to east. It was a steady white light, with no pulsing or flashing, no noise and maintained it&#39;s course and speed during the entire event. I just checked out Heavens Above.com and a satellite tracking link there and found that what I am 99% sure is what I a saw was the ISS (International Space Station). The information provided on the website matches time, direction, and duration with my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The one I was watching had the appearance of a large plane contrail, two thick and twisting trails leading into thinner lines and disappearing. I looked in the binoculars to see what plane left this trail. At the head of the trail there was no plane body. There was instead 5 distinct shapes and their trails were merging into two. The &#34;body&#34; looked like a cloud hand in a fist. As it approached the ground the &#34;fingers&#34; were slightly opening. I saw a small ship, silver and reflecting the sun. It was about a centimeter long (in the binos) and it was circling the area where the trail ended. It was an eliptical plate in shape and the back end had a red marker on it. I don&#39;t know for sure if the mark was  chevron shaped. As the ship circled the area moving with speed I noticed it was doing rollovers and would dissapear and reapear in the sunlight. This sighting occured in the sw sky over the mountains and Okanagan Lake between Vernon and Kelowna. The ship I saw headed SE. The total time was approx. five minutes from watching the contrail descend to the ship leaving the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

While looking to the west at the sunset, I noticed a chrome ball in the sky, and I immediately dismissed it as an airplane coming towards me. After several minutes of watching this object, I decided to run in the house and get my video camera to film this, in case it was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I came back out side, the object had moved to the north, but still hovering over what looked like the Oakland area. As I started filming the object, it swiftly maneuvered towards my location. As it passed me directly overhead, roughly the height of the high clouds, it disappeared. It made no noise as it went overhead, and I could then see the object was oval or roundish, about half the size of a large airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the house and turned on the TV news and my radio, to listen if somebody else witnessed this. Nothing was reported on the stations I selected. As I listened to the news, I hooked up my video camera to the other TV to see the video, which I was expecting to remarkable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rewound the tape, and pressed play, and nothing appeared but fuzz. Now I had goosebumps all over my body. Something happened to the tape. The entire tape was dead, just fuzz. Then I started thinking, maybe this thing knew I was taping it and that’s why it flew overhead, but I still to this day cannot figure out why the whole tape is messed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here’s where the fun begins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A day after this event (which has dramatically altered my life) I notice items in my patio missing. An old electric keyboard is gone, and so was my fishing equipment. I quickly dismissed this as a neighborhood kid theft, but then I started noticing other things missing too. My hair brush, my dirty laundry, my tooth brush, and even some old video tapes that I used to record my friends wedding the week before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am the only person who lives here, except for my pet Doberman, who is very old, and semi-senile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next part of this might freak you out, as it did to me, and to this day I am afraid to sleep. The following two nights after the sighting, I heard noises in my garage, which is adjacent to my bedroom. Through the walls, I head movement and rattling noises, and what sounded like voices, but squeaky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third day after my sighting, I decided it was time to check on things in the garage, and swung open the large front door. All of the light bulbs had been removed, but other than that, everything seemed to be in order. Maybe kids? The doors were locked and remained locked, so I’m unsure what it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have decided to move out and sell the house, as I am just too freaked out to stay there, and have been staying at a friends house for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i am now worried I might be abducted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you need to discuss this or see the fuzzy tape feel free to email me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stopped at his favorite spot which was very near the maintanance office with a small grassy area. While he was doing his business I was looking up at the dark sky as I usually do while waiting for him to move on. Just above the building I caught site of something faint moving behind the antena which was positioned on the roof.My first thought was that it was a flock of birds in formation so I moved to my right to get a better unobstructed view. That is when I clearly saw the slowly and silently moving boomerang shaped object which was traveling to the south.The underside of the object was coverd with yellowish white lights which defined it&#39;s shape and I could also see the stars black out as it passed under them. What was really amzing to me was the size of this thing. I can only only reference it by saying it was like standing under a floating city of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We then saw a bright light flash on the horizon as if it was signaling the light up north towards Cape Coral and Sanibel Island. The light farther north glowed bright enough to see a reflection in the water and then all of the sudden it slowly split into three glowing objects. One went right  and one went left leaving the original duller but in the same place. The light on the right went faster and eventually behind trees out of sight. The one on the left stopped and went back to the original light and made it glow. At that moment the one on the horizon blinked again. While the north light disappeared leaving a dark spot in the sky. After about 4 or 5 minutes we thought it was gone when right in front of our eyes the Light on the horizon blinked again  and the light to the north reappeared. It glowed so bright this time that we compared it to the ALMOST full moon because the reflection on the water. The light then  split into three objects again and formed a triangle ( the light to the north) that moved across the sky slowly then darted out of sight the right which would be east. At that point we left the beach and told my friend’s parents about it and went to bed to leave early in the morning. When we came home we told another friend who told us to look it up on the internet and then  we found http://www.spacepub.com/users/data/sightings/flo/flo.htm. which had a reference to your sight.

It had white 5 lights, 1 on each corner and one in the middle. I rolled down my window and didn&#39;t hear any plane. I was going about 45 mph, and had to speed up a bit to keep it to keep it in sight on my side. I estimate it was going about 60 mph....very slow for something as big as an average jet.

There were 4 round orbs and they were basically the color of fire. One moved over the neighborhood and seemed fairly close, perhaps as low as 2000 feet, but it did not seem  to be terribly high over the rooftops in the neighborhood. Rather than acting shocked or suprised, I tried to observe carefully along with the other witnesses. These objects made absolutely NO sound. No helicopter sounds. No sounds of a plane or jet. No sound whatsoever. They would hover and then move in linear directions, occasionally gaining in elevation. But they would not &#34;bob&#34; or &#34;bounce&#34; as they moved. They traveled a slow but still manner. They seemed to exercise control in their movement. At one point the other three traveled further away and up into the night sky becoming smaller and presumably more distant. At this point two of these orbs dissapeared. They did not fade out, but simply disappeared. The effect was like holding a lit match and then blowing it out. That quick. The third object continued to travel away off into space until it was no longer visible to us. Then the last remaining one which at one point seemed so close appeared to drop three little balls of light while it was moving.  Yet as these little orbs were released they would dissapear maybe 1 to 1 and1/2 seconds after being dropped. Finally this last object  took off up into the night sky and was gone in barely second. According to one of the witnesses who is one of my family members, there were other people along the street watching this event take place. We all agreed it was very strange and that the objects appeared to be under some sort of control. In my opinion, if these were man made then our technology has definitely jumped into the 25th century.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While crossing the softball field at the Renton community center I was taken aback to see two lights in the northern sky which I immediately recognized to be anomalous. They were in color and brightness very much like Jupiter. They were one directly below the other hanging motionless in the sky in an area a couple of degrees east of polaris and perhaps five degrees below polaris. They were separated by one or two degrees. After observing the lights for ten or fifteen seconds the lower light dimmed and disappeared  in three or four seconds then the upper one did the same. I don&#39;t think that these were flares - they did not resemble any flares that I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;m certain that they were not lights on an aircraft. Did anyone else see these things?<n>

My 16 year old daughter and I also observed these lights.  I was setting up my telescope in our front yard to observe Saturn when my daughter asked me to look at two stars behind us.  I turned around (facing NNE)and saw through the trees what I thought were two very bright stars, one above the other, very near to Polaris in the sky. The apparent magnitude of both was brighter than Jupiter.  I began to reposition my telescope away from the tree branches and when I turned both stars were gone.  My daughter reported that they both had just &#34;vanished&#34;.  I am a former Army aviator and these lights did not appear to be either flares or conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the lights might have been landing lights on distant aircraft, although the witness, an aviator, seems to have ruled that out.  PD))<n>

I had a good look at it since I noticed it a ways back.  It was a saucer shape, about the size of two large SUV&#39;s.  It wasn&#39;t movining, it was still in the air.  As I passed it I realized what I had just seen, the epitome of a UFO.  I continued to watch it through my rear view mirror, and just as I was debating on turning around and getting an even better look, the saucer sped off, southward, higher and higher into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(http://www.ufoevidence.org/Photographs/Photo44.htm is almost exactly what we saw)It moved across the sky a smooth, rapid speed and then just stopped and hovered. At that point we moved behind a building for about 10-15 seconds and by the time we got on the otherside it was no where in site, we had plenty of room to see for miles in many directions and was too low to have gone above the clouds in that short of time. There was an airline jet in the background coming in for a landing at ORF and a bird in closer, so it couldn&#39;t have been that high in the air. It was very visible, and distinct...no where near the clouds that were in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were sitting in lawn chairs when I looked up and saw a dark brownish-red object directly overhead. The object looked like a tube with each end rounded like a ball. It was undulating and twisting around slowly. After I determined it wasn&#39;t a bird or any other known object I ran into the house to get my camcorder. My wife, who wears glasses was unable to see the object mostly because she couldn&#39;t find it in the sky. It was moving in and out of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I finally found my camcorder case inside I brought it outside and took out the camera, attached the battery and inserted a tape. All of which took some moments. By this time the object had moved off and was further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw the object it was directly overhead and moving in a north - northeast direction. Now that I had the camera I moved across the yard to a spot where I could shoot through the trees at where I figured it would be by now. In a moment I found it and shot the attached video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was still moving to the north - northeast while clouds were moving slowly to the north. Today was a partly sunny day with rainclouds moving into the area from the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My video camera has an onboard automatic focus and it kept trying to focus on infinity during the shoot, thus the image is sometimes out of focus. At one point I pointed the camera down to the top of some trees to force it to focus. As the object moves thru the trees it appears to remain focused. It then dissappeared into the cloud bank. My Hi-8mm camera has a 22x zoom which I had it zoomed full. The video is shakey because of this extreme zoom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a higher resolution version of this file as well as the 8mm tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He said to pull over, and I did as quickly as possible. He ran out of the car and I quickly followed to see what it was about. After getting out of the car I saw two fiery orange balls hovering in the sky above us, seemingly floating along. We watched the balls move for approximately a block and a half before one separated down towards the horizon. It was then we quickly got into the car to chase the other one, only to lose it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness was kind enough to supply some more information on the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional Information below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object never stayed stationary at anytime during the sighting. No sound was heard coming from the objects. Also there was no trail or tail following the two object. An estimation of the altitude of the lights would have placed them at the height the UNBC University was sitting. (so not high at all). Both lights traveled side to side for moments, then split apart. No flames, but the flickering of the lights seemed to be like fire. The objects were moving North-east above Ospika/foothills. There were three witnesses to the sighting. The witness mentioned that he was not aware of any other who saw it at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

Being the curious little man I am I decided to get up and have a look. I was amazed at what I saw. It sounded like a jet but was moving too slow to be a jet, it was moving at the speed of a helicopter but didn&#39;t sound anything like it. There was 2 lights on opposite side both blinking and one at the back forming the craft into a triangle shape. But what really got me was that there was another light in the middle at the front of the craft that was in alignment with the 2 blinking lights. I haven&#39;t heard or seen a type of plane with a flat/straight front. This light was like a flood light causing a visible ray of light directing ahead as if it was searching for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it got out of my view and on the other side of my house. I went into the other room to look out for it and alerted my brother who didn&#39;t seem to be bothererd. I failed to see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then proceded back into my room to see that it was going back the opposite direction taking a &#34;U&#34; turn around my house, red lights flashed as it got far into the distance as it was no longer visable to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Time was 10:30 pm Saturday night March 23&#39;rd, 2004. I was in my back yard. I turned off my porch light, went into my house, noted the time and got my binaculors. I then spent the next 10 minutes observing this object. It moved from the north to the west. It was approx. the size of Venus after sunset. It appeared to be like a bright ball of glowing, gaseous fire/plasma. At the end of the 10 minutes a small &#34;piece&#34; of it came off, fell and disapeared. Before the larger object disapeared it appeared to be going around in a circle and making &#34;figure eights&#34;, like when you play with a lazer pointer on a surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 52 years old. I have lived in the same residence for the last 47 years. I am a high school graduate with some higher education. I have never seen a &#34;ufo&#34; until last year, when I had 3 sightings similar to this one over 4 nights in late summer 2003. As a matter of fact the last sighting occured at exactly the same time (10:30 pm) and started in the same location of the sky, in the north, just south of Los Angeles. I live near 3 airports (LAX, Long Beach &amp; Torrance). I am familar with aircraft at night, this was not an aircraft of any kind. What it was, I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this individual, who is known to our Center, and we find him to be exceptionally sober-minded and credible.

This story was all over the local TV news, as wel as reports of search teams on foot, horseback, ATVs, and even scuba divers in a pond.  No evidence of a crashed plane was discovered, yet certain witness swear they saw the event.  Local TV news stories reported the incident, but since there was no evidence of a plane crash, the vent was dismissed as &#34;What could it have ben, a UFO?&#34; with chuckles all around.  No witnesses actually saw a plane, jut a huge red fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reporting this incase anyone else files a correlating report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It might have been an experimental craft of some kind or it might have been five crafts, I don&#39;t know, but I know it was semetrical as far as the size of all the lights, and the distance between them, my first impression was that they were letting each other know where they were at or making some kind of signal to one another. It was really weired. I finally god back into my explorer a few minutes later, and continued driving, and less than a minute after I had I saw fighter jets coming from my left heading as fast as they could go towards my right where I had seen the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was almost 6pm and the light was still good and the sky was clear.  As we were getting into the car, my wife looked up in the sky and said &#34;Wow, look at those 2 objects in the sky.&#34; I got out of the car and looked to where she was pointing.  There were three round, bright white colored objects (almost like they were refelcting the suns rays) moving very slowly towards the South to Southwest.  They appeared to be very high up, yet were distinct and easy to see.  We watched as they slowly lined up in a straight line, stopped and stayed in the same spot for about a minute, then they moved into a triangle position.  My first reaction was &#34;They&#39;re not planes or jets, if they are helicopters they are very high&#34;  Their appearance was totally spherical, not like any aircraft we had ever seen.  We watched for about 2-3 minutes, and they appeared to be at the same altitude as when we first saw them, so they didn&#39;t appear to be balloons or something like that.  They moved very slowly, almost like hovering, then stopped, then moved again into a triangle formation.  Then after about a minute in this position they spread out into a large V formation as a fourth object slowly approached from the north and joined the V, then stopped in place as the others were.  We stood there in the parking lot of the grocery store staring up at the sky in disbelief for 10 minutes.  The light was then slowly ebbing into twilight.  To confirm whether it was some kind of stellar phenomena, I looked to where Venus was in the sky and I couldn&#39;t see it, nor any other stars or planets.  I looked back and the objects were still in their V formation, now slowly moving south.  We got in our car and drove home attempting in vain to rationalize this to some kind of human created technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stopped to watch the vessel at first it we thought it was a hoax but there were no other people in the area. My friend wen to get closer fake. It got really quiet when he moved closer. The only reason we stopped because our engine died. I could not get a signal on my cell phone so i could not call a tow truck. The actual vessel was a cigar shape wider but flatter than the regular sighting of a saucer. Nothing was emmited from the craft.After about an hour and a half the craft flew east over our vehicle.<n>

We were facing east with her house to my right(south). She told me to look as she pointed towards her house and the tree in her backyard. As I look to my right, south, i saw a bright triangular actually,  wedge shaped light flying through the sky very fast.One solid light. It looked very much like a shooting star because it was flying perfectly straight and appeared to fly towards the ground as a shooting star would. Except I noticed it was very low and had to have been in our atmosphere because we saw it continue until the tree blocked our view except where there were spots through the trees where we could still notice that it was flying  fast and  low southbound, and made no noise, did not leave any trail,. Very strange and suprising. She said maybe it was from moffet field, but i dont know. All I know is that i did not want to be one of these people who reports this shit, nor did i want to after reading 75% of these reports, but i saw it, and i couldnt believe it...there you go..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> sorry -saturday morning at 2:30am- on the 27th saw it about 8 hours ago.<n>

They were appearing to be racing one another but side by side, sometimes crossing each others paths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were quite large, no blinking lights, no sound at all, greyish in color.  When they were positioned just under the moon, they turned sharply and headed south. It looked like they briefly slowed down over the baseball park lights (which were on) and then rapidly headed southbound remaining next to one another but on occassion crossing paths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they were side by side, they were in identical formation and going at the same speeds.  Once or twice when they crossed it seemed they got out of synch but quickly went side by side again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them head south bound until we could not see them any longer from our balcony.  The sky was quite clear, some small, light clouds, temp. approx 73 with light breeze coming off of the bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the crafts were somewhat almond-shaped, with some type of haze surrounding them, moving very, very rapidly.  There were some distant planes in the sky but none of which were moving at any rate close to what these two crafts were going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mrs. ((name deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for your telephone call, and for the excellent report!

I had a small map of the planet alignment that I was holding up and trying to relate Jupiter and Saturn to the left of the Moon.  ((Son)) first saw the objects and yelled for me to put the paper down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They approached directly towards us but underneath the moon and were definitely closer to us than the planets and stars/Moon.  I would say that they were rather large, much larger than a plane that&#39;s for sure but in width especially.  I would venture a guess that they were maybe around an altitude of approx. 40 thousand feet or so, HOWEVER they seemed to pull back and forth quite a bit so maybe at some times were as low as 20 thousand feet and slightly higher than 40k ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They darted up and down and horizontally directly in front of us for less than a minute and then darted over towards the baseball park, where they didn&#39;t go directly over, but went more towards the north side of the park and seemed to almost stop for another half a minute or so.  Almost as if they hovered and then sharply flew north for a moment and then took a serious turn and headed south VERY quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An interesting note was the fact that one of these objects seemed more stable than the other.  One was always crossing the other and seemed to want to stray but was pulled in next to the more stable object. I would also state that they were definitely following the coastline as they headed south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I had mentioned, I have been reading up and found something very uncanny regarding our sighting here, to someone in Scotland.  I&#39;ve copied and pasted the reference....it&#39;s almost identical!  (Source http://www.rense.com/general6/discsspotted.htm)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((#2))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do now believe that the objects may have been as low as 10 -15k feet at points last night.  I did observe some airplanes landing and based on recent flights that I have taken, I would have to say that they were probably at this level at a couple of points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this helps you.  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((#3))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Would it help if I drew you a picture of the objects and the paths they took? I can scan it over to you tomorrow if you would like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((#4))<n> <n><n> <n><n> You&#39;re very welcome.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been reading on your site re: the many sightings here in Florida as well as in the local vacinity in which we live.  Up until last night, I had no idea what was going on down here! I&#39;m amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I use to tease my ex-husband about his &#34;sky watching&#34; and filming.  I will never, ever do that again!  I have tried to make a rational explanation for what we saw and just cannot do it. Nothing makes sense with this (I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard this before though).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was really interested in the one report from a few years back of someone seeing crafts embodied in their own haze: THIS IS WHAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT!  No extra lights; the objects seemed to glow greyish from within and emit a brownish haze that encompassed each.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow, I won&#39;t take up your time here.......I&#39;ll scan over the picture(s) tomorrow morning for you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have a good evening Mr. Davenport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((#5))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Attached is my drawing of what we had seen last night.  If you have any problems w/this, please let me know as so I may clarify.  Hopefully you will get a better understanding of our view from the balcony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see illustration from witness on the NUFORC homepage.

These two things just showed up that are misty grey sorta and looked like racing or speeding together towards us at first and then they crisscrossed back anf forth. They were silent and there was no sound around them there was a brown sorta color or haze around them. They hung out near the baseball park for a minute and they took off and my mom saw them and called me over and they went down to the left together doing the same thing. they crisscross once in a while and then were right near each other going really really really fast. There were no lights on either one of them. They were moving up and down, right in front of us. Last i saw them they were heading down towards Sarasota when i went to get my brother and my grandmother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Son&#39;s report of same sighting.

At first, because it had an irregular shape, I thought it was a plastic bag floating in the wind (there was a significant breeze).  As it got higher, I thought it might have been a kite.  As the object kept rising, it also kept moving closer to me at a slow but steady pace.  I watched it the entire time and by the time it was directly overhead, it was flying about twice as high as the church steeple.  It seemed to be a cluster of metal objects which were very shiny and appeared to have shapes like large flat letters (N? S?) It almost looked like a cluster of mixed metal chairs or picture frames.  The entire cluster, about 10 feet in diameter, was rotating in different directions as it kept moving south. By this point I thought it might be some kind of remote control object or part of some kind of air vehicle that had fallen off.  As it passed overhead it made no noise (that I could distinguish from the general din of air traffic from above).   I gathered up my books and by the time I rounded the church, it was very far in the distance beyond the library. I pointed it out to someone nearby who works at the library.  He had been sitting on the front steps of the church but had been looking down until I came around.  We watched it together for several minutes and could see that it continued to rise and move farther south, rotating all the while.  Maybe it was someone&#39;s science experiment?<n>

I noticed a yellow search light or clearance light rotating on what I assumed was on the top of a tractor on a not to distance hill between me and the lake.  There are two hills creating a spill way or overflow for the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the dark I could not figure out if it was on the close hill (1/8th of a mile) or the far hill (1/4th of a mile).  The object seemed to glide up the hill and sit there for 40 seconds and then go back down the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in complete amazement as to why a tractor with no headlights and only a yellow revolving light on top would be out on restricted government land closed to gas vehicles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed no sounds, not even country noises from bugs and related night noises.  As the object went behind the hill again I realized I was seeing the bottom of something as the yellow revolving lights were on the grass and trees without a shadow of the object.  This realization made me want the safety of my home and bed (I am 47 but the little boy inside me was not going to make the walk to the lake in the dark and figure it out).<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my mind I now know I saw something off the ground as the area is too steep with trees for a land vehicle; also the lights were below the object.  The object glowed bright yellow from the bottom.  One revolving light did a 360 degree turn every second or so and appeared to be scanning the ground for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spillway is rather long and isolated from the half dozen or so houses near by.  It could be used as a landing strip for a small plane.  Very wide and flat and a half mile long .  I heard nothing and have heard or seen nothing since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I asked the neighbor if he heard or saw anything the night before, but he did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> update:  I just filed a report.  Then I went to your tab saying enter site.  I was interested to see a report listed from a air traffic controller stating an aircraft spotted two or four ufo&#39;s outside Omaha going west at 1900 hours on Thursday March 25th.  That could fit my timeline on what I saw.  I said Thursday, rather it was early Friday morning at 3:30.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also got the impression that I saw the object and the object saw me.  We both retreated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have encouraged the witness to attempt to reconstruct the precise date.  PD))<n>

When walking back to the hotel from dinner with two friends from Switzerland that we met at our hotel, the four of us stopped to admire the night sky, so clear in the desert air. As we looked up, our eyes were drawn to motion. Four or five lights, indistinguisable from stars, suddenly moved very quickly in separate curvilinear paths and disappeared. It was a few seconds of motion in total, directly overhead. One in our group said aloud &#39;um, did you see that?&#39; We all had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whereas I&#39;ve seen metorites in the past, they&#39;ve all featured tails as they burned and broke up in the atmoshpere. These lights did not - they simply were dots of light that moved extremely fast and disappeared. This, I cannot explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting occured near the corner of W. Arenas and S. Cahuilla in downtown Palm Springs. It&#39;s been on my mind ever since so I figured I should search out a registry and report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appears to be a dull gray in color. HBCC UFO Research is investigating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photos can be found at: http://www.hbccufo.com/index.php  Received: April 11, 2004  I had an email from a fellow who resides in Trail, British Columbia. He asked if I would like to see some photos of an unusual mark he has on his back. He added his phone number in his letter and I called the man straight away and had a nice talk with him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fellow told me when he was around 9 -12 years old a large scoop mark appeared out of nowhere at the base of his spine. The gentleman said at that young age (9 - 12) he was literally plagued with vivid dreams which were very real to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the mark appeared out of nowhere on his back he was seen by a physician who told them that it looked as if &#34;someone&#34; had taken a chunk out of his back. The man said there was never any pain associated with it and no scaring. The fellow explained that there is a thin layer of skin which is covering the indentation and nerves in his back. The nerves are sensitive to the touch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The scoop mark focused around a very detailed dream of hearing a strange chatter. In his vivid dream he found himself standing in front of his father&#39;s property, which is located in the Creston, B.C. Approximately 40 feet in front of him was a craft which was hovering about 6 to 10 inches off of the ground. It was spherical in shape but flat on the bottom, a dull aluminum in color and had no distinguishing markings on it. He said there was a green glow (a vapor cloud) which surrounded the craft. It made no sound but he did feel an odd vibration the craft emitted. (His example was, if you took your hand and placed it on running equipment and felt the vibrations from it) He didn&#39;t find all of this disturbing at all. The fellow never saw any kind of creatures of any sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the man was in a state of paralyses and all the time hearing this strange chattering sound. He went on to say that he eventually work up laying on the floor in a pile of laundry and to find his socks were wet from what he believed was from the morning dew outside. There were also was small twigs and a little soil laying about the floor. The fellow told me he is still wondering what actually happened that night many years ago. Also he wanted me to know that this was a one time experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the person for the report and photos. More photos are being taken and will be sent along to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Early that night around 7:30 p.m. Jenny and I had seen something strange. The same thing happen the night before and I personally think that it&#39;s because of the planets lining up. It was a oval disk like shaped object that flew through the night&#39;s sky a lot faster than a plane. The object had up to 6 blinking lights that flashed and blinked in a circular motion. My friend Crystal and I had seen it the night before &amp; then Jenny &amp; I saw it the night after. My parents thought I was crazy, but we all knew what we saw. My brother was driving Jenny home but I screamed and made him pull over. It was around 10:15 p.m. when this disk shaped blinking light object was spotted in the sky.

We both commented on how weird that was.  No sound again no lights of any kind. A few moments later we were still standing there looking up to see if it came around again, within 5 minutes, we saw it again, this time flying east to west, straight line no lights, with either the back end or side lite by the moon. Very stable flight no wobble or teeter of any kind. This was not a bird (owl/hawk), there were no wings and it was a very exceptionally clear night.  The ship/ object was close enought to see panels and ridges between the panels. I could draw a picture, unfortunatly we did not have a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had steady green lights which then changed to orange, then yellow-white. I tried to get a good look at the craft as it appeared to be only 75-100 feet overhead and about the same distance from the road. It was oddly shaped, about as large as a small house, with 2 irregular-shaped upper tiers. It was somewhat rectangular but had an irregular shaped front I couldn&#39;t make out. I traveled down the road and got out of the car. I could not see it any longer. They sky appeared clear (I could see Venus and the other stars and a crescent moon - there appeared to be 3 pale lights high up in the sky, about where the craft was first seen. I heard no noise (and I was close enough to hear it if it was a helicopter).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This evening at 1900 ((local/Central)) the pilot of an air carrier (heavy) that was under my control reported two flights of two aircraft.  There were no other aircraft in the vicinity at the time.  He said they were 15 miles in front of him at 35,000 feet traveling away from him in a westerly direction.  The UFO&#39;s stayed out in front of his aircraft for approximately 15 minutes until the pilot said that the UFO&#39;s were so far out in front of him that he could hardly see them anymore.  After being relieved of my duties I reported it to my supervisor who put me in contact of the Military Air Defense.  The person at the other end of the phone said that they saw no objects in the area of this aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have communicated multiple times with this witness, and FAA Air Traffic Controller, as well as with the Supervisor, mentioned above.

The more southern of the two was perhaps (estimate) 20 or 30 full size passenger plane lengths ahead of the other.  Due to the formation I kept looking to see if there was a 3rd object where one would expect it be (the 3rd point in the hypothetical triangle) but there certainly was not.  I also kept looking between the two discs to see if they were connected by anything visible, but again, nothing but the cloud above them was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could hear various air traffic above me that evening but not see any airplanes as the clouds were quite low, yet these objects were beneath the cloud cover.  When they were a fair distance away from me and I had a more &#34;head on&#34; angle view to them I noticed they appeared to be gyrating in the manner in which a bullet travels down a barrel of a gun (tight spirals) as it moves forward.  Eventually they just became too far away to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely ((name deleted))<n>

It was extremely large, possibly as large as a football field. It was definitely much too large to be an airplane. Neither of us have ever seen a UFO before and we both were shocked at how big this flying object was. We observed it flying fairly low, just over a residential area near Phoenix and then disappeared behind some mountains. We did not make a report to authorities but still we are in awe over what we saw. We are both educated individuals and not the type of people to make something like this up. My husband did observe the object through binoculars but I just observed it with the naked eye. It was enormous and had many colors changig on it from red, blue, yellow, green etc. We know there have been lights reported in the Phoenix area that were V shaped, but this was a long tube of colored lights. Fascinating!<n>

She awoke about 4:45am as she occasionally does and as she looked out of her bedroom window, she saw a bright orange ball she described as a basketball, hovering above the road approx. 75 feet from her bedroom window and about 20 feet off of the ground. She said it was motionless and was kind of fuzzy around it. About 5 seconds later it just vanished completely. She lives 20 miles east of me in a rural vicinity with a neighbor living across the road from her. The neighbors house is on a small hill and above hers, yet this object was below the neighbors house with the hill as a background. It was also completely dark at this time of the morning. She has observed a similar object about a year ago moving fairly fast northward across her hay pasture in the late evening. Neither her or myself knew of each others sighting until she told my wife later in the day on 3/25/04. Needless to say i was astounded!<n>

My cousin was riding passenger when he pointed out two large, white lights, considerably low to the ground, with nothing flashing or blinking on them. The light coming from these was steady and very bright. There weren&#39;t any beams of light, and the sky between the UFO&#39;s and the tree line could be seen, with nothing above or beneath them. I slowed down and my cousin rolled his window down, and we heard no sound coming from these objects. I told my cousin to grab my digital camera from the glove box, and as he turned around to film what we were seeing, the objects in the sky were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We opened our back door and could hear a sound that was pretty loud and appeared very close but could not see anything unusual. We could hear dogs barking in the distance. The sound was like a 1950&#39;s movie UFO sound.  The sound was kind of a wobbling sound.  I told my wife to get the camcorder out and she bought to me and I taped the area and you can hear the sound along with my voice. The camera battery went dead as I stepped out to our deck when the security light came on. The sound suddenly stopped when the light came on. I told my wife to go turn the light off and I heard the sound again shortly but sounded like it was farther away. I did not hear it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request a copy of the audio.  PD))<n>

It passed directly over our vehicle as we were driving due south.  We seen it initially comming towards us about 2 or 3 miles away.  I said to my fiance, &#34;look, theres a UFO&#34;. In jest at first because we are both sky-watchers.  I said this because I am not used to seeing aircraft with dominate blue and green lights on it.  There were 6 lights visible from the bottom of the craft. Two lights 1 blue and 1 green that were dominate.  There were 3 yellow/white lights about 1/3 as bright as the green and blue lights. Also a slightly fainter red light. The red light was on the leading edge of the triangle at the apex.  2/3&#39;s of the way back to the base of the triangle were the green and blue lights nearer to the edges.  At the base were the 3 yellow/white lights located centered on the base between the green and blue lights. As it came closer and then right over us it was very clear that this was not a helicopter because my best guess would be that it couldn&#39;t be more than 1200 feet in the air and there was no sound.  I seemed to be going no mre than 80 miles per hour.  I turned around to follow it and kept up pretty well at 50 MPH. I was in a residential area and soon had to stop.  We stopped abd watched it for several minutes and seen 1 helicopter going from SE to NW seemingly going towards this object.  There was also another helicopter going directly N and to our left that seemed to be headed in that direction also.  It was very easy to hear and see that these were helicopters as we were stopped now with the windows down.  As the object in question reached about 5 miles to our north it started to change direction to more northwesterly as opposed to NE.  It made a apparently very slow turn, but as I was so far to the south of it.... it could have just been the distance that made it look slow.  Ater that we were unable to see the object.  We decided at this time to go back to our home! I am former Air force and have a better than average knowledge of aircraft and their characteristics... this is the first time I was stumped ;)<n>

At first, I thought it was just an air plane, but then my husband noticed it as we were backing out of the driveway and asked me if I saw that strange light in the sky.  We then noticed it was a diamond shape with small beams of light shining out of it from both sides.  As we traveled towards our home in Lynchburg, about 14 miles, it got even brighter then we noticed it started to travel away from us as it got dimmer.  I also noticed a small puff of smoke just when it started to move away. We watched it even after we got home for about 5 more minutes as it traveled further away from us.  Then about 10 minutes later we looked out at it again and it was as small as the other stars in the sky but it was very red at that point.  Then about 15 minutes later, it was just gone.  We are not sure what exactly it was, but it was definitely a diamond, very bright, unlike anything either of us has ever seen in the sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness does not indicate the direction they were looking, but her description is not inconsistent with a sighting of Venus, we observe.

In the NUFORC note at the bottom of my report it said that I didn&#39;t indicate which direction the object was.  It was spotted toward the west.  Also, NUFORC said that my description was not inconsistent with a sighting of Venus.  I thought that also, but what concerned me was that the object was VERY MUCH brighter than I have EVER seen Venus, plus the fact that it just disappeared after about 30 minutes.  Also, the next night, Venus was not in the same position in the sky.  The star or whatever we saw was down lower to the horizon and a little more towards the north than Venus. I&#39;m not saying we saw anything, but it just was a very strange sight, unlike anything I&#39;ve seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had headed south and had made 3 stops to call some 15 minutes each time. I have been around and in this wash all of my life, I ride my quads with my family in it 20 or so times a year. I know every bend and every part of that area. On the 4 stop while still moving south slowly I saw thur the tree&#39;s 2 light that appeared in the sky just ahead of us. They weren&#39;t there a few minutes ago but they were there now! Eric stopped the truck and we all got out and watched the lights. that were perfectly still bright yellow orangish color and very big. I know this area there is nothing out here except a few high line wires but these light were much too high to be the lines and I know they dont have lights on them anyway. I climbed up onto the truck and looked at the with a rifle scope and couldn&#39;t see anything except lights. I am a Vietnam veteran and I know chopper lights and chopper sounds.these were NOT choppers. I have shot flares off hundreds of flares in Vietnam. Flares swing down and leave a smoke trail.These lights were NOT flares. As I stood on the truck I could see the ground was lit up under them I couldn&#39;t see any lights from them but the ground was Illumated anyway. I estimate we were at least 1/2 mile from thse lights maybe more its had to tell at night. the boys got real scared and wanted to leave so we started the truck and headed back the way we came. as we were traveling north up the wash Eric the driver saw these two light go out! we stopped and looked again then they came back on. As we watch them again I now saw another light to the west of them across the wash several miles away. Then the lights went off again. We headed ! north again stopping at a fence gate as I got out the lights had came back on for the third time and were in the same place. We left the wash and headed east toward sun valley parkway watching these lights all the way. As we approached the highway we stopped and looked thur the scope again to see if we could tell what this was.We could see very clearly the light of the Palo Verde power plant to the west of the lights. I tried to pin point where their location was and the best estimate I have is east of the power plant and west of White tank mountains. I dont have any other explanation other than this was a UFO..I have elmiated all possible causes in my mind.Planes,choppers and flares. as we drove north we saw these lights untill the road went around the mountain and we couldn&#39;t see them any longer. I wish I could have talked these scared boys into going south on the highway to get closer but they were just to shook up to go.  this must of been a UFO!! I have who friend asked me to put this on here. It is very interesting there was another report about these lights on the same date and almost the same time. Thanks for listening John<n>

Noticed a chevron shaped formation of 3 amber bright lights.  The chevron was aligned east to west and pointing north.  The object seemed to be about 1.5 miles south and about 1500 feet up.  I stopped and got out to get a better view and could tell the lights were stationary in the sky.  The lights were the color of yellowish street lights, but were about three times as bright.  After a few minutes, the lights dimmed and blinked out from east to west one by one every 15 seconds until I could see no more. The never altered formation or even moved.  If I had held my fist out to measure the width, I would guess it to be about eight fists wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please note other reports of yellow lights from AZ.

I am a retired healthcare professional, and he is a supervisor at the local Naval Aviation Depot, and is very proficient at identifying both commercial, private, and military aircraft.  He was unable to identify this object. It was a very large bright yellow/amber spherical light, appearing to remain stationary southeast of us, and fairly low in the sky.  It did not appear to pulsate.  It was too large to be a conventional aircraft, or a star.  About 2 minutes into the sighting, a smaller sphere of the same color appeared to drop out of the bottom of the larger sphere, and then it stopped moving, and after another 10 seconds or so, it just &#34;winked out&#34;.  The larger object remained visible in the same location until trees blocked our view.  The weather was clear at the time of the sighting, with excellent visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was at new cut road in louisville ky. I saw this thing and got out of the car, this craft was huge, It was approx. 1-1 1/2 miles away looking at a 45 degree angle, so therefore, if I had to guess, it was approx. 2 miles from ground zero. Had 4 lights that was visible, 2 on the top and 2 on the bottom. Flavor was unidentifyable. It was moving unidirectional W-NW. The weather was clear, no clouds at all. Temp was at 32 degrees. When I was out of the car,I heard on sound at all. From considering the distance and the size, from the bottom, it had to be at least 300 yards long, top was possible 1/2 that. This had to be the mother of the mother ships. This was not a plane, bird, chopper, or a fly on my windshield, I know what I saw. These were not local boys for sure.

I just figured it was a new construction site that had just gone up the day before, and someone was building a new factory or something. when I arrived at the same hill and looked south, there was nothing at all.I slowed down and looked as well as I could at the whole area...nothing. that was a few weeks ago , I still go that way every other night and havent seen it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned immediately to look at it. It was bright green and more of a cylinder than a ball ( like a ball elongated to twice it&#39;s diameter best describes the shape ). It appeared to be travelling at a phenomenal speed but it was difficult to tell how far away it was. It seemed to be travelling in an arc like it may have been following the earth&#39;s curvature. It disappeared from my view when it seemed to dip behind some buildings on the skyline. The speed and the colour really made an impact on me, hence this report. I have never seen a &#34; UFO &#34; before and have never been a great beleiver in them either but I cannot dey what I saw.<n>

I was facing in a NNE direction and the object was moving in a SW direction.  At first I took the object to be a distant airplane, as we live approximately 94 nautical miles from BWI, DCA and IAD and am quite familiar with how approaching or cruising airplnes appear in the night sky. There was also air traffic in the vacinity that evening, so it was easy to make a quick comparison. But as this object moved and appeared to get closer I could see no individual strobe or marker lights. The object also seemd to be lower than a typical cruising or approaching airplane would be for our region. Due to the distance of the object I could not confirm any presence or lack of any sound. It was at this point that the object, which had a steady luminosity, abruptly and un-nervingly dissapeared. I continued to scan the area of the night sky for its reappearance, but to no avail. It is possible that it may have been a small airplane departing from Doersom Airport, outside of Gettysburg. But wouldn&#39;t small aircraft still be required to have strobe and marker lights? I would like to know if I have mis-identified a known object, please advise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light reminded them of a &#34;beating heart&#34; and it would go out, only to re-appear in another part of the sky. These drivers have been driving this same stretch of highway for years and have never seen this object before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night, the object re-appeared in the same location and followed them again but this time the object had a small green light on the bottom of the red pulsating one. As soon as they reached the I-40 exchange, the object &#34;blinked out&#34; and was gone. Witness #1 was a crew chief on a B-52 Bomber for many years and  assures us that this object was no conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Directly at the zenith of the sky, this object caught my attention. It was a dull, fuzzy orange color, the shape and size of a basketball, perfectly round, moving from east to west making absolutely no sound. There was also no visible contrail such as a meteor would leave. It was about 50 feet above us. The sky this night was absolutely clear and the weather was mild, about 40 degrees F. From the point in the sky that I noticed it to the time it went over the roof of my house (the roof being approx. 45 degrees up from the west horizon) took approximately 3 seconds. There were no aircraft visible at the time of the sighting, nor afterward. My wife was facing the opposite direction and never saw it but apparently by the look on my face she knew something strange went over us.

We looked at the formation for a minute while it stayed stationary, and then the top brightest light began to move. It passed the car and changed position from the right of the car over to the left. Once we looked back at the remaining three lights, the next top one moved a little to the right, flew straight up, then disapeared into the sky. After driving a little while longer, we were shocked to find a number of blinking lights surrounding the car. After a short amount of time, the objects disapeared, and we noticed we were being followed by a mysterious car. The car&#39;s headlights were so bright it caused my friend and I to comment on growing head aches. When we slowed to allow the car to pass, it came to a stop, and eventually fell behind us. The whole event lasted about 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was silent and fast, really fast. It was clear or see-through (&#34;cloaked&#34;?). But, you could clearly see the shape of the triangle because 3 dim lights outlined it. Everyone we told acted like we were seeing things. It was nice to connect with this site to see others share our experiences. At the end of December, we also saw a bright object move slowly and then seem to turn red, orange, and fade away. It was in the sky for over 5 minutes. Many of us saw it that night. We were outside at a party. It happened in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

It was not lit up, it seemed almost as if the reason I could see it was from the reflection of the sun or even the city lights. It seemed to be two &#34;X&#34; shaped or square but were on an angle looking and there was two of them, almost diagonal to each other, but very close to one another, and there could have been something I couldn&#39;t see attaching the two, and it could have been only one, with two X square shaped edges. They seemed to &#34;wobble&#34; as if hanging off a string and were an reddish-orangish color, going in a straight &#34;wobbly&#34; direction right across the sky towards the east. Going much faster than any plane I&#39;ve seen, but not as fast as a falling star. It seemed to be in outer space, but yet didn&#39;t seem as high as planes go at 35000 feet, either it was much bigger, but I&#39;m sure it was much closer. Then before disappearing over top a building, it&#39;s almost as if it vanished, or turned off and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>

The very odd thing was that there were a fixed formation of three lights, that traversed the sky almost directly overhead from wnw to ese over a period of about 5-10 minutes. The lights formed the shape of an isosceles triangle, or Grekk letter Delta rotated anti-clockwise by 45 degrees. I would estimate that the lights that were furthest apart from each other (which were in &#34;line astern&#34; formation) subtended an angle of around 5 degrees from where I saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve checked with the database of satellite tracks at www.heavens-above.com, and none match the track and timings of the lights we saw for our latitude and longtitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think these were aircraft. There was no noise, and no other navigation lights were seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not shooting stars. the lights were steady, and moved far too slowly and were visible for too long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My opinion is that these objects were outside the earth&#39;s atmosphere. They appeared exaclty as satellites do in terms of speed and appearance, but the unique issue was that the lights were multiple and held exactly the same relative position throughout the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a qualified private pilot, and spent nine years with the British Army. I would consider myself to be very level headed. I fully expected to discover a rational explanation for these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could be that these were an array of three satellites which may not appear on publicly available listings.

And this was not a horizon to horizon sighting. I first spotted the lights as they were just east of Polaris, and we both lost sight of them as they were about 45-60 degrees above the horizon slightly North of due East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside in our garden having a cigarette, and as I often see satellites during my nicotine fixes(!), I was idly scanning the night sky.  This was at 20:01 GMT (I&#39;d just finished watching a TV show that ended at 21:00). When I saw the lights, it took me a minute or so to grasp the unusual significance, and then I dashed indoors to get my wife to come out and see them too. She followed me out, and we spent a good couple of minutes watching them before they slowly faded from view (I assume because of the particulates in the air and the reducing angle to the horizon).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for the heads up on NOSS - checking the www.heavens-above.com database indicates that NOSS 2 or NOSS 2-1 are likely suspects, as the ground track and timings fits very well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for helping to solve the mystery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards from across the pond,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with the witness, and we suspect that he is an exceptional witness.

Also the item seemed to go dimmer and the bright. ( pulsating) and sometimes you could see a red  light and a light blue light.  That night I called the Woodward County sherrifs office around 11:00 pm.  to file a report and was not taken seriously.  I asked the dispacter to send a Sheriffs depauty to the location I was at.  They told me they would let inform them and if they where not &#34; busy&#34; they would send someone out.  They never showed up.   Then the next night I looked in the sky ( March 21, 2004)  and saw the exect same thing.  My wife and I where the only two to see this object. we where also the only  two people looking. We saw the same thing as the previous night.  However the object moved around like a laying down number 8.  It also zigged zaged numerous times.  but nver moving more than two inches in the sky as seen by the necked eye.  The object was located by what I would call the little dipper.  Look at the panhadle of the little dipper and move two stars over that are in a staight line and up.  Only bright looking star ( the rest look dim and only star the looks like it is pulsating in color.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Sirius is what the witnesses were looking at.  PD))<n>

My view was to the southwest, and the entire southwestern sky lit up. A good portion of the sky was lit up, well above the horizon. The houses and trees across the street were silhouetted. I&#39;ve often watched summer thunderstorms approach our city at night, and tonight&#39;s flash was easily many times brighter than any lightning flash I&#39;ve seen. I took a closer look outside and could clearly see stars and the last of the twilight from sunset an hour and 10 minutes earlier. There was not a cloud in the sky, although infrared satellite imagery currently (10:30 p.m.) shows light cloud. I checked my watch after scanning the sky for about a minute and saw that the time was just approaching 8:35.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes after the event, I saw a neighbor walking along the sidewalk in front of our house. He seemed to be gazing at the sky toward the southwest, but he disappeared down the street before I could go and talk to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a cellular telephone tower and a hydro substation, both about 3 km away, in the general direction that I saw the flash. I have seen nothing on this evening&#39;s news to indicate that they were involved in any mishap. There is nothing on the Environment Canada web site to indicate a lightning strike. Perhaps it was a meteor. I once saw a meteor create a brilliant flash in daylight when I was a child, and tonight&#39;s event was somewhat similar. Whatever it was, it was really bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the fireball seen over Canada.

The area howver does have heavy aircraft traffic with Pgh. Int. airport to the north and Morgantown, WV regional airport to the south, but the aircraft are easily identifiable in our location.

It has increased in frequency and because of other events in conjunct with this, I am beginning to suspect other aspects of these &#39;sightings&#39; might be in effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading out to the garage to get a tool when I had this &#39;hunch&#39; or sinking feeling about the night sky. I almost felt panicked, something I haven&#39;t felt since I was young boy and it was exactly the same feeling, specifically a feeling of being watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The temperature had dropped significantly, clearing the night sky for some good star viewing this evening. I look at the night sky each and every night, as well as study astrology and do some amateur astrononmy, so I am VERY aware of the placement of Venus, Mars and Jupiter and their present locations in the evening sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I first thought to be Venus, was a bit too high yet in the sky for 8:25pm. I looked at it and kept looking at it, and thought it was odd that it looked to be as bright as it did back in late February, when it was much brighter. I continued to look at it and then it did the unexpected, it faded into a very faint dot, and then disappeared. I let out a laugh and said, &#34;I knew it...&#34; With that, I looked DIRECTLY above my head, 90 degrees, 12 O&#39;clock and saw 2 more bright &#39;dots&#39; or orbs&#39; which were flying in an echelon right formation, heading due east. I yelled out, &#34;I SEE YOU!&#34; and with that, they faded from bright to dim dots and continued on their flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tracked them for about 30 seconds until I couldn&#39;t see them anymore and if ANYONE who looks at the light sky knows about simply watching planes, you can see a plane head on and notice lens flare, which catches your attention at first, then you know it&#39;s a plane of course when it approaches closer and then you usually can continue to track it as it heads out in ANY direction thereafter. No, these things were bright looking stars, lower than real stars or satelites even, then turned into dim dots (which then made them look more natural like stars). I hope this makes sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the most interesting part. I looked back in the direction of the first object and as I looked, it came &#39;zooming&#39; back into full brightnest from being merely dim. This is NOT my first experience and in light of recent events, I anticipate these events to be more frequent and spectacular. I will try to keep my camera on me more readily, but I thought I MUST report this just in case someone else took notice of any of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for letting me contribute this...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We continued to look at the &#34;plane&#34; and realized it couldn’t be a plane because it was to bright.  At that time the flying object flew straight down as if it were going to crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is when I saw the 2 very bright (like Halogen lights) on either side of the object and the shape was a triangle.  The weird thing was it was clear or it did not have a middle (only the outside shape of a triangle).  It continued to go straight down for a couple of seconds then did like a U-turn and started flying (right above the tree line) the same way it did before it flew down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it did the U-turn and it was flying horizontally. It hovered over the ground then went straight down and landed.  We could see where it landed though the trees.  All we could see was a very bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned around at a gas station and went back.  We turned down a dirt road, which was really a cemetery.  We got scared and didn’t want to go into a dark cemetery so we turned back around and started driving the way we were originally driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could still see the bright light though the trees. I turned to say something to my friend, looked back and it was gone.  Just like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know how it went out or where it went. All I know is what I saw was not a plane. It was in a triangle shape with two bright halogen lights on either side.

It had just gotten dark and we noticed what we thought was a plane above the trees on the road.  My friend mentioned that it was really low to the ground and I said, it was probably near an airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two very bright, square lights on it.  Then it looked like it was going to crash because it was heading straight for the ground and then it would even out.  Then the next time I looked at it was hovering straight down, slowly to the ground.   It was close enough to see the bright lights, they were separated and I it was not a normal shape, kind of like a triangle, but not close enough to see in detail so we decided to turn around (it was about ½ a mile until we turned because it was a highway) and we went toward the lights, on the same route, which we could still see through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then turned on the nearest road to the lights, and discovering it was a cemetery I decided that were not going to drive around in the middle of the night, so we turned around and went back on the road to see if we could just stop on the side somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 45 seconds after we turned around the lights disappeared, or turned off.  I was not going to submit anything until I saw a similar sighting just 12 days before in Kansas.  I have never believed in this before, but what I saw was not something that I normally see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she seemed quite sincere to us.

Very rapidly it traveled closer to us, then we clearly saw a huge, grey flatter object that was circular above us and flying over our house, we ran to the front of the house but it flew very fast away, making no noise.

It was lower then a plane but to high to be balloons. There was no sounds or lights, it was dull gray in color, camoflaged with the night sky. It looked like it had a vibrating or magnetic aura coming off of it.  It moved slowly in a straight path Eastward then disappeared into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was clear and warm, and there wasn&#39;t any wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We saw a chevron shaped (that&#39;s v shaped) object moving slowly across the sky.  It was about two or three inches across in my visual spectrum and seemed to be very high, at least 10,000 ft if not more.  it looked like 7 dim lights in a v formation with one more in the center.  the lights were just bright enough to see but not bright enough to really catch your attention. i just happened to catch the movement.  It was so big that I&#39;m sure it was not a jet, and it was completely silent. it seemed to be leaving a wake of  light trails behind it that resembled heat inversion or the waviness you see when pumping gas on a hot day.  it moved very slow as if it were &#34;floating&#34; rather than flying.  one of my girlfriends co-workers saw the same thing from across town so I can safely say that my friend and I were not just &#34;seeing things&#34;.  it looked exactly like the &#34;phoenix lights&#34; phenomena that was witnessed in colorado springs and arizona in 1997.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we got out of the car my son pointed up and to the west of the house and said &#34;What in the heck is that&#34;? I looked up and quickly said &#34;It&#39;s a Star of course&#34;. My son then said &#34;That&#39;s the brightest star I&#39;ve ever seen&#34;!  I then took another look and my son was right. This object was far brighter than any other stars in the sky. It was a clear night. We watched this object for a minute and I could see individual lights on it that slowly rotated as the object would sway from side-to-side and move up and down in a gliding motion. I tried to tell myself it was an airplane, but many airplane passed by in the night sky and this objedt was far larger and brighter than any plane. The 4 or 5 lights on the object were white in color sometimes showing a redish light. It hovered around in one place in the sky slowly moving downward fro qbout 2 hours before I lost sight of it as is seemed to travel off into the distance towards the town of Colusa maybe. My son got scared and went in the house after watching for about 5 minutes. I got a little scare to when I realized that this was not a plane or a helicopter. This object was maybe 2 or three miles away (Hard to tell exactly).  It was silent as it hovered. Even more strange, another object &#34;entered&#34; the atmosphere high above in the sky while I watch for about 2 hours. I noticed the object above moving across the sky just like a satellite (a small blue dot) but then the &#34;satellite&#34; suddenly grew about 10 times in size and turned a bright yellow-orange color for about one second, and then returned to a small blue dot continuing to travel across the sky. This seemed to me to be something entering the atmosphere but could have been unrelated to the larger object I was watching.  I can&#39;t explain what this object was no matter how hard I try. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before. The battery on my camcorder was dead so I could not vide! otape th e object. I am a mechanical engineer and my son is a 7th grade student.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It stayed with us as we drove west   to east &amp; was as high up as a very high jet but silent. In driveway, I went to my husbands&#39; open door window &amp; pointed up at about a 70 degree above horizon in a SE direction as I faced south now &amp; it had stopped moving when we stopped. I said &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;  The dog got in his lap &amp; stuck her head out the window so he couldn&#39;t see a thing.  I opened the door, the dog jumped out, my husband got out, I pointed up and said, &#34;That!&#34;  But before he could raise his eyes, it disappeared into the east horizon as a red light speck..out of sight!  It had to go thousands of mph to do that!! It was like it heard me trying to show it to my husband that clear, starfilled Saturday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

My last report was on 1/17/04, but i have seen this object on a total of 3 times. well on 3/20/04 between 6:30pm and 6:45pm my son, who also witnessed this sighting twice, ran into the apartment and said &#34;the same object is outside again dad&#34;, I ran outside this time my wife was a witness and to my suprise there it was, it was travling from west to east coming from phoenix and tempe to mesa between 8th ave and extention where I live. It was travling at a speed and altitude that a helecopter would travel, the object is about the size of a helecopter but it&#39;s not a helecopter. The object is black and when it&#39;s moving iit seems to be bobbling or flippin continusly, it makes no sound at all. The first time i seen the object on 1/17/2004 it was moving very slow but on 3/20/04 it was moving fast and coming straight for us, I was waiting for it to past over us to see under it and to see it closer but it suddenly stopped and began to travel upward into orbit but at a slow speed as it did last time on 1/17/2004.The object seems to change shapes from a cigar or oval shape and as it&#39;s flipping appears to change into a doubled winged shape object. about 10 minutes after seeing this my son reported while ridding his bike he saw another one, this one was black on one side and red on the other side when it flipped over. I&#39;m very upset because i had to pawn my video camera back in december 2003. I&#39;m 33 years old and work partime at Skyharbor airport, I often see military aircraft taking off from the national gaurd next to the airport but I have never seen anything like what I have been seeing. Also shortly after the object leaves, on each occassion, a helecopter shows up and seems to circle the area..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were talking and I looked up in the sky and I saw an airplane. The weird thing was that there was another flying object flying perfectly right beside the airplane. I mean it was going at the same exact speed that the airplane was, without moving or turning or anything. The unknown object beside the airplane looked as though it was larger than the airplane and it had a very bright glow to it. But the oddest thing about the object was that, unlike the airplane, it looked as though it was floating through the air and there was no smoke cloud left behind it like all flying aircrafts make when theyre being flown. Which leads me to believe that this was a supernatural occurence and that it was a UFO. After about 4 or 5 minutes the object and the airplane got so far away that they werent visible to us any longer. I wonder if anyone in that plane saw anything during their flight and if their were any reports? It was so high up, I couldnt tell what shape it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was almost as if someone had turned the lights on up above us.  Its short duration first made us think it was lightning, however, a closer look at the sky showed that there were no clouds.  The sky was perfectly clear and the stars were shining bright.  We pulled over about a mile later and got out to look things over.  We didn&#39;t see anything above us but stars.  No moving lights at all.  It definitely freaked us out as this was the first time anything like this has happened to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/19/04 23:30|Bowling Green|KY|Oval|40 Minutes|I am sending you this message to report another strange sighting which occured on Friday night, March 19th, 2004 here in Bowling Green,|3/23/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35764.html|151|ndxe200403| I am sending you this message to report another strange sighting which occured on Friday night, March 19th, 2004 here in Bowling Green, Kentucky at approximately 11:30 PM central time.  Other sightings here similiar to this have been reported several times in the past several years.  This time there was also a female witness besides me, and she too observed the same object, at the same time, as I did.  This is a TRUE story, and we were both surprised to say the least.  This object was really strange.  Anyway, I had been out for a dinner date with a friend, and was driving home when I just happened to look up out the front windshield of my automoble and saw a bright white light with something blinking on it.  At first, I thought it was probably an airplane or helicopter, because Bowling Green has a small airport located there.  Aircraft from our military bases at Fort Campbell and Fort Knox, Kentucky routinely refuel there.  But when I really looked at the object it remained stationary, and was not moving any at all.  The light was round, large, bright, and looked to be about the size of a large bus. A second large, bright, and round red &#34;strobing&#34; light was blinking on and off in the center of the object, and at times there also appeared to be smaller red lights in a row all along the outer edges of the object.  They too were blinking on and off, but not as rapidly as the center light.  The red light in the center seemed to be &#34;pulsating&#34; as it blinked on and off.  As I continued to observe the object, a female neighbor of mine drove up to park her car.  I asked her if she would take a look at what I was observing, and to tell me that I wasn&#39;t &#34;seeing&#34; things.  She did so and told me that she was seeing it too, and that it looked really weird.  We both continued to observe the strange object for close to thirty minutes.  This object, we both agreed, was truly something unusual, and not something conventional.  After more than forty minutes watching this craft, it slowly began to move sli! ghtly lower, but not landing.  We then went our separate ways because it was getting late.  This object appeared in the direction going toward Franklin, Kentucky/Portland Tennessee, leaving Bowling Green.  I have seen this thing before, and what it is I have no idea.  But it is strange and bizarre.  I do know that it is not a tower, star, airplane, helicopter, or satellite etc.  We both DID see this, and we are not making this story up.  Should this not be investigated?  Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the report is of a sighting of the planet, Venus.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information.  How he expects us to respond to his question is not clear to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION, APPARENTLY FROM SAME WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing back to you as a follow-up report on the object I reported to your center.  First, I do not believe that this object we saw was the planet Venus.  I should have provided more information to you, and I apologize for that.  Me, and many others have seen this object before the night reported above.  Some have reported it on your web site.  It sometimes appears as a huge fireball, and it does move and zig-zag about too.  Sometimes smaller objects can be clearly seen underneath the larger object flying back and fourth.  At times the red lights are clearly visable on the object, and one time we even observed the craft through binoculars, and it appeared  diamond shaped glowing purple.  This thing even flew directly over my automobile late one night years ago.  I am not making this story up or anything like that.  We have had several strange sightings of triangular objects in this area before too.  I do wish to remain anonymous, but I thought you might want to investigate this thing someday.<n>

Driving west on US route 6 out of Sheffield Lake towards Lorain Ohio at about 35 mph in light traffic, the road is only one lane in each direction and follows the southern shore of Lake Erie, homes line both sides of the road, the ones on our right have the lake as their backyard and are about 200 to 300 ft off the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and one other person are in the first vehicle and a friend was following in another. Ahead on the right is a cluster of trees near the city limits and through that I see a very bright white light appearing motionless. There are sometimes Medical helicopters traveling along the shoreline but this was not moving. As we cleared the trees there it was about 50 ft above the lake right next to a large 3 story house, a very bright white light that appeared to be star shaped but as we got closer you could make out faintly in the light a saucer shaped object with a dome on top and one red and blue light below it, steady not flashing. The light was very intense yet gave no reflection, not on the house or on the ground. Iam still driving westbound in some traffic, I slowed down and want to stop but unless you go into a driveway you can&#39;t. Then the object started moving, pacing us at about 30mph, still maintaining its position over the shore line and going behind houses, yet no reflection on anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked to be about 20 to 25 ft in diameter and did not change it&#39;s appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My feind said be carefull driving, since I was staring at the ufo. All of a sudden a feeling of fear came over me, not just being afraid but near terror. I was driving ok and leaving about seven or eight car lenths behind the car in front because I was trying to make out exactly what the shape within that light was and keeping along side of it. Then I thought &#34;fear,fear what&#39;s with this fear.&#34; Then all of a sudden the fear left and a felling of contentment repaced it. A close encounter ? I couldn&#39;t tell you but remember we&#39;re still going down the road. We were watching the ship the whole time when after about 5 blocks, we made the one traffic light, the ufo started to speed up, just got faster and faster heading in a westbound direction and climbing in the sky until it its light became a pinpoint and was over the horizon. The climb was very gradual as it excellerated away very smoothly, no sound was heard.  The sky was clear and when it was over I made a comment but my friend said nothing. The person following us didn&#39;t see a thing, said he was busy with the cd player in his car. I have sent in a few other reports from my part of the country but never anyting like this. The geographical location is near Avon Point on Lake Erie and I have read other accounts from here. Oh by the way, I downed a drink as soon as we got to the pub.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

But I was on my way to work about half an hour ago and saw a large very bright green object streak across the sky leaving a trail of green behind it.  At first I thought it was maybe fireworks but realized that it was very high and going from the South to the North at a downward angle.  I have seen meteors and such before but they didnt have the briliant bright green glow.  I saw all this about 5 miles North of the city of Cheyenne, WY.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My friend  pointed out to me what initially looked just like a star but as you kept your eye on it you could see that it was moving steadily across the sky and while doing so it was fading to where you could almost not see it but then it started to light up again and glow strong while still moving and then again fade, glow, fade, glow, until it eventually left our sight. It looked like a very distant star but when it glowed it stood out from the rest of the stars in the sky. It was obviously very very distant, further than any plane/satelite/etc. No idea what it was but it had a great rhythmic and steady pattern of traveling across the sky while dimming and glowing, no flashing lights, no noise, and a pretty regular course, no dashing about at different speeds or in different directions. Anyone seen something similar?<n>

The object was mainly white but it was flashing very rapidly from white to red, and sometimes a pale blue. My husband saw very small beams of light coming off the sides. It was still stationary but around 9:40, from where we were, we saw a plane approaching the object and it suddenly moved away. Then it disappeared. We listened intently and the object made no noise. For my part, it&#39;s my second strange sighting. The first time was in Texas in 1980.

I was outside having a cigarette when I noticed a satelite going by from South travelling north. Then I noticed a really bright light coming from the West heading East. It was travelling at a unbelievable rate of speed, I tracked it for about 10 to 15 seconds. Then it appeared to make a slight right turn and just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It did these kind of maneuvers for about a minute. The cloud cover was thick but this was underneath, then it went up. This incident was between the Topeka and Lawrence area of Kansas. I wouldn&#39;t even be posting this unless it was true. Wow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this is government technology then I&#39;m very impressed, but I highly doubt it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I assumed it was an airplane, but the lights seemed too bright and too close to the earth and not moving at all.  I thought from a distance I saw a brief flash or what looked like a spotlight.  As I approached I was able to tell that The lights were not moving at all.  I still did not think much of it, until I saw the lights quickly dim and then brighten again as the object darted a short distance to the right and came to a dead spot.  At this point, I was close enough to see a vague outline of the object against the slowly darkening sky.  Closer, now the object seemed to mimic the classic movie version of a UFO.  Strikingly &#34;saucer-like.&#34; So much so that I did a double take, a triple take and then looked over at the driver in the next lane who was pointing up with a bewildered look in his face also.  As I passed underneath it, I tried to get a closer look through my sun roof only to see a triangular shaped base that was almost reminiscent of military jets, but yet not quite like anything I&#39;ve ever seen.  I have done some research and have not found any known military craft that match what I and the other driver saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stopped to lie down in a clear, grassy patch that overlooked the western side of the park, and Fontana Lake.  I decided to watch the sky, and look for birds, as I enjoy watching birds fly from below.  The sun was bright and there were no clouds in the sky.  I layed on my back, and shielded the sun from my eyes.  I began to focus on how bright blue the sky was, and how there were no clouds at all.  There were several nearby jets, with jet-trails.  Soon, my eyes focused on a incredibly tiny white dot.  It was the size of a period, like this (.).  Just a single white point.  I thought to myself, &#34;that&#39;s incredibly high for a plane&#34;.  There were no exhaust trails.  I watched the point for about 10 minutes, and it did not move.  I closed my eyes, and looked away, and looked back multiple times, and the dot was still there. It was not a plane, for it did not move or have trails.  It was not a speck on my glasses, as I moved my head about and the dot stayed in the same position.  It was not a cloud, far too small.  It was not a star or part of the moon.  The moon was about quarter that night, and it was about 3:00 in the day, thus no star would be shining.  It was not a receding balloon, as I&#39;ve watched receding helium balloons before, and they diminish from sight much quicker.  The only thing I could explain it as was a geosynchronous satellite.  It had the same look, and this would explain why it didn&#39;t move.  However, no satellite is visible during this time of day.  Thus, I characterize it as unidentified.  Finally, I looked away for about 20 seconds.  When I looked back up, the dot was gone, and nowhere in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 30 minuets to dawn yet so I could still make out some of the stars. As I was admiring the morning sky I noticed what I thought to be a star in a unusual area of the sky at that time of morning and noted its unusual color which was an orange pinkish hue.Then I seen It start to slowly move in a northerly direction and thought I was seeing a high flying aircraft as my place of employment is about 15 kilometers from Pearson Int. Airport and we have commercial aircraft fly directly over our building at any given moment of the day. Usually the planes at that time in the morning come in from the west and then bank  south to the runways. What I saw next was amazing. The object I seen quickly started to accelerate north where it met with another similar object which seemed to appear out of nowhere and they both banked hard and fast to the west accelerating and decelerating like they were playing with one another and while this was going on they seemed to wobble and shimmer. I thought I may be imagining things but I wasn&#39;t. They were flying at approximately 7 to 10,000 feet and accelerated more than the speed of a visible satellite seen on a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>

I was sitting in the passenger seat and noticed a bright, white, round light to my left that seemed to be keeping up with us like what the Moon seems to do. The bright light was at the tops of the pine trees......it was not a &#34;search light&#34; because it was too bright and there was not a trail of light like what a search light would have AND we were driving at close to 60 MPH. For a while we thought that maybe it was a stationary light that was shining towards the highway but if it was stationary then why did it keep up with us for about 10 miles??? It no longer kept up with us after about 10 miles...it just started to fall behind until we lost view of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving north on Rt 634 between Walkerton and St Stephens Church, in King and Queen County. I was driving about 45 mph. A bright object approached my SUV from the south and descended toward my vehicle. There was no other traffic. The vehicle was lighted up with white lights. It passed over my vehicle and then slowed. I stopped when this object was about 200 feet in front of my vehicle and about 50 feet overhead. It was cigar shaped with at least 6 white lights. About 100 feet long and 20 feet high. There was no sound. There were small windows along the craft that were also lighted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my 9 mm Beretta from the glove compartment and chambered a round. Then I rolled down the window (it was raining). Just then a really intense light illuminated my vehicle. I shot 3 or 4 rounds in the direction of the object. The light immediately went out and the object immediately disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I an a reservist called to active duty with the Army.

It traveled parallel to the beach and was seen for about 35 seconds from the point first seen and it moved from right to left. It was brilliant and as I had been taking pictures of some night birds I had an opportunity to take a quick picture just as it started to recede from our view to the left from where we were standing on the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The picture is amazing and is one of the most vivid pictures ever taken of a ufo.

It was faint and hard to see.  I could not tell if it was low enough to be picking up ambient lighting from the city streets here where I live, or if it was emiting a faint glow of it&#39;s own.  It looked very .....well it&#39;s hard to describe how it appeared....it looked like a made object, not an animal flying.  It took a very straight path in the sky and traversed the whole sky in around 15 seconds. No sound.  So if it was some kind of craft or plane,  and it had conventional (earthly) engines that we are used to,  it was way too high for me to hear,  meaning that it was indeed flying at some crazy speed akin to 2000 mph.  Weird.  I have never ever seen anything like that before.  The faintness of this object made it even eerier.  I am dumbfounded.  This object traveled in what looked like a nearly perfect north heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 45 seconds after this,  as I scanned the sky wanting to catch sight of this object again,  a second object came into view.  Looking to my north, this object faded into view and appeared to be a shooting star.  It came from the direction that the first object was headed towards.  At first I really thought it was a shooting star and noticed the coincidence of it happening right after me seeing that first object.  The second object seemed to move at the same speed as the first...which was really fast.  The way it faded into view really lended to my thinking that it was a shooting star coming into the atmosphere.  This object looked as such for about 2 seconds,  but then as it got nearly overhead of me it turned red in color and changed course with what looked like a 90 degree turn towards the east.  It then continued east for about 1 second and then faded quickly from view.  I have never ever seen a meteor make a turn before,  I have seen them come into the atmosphere and slow down, turn colors, explode leaving trails of sparkles,  but never eber change course, especially a 90 degree turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this in the sky.  I look up to the sky all the time because I enjoy seeing the stars,  I like astronomy and science.  This has left me a bit confused and in disbelief.  Im waiting for a logical explanation for this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m male, 39 yrs old, and sane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I read yesterday there would be an asteroid you could see from earth so I thought maybe that was it.  I kept watching it and it slowed down.  Asteroids don&#39;t do that.  Then it stopped.  I wanted to run inside to get my coat. As I was going in the back door I had a feeling if I turned around it would be gone.  I took another look at it through the screen door and it wasn&#39;t moving.  I ran to get my coat, maybe 20 seconds when I came back out it was gone.

A short time later a friend and co-worker mentioned that he had seen this C-17 over the Beaver Creek ski area some miles away. As we talked in the parking lot I looked up to see another C-17 coming from the east at a much higher altitude than the first. I pointed the transport out to my friend and we watched it when suddenly we both saw a round object pass close by the C-17 heading north at a high rate of speed. We both were surprised and shocked by this as they appeared from the ground to have come in close proximity to each other. We watched the UFO head off to the north for about a minute before losing sight of it. The C-17 seemed to vanish too, as I looked for it again after the UFO disappeared from sight. My friend, who flew light planes for some years back, said the UFO appeared orange to him , and definitely round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is member of MUFON in Colorado.  PD))<n>

I first thought this is huge what ever it is, it covered both lanes, about 30 ft wide and about 20 ft high with the one lone light on the other lane (east bound) was flashing.  As I got closer, I slowed down, turned off my high beams, I realized this moving  object is not a vehicle, I could see the trucks passing north and south on US41 through the lights, all of the sudden as I got closer about 400 feet away these lights all vanished in different directions, and the red lights went off simuntaneously...as they scattered. this all lasted about 5 to 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone at length on two occasions, and we found him to be quite objective and serious-minded.  We suspect he is a quite credible witness.  Also, we received a copy of the e-mail he sent to the Hernando County Sheriff&#39;s Office, detailing his sighting.  The e-message was sent approximately 33 minutes after the sighting.  The Sheriff&#39;s office reported that the witness is known to their personnel, and that they consider him to be highly reliable.

It was about the size of a dime in the sky, so either it was really big and far away, or it was small and close. However, judging from the angle it dissapeared out of my site, I would have to say that it was at least fairly high in the sky. At first I thought it was just a balloon floating a couple hundred feet in the air at an angle...but then I realized: 1. It was too bright to be a balloon (this was 1am) and 2. it was moving too fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed and looked at the sky for about 2 minutes after it was out of sight and right before I went in saw what looked like a military surveilance plane flying overhead (It looked like one and wasn&#39;t using the normal commercial flight paths).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh! one more thing...The object (unlike planes that fly in the area) didn&#39;t make any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw to my left {east} 2 very bright round red lights in the sky with a small white round light in the middle. The lights where moving slowly.The red lights where pulsing and the white light was more of a blinking. The height was low 80-100 feet.Also it was very foggy out and real dark no moonlight, or stars out.I also saw a faint light coming down through the fog mist. It was small at the top and large at the bottom {like a funnel}.Then after 6-10 seconds in the blink of an eye dead darkness the lights went out.The lights where more like balls then aircraft lights. This was close to the freeway and the lights {before they went out},where moving in the direction of the aep power plant.southwest.Also my car started missing running rough.I have not looked at it yet maybee just a bad plug.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving down main street in Ellensburg Washington as i saw 2 sets of 4 lights in a dimond shape sitting completly still, there where to lights changing from red to blue and back that where spaced dirrectly in the middle of the 2 dimonds.  When i first saw them I passed them off as 2 radio towers I had never noticed.  Once I got closer I realized they couldn&#39;t be Towers because they would be anchored in where a houseing complex was.  I stoped my truck and got out as I was looking up, all the lights started moveing slowly towards I-90 produceing no noise whatsoever, As it moved my radio made static so i turned it off and roled down my window so i could hear clearly.  I jumped into my truck to follow it because I realized I had my camera.  As I was trying to find my camera i enterd the I-90, The craft was dirrectly in front of me about 100 yards a head of me.  The then picked up speed and left me behind in a matter of seconds.  I saw it pass over the horizion in the dirrection of Seattle washington.  I would say that it traveld over 50 in less than 5 seconds.  IF my math is right the craft would have been traveling at 36,000 mph, accelerating from still, to 70 mph, then to full speed.  I took 2 pictures but I doubt they will turn out due to the darkness and the urgency i took them in.  By the way the address below is my home address, I am at college now.  The number is my cell phone so I don&#39;t know if i can take a collect call but I would be glad to talk to an investigator if you would like to speak to me.  I will e-mail the pictures as soon as i get them on my computer(if they even show anything) Feel free to write me an e-mail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness on two occasions, and we found him to be quite credible.  We posted his graphic to the website.  The lights he illustrated are not totally incompatible with aircraft lights, we believe, but if in fact they streaked to the west and over the mountains in a matter of seconds, as reported, the object(s) could not have been an aircraft.

I am from Chicago, and live in a flight line for Midway airport in Chicago all my life, so I know planes, hellicopters, etc, from other things.  Plus, have spent the last 12 years in Special Forces in the Navy, so I know that too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were at the beach late, waiting for the time for my flight out of Ft. Lauderdale, just relaxing and spending time together before I had to leave at 01:30 hours.  We were laid back on one of the life guard tower platforms which are closed and on an angle, unlike those in Chicago, Cali, and other places, where there are stairs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, we had not been drinking; she was just asking when I would make another trip back.  We were looking east across the ocean, talking and thinking, and that&#39;s when a single, orange light caught my eye in the distance.  I asked her, &#34;Is that a light house of some kind?&#34;  But it did not move at all like one would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She looked and we stared at it, and she wondered as well.  It appeared to be off the coast about 3 miles, maybe less, maybe more, but from projection, about 500&#39; to 1000&#39; off the surface, perfectly static in station.  We watched for a good ten minutes when a spot light projected across the water.  I thought first, police, because parks and lake fronts in Chicago close at 11:00PM, and we were going to be forced off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> YES...I looked or trailing and guiding lights, there were none.  It moved slowly and quietly towards us and to the south of us and then just went blank.  We looked at each other and laughed, almost dismissing it, until she looked north along the beach and we saw 5, yes five more of them just hanging there, north, off the ocean coast, and yes, the city was still alive, espcially since spring break for colleges in the country was just starting.  They too hung there, quiet, motionless, however, none shown direct light, only an ambient glow.  3 faded out!!!  Just there, then gone, and then approx. a mile or less away, one appeared and then the other.  No speed, no streaks, just there one moment and then gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were freaked.  We walked up the beach a bit to see; each one looking at the other in quiet wonder and disbelief.  In 10 minutes they were all gone....no flashing lights, no tail rudder lights, no sounds.  Just there and then nothing.  We spent the next 45 minutes in travel, plus the next days via cell phone conversations asking each other, &#34;Did you see what I saw?&#34;  We both agreed that we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not crazy...don&#39;t do drugs, quite intelligent, and however I DO believe in other life out there (only a fool would think this would be made for just only us [hence a lot of wasted space]), but I cannot ignore what I saw.  This to me was a change, and when I would read other people&#39;s stories about sightings and think they were crazy, well, then I must be just as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Take it for what you want, but I was an aero-structural-mechanic in the miitary originally, and did the other thing later...I know aircraft, this was none we have, or anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, that&#39;s it...I don&#39;t know what IS out there, but something more than we are is truly there.  Resubmitting for spelling errors, because when you talk about something most won&#39;t believe or be in an agreement of such, well, once types faster than the words can keep up with.

I wasn&#39;t sure what I was looking at so I asked my friends, &#34;what&#39;s that&#34;? My one frined looked up and saw it too.  It was triangular shaped flying object with 5 amber lights, (four of the lights were on what appeared to be the bottom and one light was on the top). The object was as dark as the night sky and it was moving fast without any sound. It eventually just disappered in the distance.  I have never seen anything like it before in my life and neither has my frined.  I ran home after dinner, went online and found this website.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When she was going around to the passenger side of the car she saw 3 bright lights to the north of us and said &#34;mom, what is that?&#34; I came out and looked, and saw 2 very bright white lights and one smaller one in kind of a triangular formation, but closer than any planes I&#39;ve ever seen. They didn&#39;t seem to be moving and looked fairly close to the ground. I ran in and got my daughters&#39; digital camera, and told my son to come out and look at them too. When I came back, they were still in the same spot. She took a picture &amp; they started moving toward us, so she took another picture. They turned SSE of us, moving toward Ahtanum Ridge slowly. We could see lights flashing, so at first I thought it might be planes, but they didn&#39;t make a sound. We watched them go south over the ridge towards Wapato, then they were gone. My daughter called the newspaper the next morning to see if anyone else had reported it &amp; they said no. She also called the FAA tower at the airport to see if they saw them, but the guy she talked to said none of them were on duty the night before. He also jokingly asked someone in the room with him if he could tell her it was ufos, and they said &#34;No&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found this site tonight because I was still thinking about what we saw, and when i read the reports from Ellensburg &amp; Yakima on the same date, i had to file my report too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I happened to glance NW of my position and pointed at three large, bright lights in the sky. They seemed to be motionless, and almost looked like airplanes, but were too close together and in a triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom ran inside the house to get my digital camera while I stared at them to see if they were moving, but they appeared to be either at a stand-still or moving directly towards me. My brother came outside and looked at them and said they were probably airplanes, but I mentioned that they made absolutely no sound at all, and were close enough that they should have been rather noisy. He shrugged, watched for a second and walked back inside. I took four pictures of the lights, but only 3 showed anything other than colored pixels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first flash of the camera, the objects began to move slowly southward, toward Ahtanum Ridge. There was a large, distinctly triangular object in front, moving extremely slowly, and a smaller craft following closely behind it, blinking red, white and blue. If it had made noise, or moved in a different direction, it could have easily been an airplane. But it didn&#39;t, and as far as I&#39;m concerned, it wasn&#39;t. There was a third one, the same size as the one in the front, following a little farther behind the smaller craft in the center. They were all traveling exactly the same speed, which was also why I decided they weren&#39;t airplanes. When you live in the same place since you were born, you know the air traffic and where it moves. Airplanes don&#39;t fly over Ahtanum ridge unless there&#39;s an emergency or touch-and-go training.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another reason I don&#39;t believe they were airplanes is because of their speed. All the planes I see, flying that closely (I couldn&#39;t give an accurate estimate as to the distance between myself and the three craft.) would make at least a tiny bit of noise. Considering the size of the outer two objects, unless they were stealth bombers, they would make quite a bit of noise. The smaller one, if it hadn&#39;t have been following the others, I would have easily dismissed it as an airplane at a much farther distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they turned left at a slight curve and vanished over the ridge, heading towards Wapato, Washington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mom and I got back into the car and headed north, and upon reaching the stop sign at a T-intersection, heard a car alarm sounding, coming from the left towards the fire station. All of the lights at the fire station were on, as well. The only reason the car alarm took us by surprise is because we live in the boonies and I had no idea anyone out here even had a car alarm. If they did, we&#39;ve never heard it before and we&#39;ve lived here for 18 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I&#39;m not attaching the pictures I took is because my mother sent them already in a previous report. She didn&#39;t know I had filled one out the night it happened, so she sent her own description of the events.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the distance we saw a strange airplane which appeared to be ascending from the ground where there is no airport, south to north. It turned and came straight toward us, traveling west on Alameda. It appeared to be an airplane, flying very slowly and low in the sky, but it stopped and hovered above and to the north of us. We saw other drivers watching, open mouthed at the same time. It seemed to just stop in the air, wasn&#39;t as high as it should have been for the size of the aircraft. It tilted on its left wing, then I drove past it as it was unusual and scared me, seemed it might crash. Looked in my rearview and the girls looked out the back window, but it was gone.

She was heading north in her car and looked up and saw in the blue sky a shiny metallic looking object. It was round and moving in a straight path. She said it appeared to be large and far off in the distance. She wondered why she was seeing this and took her eyes off it... when she looked back up it was gone or had moved behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Probably of no coincidence... she was also as the time just starting to have some emotional problems as she got dumped by her boyfriend. So she was in a different state of mind that what you would consider normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I was about 14 in Lexington Kentucky in the early eighties, my brother&#39;s friend left our house one evening.  He yelled for us to come outside and see a UFO.  When we went out the night sky was full of clouds like I have never seen.  They all drooped down like cotton balls all the way across the sky.  When we all looked up there was this gigantic Orange ball of light moving silently through these clouds illuminating a huge portion of them.  We could only see the bottom of the sphere as it went in and out of the low clouds.  It stayed at a steady altitude and speed, beacuse it was the formation of the low droopy clouds that masked the upper part of the craft.  The craft itself had to be at least 50 yards wide as it passed over our heads.  It also had these long pole like extensions, like spikes, with different colored lights on the end of them.  This event was on the News in Lexington, Kentucky that evening, and hundreds of people saw this thing, propmting lots of calls to the military.<n> <n><n> Hope this little tidbit helps your research!<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1 Question:  Did anyone elso report what I saw on 3/17???<n> <n><n> 2 Question:  Is this a type of craft reported before, because I thought I saw it on a UFO special the other night on The History Channel???<n> <n><n> 3 : I also have a friend that told me him and his brother have been abducted since they were very young...he lives in Evansville, IN if you want me to put you in contact with him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END #2))<n>

There was no noise, and the objects seemed to just be hovering there.  After about 10 minutes of hovering they proceeded to move towards i90 I drove towards the freeway, but never entered watching them, and then headed home and told my parents about the strange happenings.  Later the next day I was talking to my friend from yakima whom had said she saw the same thing she too has reported seeing these things on this site.  There seemed to be either 3 of them, or one large shape.But looked like more than one, and one seemed to be doubly stacked.  There was no sound either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were above the ceiling for at times one would disappear behind a cloud. They raced overhead to the northeast where I lost sight at about 25 degrees above the horizon( neighbors trees). They covered of what I would estimate 120 degrees of visible sky in about 6 seconds. Not a sound was heard. My wife was with me but could not pick out their motion. She also said she heard nothing.

It soon returned in the exact place where I had seen it before, it became very bright, a beacon type light could be seen going back and forth. It became very bright only to shrink to it&#39;s center as if it moved away very rapidly.  This happened 5 times in approximately 20 minutes.  Same location in the sky.  I stayed in the same spot and even went outside to a line of site in line with the position I had inside.  The light was appearing just behind a row of trees, I made certain that the light re-appearing and disappearing was not just the trees getting in the way.  When the light was at its brightest it appeared to change colors on the outer edges from a brick red to an amber yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness.

River Ridge is a suburb of New Orleans.  I glanced over my right shoulder and noticed a group of grayish, white spheres traveling through the air.  They were silent, and fast.  The whole event took less than 10 seconds.  I continued to watch them fly overhead, and just as they did, the line broke formation and formed a triangle with one sphere in the middle.  I noticed as they moved they sort of fluttered, not much though, as if they were being knocked by slight currents in the air.  They appeared small to me, and I probably wouldn&#39;t have noticed them had there not been so many of them.  I will admit that I have never believed in these sorts of things.  I am not a sci-fi fan, or anything like that.  I am still skeptical of what I saw, but I will certainly never forget it.  One more fact to add to my skepticism, I live within 10 miles of the New Orleans International Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting occurred on Tuesday night, March 16, 2004.

On the date/time above, we were on our front porch, enjoying the relatively warm (for this time of year)air. Our porch faces west-northwest and we have a fairly unobstucted view in that direction, free of light pollution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife noticed the 1st set of lights coming in from due west. I left the porch and went out into our front yard. Through the bare branches of the trees I could see several sets of very bright lights, heading roughly from west to east. The sky was very clear that night. The lights were primarily bright red, with smaller white lights interspersed. As we both loolked around, we noticed aproximately 12-15 of these aircraft, moving in level flight, all roughly in the same direction. They were not huddled together in a close formation, but I got the distinct impression that they were traveling together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 of the craft came directly over our house/property. I would estimate that they were aproximately 2-3 thousand feet up, much lower than the commercial (and military)aircraft that we are used to seeing. They were moving quickly, but I was able to discern an aircraft shape and the speed was in line with that of a jet. No sudden movements were seen. What was striking, however, was the almost complete lack of sound. I strained to hear anything and was able finally to catch a very soft jet engine sound. As a comparison, several nights later, I was out walking our dog and heard a jet sound. I discovered the source of this sound at a height that was at least 3 times that of the craft that I am reporting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While this may not sound especially remarkable, the lack of noise, combined with the odd and very bright light pattern was very disconcerting. However, that isn&#39;t the end of the story. As we were observing the numerous craft coming in from the west, but prior to their overflight of our house, my wife suddenly noticed (and drew my attention to)what we took to be a meteor at a very low altitude. It also came in from the west, but at treetop level. Coming across our road, it bifurcated. It was intensely burning and the 2nd piece continued on along my southern property line, appearing to descend thru the trees. It very well may have landed in my back woods, which extend for about 2 acres before coming to an interstate highway. In any event, the &#39;meteor&#39; was very, very close and very, very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time did either of us think &#39;extraterrestrial&#39;, but we did think &#39;very odd&#39;. I would not waste anyone&#39;s time unless it was far enough from the ordinary. Any information on this incident would be greatly appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was dark in colour, but looked distinctly different to any metal i have ever seen before, dark in colour. It appeared to have no jet or any kind of propulsion, but had strange lights down the side, evenly spaced along the sides. These were red and blue in colour. It appeared to be a USO. There was some kind of disturbance around its frame that looked as though the air around it was rippling a bit, like it was bending slightly or something. I reached for my mobile phone but none of the buttons or screen appeared to be working. It works now though, which seems strange. Then it shot off releasing what can only be described as a blast of hot air that blew us both to the ground, leaving my friend with minor bruises to his left side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My name is ((name deleted)), and am presently enrolled at St. Edward&#39;s School in Oxford, SUmmertown, studying Art, Economics, Biology and English Literature.

I guess it was following my car for roughly one mile before it disappeared into the mountains near a large rock quarry.  I rolled down my windows to make sure it was not a glare reflecting my windows, but it became even more clearer and brighter even after that.  I called my wife on the cell phone, and she thought I was playing a game with her.  To this day I can vividly see the object.  It made no noise like a plane either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

((wife&#39;s)) glasses were in hand, but she feels the object looked like a comet, because of a trail behind it. (We have noted that a comet came close to the earth on Mar 18, but not on the 15th). According to myself, ((husband)), (who saw it clearly), I feel there were 2 lights traveling from East to West close together. Both of us agree that it did not move smoothly as an airplane would. I, ((husband)) feel that there were 2 lights traveling slow together, at which point, the leading light, sped up while the other one &#34;hung back&#34; and then disappeared. Very possible that it was a government aircraft given the close proximity to McGuire Air Force Base and the current technologies to counter global terrorism.  Remotely possible that it was extraterrestrial in nature. ((wife)) thinks it may have even been a plane crashing because she noted a downward patten toward the earth. We couldnt find any record of any plane crashes.<n>

A white light caught my eye first from the upper left side of my windshield and proceeded towards the southeast. It was not as high as jet liner traffic and appeared about as high as a cessna would fly, or it was very far away. The sky was clear. This light traveled from the west north west side of the highway towards the southeast until it was out of my sight in about 10 to 12 seconds. I&#39;ve never seen anything fly so fast it&#39;s speed was comparable to a meteorite and I first thought that was what it was, but it had no tail and did not burn out. The light did not flicker or change intensity, it remained the same until it was out of sight in the southeast. I immediately grabbed the cb radio microphone and said &#34;did anyone else see that&#34; and someone else said they saw it also and never saw anything go across the sky so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were planes around the sky and looking up at the small lights of the planes they were moving at the speed of about 1 inch a second, this light moved about 3 feet a second.  The light looked like a big star, but took off.  Let me know if anyone else saw something.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After about a minute, it grew really really bright and then tappered down while flickering a bit. This happened three times in about 10 minutes and I knew this was not a star. I eventually found myself passing almost beneath it, for it hovered right off the highway. I noticed the elevation was maybe twice as high as a communications tower. It wasn&#39;t an airplane, helicopter, or hot air baloon. I couldn&#39;t quite get a distint shape but their were light on it. one white light and 2 red lights. I passed it and thought I should pull over on the shoulder to watch it but I didn&#39;t because of all the cars around me. I wish I had. This is my second UFO sighting. The date is probably a little off. It happened about a month ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw two circular objects streak across the sky.  They were larger and brighter than what I have normally seen as shooting stars.  In addition, these two objects moved across the sky together and then one seemed to disappear while the other continued on straight across the sky until I could no longer see it through the trees.  The two objects were a bright, white, yellow in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving and noticed a set of landing lights pointed west like they were landing at Ellworth airforce base.   After a mile or two I realised they were&#39;nt moving and said so to my companions.  We continued east all the while watching the lights.  When we got to the last airbase exit I stopped the car at the side of the off ramp.  We all three got out and looked up directly above us at this large black triangle.  It was just hovering above us at about 200 feet.  My guess was about 60 feet from corner to corner.  It continued hovering there for about 20 sec. and then 1 corner went down, another went up, and it turned and floated south towards Rapid City Regional Airport where it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weird things:  It was right along side the flight path of military planes landing which is s.e. to n.w.. It was just after sunset the sky was somewhat dark but it was still plainly visible against the light sky.  We were the only people who stopped and I got the feeling they were waiting to see if anyone would stop and look.  When it turned we were directly below and I heard barely audible very muffled jet engines.  When it flew towards the civilian airport it disapppeared.  At first we thought it had to have flown over the airport but after thinking about it we knew that wasn&#39;t likely as there was a plane landing at that time.  The civilian airport is up on a hill which gave me reference height and we believe it flew over towards there and disappeared in front of the hill.  How we don&#39;t know.  It had landing lights on it just like the military and civilian planes all do.  No other lights were displayed.  Distance from exit 59 to the last exit is approximately 7 miles.  It was facing straight west while the landing path is to the n.w..  I think it was a military plane as the airforce base radar surely would pick it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/15/04 15:42|Calgary (Canada)|AB|Formation|1-2 minutes|Spherical White-Silver objects in formation seen over Western Calgary|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44545.html|223|ndxe200403| Spherical White-Silver objects in formation seen over Western Calgary<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking home from the bus stop and glanced up at the sky only to notice a fleet of spherical white-silver metallic objects flying in a V- formation. As they traveled, they formed a straight line. Their flight trajectory was from the NNE to the SSW. This formation appeared to be flying at high altitude, but as it was a clear day, thus difficult to distinguish the relationship between size and altitude. (I estimate they were at above 9000m and appeared to be 2-3mm in diameter when seen from the ground). They made no contrails. They were visible until I got into my house, and when I went to find them a few seconds later in the sky again in the location I would presume they would be in (off to the SSW) they had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a high school student with honours in all my courses, and have been an aviation enthusiast since I was 5. I know both civilian and military aircraft, and have never seen any craft perform or look like these. They were distinctly spherical and white-silver in colour, making no noise as they flew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

While fying a kite, I noticed what appeared to be 3 silver objects that were in the shape of discs.  They were at such a high altitude (25,000 ft.?)it is difficult to describe them in detail.  Imagine a commercial airliner flying at 35,000 feet without a contrail.  But instead of travelling in a linear path, these 3 objects were hovering and occasionally rotated around each other (changing positions).  During their movement, they would also align themselves in a triangular formation.  I pointed out the objects to the person with me, who also witnessed the UFOs.  After about 5 minutes of observing the UFOs, they disappeared.  I am not sure how the UFOs departed, but when I looked away and tried to refocus my eyes on the objects, they were no longer there.  I have researched some of NUFORC&#39;s UFO reports, and the only comparable report I found is the one that occured on 7/19/00 in El Paso, TX, only 50 miles west from my UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/15/04 13:30|Burlingame|CA|Oval|20 minutes|Daylight sighting of squashed football shaped, silver object  just above tree tops in heavily traveled area.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65394.html|225|ndxe200403| Daylight sighting of squashed football shaped, silver object  just above tree tops in heavily traveled area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’d like to first say that I’m 62 years old, and not at all prone to either lying, or confabulation. I’ve not embellished this account in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event took place at approximately 1:30 pm in the afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 4 years ago I was driving  west along El Camino in Burlingame, CA. when I happened to glance off to my left, and noticed what appeared to be a large water tower perched on top of the bluff line. There’s a long row of hills that parallels El Camino…where all the rich folks live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My curiosity was peaked. It seemed odd to me that I’d never seen it before, and also odd that it was even there. I hadn’t seen such a water tower since leaving the Midwest many years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I was driving, while trying to explain this to myself, I couldn’t see it clearly. I was on my way to Albertson’s to cash in a bunch of loose change in their coin machine. I pulled into the lot, and maneuvered myself so I could see the object/tower more closely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then that I realized that this ‘thing’ was NOT a water tower. It was hovering just above the trees, and appeared to have just come out of a very dark, stormy, cloud front that was hanging along the ridge crest. These cloud banks are very common here as this was the last storm of the season.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to get a very good idea of its size/shape because it was so close to the top of the trees, and only a few blocks away. I’d say it was anywhere between 50 feet to 75 feet in diameter. It had a dull, but reflective surface. It sort of looked like old metal. There were absolutely NO protrusions, windows, lights, or any other markings on it that I could see. It was perfectly smooth and shaped like a giant, somewhat flattened football, but with the ends distinctly rounded off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, it began moving…VERY slowly. It hugged the tree tops as it came forward, and down. It moved closer until it was only about two blocks away. It was extremely clear! There was absolutely NO fuzziness about it. There was no noise that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to move down the hillside towards me, and then stopped briefly…still only a few feet above the houses. Then, it began to move to my left. Again, it was moving ever so slowly. I watched it until it went across a well traveled main road, and then disappeared behind a large business building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, all that being said, the most interesting thing about my sighting was that NO ONE else seem to be seeing it! NO ONE stopped to look, and it appeared that no one was even seeing it except for me!?!?  I watched the papers for days afterward to see if it had been reported by anyone else. It never showed up in the papers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another odd aspect to my sighting is this: I’m an avid UFO inquirer, and have been since I was a teenager, and some friends of mine once had an experience that freaked them out. This was  in McPherson, Kansas, circa 1961. So…  …why didn’t I jump in my truck and pursue it? Here’s what I was subjectively thinking/feeling…  That it was trying to lure me, and I felt quite apprehensive/vulnerable. I felt as though maybe this was some kind of test. I felt that I was the only one that was supposed to see it. Yes, I know this sounds odd, but it’s the truth. Instead of chasing it, I went into the store to do my business.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, I’ve only had one other close-up, interactive sighting in my life. That’s another story!<n>

It was deeper and more consistant than a helocopter and not the same as the C-130&#39;s that have a low level route in our area. My wife heard the noise also, and by the time we could realize that it wan&#39;t a normal sound it had faded off into te distance. As bes we could tell it came from the south west and traveled to the north east. We are familiar with the Flight for Life helicopters that cross the area and it was not that sound. Other people in the aea heard the sound also, but most were asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former USAF pilot with 5000 hours, a CFI, and have operated a Charter Air Service.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found him to be exceptionally credible.

I had just dropped off a friend and I called him and told him where in the sky it would be from his house. He said that he saw it but it looked very small from where he was, as i was heading in the direction it was in. The light seemed to move across the sky as i looked at it, but as odd as it sounds, i couldnt quite tell what direction it was moving in. The light seemed to hover and move vertical down slowly then back up. I faintly remember the light fading from its normal white to a sort of red and back again. I came to a parking lot of a resteraunt and pulled over and got out and called my dad for some reason to tell him about it. The light seemed to move inward almost directly in line towards my head, as if coming directly at me. It did this for a few seconds and then moved directly outward from me untill it dissapeared in the sky and i couldnt see it anymore from it moving further and further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

3/14/04 21:15|San Ramon|CA|Circle|one hour and fifteen minu|I filmed starry white objects in sky that I believe to be circular UFO's.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly celestial bodies.

I got a good fifteen minutes of what I saw in the sky. What I saw in the sky were objects spaced apart from each other that looked like stars. Some were up high in the sky and others were moving by the horizon. Of course, where I live I could not see the moon and that made it better. Now these UFO&#39;s, when looking into the camera at them had a circular look to them and one was white another was blue, and the others were pulsating different colors. The white one was just white and it would move to the left and then to the right when my back was turned. It was a very extreme movement in the sky. The blue one was pulsating and it moved very slowly and again only when my back was turned.  Later on in the film I noticed some by the horizon and when I mean some I mean a few. At first I only saw two moving East, and these lights were very bright but faraway. When you look at them through the camera they were white like a ship or pulsating with multiple colors. I then saw one or two more by the horizon moving East. These were to my farther left but were moving East. They weren&#39;t moving fast, and the oddest thing about these UFO&#39;s is that they looked like very small planets but they also were white when zoomed in upon and looked like they had a black spot in the center of the UFO but to the far right of the center but not close enough to touch the end of the circular objects. I know it wasn&#39;t my camera because I saw this on all the bright UFO oblects that I saw. It almost seemed like an invasion! The reason why I say this is because this is the first time I have witnessed UFO&#39;s and I saw five to six of them in one night, and mind you these were perfect circles. These were awesome and I got fifteen minutes on tape. I hope I see more tomorrow night, and the funny thing was that after I saw these objects I still saw the first one when the others were gone and I filmed them all in order of how I saw them, and my Grandpa also! witnessed it but he believes it was satellites but these were bigger then satellites. My camera also stopped zooming in or out at times but I don&#39;t know if that had anything to do with the UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at stars or planets, but we will request a copy of the tape.

It was too far away to see a shape but it was very bright.  We could see what looked like a red light manbe once every 5 minutes or so.  The light was eratic in movement but generally moved to the North over an hour until we lost sight of it above the trees to the north west of our house.  It was a very clear night and the stars were quite bright, but not nearly as bright as the object.  We called my girl friends father who lives 9.5 miles SSE of our location and it was clearly visable to them also.  It could have easily been the sun (which had set) reflecting off an object drifting to the north, but it was very bright and low in the sky.  I don&#39;t believe it was a regular aircraft because of the time duration and it looked very large relitive to the distance it was away.  I took a few digital pictures but I did not have a tripod but I can send them if you wish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses were looking at Venus.  PD))<n>

I live in the midsection of a hill. it hovered above the hill and went behind the otherside of the hill for a while and then came back up. it was moving as a helicopeter would but move like a hovercraft. after it came up 2 other craft apeared in the sky identical to the first. they both went behind the hill slowly. about a minute later what looked to be 2 military jets(no joke; sounded like a jet atleast) began to head toward the my house and hill. seconds later 3 beams of light flashed up into the sky and disapeared. These were not human aircraft. i still wonder about the military jets still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was still daylight. An object appeared in front of me in the distance and was moving in a very fluid manner across the sky. It was silver, elongated and left no fuel trail like a plane. There were two airliners in the air at what seemed to be about the same altitude and they were leaving trails, but the object was not. I kept watching it and then it just seemed to dart straight up and vanish. A few minutes later I saw another object that looked exactly the same. I don&#39;t know if it was the same object as before or if it was a second object, but its characteristics were the same as the first. The second object stayed in the sky moving to the west for just a few minutes and then it darted up and away like the first object. It was difficult to tell the altitudes of the objects, but I would say it was between 10,000 - 25,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were stopped at the stoplight on the Murray courtsquare when we spotted the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at a height of about 2,000 ft, it appeared to be made of globes fit together (sort of like a child&#39;s jack) one on top and bottom,then three or four around the middle. It was a blackish silver with red highlights, it did not appear to be shiny but more of a flat metallic color. The sun was to our rear and right so the light did not obstruct our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to be hovering as its position did not change only our position realitve to it as we continued south. There was no sign of tethering of any kind. The weather was clear and there was a stiff breeze,it did not move as one would expect balloons to behave in the wind. The object did seem to change shape somewhat but it could have been revolving. The object had a field of disortion around it, we could easly see though it but there was a fuzzy  shimmer in a globe around the object. The traffic was heavy and we could not stop to observe it for more than a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went out to take the dog to a field in the evening and while I waited for her to do her thing I observed this brilliant large golden light. It did not move. It sometimes seemed to pulse. I had never seen a light like this over this hill. It was not like some house light or beacon light- it was very large and very bright. I went inside and got my binnoculars and called 2 people to come out and join me on my deck to see it. We all observed it through the binnoculars but could not discern a specific shape as the light was too bright, obfuscating any shape. I went back inside for about 5 minutes and when I came back out it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the witnesses were looking west, as they faced the object, we believe that Venus is a possible explanation.

It was located just west of the Black Hills. As I pullled into the driveway I realized it was larger than I thought and that it was very bright. It had sort of a yellow brightness instead of the stark white you would see in a star. I was amazed and could not take my eyes off of it. I finally called my mom to see if she could see it too. She did! I told her she had to come over and look at it from my house, as I have a clearing that provided a perfect view. I watched it about five minutes until she arrived. Once she arrived we watched it for another ten minutes or so. As I watched it seemed to pulse. We were able to pick out a refernce point right under the light that allowed us to measure the movement. It seemed to sway (or hover) just slightly. I also thought I saw some small lights to the out side of the circle. After it started to sway we noticed that it actually was getting smaller, as if it was moving away. Within about five seconds it was completely out of sight. I checked later but there was nothing. I realized how bright it made the sky, when I went back and could no longer see the hill it was positioned above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the witnesses were looking west, we suspect they were looking at Venus.

I saw it for maybe 20 seconds; my wife saw it a bit longer.  There may have been a wisp of exhaust/smole/cloud where it had been.  We both were dumbfounded.

Then the objects started a Vortex looking manuver, spinning around each other in an &#34;oblong ball vortex&#34;.

When I looked to the east, I saw this triangular-shaped silvery object.  At first I thought it was just a high-flying kite, but it was moving.  I then saw a very distinct circular light on the bottom of it.  (Also in the sky overhead were several commercial airliners and what looked like a pair of fighter jets; they appeared to be plodding through the sky, compared to the triangle.)  The triangle moved in an arc, but faster than anything I have ever seen before.  Also, it would hover in one spot for many seconds, then move on.  My daughter saw the same thing.  She went to get our telescope.  When I tried to get a better look, it just disappeared.  It also had no contrail.  I don&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s, but I think I saw my first one.

It was a clear night and the star were shinning brightly, but the person said this was certainly no star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO called the local airport which is very small to enquire to see if anyone knew if a helicopter or any aircraft was fling in that area on March 12, 2004 at approximately 10:30 p.m. and they said they were not aware of anything flying that evening. I also checked to see if anything was fling on February 27, 2004 and March 7, 2004 and again no reports of aircraft in the area. Both of these dates I mentioned had sightings of unusual craft in the area. I will also be taking a drive to visit all of the witnesses who filed reports to get a better idea where exactly the objects have been seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also while I chatted with the witness I was told of a number of incidents which have taken place in and around Decker Lake and Burns Lake British Columbia. Objects being witnessed by a large number of folks. Some watching an object skimming over the water on Francois Lake and the object was of a large size, silent and glowing. Other strange white/objects making some very fantastic maneuvers in the sky&#39;s above and always dropping down behind one of the mountains in the Grassy Plains area. This is rather interesting because I know there has been a number of cattle mutes that have taken place across Francois Lake and around Grassy Plains. Also strange creatures are being reported from our native peoples.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will also add I receive information from a very credible source who works on Francois Lake everyday, along with others who have reported that the large Canadian Search and Rescue Buffalo had been flying late at night for no known reason over top of Francois Lake at very unusual hours. Some of these witness made enquires to why the aircraft was there, thinking the flight crew may have been on a training mission but there was no information to come forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am starting to wonder if there isn&#39;t something happening all throughout this area and I am certainly going to be spending some time out there talking with residents around the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below is a little on what our Search and Rescue Buffalo looks like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Buffalo  the Tactical Twin from DHC DHC’s Buffalo* was designed to meet a US Army requirement for a fixed-wing tactical transport with a cargo capacity to match Boeing-Vertol CH-46 Chinook helicopters. The type entered Canadian service in 1967 as a complement to the larger CC-130 Hercules. The training of paratroopers was among the CC-115’s early tasks but in 1974 the CF Buffalo fleet was modified for the search-and-rescue role.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rescue equipment, improved navigation aids, and crew rest stations were all that was required to convert the Buffalo from transport** to SAR. Perhaps a little over- powered for their new role, the key virtue of the CC-115s was their availability. The Buffalo had little opportunity to make use of their phenomenal short take-off and landing abilities as SAR aircraft. However, the rear cargo ramp was ideal for rescue equipment dropping, and the paratrooper doors suited SAR-tech jumps just as well. But, the Buffs are aging and only 6 of 15 remain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>

Expecting this object to turn out to be a plane (since a small airport is nearby)did not..I got out of my hottub to get a better look since my field of vision was going to be blocked..there was no sound of an engine, and a strange dark orange glow underneath the object..passing above ground I would say about 500 feet..traveling in a west to east and not going very fast, Either there was enough light coming from aboveground to light its underbelly, or the object itself was eminating the glow,..There were no flashing lights or any airplane or jet sound, just what seemed to be circular in nature, this object was flying close enough that if it were a plane, I would have heard an engine sound or the sound of the wind had it been a plane gliding into land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> \ Something was very different about this, enough so to make me get out of my hot tub and stand in my backyard in my birthday suit to check it out!!  I watched the object until it was out of my field of vision from where I was in my backyard (about 2 minutes.) It was not headed toward our airport in any normal flight pattern that I have observed (&amp; flown myself) for a landing at the airport (redmond airport).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Traffic was very light, and I was stopped at a controlled (traffic light) intersection. I had the sun roof open and witnessed a small (approx 6-7ft in length and half as wide in silhouette) oblong oblect with red and blue lights with no other distinguishing features. It was traveling at a leisurely pace from the north east to the south west. It was just above the tree line (roughly 80 feet above the ground). It passed directly over my vehicle and was completely silent. I initailly disregarded it as a small helicopter but was rather perplexed by the fact that it made no sound at all. It was a warm evening and I had both of the front windows rolled down and the sun roof open. I would have heard any sound that it made above a whisper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then turned northbound on the I-5 freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 22:15 I had run my errand and was returning home on the south bound I-5. As I entered the exit ramp for Del Mar Heights road I caught site, in my peripheral vision, of red and blue lights above my vehicle. I looked up through my open sun roof and saw the same object that I had witnessed earlier directly above, and keeping pace with, my vehicle. This time it was no more than 25 feet above me and again making no sound what so ever. I slowed and it slowed with me. I felt my wheels on the shoulder of the exit ramp and looked back at the road for only a second and looked back up. The object had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was dry with a light marine layer building in above approx 150 feet. The object was well below the marine layer on both sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/12/04 19:05|Columbia|MO|Sphere|90 seconds|Bright yellow sphere of light, changing to white and swiftly moving away.|3/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35586.html|265|ndxe200403| Bright yellow sphere of light, changing to white and swiftly moving away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving north on South Tomlin Hill Road.  After making the 90º left turn in the road, I was headed west at about 7 miles per hour when I saw a luminous yellow sphere. It was about 45º above my line of sight in front of me and slightly to my right, or north of me, plunging swiftly downward for approximately 1 second, north to south, on about a 30º angle. I thought it was a meteorite. I expected it to burn out, but then it became a bright white light and headed west/northwest. I continued to drive west, speeding up to about 30 miles per hour as the light sped away from me. At this point it resembled a star moving away. It diminished in size until I lost sight of it in the still red glow along the western horizon. I thought perhaps it was a plane but I did not see any blinking lights. There was a jet headed east overhead to my left. The light moving west did not seem to be at the same altitude as the jet. My guess would be that it was perhaps at half the altitude of the jet. Tomlin Hill is higher than the surrounding area making it is possible to see a wide expanse of sky in all directions so I never lost sight of it until it reached the western horizon. I watched it for perhaps 90 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in this area and the Columbia Regional Airport is to the southeast of my home. I am very used to seeing lots of aircraft in the area. I am very familiar with what aircraft look light at night. This did not seem like any craft I’m use to seeing pass overhead at night. It moved west much too fast for a small plane. Even a jetliner passing over head would take about twice as long to cover that same distance. For the brief moment it was plunging down it seemed perfectly round with no distortion around its circumference. Even though I momentarily thought it to be meteorite, there was no smoke trail or streak of light. My impression of its color and shape at this point would be like that of the sun high overhead on a hot hazy day, but not that size and more spherical in shape. It initially appeared about the same size as Venus, still clearly visible in the western sky that evening. It did not twinkle or have any blinking lights. The night was perfectly clear with lots of stars and aircraft visible in the area. I don’t rule out that it may have been a smaller jet of some kind flying at a much lower altitude than that of a jetliner except for its swift downward motion when I first noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light cause a commercial airline to flash its headligts, but this object never replied or changed its path. It also made no noise and had no other visible lights blinking or any other colors. Once this odject passed overhead, Im guessing at about 5 to 10,000 feet, it was probably 15 miles away from me heading NE, and its light was eactly the same, just as bright as if it was a ball of light -as bright and big as Venus - as if it was using that look as camo. Anywhoo.. If it was a plane, the light would have vanished when it was past my location as I would not have been able to see the headlights anymore. So, after the flying planet was probably over phoenix, its light dimmed out until it was gone. This was too big and bright to be a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> LATER<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was going pretty quick and was on the horizon and moved towards me and then moved away back over the horizon.

My family and I were hanging out at my Mom&#39;s house. I have a 3 million candle spot light were shining it around the around looking at caves and stuff like that.  Real indian caves but thats another story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I turned off the light a light appeared on the horizon. It was very bright and seemed to move across this hill side. It wasn&#39;t on military property but somewhere on our ranch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light lit up the horizon many times brighter then any car headlight. In addition no car could get where we think the light was coming from and all my years at the ranch we have never seen car lights from this far, they just disapate to fast. This went on for about 1 minute stopped and then restarted again about 10 minutes later in almost the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it stopped for about 30 minutes and reappeared on a mountain called Bald mountain. This mountain is on military property called Fort Hunter Liggett. The same basic thing happened the light was very bright and lit up the moisture in the air. The light went off and then reappeared further west of where it was at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is where it gets wierd, my brother and I know those roads on the base. There is no way to move that far in 5 minutes. So we might be able to believe it was a helicopter but it was on private propery an hour before that. Also why would the military have a light that bright and shine it in the air? The last wierd thing is that there wasn&#39;t any sound. Everyone believes the light was too powerfull to be mounted on a automobile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven&#39;t done a very good job at explaining how bright this light was.  It illuminated the very air it went through. I have seen spot lights at car dealerships and this was much brighter and wider then those lights.<n>

As we looked at it, it slowly started to get smaller in size almost like it was moving away. It did not have a sound and did not have a recognizable shape. It took off at a high speed almost like it was going out to space. It got smaller considerably in size and looked like a star. Much brighter than all the other stars, then it dissappeared. With in about 2 seconds it flashed one last time and was gone. What we saw sounds exactly what someone else saw on this website. The only differance was the time frame and location, but it was close to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont think this object was a plane. It moved to slowly and then took off too fast out of sight.

But we knew it wasn&#39;t a star because it was moving until it disappeared past the roof of an adjacent apartment building. It did however, look as if it was still moving away.

I felt this subject a bit difficult to discuss until I pulled up this website and realized that there are thousands of witnesses to this somewhat unbelieveable subject.  I did video what i witnessed and i hope to share it.  The object seemed to do many things from changing color, shape, and size.  The object had many lights around the spaceship looking object and one larger and brighter light in the center.  It did hover for adleast two hours but moved slowly.  AT times it would move quickly and seem to maybe try to camouflage itself by blowing up or getting much larger.  I must say i have never witnessed such a remarkable item in my life.  It also spinned and changed colors.  There is much more that i could say but i hope this will give you some idea to what I&#39;am describing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the report is consistent with a sighting of a star or planet.

I said &#34;Oh, they&#39;re probably just in the hills&#34;.  She said &#34;No, the hills are way low on the horizon from here, those are very high in the sky&#34;. And indeed, they were.  There were 2 sets of very large round yellow lights.  The lights in each set were equally spaced apart and of the same size. They did not move. One had 5 lights and the other 4.  One set quite a bit below the other and staggered to the left of it.  We both went out on the deck to watch them for about 10 minutes.  Then she left to go inside and try to phone her son who was studying in Madrid, as this was the day of the terrorist bombing. I turned around to close the door behind her and the top set had disappeared by the time I turned back.  I continued to watch the remaining set and after about 6-8 minutes they started to blink out, going from right to left in order. First the extreme right , then a second or two later the next in line, then the last 3 turned sort of translucent, (see-throughy) and blinked out together. I don&#39;t know how long they had been visible before we saw them.  I didn&#39;t see anything on the news or in the paper about it, but knew that these lights were definitely not on the ground and not military.  They were rock steady.  Then a few weeks later with a group of friends in VA, I mentioned them and they said exactly the same phenomena was described in the new book &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; by a couple of Drs.

The back side of the tri-craft was at least 50 feet across. The other two sides would measure similarly, I would estimate. There were six or seven pale yellow lights underneath. There was no particular uniformity about the position of the lights. The craft was no more than 100-125 feet above us. I yelled to my friend and driver to look up. Because of brisk traffic coming in both directions, he could not stop the car but he did manage to slow down and lean to the right in time to also get a brief glimpse of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stared at it, and I noticed the object moved around at random, not particularly rapidly. There was no trail. The light emission was steady, not blinking. This moving object was confirmed by a second observor who said it looked like a Mercedes Benz 3-pointed star without the circle around it.  I put the videocamera on it and at 20x zoom it appeared to be a sphere.  It was difficult to keep the object on screen when at max zoom, so I conclude it was a good distance away.  We are in a flight line to the Manchester, NH Airport (it is 4+ miles NNE) and see a lot of planes, usually coming in from the SW but occasionally from far away in the West.  A plane came in as I was videoing this object, so I put the camera on the airliner for a contrasting shot.  It was not comparable to the object.  Planes are steady, this object was mobile horizontally and vertically and is not like any plane or star I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus may be the explanation.

(Jupiter had set about 6 hours earlier and it was impossible for any planet to have been in this part of the sky anyway.)  It did not twinkle.  Almost immediately after I had first set eyes on it, it began to fade rapidly and steadily until it vanished.  At first I thought that a cloud had passed in front of it but then I noticed that the sky all around was completely clear.  To be sure that it hadn&#39;t been covered by a small, isolated cloud, I continued to watch.  It did not reappear even after a minute or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very slow. I could not hear anything appart from the sound of my engine. I opened my car window and still could not hear anything. I drove on and another &#34;craft&#34; flew over ahead of me, again I could hear nothing with the window open. I drove on. Then a third craft flew over me - it was bigger, perhaps the size of a jumbo jet and was as low as the others - there still was no sounds made with the car window open. This craft was a wing-like shape, very thin with a row of small green lights along the back. Itflew across to my right and while doing so, dipped its &#34;wing&#34; to the right and then went back up to the horizontal. I have no iead what colour it was because it was dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stepped outside as well and he pointed out an object in the sky.  It was extremely bright, low on the western horizon and large.  It appeared to be hovering not too far from us.  At first we thought it was possibly a helicopter because we could hear the sound of one approaching but we realized it was not coming from the light but an actual helicopter heading towards the light itself.  This helicopter departed the scene after a red light seemed to dart out from the light itself.  At least 6 military jets were circling the light at a much higher altitude, keeping a good distance between it and them.  The light hovered still for about 10 minutes and then moved very quickly to the right before continuing to hover.  My 8 year old son came out to see what we were staring at and shouted &#34;It&#39;s a spaceship!&#34;.  I told him that I didn&#39;t know what it was but it was definitely odd.  Two other neighbors were outside and appeared to be watching it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were still debating whether or not it was a search helicopter because it certainly did not seem like one.  There was a strobing effect to the light in an alternating yellow/green pattern.  We realized that it was moving once again, this time away from us, due west.  Although it was diminishing in size, the brightness of the object stayed constant and at the same altitude.  At that point, we realized that what we were looking at was not the headlight of a helicopter at all. We watched it until we could see it no more because houses obstructed the view.  When it departed, the military entourage departed as well and it was a normal quiet Gallup, NM evening once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last sight that we had of it, it seemed to blink red once.  The rest of the time, it was just an extremely bright white light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been looking at the dramatically twinkling star, that would have been visible in the southwest sky on the time and date indicated by the witness.

My husband said &#34;Look at that!&#34; and by the tone in his voice I  realized that it wasn&#39;t Venus that he was pointing at.  We both saw 2 faint &#34;pinkish&#34; lights traveling at a high rate of speed, one trailing outside and slightly behind the other.  They started to fly closer to each other, appearing to almost collide.  Their speed dropped very suddenly, they appeared to correct their positions, abruptly changed direction to the northwest and faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared that we were viewing two flat, &#34;teardrop&#34; shaped, lighted objects.

I turned  and watched them for a couple of minutes.  They were a group of 6 or so orange/ amber colored lights moving in a south westerly direction. Immediately following the orange lights, were two smaller red lights that moved in odd directtions. I also saw at least two military aircraft chasing the objects. I could recognize the red and green lights that are common on planes.  I could see no other lights on the group of orange lights, or the two smaller red lights. I watched  the lighs until the went beyond my means of viewing. There were no reports made on the news about the lights, but I know several other people saw them as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object would move at extreme rates of speed back and forthe in a horizontal direction then ocasionaly at a high rate of speed straight up into the sky.

I was on the passenger side and looked east out the window into the clear blue spring sky. Due east, at about 45 degrees, I saw what looked like a silver airplane with no wings (just a silver tube). The sky around it shimmered in kind of a circular pattern. It didn&#39;t seem to be moving at all, and there was no sound. After watching a couple of minutes, I wondered why I couldn&#39;t see the wings. I&#39;m slightly nearsighted (20/40) so I put on my glasses to see it better. It looked the same - still no wings. I watched about another 30 seconds or so; then it disappeared as I watched. It didn&#39;t get smaller like it was going away, nor did it go behind a cloud. It just kind of clicked off. I told my husband that I think I just saw a UFO. We got home about 5 minutes later. After a couple of minutes, I heard military jets overhead. I don&#39;t know if the two events were connected. (Don&#39;t know if they scrambled to chase or if the jets were coincidentally there a couple minutes later.)<n>

In Cordoba we have Uritorco mountains which you probably heard about because of the numerous events related to UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night we saw the incident was a cloudy night, we lay on the rocks of a dry river to watch the stars, then we stand up and walk down the river heading to bed, after this a hound of dogs really went crazy up the on the valley, barking a lot and from where the sound came we saw what appeared to be a flashlight trough the woods, but soon started to move erratic floating towards our direction, was a green like light, never seen a light that color..<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it came closer we decided to keep a safe distance between the light and us, I knew the moment it started floating in that erratic movement that the light was an alien craft, and this craft was coming way to fast so we decided to run as fast as we could, we had a feeling of fear and excitement, we were shocked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped running and incredibly left the fear behind and went back to the place we last saw the light, but it wasn´t there.. we searched the skies and nothing ! but this is the funny part, we turn around again and see this same light again but different now! there was the same green light in the center and like other six or seven small lights around the main one, describing a disk shape object this time it stood still in the air, levitating at 10 meters from the ground and another 30 from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could´ve stayed all night there, but the object wouldn´t move.. it stayed in the same spot floating, so we stayed like an hour, watching and watching again, loving that moment with our own eyes and souls and I think the beings inside the craft were also interested in us because they didn´t take of, was like a mutual fascination.. as if they were expecting something from us, but didn´t get any closer this time After a while we sadly decided to leave, we actually abandon the sightin.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Immediately I saw a triangle shaped object flying slowly over our house.  It flew only as high as the tree tops.  It had pale yellow lights at each triangle tip and a red light in the middle of the craft.  (All lights were underneath.)  It made absolutely no sound and left no trail of any kind.  It flew from the southeast to the northwest - over the city.  I live on the east side of the city.  I watched it as far as I could see it.  I was describing the whole event to my brother on the phone.   What could this have been?  I have never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/9/04 21:30|Chanute|KS|Triangle|20 minutes|The object was surrounded by bright green lights forming a triangle.|3/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35551.html|301|ndxe200403| The object was surrounded by bright green lights forming a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came home about 9:30pm Tuesday March 9th of 2004.  (7miles East of Chanute) I noticed what appeared to be a large bright light low to the west horizon. (Much brighter than any others stars) It appeared to have two lights on top of each other.  The night was perfectly clear and completely silent.  I stood and watched the light for about 6 minutes trying to figure out why it seemed to be flickering.  I then called my daughter and her boyfriend (they were still in town) to ask if they could see anything from where they were at.  They could not see anything though.  I then continued to watch for another 2 or 3 minutes when I started to notice a triangle surrounding the lights.  These lines that formed the triangle were green and like what appeared to be on a car dash display. (Color/shade of green) I hurried up and called my daughter back and told her and her boyfriend to get out here before it was gone.    I continued to watch and noticed that the formation was definitely coming towards my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The triangle was getting larger in size therefore I knew it was coming closer.  5 or 6 more minutes passed and I called my daughter again to see how far away they were.  They were on the main highway near my house only ½ mile away from me but could not see anything.  (That’s how low this thing was flying) I ran out to the gravel road north of my house as I noticed it moving slightly northwards.  It seemed to be hovering at what appeared to be about 80&#39; or 90&#39; above the tree tops and only 1/4 or ½ mile away from me to the west.  I determined my distance using the strobe like flash the object was emitting on the trees.  About every 5 or 10 seconds there would be a flash of white light shining downward.  On a few occasions the light was red.  The light would be bright enough I could see the hedge rows below it.  I then used the hedge rows to calculate my distance from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having to guess the actual size the object, I would say that using the three green lines that formed the triangle, the object was equivalent to 2 (two) full moons width.  This was calculated when the UFO was at its closest point to me.  I heard my daughter coming down the road so I phoned her to tell her to turn off her lights but her car does not allow lights to turn off while car is running.  When they pulled up I quickly jumped in the car so we could drive closer.  As we started to drive about 65mph on the gravel, it quickly started moving back towards the west. (The way it originally came from) We drove back to Chanute and on through town continuing 11 miles on west of town.  All the while we were traveling at a high rate of speed.  The object disappeared into the horizon at a low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three of us that saw this happen yet none of us could even begin to explain what exactly it looked like.  I did report this to the Sheriffs Department but they had not heard anything about it.  The object made no sound whatsoever.

These lights were moving in an southeastly direction.  They appeared to be flying in some type of formation.  The light were very bright and flew at medium altitutde.  Once I thought that the lights were coming in the direction that I drove in.  At this time, I began to get scared and panicky.  I began to stop my car and the lights appeared at a stand-still in the sky.  At this time, I saw at least 4 to 5 lights and they appeared to have a battle.  I did not hear any sound.  These lights appeared to be shooting at each other.   After each light launch some type of explosive at the other, all the light simply disappeared before my eyes.  I have never seen them again.  Days later, I experienced swelling in my ankles and at times my voice echoed when I talked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the lights were not associated with an advertising display, then we don&#39;t know what the witness observed.

The time was 6:45 PM.  As I got nearer, I could see brightly colored lights on the bottom of it and two bright headlights at the front of it.  It was only 100 to 200 feet off the highway to my left side and about 100 or so feet in the air.  It seemed to be surrounded by a light layer of fog.  I was so intrigued by it that I decided to backtrack to try to find its location.  I got off the highway at exit 9 and proceeded to Tolend Road.  After I got on Tolend Road and crossed the bridge that goes over Route 16, I saw it again.  The time now was 6:55 PM, or so.  It flew over the road right in front of me, travelling perpendicular to the direction of the road from my right to my left.  This time, there didn&#39;t seem to be any fog surronding it.  I only saw it for a few seconds before it disappeared behind the trees to my left.  Again, it looked to be triangular and had two very bright headlights in front.  It couldn&#39;t have been going very fast.  I would say no more than 25 to 50 miles per hour which seems to be way to slow for an airplane to travel.  It was approximately 100 feet in the air at this point.  Another interesting thing that I only realized after my friend started to ask me about it was that this object was very quiet.  Despite the fact that I was in a running car with the windows up, the object didn&#39;t seem to make a sound, which was strange given how close it was.  Clearly, I would have heard it if it was a helicopter or an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was obvious to us the object was very far away(km or miles unknown). I saw a bright orange fire type object heading towards the earth at a very obscure angle. I quicky pointed it out to John who saw it right away. It Definenty was not a plane going in for a smooth landing, but perhaps a plane crashing. Me and John were both shocked and had no explanation. The object was going too slowly to be a meteriod. It went as quickly as it came and in seconds was out of sight under timhortons.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Somewhat hard to see because of city lights and light cloud formation.  Looked like many stars grouped together, it seemed to be very high up and could not be seen sometimes by cloud coverage. When not obscured by clouds there was a pulsing of the lights and it traveled from over Seattle to over the Olympic Mountains.  It lasted about 2 hours before it was blocked from view. I first saw it as I was walking through a dark part of a downtown park (between Pike and Pine at Boren).  When I got to my apartment I told my neighbor about it and we went outside to see it.  Only had binoculars and when viewed through them you could see distinct bright lights like the head beams of an oncoming car. Viewing it from downtown Seattle was hard because of all the city lights. There were many aircrafts flying in the general area perhaps one of those had a better view.  Would like to know if anyone else saw this or not.  It did seem extremly high up and probably not noticed by any one because of the clouds.  When not blocked it was more noticable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Given the length of the sighting, we wonder whether the witness might have been looking at a celestial body.  PD))<n>

It was a perfectly clear, windless day, and as I was walking my dog I looked up and scanned the sky. Almost directly overhead I spotted a round gray object moving to the northeast at a fairly high speed. My first thought was a balloon, but it was moving far too fast. At arms length it was the size of a BB, and as it moved away to the northeast my eyes focused in on 5 similar objects following the first. They were silent and flying in a loose formation, and appeared like the 1950 Great Falls UFO film as they faded away in the distance. The pilot of a light plane flying south might have seen these craft if he were looking up. I believe the objects were under 5,000 feet. I scanned the sky and saw a helicopter to the north that was probably over the area of Federal and I-70.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 4:45 PM I was again looking at the sky, and to the north where I had seen the helicopter I spotted what at first appeared to be a black cylindrical object with a white tail below it hanging motionless about 30 degrees in the sky. My first thought was a kite, but when I looked at it through my binoculars it appeared like a cluster of orange balloons with red lights on them. The white tail was not moving and appeared rigid. I watched it for about 5 minutes, eventually it began to rise higher in the sky, to about 50 degrees. I went back inside and returned about 5 minutes later, but could not relocate the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange objects that I had no explanation for. I am a MUFON member and watch the sky quite a bit. The 6 objects I saw did not appear any different than ones I have seen in UFO films and videos shot worldwide over the years. I hope someone else saw what I saw this afternoon and reports it, otherwise I may stop believing my own eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is MUFON member in Colorado.

I dont care if you believe me or not, it happened.  I was on my paper route in my car this early morning at 3:20, I recall the time distincly because I changed the radio to a song I liked at that time.  I was driving on Carlsbad Village Drive, and about a quarter mile to Tamarack road I experienced something.  Now it being so early there was nobody on the road except me.  I was driving about 25-30 MPH when I saw a real bright light in the sky about the size of the moon.  I was totally baffuled by what I saw and I pulled over to catch a better glimpse of it.  I am an avid listener of the coast to coast am radio program so I&#39;m very interested in UFO&#39;s and such.  It got bigger as time passed and it looked like closer.  About 1 minute passed and all of a sudden it just disappeared.  I was very disappointed but at the same time going crazy and shouting and yelling what ((deleted)) is that????  Then after 10 seconds of dead silence the round bright object landed RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!!  It was circular and glowed very brightly.  It was probably 25 feet tall and 100 feet from side to side.  I&#39;m only guessing on the estimates, real rough numbers.  I was so stunned I felt like I was going to have a heart attack.  Then I heard a voice as if somebody was talking gently into my ear.  I looked around a didnt see anybody around me.  All of a sudden the craft didn&#39;t glow anymore and on the side of the craft it said &#34;FUTURE&#34;  The Voice said &#34;nobody else can see this but you.  we are from the future.  you are the representative now of the future for this mass.  please lead or their will be dire consequences&#34;  I remember every single ((deleted)) word it said.  It talked very slowly and clearly in perfect english.  I still couldnt see anybody but the craft and after it stopped talking i shouted &#34;who the hell are you????&#34; and EVERYTHING JUST DISAPPEARED.  After about 10 minutes of me shaking and hyperventilat! ing and me getting weak in the knee&#39;s I went back into my car and started it back up.  I then reached Tamarack Road and I looked at my clock in my car and it read 3:02.  I was so stunned.  I immediately drove home and just sat for a few hours at my kitchen table stunned and thinking what to do next.  Then i got on the internet and searched for about an hour until I&#39;ve come to this site.  My heart is still at a million beats per second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I saw that the oval light was moving in diagonal, so I raised my eyes, thinking that it was a falling stars, but it was bigger, slower and suddenly it changed direction. Instead of in diagonal, it started moving in horizontal, and after a second it vanished. My first reaction was the cry, I was a little scared. The day after, to have a confirm, I asked to my university friends (I&#39;m a doctor in sciences of communication and I&#39;m attending a master of Journalism), and one of them told me that he too, the night before was in a car with a friend, and saw the same thing!<n>

It is a clear night with lots of stars out - this was about 10 x larger and much brighter than any star, also very colorful. It moved up and down and seemed to be spinning around very fast. Every so often it would spit out streaks of red dots down toward the ground in a tripod shape. At the same time, there were three or four others visible, one to the north, one east and one south. The one in the west slowly got smaller and smaller, then disappeared over the egde of the mountain. The others are still very clear, they look the same, except they are too far away to see any red dots. They seem to move closer, then further away, but always differentiated from the stars around them due to the fact that they are very bright, they are colorful and they have those streaks going out to the sides and downward from them, as well as they seem to move around a lot. My daughter got them on video tape. She is still out there taping them now, it&#39;s been an hour, but I&#39;m not sure whether she got it set up in time to catch the red dots of the first one. My daughter just came in and said that she looked at them through a rifle scope and it was spitting out red and green &#34;dots&#34; (lights) toward the ground. I called your hotline and the person I spoke to was a complete incompetent, not willing to listen to any description what so ever. As soon as I told him they were the size of stars, he interruped me and told me they WERE stars.

I was in my yard observing a very nice sunset and noticed a dark shape against the sunset, which was almost over with. The object appeared to be in the flight path of normal air traffic [ there were five or six aircraft on their approach to SEATAC International]. It appeared to be getting closer as if flying towards my location. I ran in and got my 10 x50 binoculars and my 30x60 spotting scope and  veiwed the object for a couple of minutes. Looking through my spotting scope the object was tumbling at about 5000 ft. alt. At first I thought that it was a balloon, but  then there was nothing tethered from it, and the spheres looked too uniform and brightly colored [it was back-lit by the western sunset]. It looked like it was comprised of 6 to 8 red, green and blue balls in a perfect cluster shaped something like this: 0880. I had to move my spotting scope that  was on the hood of my pickup because the object had moved  slowly behind a street light pole in my driveway while I was looking at it. I moved the scope and tried to reaquire the object but couldn&#39;t find it. Only ten seconds lapsed before I picked up my wide angle binoculars and tried to find it once more. The object had completely disappeared. I search for it for another 10 minutes and gave up. The things that stood out most in my memory was the perfect  almost molecular shape and the distribution of the most purest glossy colors I have ever seen in backlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the witness observed, but his report appears to us to be serious-minded.

Then I noticed what looked like the trail from another jet, except it kind of looked like two trails from a jet real close together. As I watched it more, there was no jet, and the trail wasn&#39;t getting any longer. It was completely horizontal (north to south). It was fairly high in the sky, and as I looked at it more over a period of about a minute, I swear it looked like a perfect row of small windows going down the length of it. It also seemed to have a perfect, long, cylindrical shape, with the windows going down the middle. I could tell it was cylindrical because the top and bottom kind of faded as if there was some roundness to the object. I couldn&#39;t tell how high it was in the sky, but the object looked enormous. After about two minutes of watching it, it performed a 4 second fade out from being completely visible, to disappearing completely. I&#39;ve never witnessed the trail of a jet disappear that quick after being visible for that long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is not one cloud in the sky today, completely empty blue sky except for first jet that I saw, and the other unexplainable object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There&#39;s no way I was the only person to have seen it, there was tons of cars on the freeway, and the object was in plain view as you were driving southbound.

I have never seen anything like it.  There were SO MANY trails, not double trails as if from a twin exhaust, but single trails.  Furthermore, and this is going to sound even more bizarre, the trails seemed to almost like form clouds or attract clouds or something.  Because as I was passing through the Sepulveda pass I noticed that they kind of aggregated together in a &#34;cloudlike&#34; mass - not smokey like, but feathery like a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In final I would like to note that some trails seemed to begin mid sky - with no faded trail prior to where the observed trail began - as if it, perhaps, came in from a very high altitude (or, I suppose, turned on the &#34;jets&#34; mid sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness was looking at contrails behind high-flying jet aircraft.

On March 8, 2004, I was testing a new digital camera I had bought for my upcoming vacation to Hawaii. The camera takes mpeg video as well. At 12:54 a.m., while my boyfriend and I were laying in bed, I had the camera pointed out our bedroom skylight (skylight is 8 ft. x 6 ft) when I noticed a white light in the LCD screen. At first I thought it was a star, but then I realized it was moving, so I thought it might be a comet.  I continued to record for a total of 1 min 14 seconds. When I played the video on my computer at 200% zoom, I was surprised at what I saw.  The object had different colored lights that would change from green to red to blue to yellow, and the lights would appear to be perfectly circular then they would rotate and change into a white streak, then change again into 5 cirular lights each a different color-red green yellow blue purple.  The object could not be seen-just the lights that rotated around it.  I was able to change the contrast and brightness in my media player, and when I did, a second row of lights can clearly be seen above the first, but rotating in the opposite direction. There is a also a strange haze around the object as it moves.  (I would like to add the fact that I have taken into account any possible reflections from the skylight, however,all the lights were off in the house. The only light in the room was from the LCD screen)  I will be forwarding the video to you via U.S. Mail.  I captured stills from the video that I saved as jpegs and will be emailing those to you as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went to our balcony to get a better view with my husband and we watched it for over twenty min together. I had gotten my digital camera before I went to the balcony and took five photos of the object.  It seemed like the color was changing to brighter then dimmer as a result I expect from heat? There was a dark purple haze spinning around this sphere of light. It kept moving in the same vicinity slightly upwards, downwards, side to side. I returned to bed continuing to watch (my husband went downstairs)and it slowly descended behind the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I downloaded the pictures from the camera and they came out showing an enormous yellow and red starburst type aura.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at a celestial body, possibly Sirius.

It was zigzagging between the trees about 20’ off of the ground.  It was luminous white in color and at least 4’ in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came to an abrupt stop at about 10’ above the surface of the lake and only about 30 yards from where I was sitting.

Then from the same direction off to my left/south; five objects identical in appearance to the first that I’d seen, came zigzagging through the pines, one after the other.  They came to a halt and hovered in a horizontal line about 40 yards from us at a height about 20’ above the surface of the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there watching them for at least 10 minutes.  They stayed in the same formation the entire time and then abruptly departed back toward the pines, but this time in a climbing mode above the pines.  We watched them until they disappeared out of sight.<n>

Shortly afterwards it changed into a more round or oval shape and came to a complete stop. As the witness watched the object traveling along over Pauline Mountain it flashed an extremely bright blue light. The object did this a couple of times and what came next surprised the lady. She clearly was able to see a ring of blue lights which ran horizontally around the center of the object. The woman reported there were a large number of lights, and said it was hard to estimate how many. But she figured there had to be a dozen or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was able to observe the object for approximately 25 minutes. As it moved slowly further away the lady lost sight of it. The lady said it grew smaller and dimmer in size due to the distance away until it disappeared. She grabbed her video camera and ran outside, but she explained at this time into the sighting the object was already at a good distance away and she failed to get any footage. The witness did mention that if she&#39;d thought of the camera at the time of the sighting she was confident that she&#39;d have been able to film it. No sound was heard.

(which parallels the ocean shore) from Chestnut St. at approx 5 pm looking due west over the Pacific Ocean about 60 degrees in the sky I observed a horizontal thin light with 4 barely visible light streaks emanating up from it. At arms length the length of the light was about 1 inch. I looked for strobe lights or other indications that it was a plane or other terrestrial craft, but saw none. I stopped and got out of my car and asked a couple walking along the street what they thought and they said they had noticed it but didn&#39;t know what it could be. As I turned and drove north on Carlsbad Bl., the object moved north as well. It seemed to stay at about the same angle to/from me. After a mile I stopped again, completely awestruck at this obvious UFO (wht else could it be?) in broad daylight. At a Starbuck&#39;s near where I stopped, I approached a guy drinking coffee and pointed to the object. He said sometimes there is a kind of light blimp that goes along trhe coast but it doesn&#39;t look like that. He said he thought it might be a comet, but I mentioned there was no tail and it seemed to move at irregular speeds/intervals. Anyway, I got back in the car, drove north a few more miles, observing the object. I stopped one more time and pulled out a pair of binoculars (7X50) that I have in the car. Through the bonoculars it was hard to focus and it didn&#39;t give much of a better view, which leaves me to speculate that it was a huge cigar shaped or rectangular ship, way far away. I&#39;ve heard of ships supposedly hundreds and even thousands of miles long and this could one of those that was hundreds of thousands or even millions of miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Not an ordinary plane jet. First, the &#34;tail&#34; or &#34;trail&#34; if that is what it was, was perfectly straight on a very very windy day.  It was not drawn out by the wind or made fuzzy or anything.  It looked like a white needle against the sky.  Second, it took about 15 minutes to move across the horizon.  If what I saw was an exhaust tail, the tail was big enough to indicate the plane was moving very very fast, yet it could not have been, since it took 15-20 minutes to move across the sky.  Third, unless the object was very far away, but in that case I should not have been able to see it with the naked eye unless it was huge.  Also, if they were moving that fast I should have heard some sort of sonic booming - I heard nothing.  Fourth, they were flying over mountains, and were angled down 20 degrees as if landing.  This is odd.  Fifth, there were 3-4 (at least, the first one was already in the sky when I started and the last was still in the sky when I left), which is also strange.  Sixth, the crafts were flying right underneath the sun, which could mean absolutely nothing, or could fit in to something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time and day, in the same mountainous area, I also saw a wingless plane flying overhead.  It was red/ silverish in color (not illuminated - but like paint), had no wings, and was sort of hover flying.  It was down so low I could make out its shape, yet it wasn&#39;t moving very fast overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I would imagine planes are at a height where it would be about 5-10 minutes before they arc and land at OIA. (Couldn&#39;t tell you what the feet above was). Had just seen a plane fly by and not 2 minutes later saw cruising at the same altitude as the plane had just passed, (I thought first was another plane)an silver egg shaped craft. No noise, no wings and no trail behind it. It was going slower than the plane previously, about 15 sec of viewing time. Smaller part of the egg was flying in front.

We also saw several other objects that seemed to hover and blink and these objects were directly between two radio towers (and yes I understand what light were the radio towers and which ones were not).

The light was so intense and bright that I cannot find words to accurately describe it.

(appx. 5 miles from original sighting)   I thought to myself, as soon as I get past these trees I&#39;m going to stop this time and really look at it.   Within a half of a second I was on the otherside of the trees and the light was gone - no where to be seen anywhere in the clear sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

No lights on, so I knew it was not a plane.  Making a motor sound, similar to but not quite like a helicopter.  But it was not any type of helicopter we know of.  Seeing it from underneath, it was clearly shaped like a triangle and had 1 red, 1 green, and 1 blue light in triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over my car, put the hazards on, got out and looked straight up.  Seconds after I did this, the thing sped off really fast and the RGB lights seemed to shut off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked out of the window and saw to my right hand side a round object hovering. It was full od red and yellow lights. The sound was quite loud and did not sound like a plane nor a helicopter.. The lights appeared to be diamond shaped within the shape. It hovered there for about twenty minates. The lights also kept splintering out and darting across the sky and back to the ufo. It suddenly shot off into no where at the speed of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked out my window and noticed that it was way too bright. All of a sudden it started moving, and looked kind of like a plane. It had at least 3 flashing white lights, and a green/blue light at the back. It also had a dim beam in the back.  I watched with binoculars as it moved slower than a plane going up and down, kind of floating.  I didn&#39;t hear any noise, but the beam in the back was very strange. It was 11:00 at night and the airports are closed.  Others should have seen this too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;d never seen anything like it, every time they past they seemed to get slightly closer until only flying at 200ft. The craft were a triangle shape and we heard no sound of an engine, just a high pitched shriek, it seemed to be being followerd by some fighter jets, but it left them behind with ease.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Earlier that day there was one single loud thunder, I dont know if it has any connection, it could have been a sonic boom. after what I witnessed the sky started to fill with clouds almost as if there was some weather control, thats only speculation, but i assure you that those 4 lights were not birds, lights shinning from earth or lightning.  I am a skeptic and dont jump to conclusions. I still am not convinced there was an intelligence behind these lights, but I hope there is.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The wind was out of the NW at about 10 MPH.  I noticed 4 jets flying in formation what looked to me in the northern sky over Interstate 10, from the west to the east.  Three were in line with each other but the lead was clearly ahead of the others. My guess is that they were 30,000 feet or more in altitude, all 4 leaving contrails, and were spaced about 3000 feet apart. Everything was normal and I signaled to my friend, &#34;Hey, look at those planes&#34;  He said, &#34;Yeh, gotta be the military flying in that kind of formation.&#34;  They were absolutely identifiable as jets. Then he noticed the lead aircraft had a shiney sphere under it and said &#34;can you see that under the lead plane?&#34;  I said &#34;Wow! That&#39;s amazing. I never could say I saw one until today!&#34; It was about half the size of the lead jet aircraft. He ended by saying they are probably heading to Eglin AFB, FL.  What really proved it to me is that the sphere was definately shiney, made no contrail (like the jets did) and was separate and aside the lead plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  However, we believe that the possibility of military aircraft would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the sighting may have been of a genuine UFO.  PD))<n>

As we watched, it bounced off the mountain and back in the air.  It was going very slow and made no noise.  We watched it bounce until we lost sight of it.  It was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I quickly made a right hand turn onto welcome farms rd, to follow theese strange lights, all of a sudden the two lights came on steady and joined into one bigger light. At this point i had stopped my car in disbelief..as i opened my car door to get out and take a better look, it shot south-west and up at an outrageous speed.

Myself and my girlfriend&#39;s mother saw a cigar shaped object move across tree tops and tremendous speed.  It left a light trail with no sound.

Then all of a sudden, it would disappear.  After a few minutes, another would appear and do the same exact thing.  This happened about 5 or 6 times.  After a while, we saw the shape stop in the center of the sky, and just fly in circles, and then move in the same pattern it did before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;ship&#34; was not just black colored, but more of a visual camouflage. We could tell the shape of it because the edges were a little lighter than the rest of it and the stars kind of moved around/through it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a very clear night and I glanced up toward the sky.  Very high in the sky, I saw what I first thought was an airplane, but the lights were pulsing off and on (not fast, it was on a couple seconds went by the off).  When the lights were off, I could not see anything and when they came back on, they were in the shape of a &#34;cross&#34; (not a plus sign -- a cross)  This object was going south.  Then I glanced over to the west and lo and behold, another one was coming from the west and made a turn south.  It was following behind the first one.  I watched until I could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was told by my neighbor (who is a former air traffic controller) that they probably were jets flying into Ft. Myers International Airport.  I question that though because I think the airlines have lights on their planes at all times during the night.  When these lights went off, you could see nothing.  This just didn&#39;t seem normal to me.  I couldn&#39;t hear anything either, but as I said, they were very high in the sky.  They were so high in the sky, that they looked like the size of my hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please feel free to contact me is you have any questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/5/04 20:45|Ceres|CA|Other|1 + minutes|I saw a Huey heliocopter  trailing a very large non light emiiting object at night at low elevation and low speed.|7/8/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37813.html|364|ndxe200403| I saw a Huey heliocopter  trailing a very large non light emiiting object at night at low elevation and low speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Huey heliocopter was making passes from SW to NE and NE to SW back and forth and trending in a southerly direction as a farmer would spray or plough a field. the direction between the parrallel rows I estimated to be about one and one quarter mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The heliocopter caught my attention when he made an easterly pass to the north of my position, because he was flying way too low to be in compliance with FAA rules and he was moving very slowly. About 15 minutes later the helicopter returned on its return pass with a southwesterly heading. It was hard to make a visual sighting of the heliocopter at first because of his extremely low flight elevation.  I could hear the helicopter for a couple of minutes before I could see him.  Now keep in mind that at the time I was busy unloading my van at my business partners/friends house and I wasn&#39;t really focusing all of my attention on the heliocopter.  I have seen many helicopters many times and they are no big deal to me. The reason I was paying attention to this one was because I was curious about the incredibly low elevation it was flying at and I wanted to see if it was private or military.  When it finally came into view at a distance of about 950-1100 yards, something caught my eye in front of it.  I blinked because I didn&#39;t really see anything other than the heliocopter at first glance but as it got closer, maybe 800 yards away, I suddenly realized what had caught my attention. The sky was very bright that night and as I looked to the north towards the town of Ceres at low angles you could easily see the outlines of utility poles because they were very dark against a light sky that was glowing orange.  What had caught my attention was the light of stars being blocked out by an object that was proceeding immediately in front of the Heliocopter.  I was awestruck as the object and the helicopter passed overhead about 200 yards to my north and at an elevation of no more than 100 yards, probably lower.  At the closeest approach I could easily see that outline of this craft or object as it was completely and totally black.  It was immense in size it must have been 8 to ten times as long as the Huey helicopter that was following it.  I would estimate that the speed was no more than 35 miles per hours.  The shape  of the craft was clean and aerodynamic at the leading edge, perhaps like the front of a jet but fatter or I should say it widened at a greater angle than any aircraft I had ever seen.  About 100 feet or more back from the leading edge the objects shape got very complicated.  There was a tremnedous appendage that was somewhat akin to a giant irregular keel that hung down towards the ground and was probably no more than 150 feet above the ground.  The sides and top of the rear half of the object had a large number of what appeard to be angular protuberances of many different shapes sticking out from the craft.  I must reiterate that the craft emitted absolutely no light whatsoever and I could only see it by its outline against a lighter sky.  Needless to say I was rather excited and I yelled loudly several times for my friend Tom Copeland to come out of his house quickly.  By the time he did it was too late for him see much of anything except for the departing helicopter.  The object seemed to either adsorb light or it had an albedo of zero.  This was brought home by the fact that the Huey was shining a tremendously bright light at the object.  Either the heliocopter was making small side to side movements or they were moving the light from side to side.  When the light didn&#39;t intercept the object, you could see its beam for over a half mile in the air.  When the light did intercept the object it was extinguished at the point of contact.  You could see nothing on the surface of the object nor was any light reflected.  There was a sound I heard that I don&#39;t know the source of that can be described as something like the ping sound that a sonar unit makes on a submarine.  I don&#39;t know if it emanated from the object or the Huey.  I have thought about the way the heliocopter was acting and I have come up with a couple of ideas.  Maybe the flight crew was moving the spotlight back and forth because they couldn&#39;t really see the object either and this helped them to &#34;see&#34; it by watching the beam of light extinguis! h just as I was watching it.  I don&#39;t know if they were picking it up on their onboard radar or not and perhaps they were afraid of running into it.  This constitutes the bulk of my sighting information.<n>

This is so weird,&#34; one of the pilots can be heard yelling, after the plane&#39;s crew switched on an infrared camera to track the objects, first picked up by radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The film, recorded by a plane looking for drugs trafficking near the Gulf of Mexico, shows 11 objects as blobs of light that hover in formation or dart about, sometimes disappearing into cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mexico&#39;s most popular nightly news broadcast showed the video Monday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interviewed by Mausson on another section of the video, the pilots said they grew nervous when the objects, still invisible, turned back during a chase and surrounded the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;There was a moment when ... the screens showed they were behind us, to the left and in front of us. It was at that point that I felt a bit tense,&#34; said Maj. Magdaleno Castanon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mexico has a long history of fanciful UFO sightings, most of which are dismissed by scientists as space debris, missiles, weather balloons, natural weather phenomena or hoaxes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From Larry Vogt, N4VA Springfield, VA 22152<n>

I went to my gun cabinet and grabbed my shotgun. I ran outside as quick as i could forgetting to put on shoes, and when i got out there i seen a small flash of light that made it seem like a square mile stretch was day. At that sudden moment the dogs stopped barking and my eyes were sore. I looked up after recovering and seen a small not quit a tear drop formation but that the best that i can describe it, really it was a pretty irregular form and not big at all it could have been that they were far away but it didnt seem like it. I was stunned watching them hover for about 5 or 6 minutes then they illuminated in a bright green. I was blinded momentarily and then they were gone there about 4 of them im sure of it all the same size and doing these wierd motions it was very creepy. Ever sense them i have been hoping for them to return i feel they have the powers to cure many of our diseases!<n>
3/5/04 04:30|Valencia|CA|Light|30 seconds|Very low, loud oscillating sound, 3 streaks of thin green light|3/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35416.html|369|ndxe200403| Very low, loud oscillating sound, 3 streaks of thin green light<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 4:30am, I woke up to an incredibly obscene, low oscillating sound.  It started as a hum, and grew louder and more pronounced.  It was similar to a helicopter whump except that it was enormous, much louder and with more resonance.  I am very familiar with helicopter, jet and prop aircraft sound.  I never get out of bed for the usual aircraft noises, but this was so strange that I shot out of bed and looked out the window by instinct.  At that point, the low, humming grew louder and almost with a bang, I saw at least 3 thin streaks of green light, close together at low altitude travel from south to north very quickly.  I am not sure if this was 1 aircraft or multiple, as I was unable to pick out a shape.  The noise faded out quicker than it appeared.  Total experience time was approximately 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial thought was that it was one gigantic helicopter that I have never heard before.  My second thought was that it was a group of smaller helicopters very close together.  After thinking about it further, the sound made me change my mind and refer to it as &#34;experimental aircraft&#34; because the sound was incredibly unique, the direction of travel was inconsistant with the usual aircraft overhead, altitude was very low and speed was very high compared to usual aircraft overhead.  I just can&#39;t get over the sound, which was so unusual, I decided to write this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I got north of springer I noticed two blue lights in the low clouds,I did&#39;nt think much of it at the time,I proceeded to Colorado drove over Raton Pass and through the town of Trinidad the weather was clear on the Colo side. I then noticed the two blue lights to the west of the Interstate,there was a full moon just above the mountains the lights were approx 100 feet apart and keeping pace with me I was doing 65 mph. The lights tilted slightly as it was travelling north, then all of a sudden the lights went out a minute later I looked and the craft appeared in the moonlight it was very close to the highway,it was BIG!!! the craft appeared to have a light blue glow and the front was flat with dark lines running up and down the front of it. At approx 5:00 am I approached Colorado City,Co the craft went right over the town up against the foothills. The craft dissappeared for a few minutes then reappeared in front of me about 200ft high lights pointed at me, I started getting nervous after that then I pulled over and it got behind the the truck and it tilted downward toward the truck I got out to look at it and it backed up but made no noise. I then proceeded north to Pueblo and did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Please somebody talk about this because i think this is it. i think they&#39;re finally coming. I am a very sane Christian nut i believe this is the beginning of the invasion. This sighting was on world wide news and should not be taken lightly. I live in Las Vegas and i know what UFO&#39;s look like, as i have seen one myslef in an unrelated incident. The video i saw on CNN brought me to these conclusions.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife was putting our daughter in the child seat and I had walked around to the opposite side of our car.  The night sky was fairly clear and I always enjoy checking out the stars, whenever possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happened to look up, wanting to catch some of the nearby planets (that are in good view right now) and stars.  I noticed an unusually large light (about the size of a small pea, at arm&#39;s length) shining VERY brightly, nearby another fairly bright star.  I thought it unusual that two abnormally bright stars were clusted together, so I fixed my gaze a little more.  One looked to be simply a bright star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light on the right (approx. WNW of the other one in view) side grew extremely bright, almost as though a gigantic flashlight was shining straight down toward me.  I commented outloud for my wife to look, but she was busy constraining our child within the seatbelts (she doesn&#39;t really get into star-gazing much anyway).  I never broke my gaze, from the moment it caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It grew very bright (almost pure white...brilliant) and then arced-off, for lack of a better description.  It looked as though it &#39;rolled around&#39; and I lost complete sight of the object.  My best attempt at describing how it disappeared was that it looked like a very small eclipse.  I verified that there were very few clouds in the area, if at all.  The nearby &#39;star&#39; on the left didn&#39;t change much throughout the whole ordeal (I suppose it was a true star).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it &#39;turned off&#39;, I quickly scanned the sky for reference points.  From my best guess (sorry I&#39;m not more specific) I would say that this observance was in the NW sky area.  I saw the open &#39;scoop&#39; of the Big Dipper point up toward the North Star and noticed that the light I clearly saw, was off-alignment, over toward the NW (as the scoop-alignment pointed off toward my upper left).  This event happened off to my upper right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we returned, and all during our driving time to and from our destination, I kept scanning the sky for any oddities.  I saw none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps someone else in the middle TN area saw something similar?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I went out side to hear what appeared to be a B1-B bomber at an altitude of 500 feet off the ground. At this time the sound was extremly loud and much louder than a B1 (Las Animas is located in  an MOA - Military Operations Area where B1s, fighter jets, B-52, F-117s train). I expected to see some type of airplane lights and strobes (B1 strobes are usually a brilliant very fast strobe), all I did see was a large oval white light, no stobes moving to the North. It appeared to be at a height of a commerical jet, 20,000 plus feet. After watching the light move off to the North, I went inside and called the Pueblo (80 miles west of Las Animas) Airport tower. They said that my area was out of their radar range and I needed to call Denver Central. I did call Denver and related to them the light/craft and sound. The gentleman I spoke to said he would check and see if there was any military traffic or any aircraft in my area at that time. After several minutes he came back on the phone and told me that it was not a B1 bomber or any military plane or commerical jet, but he did say that it was a classified aircraft on a classified mission and that is all he could say about the event! I have watched a lot of aircraft over the years in this area and seen some strange aircraft, but this one event was very unusual!<n>

We both saw an object in the sky that seemed small like a balloon far off in the distance.  It seemed black and moved closer very quickly.  It became obvious that it was an oval shape.  I cannot even describe how black it was-it was like a black I&#39;ve never seen-there was no reflection in it at all-it almost like it was a oval shaped hole in the sky.  As it moved it would tilt to the side and as the sun shined on it  I saw sort of a brownish metallic color on the side and seemed to change to more of a pill shape in that it wasn&#39;t completely a 3d oval. It was like a flat oval.  I drove away because my friends daughter was scared so I don&#39;t know how long it stayed there.  It just had a floating affect and went off to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could not make out the shape of the craft but noticed it had no blinking lights or the usual red/green lights just a brilliant white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 30 mins later I went out after the dog so I could leave for drill and the Naval Reserve Station in Louisville as I had ((deleted)) duty as a ((deleted)) and notice the light still there and knew it wasn&#39;t a conventional aircraft and thought to myself with some doubt that maybe it was Venus or some type of star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next 10 mins I drove out of view of the craft until reaching Market St. in Charlestown.   Once I passed the hospital I saw that the high school football field on my left about three blocks up was totally lit up and the craft was gone which was very odd at that time of year and 0345 am I pondered what in the world could be going on there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1 min later and much closer to the field, I suddenly saw, I will do my best to describe it: all the light in the stadium started dimming like it was being sucked in by a vacuum, until it all went into a white brilliant ball of light in the center of the field, and then shot upwards with great speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball looked almost exactly like the craft over The Temple Mount and i was flabbergasted and proclaimed all ritey then!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw no vehicles on the streets at all but surely someone especially the police had to see the massive light over the stadium.  I mean the odds would be impossible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone me that you seriously saw this stuff, Please!<n>

I was shocked and it was so huge as it dissappeared within  the cloudy sky!I was convinced that this was strange but if it were military  couldit fly with no lights in such an eeirie manner?I called my local news station to report this event and to see if anyone had perhaps seen it.No one did not report anything, and I think the station recepient thought I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The flashing was not consistant and did not have any pattern.  There were a total of 3 neighbors and myself who seen the object.  After approximately 20 minutes the object moved slowly west and faded out.  The total movement back and forth within the sky was approximately 20 degrees arc.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was directly overhead and was heading toward the moon at a very high rate of speed.  It came from the west and was heading east.  There was some high, thin cloud cover but moon and some stars were visible.  As it neared the moon, it banked a turn toward the northwest quite rapidly.  There were some planes visible from where I was sitting, but the object appeared to be out of our atmosphere--suggesting that the object might have been quite large in reality.  It left no trail or tail and did not act as though it was a satellite or shooting star nor did it act like any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen!  To bank a turn as this object did and traveling at a high rate of speed only leads me to one thing...it had to be a UFO!  A few seconds after banking the turn, it shot away.  There&#39;s nothing I know of that can travel like that and cover so much sky in only about 25 seconds!  I have been a sky watcher for a number of years and I have never seen anything like this before.  I have observed other crafts and twice I&#39;ve had cases of missing time.  But this sighting proves to be the most fascinating one yet!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Too much distance covered in such a short time<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the sepcified time and date, I witnessed an object flying at a very high rate of speed.  I was outside having a cigarette and was admiring the night sky as I often do.  I&#39;ve been a sky-watcher for a number of years since my first sighting in Aug. 1991.  There were some very high, thin clouds and some airplanes visible at the time.  The object appeared from the west and moving toward the east in the direction of the moon.  After about 15 seconds, it was quite near the moon.  Then it banked a turn and moved toward the northwest.  The object appeared as though it was out of our atmosphere.  It appeared to be as high as some of the stars.  After banking toward the northwest, it slowed down considerably and then shot away after about 10 seconds.  It left no trail and there was no visible tail.  It did not appear to have the characteristics of a satellite or any known aircraft that I&#39;ve ever seen!!  I have been watching the heavens since my first sighting in 1991 when my car was approached by a solid white orb and I was left with 1.5 hours of missing time...as was the passenger in my vehicle that night.  To have seen something flying that high and appearing only slightly larger than any of the other stars that were visible through the coud cover, it suggests that the object may have been quite large.  It did not twinkle like other stars and to have covered such a large area of the skies, I am inclined to believe that this was a UFO.  I am wondering if anyone in the area saw the same thing I did?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

It was positioned to the NNE of our house.  It is impossible for me to determine how far away it was.  It had the appearance of Alpha Orionis (sp?).  I stood and watched this object continue to dance in a pattern that was neither consistent nor predictable.  The air temperature at the time was @ 53 degrees.  It was partly cloudy, and the moon was at zenith and was 3/4 full.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any rate, the object continued to dance just above the tree line until it simply disappeared.  When it disappeared, the canines that had been howling and barking stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked around to see what this could be a reflection from, but realized that these were objects and they were moving slowly, and several from time to time quickly broke their formation, darting sideways and forward.  The lights moved as a general large cluster, with individual lights quickly moving forward and sideways, but still maintaining the general formation.  We watched for a little more than a minute -- time for me to ask, &#34;Are you seeing what I&#39;m seeing?&#34; and to get up from my chair and walk the length of the patio and watch until the objects simply flew out of sight.  Weird.  Never thought I&#39;d be reporting something like this . . .  Would love an explanation. Would also like to know if anyone else saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were a slate color and very smooth in appearance.  The atmosphere around them sort of &#34;shimmered,&#34; but it was definitely not exhaust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whirring noise stopped and my wife&#39;s hair became statically charged and she turned a bit pale.  I immediately ran into the store and dialed 911 where I was immediately treated with disbelief.  Amazing . . .  I told the attendant and she ran out with me, but the objects had gone.  My wife said they just sort of &#34;dissolved.&#34;   I plan to file an official report with the FAA or whomever.  Seems this area&#39;s law enforcement decides for themselves what is important enough to concern them.

On 03/02/2004, I was alone on the 8th floor (top floor) of a corner conference room of the building I work in. I was in the conference room approximately 1 1/2 hours as I was listening to a conference call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The office has two very large windows which presented 180 degree view of the north and east. It had rained the day before, but on this day, there were some clouds @ roughly 2 - 4 thousand feet. There were also breaks in the clouds so some sun was available. The visibility was very good. I could see JPL (Jet Propulsion Labs) on the north side, and to the east 20 + miles, and to the south east I could see Catalina Island. A very clear day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a few helicopters during the time I was on the conference call. We have a lot in the area, police mainly. I also observed a few birds (hawks and crows) flying nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 12:35 I was seated looking out the window facing Mt. Wilson and slighly to the East of it. I noticed an object I took for a helicoptor come into my line of vision from the mountains. It was moving towards me. I kept thinking it would soon become larger and I would see the roters spinning above. It did not get larger. As I kept watching it, it moved up just under the clouds and began to slow. It was still to small to get a good description other than it appeared an ovid type shape. I could see no appendages. Twice it was caught by sunlight and the color changed to a reddish metalic color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued to move just underneath the clouds and stopped just south of the building I was in, directly above Colorado Blvd. It continued to remain stationary for a few minutes. At that time, the conference call ended and I moved to end the call. When I looked out the window again, the object could no longer be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed before I lost sight of it, that during the time it hovered over downtown Pasadena, a small private plane flew under it by a few hundred feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At arms distance the object would be about 1/4 the size of the nail on my little finger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be interested to know if this is some sort of weather collection object. I am not saying it&#39;s alien, but I don&#39;t know what it was. Due to the closeness of JPL and indeed, the Skunk Works (just the other side of the mountains) who knows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes certainly feel free to use my report. I would love to know if these egg shaped objects are omething that is not mysterious if we only knew they were around (i.e., the weather gathering devices). Obviously if they are related to military then we won&#39;t be told.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I keep trying to look in the sky when I get the chance.

Since my family ownes aprox 800 acres I knew that nothing or know one was hunting on our property. Plus we have 5 locked gates that have master locks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I began to watch I noticed what looked to be 7 objects. Their was 1 taller than the rest. Their was a light that hovered over the group.The only way to describe the light is it looked like that thing that divers use for transportation while diving under water, except it seemed to giving light to these thing&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I sat there I began to get scared, because they were getting closer to my deer stand. They were going up and down this hill side, like they looking for something. The only way that I can describe these beings is they seemed to glow and they didn&#39;t take steps they hoovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They got to the log road where I was, then they stopped.  It was obvious to me that they knew I was there.  It was at this time that I really became frightened, because I knew that this phenomenon that I was witnessing were not human.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1/2 hour before sunrise they all seemed to go to this bright light, which was about 75 yards from me. Since I was in the wood&#39;s the foilage kept me from seeing real good. The bright light that they seemed to be headed to disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this occurance there have been a lot of strange thing&#39;s happen. Since I live in the Bible belt if you say that you&#39;ve experienced a UFO phenomenon people tend to think your nut&#39;s. So I haven&#39;t said anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since all of this started I&#39;ve probrobly got 6 or 7 video&#39;s a lot of pictures just to have proof. There&#39;s a whole lot of thing&#39;s that have happened, that I have documented but I don&#39;t have the time or the room to go into it right now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To be honest this whole thing has been scary, and I don&#39;t know who to even tell. It&#39;s gotten to the point that I try to stay around people and not by myself which is very unusual for me . Before all this I was alway&#39;s by myself either hunting or fishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We wonder whether the witnesses might have been observing a celestial body, perhaps Sirius.  PD))<n>
3/1/04 21:00|North Port|FL|Changing|20 minutes|Bright red lights with an unusal pattern in the evening sky.|3/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35362.html|409|ndxe200403| Bright red lights with an unusal pattern in the evening sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A red object stayed stationary over the cloudy evening skies but yet this UFO showed itself clearly.  It went horizontal and vertical and often changed its unuasual pattern.  It looked like it had a tail of red lights, kind of like a meteor shower but just stayed in one spot.  Then all of a sudden, a second UFO appeared with a bright light facing the other one with an unusual pattern also.  Then within 15 minutes, it totally disappeared from the night sky and never reappeared back.  It was a very odd sight to see and it was something that not many people saw unfortuately at the time because we live in a very secluded area with many woods and no city lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/1/04 21:00|Plymouth|VT|Unknown|3 min.|life changing event for me will not view skies ever the same.|1/19/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41513.html|410|ndxe200403| life changing event for me will not view skies ever the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> coming home from work at the top of the hill after the salt ash inn on 100A in plymouth vt. I saw two lights hovering just above tree line in a field about 100 ft. up the lights were about 50 ft. to 75 ft. apart. they were absolutely still, yet pointed at my car, being who I am I stopped imeditely to observe it. My fist thought was a u.f.o but, it could be a D.A.R.T hellicoptor. I stopped my car in the road, turned off the radio, poked my head out of my driver side window to listen, ii heared nothing, it was about 45degrees and the moon was bright, the craft&#39;s lights watched me for say- 10 seconds then the lights or the craft turned on a dime and flew above tree line slowly away toward Rutland/north clarrindon area.I made a u turn, went down the hill. as I got to the plymouth store i saw it flying just above tree line slowly with no jet trail. I asked at every house in plymouth if anyone had seen it, withj no success. the last house I asked invited me in and showed me a video. I do not know what to do with the video.if it&#39;s a government ship ,hats off to you, why me? call me<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was just hanging in the air about 150 ft. up, it was over a field in the town of plymouth, over a farm. Two lights simular to car lights maybe fifty to 75 ft. apart the lights were looking right at me for about 20 seconds then turned on a dime and slowly hovered above the tree line just like a movie. I had stopped my car in the middle of the road as soon as i saw the lights, rolled down my drivers side window poked my head out I heared absolutely no noise. I puled a u turn and followed it down to rt. 100 it was flying just above tree line slowly, with no exaust trail. it was about 50 degrees that night and the moon was pretty full. I asked everyone in plymouth if they had seen it and had no luck my last try I found a house where all three people had seen it and they had taken a digital video which the father showed me I have not decided what to do with the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have sent two messages to the witness, and have received no response.

3/1/04 19:00|Avalon|CA|Oval|5 mins|Round, tall craft over Catalina Island, two teardrop black crafts inter-weaving with another at low altitude|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36873.html|412|ndxe200403| Round, tall craft over Catalina Island, two teardrop black crafts inter-weaving with another at low altitude<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were coming home after a fishing trip to Catalina Island on the backside of the island.  It was getting dark, so we decided to head home.  We were on a 22ft center console fishing boat.  As we turned the eastside of the island and started heading toward the Angels gate in LA Harbor, I looked to the west and noticed a circular craft in the air at approx. 5000 ft to the north side of the island ( which is actually the front side).  I have been very interested in the UFO Phenomenom for 15 yrs now and have spoken to people concerning the subject.  However I never had a sighting. That is why when I looked up at the object in the sky I kinda questioned it immediately.  It was circular, but taller.  I had extremely bright lights around and on top of it. I watched the object while I held on to the boat( as we were coming in, approx. 14 knots.)   It seemed to hover moving eastward, moving along the frontside of the island.  I couldn&#39;t believe that what I saw in the air was not a craft that I could describe.  My brother&#39;s a private pilot and we have no problem identifying airplanes and blimps (Goodyear Blimp right down the street).  I am a space enthusiast as well so when this object appeared, I was downright purplexed.  What the hell is that?, I said to my self.  As I said in the duration, I watched the object for a few minutes and then said to the captain and my brother who were also on the boat,  &#34;hey look at that&#34;.  Immediately the captain said &#34;that looks like a UFO&#34;.  I almost fell out because he shared the same interpretation as I did, without me bring up the UFO possibilty.  He was driving the boat and it was getting dark so his immediate focus was keeping the boat safe, nevertheless, I kept watching the craft.  Before I knew it, the craft shot straight up into the sky extremely FAST and then disappered.  I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.  If this was a real sighting , I saw what everyone is talking about.  Please understand this is not a hoax.  I would never spend my time li! ke this over something that did not happen.  I just saw a report of the Mexican 11 UFO&#39;s all over the news and it inspired me to report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also have another incident to report, that I experienced traveling south on Pacific Coast Highway in the City of Torrace, CA.  I was coming home from my business and was going home which is in Harbor City. This was approximately 6pm and was in late 2003, before the daylight savings time change.  I was driving normally, traffic on PCH was normal and I had just passed Crenshaw BLVD. As I got to Pennsylvania Ave, I noticed three lights coming from the east going westbound, like they were on approach to Torrance Airport. As I mentioned, my twin brother is a private pilot and achieved his license at Torrance Airport, so I am very familiar with the traffic of planes coming in for landings.  I could help but notice that the two lights on the outside were much brighter and the center light seemed very normal in it&#39;s brightness.  I thought &#34;wow, that guy is coming in very low&#34;.  I followed the lights as they were coming toward me as I traveled east on PCH.  Then the lights shifted like one wing was turning completely over to the otherside, vice versa.  I thought the plane was trying to do an upside down manuver, therefore shifting ( I&#39;m doing my best to describe)  or doing a manuver that would have the lights flip over, like doing a barrel roll.  Right then the I could see that there were now the two bright lights were in front of the normal light. They were only 400 ft above and as the lights came to the leftside of my truck I could see two TEARDROP Black shaped crafts, with one extremely bright light on the very front of the vehicle.  I could not believe what I saw resembled the early versions of a UAV or a sleath teardrop craft, but it did make sense that these vehicles would be right there on PCH.  These vehicles were now inter-weaving with one another and boom they took off almost instantly!  Then came the private plane, probably a Cessna or Mooney.  This ws so off the wall, I could not explain it.  I told my family about the sighting but that was it. I know I never saw any stealth aircraft in the area, an! d have been next to one before.  This was not an F-117, but a formation of two teardrop shaped craft.  This was real for sure.  Please let me know if there were any sightings of these crafts in my area so I can know whats going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Remember guys, I&#39;m not joking here.  This is not some student joke or a false report.  This was real and will stand behind everything I have said.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

3/1/04 14:00|Tucson|AZ|Sphere|5 min|Silver balls in the sky AZ|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55320.html|414|ndxe200403| Silver balls in the sky AZ<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside tanning on my grass and it was a nice clear day except for a cluster of clouds in the bright blue Arizona sky. I had a towel over my face because I had lost my sunglasses but took it off because my face was getting too hot.   I looked up in the sky because I saw some clouds and I hoped they wouldn’t block the sun while I was tanning. I first thought I was seeing eye fluid bubbles, “I don’t know their correct name”, and so I rubbed my eyes and lay starring up at the clouds again not expecting to see anything. Watching the clouds move, I let my eyes relax in a gaze. What I saw were two very little or just really high in the sky, ball shaped, silver objects moving and stopping in and around the clouds. I watched as they moved and stopped and fallowed each other in the sky. After a while one vanished and the other vanished soon after.  I told my sister when she got home but she just said, “Oh”, but that to be expected I guess. So nothing super really happen that day but I got to see two UFO’s and that was really cool. I do live in Tucson by DM Air force Base, and see planes in the sky all the time these were not planes and weather balloons don’t move like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

3/1/04 11:30|Lowell|MA|Other|two minutes|Parachute-like object drifting past window|4/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36040.html|415|ndxe200403| Parachute-like object drifting past window<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m an elementary school teacher in a public school.  I was taking my morning break to have a cup of tea and sat on a chair by the window in the teachers room.  I noticed something that seemed to be drifting past the window (the school sits on a hill overlooking the city).  It was about 150 feet away. At first I thought it was a para sail,  but when I looked closely, I realized it was something that looked like three stuffed pillows stacked one on top of the other.  There were cables or wires that held a dark canister hanging beneath it  and seemed to be suspended from the sructure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a teacher in the room with me, and I directed her attention to the object.  She went to the window where I was standing and watched without comment.  I thought the whole incident was very strange.  The object drifted, rising and falling with the general contour of the hillside until it passed out of site.  I don&#39;t know why, but I had the feeling that it was gathering information, collecting data of some kind.  It seemed to be under control and climed in elevation when necessary.  It seemed to maintain a level elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/1/04 10:50|Anaheim|CA|Changing|5-7 minutes|A coworker and I noticed a black roundish object that appeared to be hovering above the Disneyland hotel.|3/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35381.html|416|ndxe200403| On March 1st 2004 in Anaheim Ca. a coworker and I noticed a black roundish object that appeared to be hovering above the Disneyland hotel. (There were no lights or sounds from the object (that were heard or saw) and there were no surface features noticeable, and it was an overcast day with the possibility of rain). From were we were standing it would be very difficult to tell it?s height above the ground or its size. But it appeared high and not very large. At first we thought in might be a Mickey Mouse balloon because it seemed to change shape slightly as it floated. After about a minute it started floating to the south very slowly (continuing to change shape slightly) but it didn?t quite behave like a balloon, it?s movements were a strange kind of slow bobbing and it was moving in the opposite direction of the wind. After about a total of five minutes of this, the object changed from a roundish shape to strait as and arrow (it may have only turned so I was seeing it at a different angle) and shoot off to the east at a very high speed and it was out of sight in a couple of seconds. It still made no sound as it moved away fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
