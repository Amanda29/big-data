The person who submitted it describes herself as a &#34;stripper.&#34;   However, we include the report here just to demonstrate that NUFORC is on its toes, and we don&#39;t let much get by us.  We have complimented the witness on how well she writes, suggesting that she could have a second career as a professional writer.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Large object above thousands... and only a few reacted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with my buds in Ybor, when I noticed a large craft hovering above us.  Everyone saw it some even pointed at it.  But no one else was the least bit surprised by it.  It had an inscription on the side as it hovered by... it took me a very long time to read it but it turned out it was english!  As it hovered just a few hundred feet above our heads I could make out &#34;Good...&#34; then as my eyes focused &#34;..Year&#34;.  It said &#34;GoodYear&#34; on it.  I peered deeper into the craft and could make out a small figure inside running the entire craft.  How it was able to hover just above our head without wings, I do not know.  It was almost like it could fall at anytime.  I ran into a near by bar to tell everyone there, they were all excited and rushed out.  But the second they laid eyes on it they threw their arms down and went back to drinking.  There was a flashing light on the bottom of it.  I knew that had to be the reason for everyones immeadiate dismissal of the craft.  I don&#39;t know why it wasnt working on me, but every single person I went to looked at it, and almost instantaneous laughed or giggled and paid no more attention to it.  Theses ufo&#39;s are getting more sophisticated.  It was almost like everyone had seen it a thousand times... could it be that since we are having more and more encounters that the extraterrestials have resorted to mind control?  I&#39;m not sure it was the flashing light, perhaps it was the script on the side of the vessel, perhaps the combination of the words &#34;Good&#34; and &#34;Year&#34; are some type of code words that allow extraterrestials to bypass our natural instinct of fear!  Again I am not sure as to way these words had no effect to me, but it could all go back to the creations of man, maybe we&#39;re some type of hybrid monkey that the extraterrestials used as slaves and as we developed we became more modernized and fearful so they had to implant genes into our gene pool to assure us as potential slaves for future use just in case their newly appointed slaves arent as useful as we once were.<n>
12/31/00 23:45|Eagle River|WI|Light|unsure|2 large pulsating stationary red/grn lights with  6 balls of light moving rapidly below  this,300ft away,|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15820.html|2|ndxe200012| 2 large pulsating stationary red/grn lights with  6 balls of light moving rapidly below  this,300ft away,&lt;200ft high over lake in WI.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what I believe to be one and or several UFO&#39;s while at our cottage, located on the NE Shoreline of Anvil Lake(approx 8 miles East of Eagle River )in Wisconsin.Our lake is approx 390 acres, and most of the residents there are seasonal(as are we)therefore, there are very few residents on the lake in the winter.What I saw occured on 12/31 @ approx 1145pm(and no, I had had nothing stonger than diet-pepsi to drink,despite the fact that it was New Years Eve).I was the only person in our cottage, as everyone else was out celebrating NY Eve, and I had decided to stay there and read a book.I was sitting in a lazyboy chair.The view from this chair overlooks the lake(the shoreline is 75 ft from our cottage),with an 8 ft glass patio door facing the lake.I have vertical blinds covering the glass,and the blinds were almost completely closed.As I was sitting down,reading,I saw a bright neon green stream of light shoot by(I could see this through the sm openings that remained on the blinds).I then saw a bright red stream of light go by, and it looked to me like it was a short distance from the shoreline over the lake.I got up from the chair and approached the patio door, fully expecting that someone who was staying on the lake was shooting off fireworks in anticipation of celebrating NY eve at midnight.I peeked out of the blinds(I didn&#39;t actually open them up)and saw what was approx 6 bright balls of light, that looked to be about a foot in diameter.Some of these were a very bright red, and the others were a bright neon green.They were moving rapidly and seemed to be leaving trails of light behind them.(The most accurate comparison I can make to this is that they looked like when a child plays with a sparkler on the 4th of July, where one can see the trail of where the tip of the sparkler has been).These balls of light were traveling very fast,but staying in one general area directly in front of our cottage.They were approx 300 ft away from me,over the lake,and approx 150 ft high.They were moving in that one are! a,changi ng directions rapidly, making loops, etc,but never left that one area,They never actually descended down to the ice, nor traveled away from there(to me they almost seemed  to be electrically charged or something).A second or two after I first observed all the balls of light,I looked directly above them and saw 2 large stationary lights.These lights were directly above all the moving balls of light, and were about 3 ft in diameter/2 feet high each. The stationary lights were the same color red and green as the things below them, but were flashing or pulsating.They looked identical to one another in size and were at the exact same height(there was about 75 ft distance inbetween these large lights).It was very difficult to see an exact shape, as it&#39;s very dark on the lake, and because of the brightness of the larger lights it was almost like looking at headlights on bright, where it&#39;s difficult to distinguish what&#39;s around the lights, but I thought I saw a rim of dark grey metal along the backside of the large lights.The metal appeared to have multiple slats along the edge, as though they were vents of some sort, and I got the impression that it was the outer edge of something, and that the 2 large lights were connected/part of this metal thing.The balls of light continued to travel in the same area directly below the stationary lights,never going above the big lights,nor any further than about 30 ft to the left or right of the big lights(I got the impression that they were shooting along the outside of some larger thing connected to the 2 large pulsating lights).Once I noticed the metal along the back edge,I became frightened,believing at that point that I was looking at something not of this earth.I distinctly remember thinking it was going to shoot down a ray of light to the ice, so I looked beneath it and could clearly see the ice below all of this.I would guess that I probably initially looked at all of this for approx 2 minutes, before seeing the metal part and moving away from the window.We also have! a large picture window overlooking the lake with the drapes wide open and a chandalier type light lighting up this room which was on.I pulled the plug on this light, as I would have had to walk in front of this window to turn off the light at the switch and didn&#39;t want to be seen by anyone/anything(As I was alone and stunned by what I was seeing,I didn&#39;t know what to do, and had no phone or believe me I would have dialed 911 at that point)!After I pulled the plug to turn off the light, I went to the picture window to close the drapes, and the view from this window prior to closing the drapes was the same as what I have described from the other window.I then went to the room furthest away from the lake,which is by our backdoor, as I wanted to be as far away from whatever was out there as I could be.I stood by the back door for I would guess about 10 minutes, before going back to peek out the patio door,and everything I had described earlier was gone.I never saw any of the lights leave and was deliberately not looking anywhere near those windows as I was afraid, I guess, of what else I might see.After I got over the shock of what I had seen, and was sure that whatever I had seen was gone, I looked more closely out over the lake, and saw a small triangle shape of light(red,green and white lights) all the way across the lake almost to the shoreline directly opposite ours.I have no idea what this was, nor if it was related to what I had seen earlier(although other than the colors being similiar it didn&#39;t seem to be related).However, there is no house over there and I have no idea what this could have been.I looked with a pair of binoculars and could clearly make out the lights, but it was very small, even with the binoculars.I didn&#39;t see this triangular thing move at all.I looked at it  periodically, and it remained there for several hours, as I recall it was still there at 2am and was gone when I looked again about 230am before going to bed.I should also note that we have a dog(3 yr old siberian huskey/yellow lab)w! ho alert s at any type of movement/noise around the cottage, and he did not move at all during this event.I also heard absolutely no noise,nor saw any blowing snow around the lights, which one would expect with any kind of hovering type craft like a helicopter.We had to leave the cottage early the next day to return to our home, and I have not talked with anyone else on the lake to see if they may have seen anything that night.If anyone else did see anything,I will certainly inform you of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The following addendum was sent by the same witness 5 days later.

I was pretty bored that night and i believe i was watching X-men for the first time. Well, the couch i was sitting on was by our Windows that face the front of the house, facing south. For some reason i had the odd feeling something was over the house, maybe because i heard something, but i had the urge to look out that window... so I quickly opened the blinds to look outside, and there was a craft flying from over my house towards the small mountains. You could see it fly that way because the lights from the city behind the mountains helped to sort of give an outline to the shape of whatever was flying overhead.  At first i thought it was just a helicopter flying over the house, heading back towards the city, but afterwards i asked myself why in the world would it be so low. It seemed like it was only 100-200 feet above the house as it flew past, and when it went over the mountains, it just barely flew over the edge of them. No lights were visible, and so i said, &#34;that was either a UFO or a military plane flying really low over the town.&#34;  My last thought about it before i went back to my movie was, &#34;Hey, that&#39;s illegal to fly that low anyways!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes himself as a member of the U.

It looked like a triangle with rounded tips. Every time that I looked up il was in a different position. It was right outside of my window. I first saw it when I looked up from my book. I thought that is was the moon at first. Then when I looked up a second time it was lower in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third time that I looked up it was higher than the first time. After about an hour or two it just vanished.<n>

Ran inside for a pair of binoculars and struggled to focuse it and to my amazement saw it was attached to a globular whitish semitransparent form. In the following some 4 reappearances by now I was accompanied by my wife, mom, and my sister and her husband and 12 years old son. In the second observation I noted that the globular form turned counterclokwise, giving the impression that the yellowish light dimmed. I was the only one that could observe the phenomena through the lenses, but some of the concurrents at some moment could discern the whitish form at plain sight. We concluded that this strange thing was traveling at usual plane speed in wide circles that overpassed the southern part of our coastal city and the caribean sea, because always appeared from the east and directed southwards. No conventional structural features were visible: fuselage, wings, navigation lights, and totally silent.<n>

I showed my friends and we watched it with a pair of binoculars as well as a small telescope. The object seemed to change shape or rotate so that we (my friends and I) could observe red lights dancing across the underside of it. The red lights were very bright and very active. The rest of the object appeared to be a shiny black color and looked as though it was changing shape from a rounded triangular shape to a mass of three small orbs. While in the later form it was more difficult to see the red lights. The object was moving back and forth across the hill and at one point seemed to get closer to us as it appeared to get bigger and brighter then it returned to it&#39;s previous possition moving along above the hill. All of this took place over the course of aprox five hours, during which time we called the Anchorage international airport, Elmindorf AFB, and the FAA. The object eventually moved back behind the hill and was not observed again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note;  Witness indicates event occurred on New Years Eve, 2000.  We have changed the date.

I noticed a strobing light in the South east sky.  It sat motionless for about 1 hour flashing Red Green and Blue.  It appeared to move slightly with the other stars athough there were clouds which eventually obstructed my view. This may be a star but I have never seen one which changed colors so dramatically.  If some knows which star or planet this is let me know I will check again in the same location the next clear night and if it appears again I must assume it is a natural phenomenom.<n>

WE WERE WALKING BACK TO OUR HOTEL ALONG THE PIER WALKWAY AT ABOUT 8:00PM WHEN I NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT COMING FROM THE EAST (OVER THE CITY OF PISMO)  I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS A HELICOPTER BECAUSE I SAW OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA AND IT WAS MOVING ABOUT THE SAME SPEED, BUT THE GLOW OF THIS OBJECT WAS MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER AIRCRAFT.  AS I  WATCHED IT COME CLOSER, I JOKINGLY TOLD MY FAMILY &#34;LOOK AT THE FUNNY LOOKING UFO COMINGTHIS WAY.&#34;  IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 1200 FEET ABOVE US, MOVING TOWARDS THE OCEAN.  MY MOTHER AND FATHER IN-LAW COMMENTED IT LOOKED LIKE THEY PUT CHRISTMAS LIGHTS ON A HELICOPTER. THE LIGHTS WERE GROWING BRIGHTER THEN DIMMING AS IT WENT PASSED THE PISMO BEACH PIER.   WE COULD NOT HERE THE SOUND OF ANY ENGINES OR HELICOPTER BLADES.  THE OBJECT ALL OF A SUDDEN, STOPPED, TURNED A LITTLE TO THE NORTH AND THEN HOVERED IN ONE SPOT. WE WATCHED AS IT CONTINUED TO GLOW AND DIM, BY THEN ANOTHER FAMILY OF FIVE WERE CURIOUS AS TO WHAT WE WERE ALL SEEING.  THEN WE SAW SOMETHING OR SOMEONE FALLING FROM THE OBJECT.  IT WAS ALSO GLOWING LIKE FLAME, POSSIBLY BURNING FUEL OR MATERIAL.  IT DROPPED THIS MATERIAL TWO OR THREE TIMES, THEN THE OBJECT GLOWED AND DIMMED A FEW TIMES AND FINALLY WENT COMPLETELY OUT.   IT KEPT THE SAME ALTITUDE AND POSITION BUT DISAPPEARED.  THE HALF LIT MOON GAVE OFF ENOUGH LIGHT TO SEE THE SURF AND SEA BELOW THE OBJECT, BUT WE DID NOT SEE ANYTHING SPLASH DOWN OR LAND ON THE OCEAN.  MY TWO DAUGHTERS AND NIECE WERE ALSO THERE.  MY DAUGHTER AND NIECE AGREE THEY SAW TWO SETS OF THREE LIGHTS ON THE SIDE OF THE OBJECT, AND THAT&#39;S WHERE THE GLOW WAS COMING FROM.

Sometime before 0402 hours today, have the feeling I was visited.  For the past five years (since 1995) while sleeping have dreamed that my house, a two story is tilting to the west and crashing into the street.  This morning, I awoke for some reason.  I lay awake and suddenly hear a low frequency buz or vibration and then hear noise, not sure what it was but almost at the same time sense I and my entire house tilting again to the west as one.  I said ... gee, my house is going to colapse on top of me.  I braced or tried to brace myself for this (thinking maybe an earthquake as the noise preceeding this reminded me of an earthquake when I lived in Japan) and expecting to hear furniture hitting each other as well as the west wall.  I mean the angle was about 45 degrees now.  However, I neither heard furniture slamming into anything and to my amazement, my ceiling fan was turning as normal and not at an angle.  That clued me into something weird.  All this time while I was trying to brace myself, but then I realized I was fully imobilized, could not move any limb or my head.  The only thing that would move were my eyes and they were open.  At this time, I forgot about the tilting effect when I looked to my right toward my skylight and see a beam of blue light that I sensed was searching and it found me.  To my left (west side) I also saw light coming from the window.  I realized somethign was not right, yet could not move let alone get up.  I now felt as if made semi unconcious yet fully awake and being examined in bed.  I looked around and could only make out a small dark figure to my left, above my head and to my right.  To my astonishment, directly in front and a little to the right of me about 10 ft away I saw what appeared to be a holograhic figure or what tried to be one, or perhaps that was the beam of light that found me.   I asked these thing what they wanted, but got no response and sensed they were intent on examining me.  I definately experienced fear! , yet no thing I could do.  Then suddenly it stopped, and they left at least it felt that way, and I look quickly at the clock and it was 0402 hours.  The blue light then gradually went away (maybe 30 seconds after the events stopped) from both my sky light and window.  I have been awake since.<n>

As the object moved across the sky it developed a vapor trail. This oddity prompted my wife to grab our VideoCam and as a result we have film of the event. My wife &amp; son also viewed the object through binoculars; appeared to be a fireball coming down. The video footage shows a glowing object seperate from the vapor trail as it nears the earth...leaving a corkscrew shaped vapor trail behind before it disappears below the tree line. It appears to have crashed whatever it was. The object appeared quite large considering the distance from our house. We have allowed the video to be viewed by a newsreporter &amp; a scientist who could not explain this event. Supposedly a meteor would have come down much faster than 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We agree that it could not have been a meteor, if it was visible for 3-4 minutes.  We suspect a high-altitude jet aircraft, leaving a contrail behind it, but that is only a guess.  PD))<n>

It was in the area where my best friend lives so I pulled of to the side of the road and called him on my cell phone.  I asked him did he see the lights and maybe did he hear a loud noise.  I thought maybe a transformer blew or a small plane had crashed.  It was really bright since we had an ice storm here and everything is really bright when lights hit it.  About the time they (my friend and his family) were going outside, the light headed south at a really high rate of speed and stopped about 10 to 15 miles south and was around 2 or 3 thousand feet in the air.  I had heard that it had been reported about the same time the night before.  It was a disc shaped object that had green, blue, red, and white lights that rotated around it each time in a different color.  I found out that night why people are such criticts about this subject because when you see something like this you say to yourself this is really amazing and who is going to take me seriously!!!  I heard on the Art Bell show that there have been numerious sitings in Oklahoma and Texas in the past 6 months and maybe their is something to this.<n>

Last night out on my deck I was smoking a cigarette when I looked up into a clear sky and noticed what at first looked like a bright star.  After a few seconds I could clearly see it was moving toward the west, I then thought it was an airplane with landing lights on, possibly a jet but it was too high to be landing.  I watched it for a while, finished my cigarette, when it stopped.  It stayed in one spot for several minutes.  I can&#39;t understand how a plane could hover in one spot, it was definately  much too high to be a helicopter, there was no noise. I have no idea what could do this.  After going inside and telling my wife I returned to the deck but it had gone.<n>

We were on a flat part where the trees and few homes visible at top can be seen.  We saw at least 2 bright lights in close proximity to each other.  My husband said he had never seen that before, and that it must be on one of the homes.  Then he noted that they were in the sky, not on any of the homes.  The fact that we were a good distance and the lights were so bright indicated to us it wasn&#39;t any aircraft we&#39;d ever seen.  Also, it appeared to hover, with no noticeable movement.  There were no blinking lights as often seen with aircraft. I watched the light until our visibility was hampered by thick forest through which the road travels. My husband is truly a skeptic, but even he commented that maybe it was a UFO.  I came out by myself to search about 1/2 hour later, and found nothing.<n>

We both looked up &amp; watched. It was a saucer shape but a little more rounded. It went back &amp; forth in the sky, would stop briefly then travel up &amp; down in very fast movements. It flew away fast sideways but came back again. The odd thing was it would stop &amp; then move up &amp; down but extrememly fast, then side to side. The movements were strange, almost like it would stop to observe &amp; then move around again. It was extremely large &amp; yet quite far away. Farther then an aircraft would ever be but so large you could see it very well.  I know this was not lights, aircraft or anything I have ever seen. Nobody could tell me any different, I do not care what anyone else thinks, I know what I saw. The reason I remember the date &amp; time so well is my father in law past away that night about an hour after.

Then, the circles got closer and closer to us, getting bigger and bigger, up to a point where we could see that ezch craft had about five lights total and was revolving aroud, like a frisbee when it flies in the air. then , they started spinning faster and faster the lights got blurry and made it seem like they had only one bright red light each, around the entire ship. then, all of a sudden, they just blasted away and we never saw them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the effect could have been caused by an advertising light, either laser-based, or a typical revolving spotlight.

I have driven this route at least a 100 times prior. It was dark being winter at approximately 7:30 in the evening but everything was visible due to the snow laden landscape reflecting the quarter moon&#39;s light. I was on the last switchback of Berthoud Pass on route 40 just prior to the Mary Jane Ski resort near Winter Park. I was the only vehicle on the road at the time, traveling about 45-50 mph as there was some snow on the road. All of a sudden coming from behind my vehicle on the left side I noticed a black stealth-like seamless craft approximately 50’ above the pines that lined the road. I slowed down to about 30 mph to observe it and it continued to travel along side parallel with me at the same speed maintaining the same height. I rolled down my window and the only sound was that of my jeep. There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft.  Its shape is! what I describe as a “stingray” flatter and somewhat triangular with two short (about 6’) wide protruding wings that had a soft green glowing light emitting underneath. In the back, the “tail” was raised somewhat with 3 circular glowing yellowish balls of light about 20”each in diameter making a triangular pattern with one on top and two underneath.  There were no “windows” visible. The craft was about 20’ long x 25’ wide.  No “wind” was created from it causing any of the tree tops to move at all…it was just silently moving along opposite of me.  After this, I can not recall what happened as it seemed to have virtually disappeared and my memory does not serve me as to where it went from that point on.  My memory has always been pretty good. I have to be honest and wonder why I do have that brief gap as to where the craft went after we had been &#34;watching&#34; each other for at least 5 minutes on the road.   All I know is this was NOT a helicopter, nor any manmade craft I had seen ! before.  When I first saw it I was nervously frightened thinking &#34;this is for real and I am the only one on the road!&#34;, then I became intrigued. I am and have been a drug free person and was of a very sound mind that evening!  I have told my story to many but never “officially reported it to any viable sources. I have the vision of the craft in my head and have sketched it out several times. I am still very curious about what I experienced and reflect upon that evening which makes me feel fortunate that I was able to witness it. 4 months ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer that metastasized to my bones. I suppose I would like to find answers or just share experiences with others who have had &#34;closer encounters&#34; similar to mine.<n>

I usually take a look at the sky, because our friends have a spectacular view unobstructed by trees. Looking above the constellation of Orion to the east, We noticed a single white light at high ltitude traveling from South to North in the conselation immediately above Orion (which was just starting to rise) at an etimated elevation (Azimuth?) of 60 degrees from the horizon. The light was steady white as it traversed in a nearly straight line until it faded out of sight to the north after about five minutes of observation. There were no observable navigation lights. It may be a satellite, however the object seemed to make a gradual 10 degree course change to the right (east) as it passed over Orange County. The estimated flight path would have crossed the LAX landing pattern at approximately 16:12 hours and there were aircraft in the pattern. I am a 42 year old public relations manager and my wife is in 43 year old software salesperson. Before we made the report, I checked Heaven&#39;s Above to confirm any prediction of satellite or Iridium flare activity, however I found nothing conclusive scheduled at that time for my area.<n>

One craft or three I could not tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were returning to work after a lunch break. I stepped outside and looked up to see the moon. Instead what I saw were three dome shaped lights that were moving north at a constant rate of travel. All three lights were the same color something between a subdued peach &amp; burnt ocher. They did not blink or flash. The lights were either three individual craft moving in perfect triangular formation, or they were attached to one indistinguishable craft. All moved exactly in unison! The craft covered about 40 degrees of sky in less than ten seconds and maintained a constant velocity. No noise accompanied this sighting. I shouted over and over at my wife to &#34;Look at this! Look at this!&#34; She was closing the door behind me and turned and observed the craft for about seven seconds. After continuing across the sky in a straight line the UFO disappeared seemingly winking to nothing as it went into the night. My wife was extrememly shaken. I too felt this, but I also felt excitement. Disbelief. Never have I seen anything even close. I am an Army veteran and am trained in aircraft identification. This was absolutely not a conventional powered aircraft. Nor is it anything I have ever been instructed to watch for. Very chillingly this craft is a near identicle copy of a recreation I observed very recently on TV of a UFO reported all over Britain in one night and investigated by that fromer MOD official whose name I cannot recall. I believe the show was &#34;Sightings&#34;. The event is less that 2 hours old and I am back at work, but my mind is not focused and I feel as though I am running on Auto. What do I do now?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume the witness implies a sighting in Austin, TX, since that is his home.  The event he alludes to occurred at Bentwaters AFB in England on the night of December 29, 1980, just 1 or 2 days after a dramatic sighting near Houston, TX, referred to as the Cash/Landrum Case.  In the latter case, three people were badly burned by a diamond-shaped, extremely bright object, which was being pursued by a number of USAF &#34;Chinook&#34; helicopters.  PD))<n>

I am only reporting it in case there were other sightings. I was getting into my car and glanced north towards Mount Wilson observatory, which overlooks Pasadena.   I briefly saw a bright florescent green light/ fireball arcing across the sky heading east to west. It was extremely bright and extremely green.  I have a very vivid image of how unusual it looked.   Holding my arm at arm&#39;s length it would have only been the size of my smallest fingernail.  But judging by the arc it did not look too high in the atmosphere. It was very much like a falling star/ meteor - but much bigger, closer, right over the city - and extraordinarily vivid green in color. My sighting was a brief glimpse only - it was obscured by a building.  I tried to drive towards the sighting a few minutes later and found nothing.<n>

It appeared to be disc or perfectly round in shape and was sharply defined. Not like the shimmering of a star. It was located between the rear view mirror and the top of the windshield. (See my graphic UFO_1st_sight.jpg)  It was at an angle of about 45-50 degrees above the horizon and about 10 degrees to the right of my westerly heading. It caught my attention because it was not the usuall red color I have seen on aircraft or helicopters (I live not far from the sheriff station and helicopters are based there and usually fly over my house. I am also familar with aircraft navigational lights). The color appeared as a bright crimson red and about the size of the largest star. However it DID NOT have a glow to it. There were no other lights visible such as associated navigational light nor was an object visible     which might have been seen from reflected light off the object. As I continued west I had to move up closer to the winshield and peer up as the object seemed to be moving in an easterly direction.(See graphic UFO_5-6secPlus.jpg).  When it was about overhead it dissappeared. However the way it dissappeared was unusal. It DID NOT JUST BLINK OUT but appeared to move up and away so fast the it was like a dissappearing cone. (See graphic UFO_15-20secPlus.jpg). I stopped in a dark parking lot to see if there were any further traces of it but observed none. I have tried to create an animated graphic of the final observation but have been unable to do so yet.  I have not been able to get the right color that the object appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will post illustration at a future date.  PD))<n>

Tom, and we both saw a large craft to the left of the highway over the valley where there are no houses or buildings. It was not moving and very close to the earth. That is was caught our attention. It was very large and dark with lights. I was driving so I couldn&#39;t stare too long at it. The passenger in my car was able to get a good look at it and described it as being diamond shaped, like a kite, with white lights on the points. It did not make any noise. It was completely silent. It then moved across the valley going east, flying low, and so smoothly, not real fast, but it was out of sight in a matter of seconds. It was probably going fast, but gave us an illusion of going slower, because it was like gliding over the valley away from us and it didn&#39;t make any noise. It really freaked us out. We definitely saw something that night like we&#39;d never seen before. Perhaps our government has some secret aircraft we don&#39;t know about or perhaps we witnessed a UFO. Whatever the case, there must have been others who saw it too, because it was near a major highway and during rush hour commute.<n>

Time 14:51 UTC (5:51 PM, MST).  It was almost dark.  Witnesses attention was drawn to a blue-white light approaching from the northeast, almost dead ahead, about 30º above the road at Point A.  See accompanying sketches.  There was no strobe light, nor running lights as would be the case with an FAA-compliant aircraft. The light appeared to grow slightly brighter and larger, as it dropped or moved closer.  Witness sensed was it was moving closer.  Roughly 3 to 5 seconds after witness first noticed the light, it appeared to be about 15º above the road and there was a bright flash (Point B).  The light made an abrupt turn to the right (east).  The light moved parallel to the horizon, traversing from Point B to Point C in approximately 5 seconds. Witness continued watching the light as it traveled from Point B to Point C, whereupon it disappeared from view behind Conical Butte.  Witness anticipated the object would maintain a steady speed and reappear at the right of the butte (Point D) in about 5 seconds.  The light appeared as predicted, and continued horizontally at the same speed for about 2 seconds, whereupon there was another brilliant flash (Point E) and the light dramatically accelerated and climbed out of sight in an easterly direction (Point F). According to witness, his friend, traveling in another vehicle approximately ¼-mile ahead of witness&#39; vehicle, with two Dalmatians (dogs), reported the dogs awoke and became agitated during the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Ronald S.

Very bright, consistent brightness, just a small, narrow, oval shape - reminded me of comet Hale Bop&#39;s shape,(but no visible tail behind it). It was descending very slowly, maybe covering an inch of sky per minute. It seemed to be something entering the atmosphere, burning.  Too slow to be a meteorite and too fast to be a comet - maybe space junk? Watched until 17:20 hrs when went out of sight below treeline/horizon. The day was very clear, the sun was still up, altho setting - I am an astronomy buff - so I know where all the planets are and anyway it was too light for any stars or planets to appear yet and Venus is in west/setting now and Jupiter and Saturn in east/rising - so was not a planet. Believe must hv been some space junk.<n>

After going over the first crest I noticed in the sky a very strange smoke trail. It look like a donut then a dash then a donut connected together and stretching about 1/4 mile in the sky. The air was cold enough to maintain it&#39;s shape for a long time. I never heard or saw any craft which made this nor could it be seen unless you were in the mountains. I pointed it out to everyone but since it was the first time for everyone to horseback ride, only the guide looked up. I think I saw this trail before meantioned in a report discussing jet propulsion systems on experimental craft. Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t able to get a photo.<n>

While I was in there, I looked out the bathroom window, and saw a bright light SW of here, high in the sky. It was not a star, as it would get brighter, than lighter. I only watched it for maybe two minutes, and it &#34;Blinked out&#34; as it had never been there. There were no clouds around it.It also seemed to have a haze around it, that would come and go, depending on how bright it would get. Then tonight, I was letting my cat outside, as it is nice out tonight, at about 5:50, and there it was again!(A very bright light in the sky.) I grabbed my camera, and took a picture, and grabbed my binoculers. It looked like a sideways white neon light, with a blue spike-like thing on top. Almost like a toy top. It was positioned almost sideways. I am still shaking! I have my my parents video camera from filming Christmas stuff, and as soon as I went in the bedroom to grab it, it was gone when I came back. Other dogs in the neighborhood were barking, but my own, wasn&#39;t. It may have moved a little from side to side, but hard to tell since my hands were not steady. When I get the film develpoed, I can send it in, as well as a hand drawn picture.<n>

Lengths approx. width of one finger at arms length. Appearance was also like the landing lights of two airplanes at great altitude reflecting on haze or ice crystals. Several minutes of continuous observation showed no movement at all against the background stars. I noted the positions relative to Big Dipper (slightly W and S (or higher)). After one hour I observed that the two light sources had not moved relative to the ground but were stationary with Big Dipper rotating CCW. After 2 1/4 hours one of the sources appeared slightly S of and between the bottom-most two stars of the ladle of Big Dipper. They had not changed position relative to the ground nor to each other. At first, the sources seemed more coherent, as if a beam of light, brightest to the L (W) and fading to the R (E). It is possible that the rightmost source was more coherent, and may have had several pinpoints or flashes of light along its length, only several, and at random. This one also appeared to have a lobed width, 2-3 lobes being suggested, but just at the limit of my vision. Over time, the sources faded slightly, or dispersed slightly, but remained exactly as when first seen in all other respects. Absolutely no motion relative to the ground. (Geo-stationary objects? At this latitude I thought it not possible to remain fixed over a position directly below.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We talked to this witness and found him to be exceptionally credible.

I was looking towards the south when I saw a bright object shoot across the sky towards the west where it then disapeard due too haze. The object was pill shape (sausage) and was in view for about 5 to six secounds and traveled west at the same hight (level). I live near Leeds Bradford airport and got in touch with them but they did not pick anything up on radar but noted my report.  This was not a plane and was traveling at thousands of miles an hour. I have seen meteors and comets and it was not any of them.  So what was it? ((name deleted))<n>

As I entered the town of Saco I noticed A very bright white light to the south of me .As I drove east on Saco ave I had lost it in the trees, Then when I pulled to the intersection of Rt 1 and Saco Ave it was to my Southeast and moving very very slow, So I Pulled into the Shop N Save parking lot and watched the triangle shaped craft move over me it was three times the size of any air craft id seen before and it had a hudge white light in the front and 1 large square in the bottom center of it and three smaller squares on each wing ,With a red light on each wing tip. this was either the stealth bomber or I Have been witness to a top secret craft or a ufo!!!!!!!!!!<n>

There is a bypass just before Ballater which lets you miss going all the way through the village. At about 7.15pm, 400 yards or so from the bypass turn off, both Peter and I looked up to our left and saw an object in the sky. It was triangular, looked to be grey in colour and its predominant feature was that it had 3 large blue lights at each point (but not on the very tips). These lights were not flickering or flashing and did not appear to emit any beams as such. It also looked as if there were white/grey laser beams coming out from the opposite side of the object (to the blue lights) however, it may have been the &#39;top&#39; of the object lit up by more lights. The object looked to be about the size of a house. I have been calling it an object but it definately was some kind of aircraft as it was hovering maybe 200 yards above the trees to the side of the road. I could hear what seemed to be a helicopter, however, if the helicopter had been overhead, it would have been much noisier and what I heard was a muted rotor sound. There was no sign of any other aircraft such as a helicopter nearby. When I heard this noise I assumed that it must be a helicopter because of the relative proximity that this craft would have been to Balmoral Castle (7 miles approx). I believe that the airspace around the castle is restricted and that it is monitored so if there are any unauthorised aircraft in or nearby this area, the airforce scramble jets etc to investigate. There were no jets which I found strange but perhaps it was outside the restriction zone. We pulled in to the side of the road just after the bypass and ((name deleted)) got out walking back to see if he could still see the craft. I also got out of the car but by the time I did the craft was gone. ((name deleted)) said that it was still there for a moment when he got out of the car but started to move slowly then &#39;just disappeared&#39;, no speed trails or anything like that. When I&#39;d got out of the car and looked in the direction towards the bypass where we has seen the object, I noticed that another vehicle had stopped in the entrance to the bypass going the opposite way. The vehicle started to move off and stopped beside ((name deleted)). It then drove off. There was also another vehicle behind this one which had stopped and drove off the other way. When the vehicle passed me, it was the police and the other vehicle was also the police. The van which had stopped to talk to ((name deleted)) had two policemen in it, and they asked if ((name deleted)) was okay. ((name deleted)) asked the driver, &#39;did you see that?&#39; to which the passenger replied after looking sideways at the driver, &#39;yes he did&#39;. They rolled up their window and drove away. ((name deleted)) and I then turned the car around and headed back the way we had come to see if we could see the craft again, but it was gone. We checked our watches and we had not lost any time, the whole encounter lasted probably 3 minutes. We both feel so lucky to have witnessed what we did. The craft was either one of two things, a secret military aircraft whcih has big blue lights on the bottom, hovers and sound a bit like a helicopter or it was a spacecraft. All in all there were ((name deleted)), myself, the two policemen and also 1 or 2 policemn in the other van that saw this. The place which this happened is right next to a hotel complex called the Craigendarroch and just outside the village of Ballater. There may have been many more people who saw it.<n>
12/27/00 15:00|Kea'au|HI|Sphere|5 -10 minutes|2 friends watch UFO watching us , disappears as we look through binoculars!|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67454.html|45|ndxe200012| 2 friends watch UFO watching us , disappears as we look through binoculars!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between 12/20/00-1/7/01.   I am from Hawaii, born and raised, my family and I moved from the big island in 2000.  I was visiting the big island on university  winter break from WWU during my freshman year of college.  I was staying at a friends house in the Agricultural lots above Keaau.   We were swimming in my friends backyard pool and playing around.  I pushed myself out of the water and lay on the edge of the pool on my back.  There were almost no clouds in the sky that day that I can remember.  It was 3 in the afternoon, super hot and sunny.  On my back, I was getting a little blinded by the sun shining in my eyes, so I put my hand up to block the sun from my eyes.  We were just chilling and after a short while I noticed there was something in the sky not far from the sun.   With outstretched arms in front of me blocking out the sun,  I could see something 2-3 inches from the sun(not literally, but 2-3 inches from where the edge of my hand was blocking out the sun).  The first thing I thought was ”this is unusual, the sun is really, really bright right now, how can I see this thing right next to the sun?”  I told my friend about it who was on the deck as well.  He looked up and saw it, and didn’t know what to think.  We both yelled to our friends and family in the house to come outside and see the UFO.  My friends parents came out, but didn’t spend long looking up and couldn’t see anything.  Me and my friend watched it for a while, it did not move at all.  As we were looking we could almost see the detail of the thing.  It looked super big, but really far away.  You could see that it was either made of light at times or was metallic and reflective.  It would kind of shine like a star, reflecting light, but you could see that it was metallic like as well, definitely round looking, could have been saucer shaped but was too far away to tell and we were seeing only the underside.  The really weird part is this:  after around 5 minutes of watching this thing, I asked my friend if he had ! binocula rs or a telescope.  He said he had binoculars in his car.  He ran to get them as I was still on my back keeping an eye on this thing.    The whole time he is looking for and bringing these binoculars I was watching it.   He returns 30 seconds later, and he hands them to me while I’m on my back, hand it the air blocking the sun, with my eyes on the object.  I put the binoculars to my eyes and try to focus to find the object but I could not find it. All the while my  friend is asking me what I see.  Nothing through the binoculars, so I put them down to try and find the object with my eyes.  I couldn’t find it after that.  It had disappeared right when my friend gave me the binoculars, not before or after.  We were unable to find the object after that.  Pretty weird, something was watching us that day!  I am Hawaiian Chinese and Caucasian, grew up on the big island, went to Keaau and waiakea public schools.  I graduated high school in 2000 and was attending WWU in Bellingham WA at the time.  I have graduated since then and am in Bellingham WA with my family at the moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have known each other  since we were 7 years old.  My friend is a Caucasian, who grew up on the big island, went to Keaau, and waiakea public schools as well.  He is very book smart, AP student and is a doctor of pharmacy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The bright areas were not right beside one another but had some distance between them. They were not real bright(soft lighting) but very noticeable and appeared to be forming the circumference of a circle ( quite a large diameter).  Each lighted area was a rectangular sort of shape - not like a spot light. The mass (for lack of a better term),moved across the sky above me and as it moved it was turning in a  counter clockwise direction, very slowly. It would go just out of sight and then come back and go the other direction to where I first noticed it.  It continued back and forth several times. I called my wife and daughter out to view it as well, other wise people would think I was nuts.  They both saw it and my wife watched it move over to another area of the sky from where she first saw it.  Above, the question was asked about the number of craft seen - I answered zero as all we saw was the circle of light.  This might not even be related to a UFO but I wanted to explain it to you just in case. Perhaps you could give me your opinion on this.<n>

The object had a tail of flames (like a meteor).  The object moved over the tree line to the left and out of my field of vision.

It was traveling from the east to the west. I know this since I was traveling north on Rte 91.  Two cars had just passed me on the highway and I know that they saw it too since they swerved in the passing lane in front of me just as I saw this object.  It was bright yellow/orange at the tip and neon green in the tail which was wider than the tip.  I did not see it dissappear over the horizon since I was too busy trying to make sure I didn&#39;t collide with the cars in font of me.  I saw only one mention of this object in the news the next night which was picked up by the Associated Press in my local newspaper.  I have watched the sky for most of my life and have never seen anything like this.  I have seen the comets in recent time - Hale Bopp and Halley&#39;s - but they looked nothing like this. More importantly, I have been seeing lights in the southeastern sky from where I live in northeastern VT for a few weeks.  They are clearly visible on a clear night.  I don&#39;t think that these lights are the normal star/planet sightings eventhough they are visible in the sky at dusk when the sky gets dark.  They seem to be suspended in the night sky at the tail of a constellation, which I cannot name since I don&#39;t know them that well.  They only move in the sky as the night goes on and as the constellation moves in the night sky.  The reason I feel they are different is that they appear to be flashing red, green and white lights.  This is visible clearly with binoculars.  They are much further out in the sky than any aircraft, because I have seen aircraft fly in the sky at altitudes that are are very high at the same time I am observing the flashing lights and the aircraft is far below these lights.  As the night progresses I can see other lights (not stars, I don&#39;t think) appear over the horizon from the northeast.  They seem to form a very large triangle in their positon in the night sky with this lower brighter object.  The two additional light points in the sky (also flashing colors) appear to be much further away than the one I can clearly see at dusk and thereafter. Can you tell me anything about them or has anyone else seen them?<n>

I was in the Marine Corps for four years and just got out recently.  I was stationed in North Carolina.  I had grown up in Massachusetts.  So regardless to say I made a lot of trips up and down the east coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;sighting&#34; took place on rt 95 in virginina.  When driving to North Carolina we had to take rt 95 all the way through.  On that road there are hundreds of exits we pass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin and myself were driving through in December of 2000.  We were driving late at night.  We were maybe 4 to 5 hours from our destination.  The three lane highway had turned to two lanes.  We were still a while away from North Carolina.  Let&#39;s just say 20 to 25 exits away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We passed a Virginia state trooper.  He proceeded to pull us over and give us a citation for speeding.  We accepted the ticket and continued on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediatly following the stop, while we were a little shaken we witnessed lights that seemed to be car headlights heading the worng way on the highway heading right towards us.  Before I had a chance to even react it was gone.  There were no other cars on the highway with us.  Dissmissing it as an optical illusion we checked the exit number.  At that point it was when we realized that we were twenty exit ahead than we just were a minute ago.  Checking the speeding ticket wich had the mile marker and exit on it we realized that over three hours had passed since the citation was written.  Being in the military I am a stickler for details and I had throughly chcecked the information on the citation after I have had recieved it and it was correct with my watch and car stero clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We made it to the base fine, but we were very late and disoriented.  I do not know if that is information that you collect.  I assure you it is not false.  I just wanted to get it off of my chest.  Do what you will with this E-Mail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing that really stood out with the incident and the what caused us to think we were not crazy was the citation.  When we called to get information on the ticket, we were informed that the citation was never written and that no such officer exhisted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you do not think this is a hoax and are interested, you can contact me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Was listening to my police scanner and heard that police were looking for a possible downed aircraft that was sighted going from north to south and veering sharply east.  Home owner reported debri falling from aircraft.  Sky Harbor airport was contacted and knew nothing.  They were also contacting a missle base in Calif. to see if it was possibly a missle.  Last I heard was that nothing was found and it would be classified as &#34;unidentified&#34;. It reportedly had flashing red lights.<n>

This object was very large and very bright. I would have dissmissed it as a shooting star however it stood still for a second, and not to mention its huge size. I lost sight of it as it went below the tree line. A lot of air traffic soon followed (probably the f-18&#39;s or F-15&#39;s from dobbins.<n>

12/25/00 18:30|Buffalo|NY|Formation|1-3 MIN.|On 12/25/00 I witnessed a boomarang shaped object traveling quite fast in the sky, it's shape defined only by it's glowing white light|1/3/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15616.html|61|ndxe200012| On 12/25/00 I witnessed a boomarang shaped object traveling quite fast in the sky, it&#39;s shape defined only by it&#39;s glowing white light<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dec. 25th 2000.....seen by homemaker/housewife Around 6:30pm that evening as I was just about to go in after having just filled my bird feeders for the following day in my back yard, I noticed out of the corner of my eye something unusual in the sky. This object was not a plane, it was not clouds(the sky was clear at that time), it was not the smoke from my neighbors chimney or a falling star(meteor)and it was not a flock of birds flying in formation(although the latter did crosss my mind at first because of the formation it was in but it was traveling much too fast). What I saw was something shaped roughly like a boomarang, it made no sound, left no trail in the sky and the only thing that defined it&#39;s shape was what seemed to be dots of white light, several rows of them. It wasn&#39;t light like starlight or streetlight or any light I have ever seen, it was just white dots of light, glowing white dots. It seemed to be traveling northwest to southeast at the time I saw it and I watched it till the tree branches obscured it and it disappeared over the housetops. It&#39;s shape never fluctuated from this boomarang formation. I stood there saying to myself, &#34;what the @#&amp;* was that?&#34;, and would have probably just left it at that but as I was standing there contemplating what it was I just saw I noticed this same shaped object with the white light further down the horizan. It was further south closer to the downtown area of the city(Buffalo) and now seemed to be traveling east to west till it disappeared.  This thing was so strange I probably would have talked myself out of believing I had seen what I had just seen if I had not seen it twice. After I saw this object the second time further down the horizan I stayed out for probably another 10 minutes or more searching the sky for this thing till my toes were getting numb before going in. I don&#39;t know what it was that I saw that night but I do know what it wasn&#39;t and I&#39;m wondering if there were any other reports in the Buffalo, Western NY area regarding this strang object close to the time I saw it??  Thanks<n>

I was just browsing a very clear sky, since we where very far from the nearest city, so millions of star could be seen. Suddenly I watched an object moving slowly, but making very wide turns. Impossible for an aircraft. Besides it had no other lights like the beacons and nav lights. I removed my eye from the telescope, to check if I was just seeing things, and tried to call my cousin. In that moment, the object started to grow amazingly until it reached maybe 10 times its original size, then disappeared. Sadly no one else could see it. I believe it entered the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in original report was flawed.  We have corrected the date to the year 2000, which is what we presume the witness intended.

(he has severe sight problems.) It looked a lot like one of those firecrackers on july4th that are big and round. it was probably 2 to 3 miles ahead of me, crossing from my right to my left, heading north. the sparks falling downward were white.there was no noise. it just disappeared, as if it shut the light out.<n>

My son was watching TV in the living room.  I heard a sound like a strong wind blowing and the large windows in my bedroom (4X6) &amp; (3X8) started lighting up as if there was lightning outside.  I waited for a few minutes and it continued so I decided to unplug the computer and TV&#39;s.  I went in the living room where we have a 6 X 12 ft window and four other windows down the side of the LR, DR area.  The flashes continued, like lightning although there was no storm, thunder, or black clouds. My son opened the front door to go out but being new to the area I thought if it was lightning, it was dangerous (I lived previously in Arizona). Suddenly the whole field, about six acres and the mountain on the other side of the field and all the property we could see down the side of the house lit up in a very bright light like a giant spot light for about three or four seconds. It really startled us.  Then a red light flashed in the same manner for about one to two seconds.  There were a couple of smaller flashes and then everything just stopped suddenly.  There was the sound of wind and then everything was quiet.  I was new to Idaho and told my sister about it and she said they do not have sheet lightning in the winter.  There was nothing in the local paper re this incident.  I was not going to report it but it has been on my mind and I cannot reach a satisfactory explaination for what we saw.  I wonder if there has been any other reports of bright lights on this date?  I am sure now it was not lightning and I wish we had gone outside to look up in the sky because the light seemed to come down from directly over the house.<n>

This is a small town in Mexico surrounded by the Sierra Madre Mountains.  About eight of us went on a tour of my uncle’s ranch where he raises goats for a living.  He is a goat shepherd and lives looking after these goats in the mountains.  We spent the whole day climbing a hill trying to get to the top.  It was about a mile up to the top.  It took about 2 hours to go up and come back down.  At about 6 or 7 pm, the sun started to set. There was still daylight out so we started packing up and heading back to my uncle’s house.  It was a long drive.  Four of us had to ride in the back of the truck so we had a clear view of the skies. It was a clear winter day.  This was during Christmas week because I remember spending Christmas Eve in Monclova, Coahuila the next day.  As we drove we noticed a white light right above the mountain top.  It just stayed there f! or a few minutes but we thought it might be lights from a car driving down a road so no one really paid much attention.  I was sitting facing the light so from time to time during the chatter with everyone I would look toward the light.  I noticed it started moving in a direct line as if driving the same way we were going.  I thought it was odd a vehicle would be driving so slow.  At this time I brought the attention to everyone else in the group.  We weren’t familiar with the area so we all thought there was a road on the mountain.  We asked my uncle and he said no, it is not possible to drive that far up the mountain.  We then realized he was right.  As we turned a corner we could see the light was not on the mountain, but hovering over it.  We all gasped and watched as it got nearer to us increasing in size.  At first it was so far away it seemed like white car lights, but as it got closer we realized it was one ball of light.  Like an orb, like a meteor.  This orb was t! raveling horizontally across the mountain so we knew it wasn’t! a meteo r.  It never turned off but kept moving at a slow pace as if trying to see what we were up to.  We tried recording it on camera but it was too dark to see.  This is the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen.  My uncles said they see things like this from time to time and other strange things too.  I don’t know what it was, but I know what it wasn’t.  This orb didn’t shoot across the sky and dissappear, no as we got further and further away it traveled back behind the mountain until we couldn’t see it anymore.  This was no flashlight, it had to be bigger than our truck judging from the size and proximity to us in the sky.  Very strange. I have no reason to lie or make this up. This is what we all saw and to this day from time to time we talk about it, not knowing how to explain it.  No there were no sounds coming from this orb. It was very silent.  We were in a remote location, far from any noise of traffic, there were no airplanes or aircraft of any kind in the skies.  This was about eleven years ago. I didn&#39;t know we could report these sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

It was quite low, and kept a steady speed.  It was out of sight very quickly.  There was no sound.  It was silver and cigar shaped from a side view.  I called 911 on my cell phone and it was eventually answered by the Minnesota State Troopers.  The operator told me that he was inundated with calls about this craft.  It was such an unsusual experience that ((Witness #2)) and I looked at each other with our mouths open.  I have also worked with jet aircraft in the military for many years, and this was NOT a jet aircraft.  It left something....a pulse-like wave not in it&#39;s wake, but in front of it.  Apparently, many saw this event while driving, not just on 52, but on perpendicular and parallel roads as well.  The speed and shape were something I&#39;d not witnessed before.  Coupled with it&#39;s lack of ANY noise, it was clearly something new, or something I&#39;d never seen before.  There are NO major airbases in the area.  Not even an airport within 60 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It suddenly slowed noticeably and changed color from red to orange and continuing to slow down it changed to yellow then it just disappeared. I don&#39;t believe that it was a meteorite as not only was it low in the atmosphere and travelling on a level trajectory, but it slowed down very suddenly.<n>
12/23/00 04:00|Toomsuba|MS|Oval|about 2 (two) minutes|A silent solid red oval shaped craft with no blinking lights is sighted in Toomsuba, MS.|1/3/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15660.html|84|ndxe200012| A silent solid red oval shaped craft with no blinking lights is sighted in Toomsuba, MS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday morning approximately 4 a.m. on 12-23-00, I was outside on a clear and cold night watching for shooting stars and anything else that might cross the sky. As I said, the sky was clear and the moon was in or very near its new moon phase. So it was an absolutely perfect observational setting- though it was just below freezing, but I like it cold. The area is rural.  My family&#39;s home sits with neighbors to the left and right or east and west.  In front and across the road of their home (South) is a pasture. Behind (North) it there is woods.  The pasture across the street was logged about two years ago, so there is a stretch of land that is relatively clear of obsticles. Where the property line ends at the pasture, roughly southwest, the tree line picks back up and covers a large portion of the skyline from Southwest all the way back North- there is a small opening westward where the road goes.  Much of the woods behind the house were recently logged as well, but the larger pine trees nearest our property line still stand and take up much of the immediate Northern skyline. Now to the good part.  I had been outside about half an hour and was looking westward after just having seen a dim shooting star in that direction.  I then saw this solid red oval shaped craft, flying very low, come out of, well actually over, the trees to the North. It seemed to be moving from north to south. I studied it intensely to see if there were any flashing lights- there were none.  The object seemed very low, and very close.  I began walking toward it- west along the street. It was moving very slow and made absolutely no sound.  As I walked toward it, its speed noticably increased and very quickly. There were no human defying zig-zags, but it went from a rather large clear red oval shaped craft in front of me to being a rather small vaguely red oval shaped craft much faster than I would have liked or expected.  It seemed to fly directly away from me, and grew perceptively smaller as it went. Also, as I studied it, I think I saw at least two, possibly three different angles of the craft, and it was solid red all around.  Nothing but red light. Well, as I realized that it was moving away from me I ran about 80 yards trying to keep it in sight, but lost it to the treeline as it appeared to be moving first due west away from me, then more of a south westernly direction. I could be off a little or alot on Its last direction due to the treeline, but it was without doubt somewhere between due south and west, but closer to south. After I lost it to the trees (it was also very vague in the distance by this point)  I reluctantly walked back to my parents house and silently mused to myself about the fact that I had just seen a UFO. I do not know of any known man-made objects that move with the its velocity, have no blinking lights at all, and is one solid defining color. Speaking personally for a moment, I must say that the adrenaline rush was amazing. As I ran toward the object, as it made its escape, I was silently calling to it, &#34;come back, please, come back.&#34;  Mercy, I like the awe inspiring feeling of seeing something that perhaps, just perhaps was created on some other planet in some other galaxy far far away- deep within our vast and complex universe.  I find that the nightlife in this small rural town isn&#39;t quite as dull as most here like to believe. :) I don&#39;t know if this goes here, but I have video footage of something that flew through the background of a newscast report.  I was working at a local t.v. station in Meridian, MS at the time.  I was the only one to notice it because it was very light in color and the sky was in that overcast, really hazy and bright way. However, as the report was shown on air, I happened to be watching a small black and white monitor, which effectively took away the excess hazy light, and I could see the object clearly. This thing &#34;did&#34; do human defying manuevers as it zig zagged up through then out of the frame.  I&#39;ve sent a copy of it to Peter Gersten, and I&#39;d be happy to send a copy to the NURC if you want one.  Its brief and not particularly spectacular, but it is definately &#34;something&#34; and its movements defy everything that we&#39;re supposed to be able to do.<n>

Then I realized it was too low to be the moon, and it had a light trail following it. It then disappeared into the glow. The glow stayed, but the &#34;moon&#34; had disappeared. It was the same size and shape as a waning moon, with the dark area on the right; yet the light trail was also on the right, which did not make sense to me. What really didn&#39;t make sense was how fast it disappeared into the glow. The rest of the sky was clouded and black. I tried to keep an eye on the glow, but the mountains were in the way after I passed the straight-away I had been on.<n>

There was a bright moon that night, and very little wind or cloud. The ball appeared to dive downwards into the Goyt Valley (about 2 miles from my house) and it lit the sky up for 3/4 seconds, there was no bang, but i heard sirens coming from the main road going towards the Forest area. Though upon looking at local and national news, there was nothing on what had happened and when i asked about the sirens to the local station, they said it was nothing and for me not to worry.

Horizontal aspect, (ground-upward/lateral field of view began at about, (ground 1, straight up 100) 55-60 on graph.

That particular time we were on the side of town that this sighting appeared to transpire &#34;over&#34;. That night it was in our easternly field of vision. Appearing almost as a flash and close to us location, and we could have sworn it&#39;s decent ended in or between or near the top of two of four or five 10-15 story buildings. One of which is housed with major satellites on the rooftops, (major communications company). What&#39;s the big deal?

As well, it was extremely bright. The evening was exceptionally clear with no moon. My best guess is that the object would have been about 50 miles from me. This would raise the possibility of other reports being files from teh Belleville area as well as perhaps Trenton and Oshawa. If my guess with respect to distance is off, perhaps there might be some reports from Toronto. I watch the sky a great deal and have not seen an object of this nature before. The color and path of descent are the two issues which have compelled me to file this report. Best regards, ((name deleted))<n>

Out of season and disappeared too fast<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this because I saw your 12/19/00 report over the Foxboro (New England Patriots) stadium only recently and it reminded me of what I saw.  On or about the same date at about 5:15 pm on a sunny day at sunset I saw what I thought was the blimp that usually over the stadium. It reflected the reddish orange glow of the sun and was a horizontal oval.  I was on rt 95 north of the stadium about 5 miles and was looking south directly toward the stadium. I observed it for 15 seconds or so and lost sight of it as I went lower into the valley.  I know the area well so I know the object was over the stadium or very close to it.  It would have been 200 to 300 feet long to see it at that distance, about the size of the blimp.  It seemed odd at the time that it would be there because it was too cold for any event and none were in season. When I could view the  stadium area again, in only two or three minutes, it was gone.  The blimp would not have gone so fast. Could you get me in touch with the fellow who reported his sighting in Foxboro so we could compare notes.<n>

The object itself appeared to be a color I have never seen, it was a cross between neon yellow and charturese green.  After staring at the object for under a minute the object appeared to swallow itself, like an octopuses tenacles and move into the distance at speed of light, leaving all 5 lights to appear as one for a brief moment, then vanish all together, the sound as it did this was like a swift breeze with a small suction popping.<n>

It was flying just above the powerlines. It had 2 white lights (like headlights) on the front of it and an orangeish-red light on each side (they were blinking.) It started out on the left of my car, then it flew over the top of my car(I honked my horn as it went over me) and I watched it fly away. I watched it until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. It was headed in a NW direction. I was only a few blocks from home, thank goodness!! It is the type of thing that you&#39;re afraid to call the police about. They might think I was nuts!!<n>

The first time we watched for about two hours. A very bright light, too bright to be a star, that hovers for just about in the same place for several hours, but during that time it will move sideways, stop hover, then move in half circles,then stop and hover again. At one point it started moving very fast toward us (my husband &amp; myself) then it stopped again and hovered. An airplane doesnt hover for several hours in the same place. It has been very cold so we have watched it then gone inside to get warm, then it will at some point be gone when we return outside to look at it. Our dog warned us about it the first time I saw it, he was barking and going nuts. As soon as we spotted it, the dog settled down. Thats the way he reports things to us. He did the same thing when there was an automobile accident on our road. We love about 15 miles from Spokane out in the country. On one occasion we called our neighbor across the road, and he said he has been watching this strange light for several months now. Hasn&#39;t said anything to anybody because he didnt want anyone to think he was crazy. My husband and I on one occasion went driving to the direction of it and when we got to just about where it should have been it was gone. We have seen it on three different nights, so far. I guess thats about it.<n>

Almost as if guided by an invisible force, I walked out the door and stood on the grass, facing the three glowing spacecrafts hovering before me.  &#34;Welcome!&#34; I yelled, as the spacecrafts blinked at me.  Almost without noticing it, I began to float towards the craft until I was hovering before it&#39;s entrance.  The door opened as I hovered inside.  I then played cards with the Aliens and we bad breakfast together before we reluctanly bid eachother goodbye and went our separate ways.  The End.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.

I thought it might be a jet so I kept walking.  Right before I went in I started to think a second and realized I heard no jet sound.  So i watched it go through the sky as I walked down the street following it, trying to listen for a sound.  I couldn&#39;t hear any.  I got a little freaked out, but thought my imagination was getting the best of me so I started walking back home.  On the way I saw another one coming the same direction from the same side {right side facing down my driveway).  I thought maybe the craft had spun around so I looked back and in the distance I saw the other one I had previously seen.  So I stopped and watched it also.  It also flew fairly fast, and faster than any helicopter or commercial plane I had seen.  Again I listened, but I still heard no sound.  I stood and watched the two crafts go off onto the horizon.  That happened within 2 minutes.  I stood in awe wondering what I had seen for about 30 seconds when I saw another &#34;blinking&#34; light go through the sky from the same direction on the left side of me.  It was going a bit faster then the other 2 and I watched and listened as carefully as I could as it also traveled to the horizon.  It crossed the whole sky in about 15-25 seconds.  I stood there for about 5 minutes after, watching for any other objects but didnt see any.  I coudn&#39;t tell the shape of it at all.  All I saw was a &#34;blinking&#34; light.  By blinking I mean, I saw a white light flash at different times.  It definitely didn&#39;t look like an actual light blinking.  It looked more like the objects were spinning and a piece of the object was shiny or a metal of somthing that reflects light.  It looked as if that piece of the object was reflecting a light source from which I could not tell.  The moon wasn&#39;t out at the time so I figured it wasnt that.  The sky was completely clear so I don&#39;t think it was a spotlight on the clouds either.  Thats all I know! .  The o nly observer was myself.  I&#39;m 17 years old, white male, I go to Woodlawn High School, I&#39;ve never seen had any spotting before.<n>

This occured in the South East portion of the sky. These two objects moved at an incredable speed over a very large area of the sky and both did not have running lights on them like a normal aircraft would. What attracted me most, was the way they moved about. No airplane nor helicopter could ever move about like this. I took ground school and have done some flying to know better. I, am an ex-military Aviation Ordnanceman as well as an Electrical Engineer. The law of physics does not apply to the two objects viewed tonight. As I, ran for the camcorder to return and video these two objects, they were gone.<n>

12/17/00 19:10|Bolingbrook|IL|Light|35 minutes|Bright twinkling light hovered for 35 minutes southwest of Chicago, IL.|12/20/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15498.html|119|ndxe200012| Bright twinkling light hovered for 35 minutes southwest of Chicago, IL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday December 17, 2000 I spotted a light in the western night sky around 7:10 p.m. CST while driving in my car at the intersection of Route 83 and Route 171 (Archer Avenue) which is on the outskirts of Lemont, IL (southwest of Chicago).  The night was clear, cloudless and cold with the temperature hovering around 0 degrees F.  The light was approximately 30 degrees above the horizon and at first I thought it was a star because of the twinkling light it emitted.  But it seemed too bright and low on the horizon to be a star or a planet.  I continued to drive north on Route 83 and then merged onto Interstate 55 (Stevenson Expressway) heading in a southwest direction. The light was still in the same position when I headed southwest on I-55; the time now was about 7:15 p.m.  I still thought that the light was probably a star at this time.  About 15 minutes later I passed Route 53 in Bolingbrook, IL and the object remained in the same position.  At this time I ruled out that it was a commercial jet/plane coming in to land at O&#39;Hare International airport.  All planes coming in to land at O&#39;Hare will fly by within 5 - 10 minutes; it had now been 20 minutes since I first spotted the light.  Within the next few minutes I noticed the light to twinkle more and once or twice blink out for between 1/2 to 1 seconds (this is only an approximation).  There also seemed to be a slight change in altitude in that the light descended just a bit.  I then exited I-55 and proceeded north on Weber Road (between Bolingbrook and Romeoville, IL).  I then turned west onto 119th St. and drove several miles further to Book Rd. (just south of Naperville, IL across from the Naperville polo club) and turned south onto Book Rd. stopping to observe the light from a stationary position.  At the same time a white pickup truck also stopped on Book Rd. behind me just north of 119th (to observe the light I assume).  The light remained hovering in the sky in a position WSW of me.  I was now close enough to it to discern only that it was no! t a star .  Its altitude was not easy to determine, but I did notice that planes, some distance behind the light flying into O&#39;Hare airport, were higher.  After a minute or two the light grew in intensity and became very bright, it appeared to twinkle with multiple red and white lights.  At this time (now about 7:45 p.m.) I decided to get out of the car to take a picture, but I was too late.  The light disappeared.  I would estimate that the light was midway between the towns of Bolingbrook, IL and Yorkville, IL.<n>

I would guess the size to be approximately that of the wing span of a boeing 727.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be hightly credible.

Getting out of the car, my son and I watched a perfectly round, light yellow ball glow eerily for at least ten minutes.  The ball was about 1.5 to 2 degrees in diameter.  In binoculars, it was an unevenly lit ball that would occasionally flare up brightly or dim down to nothing.  Although it did not change position in the sky while we watched it, we did notice a wobble that on close inspection appeared to be the motion of this ball around a central axis.   My son says that when I entered our home to retrieve the camera, he observed the ball fall and rise 3-5 degrees with a falling-leaf type motion.  Although an entire disc could be seen, under magnification, the glow of the disc was not even.  It was more brightly lit at the 7 o&#39;clock position, and faded to near darkness at the 2 o&#39;clock position.  Though this seems more consistent with external lighting, none was observed, and both of us feel that the object was emitting visible light.  No other lights were associated with this object. Although estimating distance of this object would be very hard, my guess would be at least five miles, maybe as far as twenty five.  The ball remained fixed in the southeastern sky, 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon.  The lighting of the object appeared to be internal.  I thought maybe it was a balloon or blimp lit internally for some reason, but it did not seem to move or behave the way I&#39;d expect.  Except for the axial motion, the object I observed was rock-steady in the sky.  We first saw it about 18:00, and about fifteen minutes later, it just winked out. The lights of several aircraft were observed in the same binocular field during the sighting.  The object did not appear to react to the aircraft, or vice versa.  I did take photographs with a 35mm camera and 200mm telephoto lens, but I don&#39;t expect much<n>

I was on on a flat stretch of state route 503 headed South from Fargher Lake.  The area is on a well travelled flight path to Portland Intl.Airport., so I hesisitated to send this in.  It possibly was an airplane, but it was very strange and I never got a conclusive I.D.  I have been in the service but still haven&#39;t figured out what I &#34;saw&#34;?  I saw a very, very, bright light, so bright the only thing I could imagine was a chrome jet or airplane , reflecting the sun in a very freak fashion.  Definitely bigger than a landing light apporoximately at 45degrees from the Southern horizon.  I thought it was a plane, but it was strange enought to pull off the road.  I watched as traffic sped by , everyone in a scurry going to work or holiday shopping.  The craft turned, the light was gone, but it just didn&#39;t look like an airplane, jet, but yet flew as if it could be.  The light was sooo big for the plane or craft to be so far off, that I wouldn&#39;t even ID it within a minute.  I watched it travel off on a Northwesterly direction, but still couldn&#39;t discern a clear image of a conventional aircraft.  I then was told by a friend that all planes are painted.  Whatever it was cause a very bright white ball, and if it was a glint from the sun, it was a very freakish event.  I am saying it was a UFO in nature to me.  Wish I had the camcorder.

A huge, black triangular craft hovering, I estimate, about 300 feet above the ground(not entirely sure) It had three red-orange lights on each point of the craft and one bright blue-white light in the middle that shone on the ground. It looked like a searchlight. The object just hovered on one place for a while. when we passed it, it moved in a circular movement across the road behind us. I did not hear any sounds, but the thing gave me cold shivers. I felt kind of connected to the thing in a way. My parents, although freaked out in a way, thought it was probably some millitary craft.

I love to watch those UFO shown on Discovery and TLC.  But I do so for entertainment purposes.  I think, or thought, the whole UFO thing was a bunch of bunk. But last night I saw something that was truly unknown to me.  I was standing outside a ham radio friend&#39;s house and we were talking about amateur satellites.  There were four of us in this group. A kid in the group started pointing out constelations.  When I started looking at what he was pointing out, I noticed what I thought was a satellite.  It appeared to be a star which was moving from south to north, and it tracked almost straight overhead. It looked just like a low orbit satellite (I&#39;ve seen many of those before) but it was moving much too fast.  A low orbit satellite would take about 10 minutes to track across the night sky.  This object took under a minute. There were no flashing lights or sounds associated with this object.  In fact, I told the others it was probably a satellite, but I later decided that it couldn&#39;t have been.  Then I thought it could have been a piece of space junk entering the earth&#39;s atmosphere, but this object left no trail or flaming debris. I have ruled out in my mind all the possibilities.  As much as I hate to admit it, I have seen an Unidentified Flying Object. If you guys know what this light could have been, I would love to hear back from you.  I&#39;m all out of explanations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness was observing either &#34;Mir&#34; or the International Space Station passing overhead.  PD))<n>

My first thought was &#34;What is the sun doing up at midnight?&#34;  As the ridiculousness of this thought hit me, I sat up and put on my glasses. As I focused on the object it slowly descended behind the ridge top; a smaller whitish-blue light at the top of the object flashed once (like a strobe light) before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s hard to say how large the object actually was, but the ridge summit is about one-half mile from my house, and the object looked somewhat like the size of the sun as it rises or sets. A couple of days later, I learned that a neighbor in the area also had a similar experience at about the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am presently a psychoanalyst in private practice. Before I changed careers, I was chief of a large fire protection district in the western U.S., and had training in fire investigation. Before that I was a naturalist with the National Park Service, and have long been a student and observer of nature. I consider myself to be a curious, careful and scientifically oriented observer. This was about my 12th sighting of an object that I do not consider to have originated on Earth.<n>

I watched it for about 5 seconds thinking it was an airplane getting ready to land at the nearby airport. It was moving from east to west at what I would consider normal aircraft speed, and then all of a sudden it snapped like it was connected to a large rubberband and flew back toward the east. I was in the military for 10 years and law enforcement for 6 and I&#39;ve never seen anything move that fast. It was gone and out of sight within less than a second. It was a real creepy experience.<n>

It was about 9:00pm and very cold out (on the verge of freezing). I happened to look up and to my surprize a flare-like object shot throught the sky as if it had been fired out of a gun. It was faster than anything I have ever seen before.  My initial thought was that of a bottle Rocket, but no bottle rocket travels at the speed that this thing was moving.  The most interesting part of this is that the object fired off from a central point in the sky. Its as if the object was floating and then just suddenly blasted off. The object immediately formed a vapor trail.  This was the strangest vapor trail I have ever seen in that it had a vibrant white glow and it sort of looked like a dark blueish outline formed around the edges of the trail.  I am possitive that it wasnt a space shuttle landing, because I have seen the trail that forms from a space shuttle and this was far bigger and brighter.  Once again, nothing has ever passed my eyes at the speed that this thing was traveling.  I also noticed that although it seemed like it was only 200 or so feet above me at the start, as I drove into a clearing over Lake Travis (right by Mansfeild Dam) the trail looked like it was 5 miles high.  I have explained my sighting to the best of my memory.  I must say that this has opened my eyes a little to the possibility of extraterrestrial airships.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Its speed seemed normal but, it flew a little low and close to my house. This wasn&#39;t a normal flight path. It slowed down, almost hovered for about one minute, at about 100 to 200 yards from my home, over a woodened area. Its strobing light was at the tip of a short appendage, which was off to one side of the craft. As the craft moved, slowly, this strobing light moved, clock-wise, around, towards the right side of the craft. Some of the strobe&#39;s light illuminated the craft&#39;s body, during the flashes which, revealed its very, dull, graphite-colored surface and oblong, rounded, disk-like shape. It had no protruding wings. I saw no other lights on it, other than, a few small areas of very unusual, dim, multi-colored lights, along the sides of its body.  There was a slight rotation of the craft, as it hovered, before, moving west, at moderate speed. As it departed, its strobe was, now, on its right side and no longer at the front of the moving craft.I heard no sound from this craft. For about ten minutes, about ten smaller crafts flew by, one by one, following it. This is a lot of one-way air traffic for Brighton Township!<n>

I&#39;ve been seeing about four UFOs per year in recent years although, my first sighting occurred during the 60&#39;s, though, this is only the second sighting I&#39;ve ever reported. My first reported sighting was of a black triangle, on 12/09/00 about a mile from this sighting. I&#39;ve seen about 20 UFOs in my lifetime and all of them have occurred within this two mile radius. I&#39;ve begun to noticing that these UFOs tend to &#34;wink-out&#34; at similar points in the sky and I think that these similar locations might indicate some sort of flight path or &#34;entrance-exit doorway of some kind.&#34; I really don&#39;t like seeing them. They baffle my mind quite a bit. Anyway, I drew this image at a friend&#39;s request and thought I might as well send it to the UFORC, too. :-) My report : At 6:25 PM, from my kitchen window, on December, 15th, 2000, I noticed a large, intensely, bright, bluish-white strobing light flying north from the Beaver or Vanport area of western Pennsylvania . Its speed seemed normal but it flew unusually low and close to my house and was perhaps, only 200 feet away from me for 5 seconds or so. This wasn&#39;t a normal flight path. As the strobe flashed, about once per second, it  illuminated the craft&#39;s body, momentarily and, I could then, see that this craft was oblong, wingless, disk-like and of a dull, dark, brownish-gray color. There were also a few areas of very hazy, dimly lit, multi-colored light, of red and yellow-green, around the right side of the craft which,  seemed like windows but with no apparent structural definition or frame work around them. These window-like areas seemed to merge with the surface of the craft&#39;s outer surface. The disk seemed to be about15 feet wide as, it passed just behind a tall tree in my yard.  I heard no noise from this craft at this close grange nor at any other time. Immediately after this craft passing by my window, it made a sharp 45 degree, westerly turn, towards an open field and hovered about 100 feet above the ground. about 75 yards from my window. This dark craft had no other lights. At this angle, the disk looked very black except for the small surface area being illuminated by its flashing strobe.  Although, the outer countours of the craft were  barely distinguishable from the darkness of the surrounding landscape, the craft&#39;s slight drifting movements provided  me with some indication of its disk-like shape. The strobe was located at the tip of a short, thin appendage, about three or four feet in length, along the center portion of the disk&#39;s side.  As the craft moving very slowly  westerly while low in the field and about100 feet from the ground, I noticed that its strobing light seemed to be rotating, clockwise about a fourth of the way around the side of the disk. But perhaps, there is another was of viewing this apparent rotation. I noticed, too, that this strobe light was always pointing towards the north, even though, this craft was in the process of making a sharp, 45 degree turn towards the west and the strobe light was always pointing north, in spite of the disk&#39;s varying flight path . This fixed, northernly directed pointing of the strobe&#39;s appendage  remained consistent throughout my sighting or at least, during the time that I could  see the craft clearly before, it departed far into the west.  When the strobe was at it closest, low over the field, I could see this strobe&#39;s appendage wavering, back and forth, a few feet CW then, CCW, every three seconds or so as it hovering. This slight wavering or gliding back and forth movement of the appendage sort of reminded me of the subtle wavering of a compass needle. These wavering movements were quite obvious though, not perfectly rhythmic or uniform in the length or duration of each swing. This disk then, stopped and hovered, a seconds time, about 250 to 300 feet above ground and about 150 yards away.  The strobe no longer at this disk&#39;s front end, as it had been during its approach towards my house from the south, was now casting enough light upon the craft&#39;s surface to illuminate and reveal its very dull, dark brownish-gray color, very faintly. This color resembled that of a darkened, tarnished penny though the craft, itself, always looked very black in the areas not being illuminated by the strobe. I observed this craft for about one minute before it continued on westward, at a slightly higher altitude and speed than that of an airliner. As this craft gradually faded out of sight in the distant western sky, it didn&#39;t visually descend towards the horizon but rather remained high in the mid-sky.  The sky was very heavily over-cast at that time and no stars were visible. As the craft headed west, I sighted smaller crafts following it. These crafts flew passed, one by one, about one minute apart, over a period of about ten mintues. Each followed the disk&#39;s path, though, none of these smaller crafts flew in close to my house and hovered there.  All of these smaller crafts flew directly in the direction of the departing disk.  These crafts, also, flew slightly faster than airliners and they did make engine noise. One flew close enough that I could see its underside with binoculars (I hadn&#39;t had time to grab them when I really needed them for viewing the disk) With binoculars, I could see two bright, bluish-white, flashing lights, one on each of its wing tips. These bluish-white, alternatingly, flashing lights seemed to create the illusion of a blue line running from wing tip to wing tip, on the underside of the plane.   Or perhaps, I was actually seeing a single light that moving rapidly from one wing tip to the other, in a manner similar to how I might draw long lines of light in the air by waving or writing in the air with a hand held flashlight. When viewing the closest of these approaching small planes, its bright flashing bluish-white lights would reflect back upon the underside of its wings which seemed to be unusually broad and of a similar color to that of the disk, itself. Towards the rear on its underbelly were two broad clusters of non-blinking, dimly lit lights. One cluster was red and the other amber. In side view, from a distance, these crafts displayed what appeared as a single small, yet, very bright, flashing light that alternating between rhythmic flashes of jerky pink and white light.  The disk&#39;s strobing light, on the other hand, seemed to more in a straighter, smooth line without this visual jerky motion. I noticed no electrical disturbances during my sighting.<n>

We each had a cigarette, he returned inside.  We were together about 3 min, a truck pulled up then the driver pulled the truck into the bay and went inside. I was looking up in the sky, as we have a very large crane in front of the building, I was looking at the top of the crane, amazed at its height.   (The crane being so tall was folded in half, or collapsed, there were no construction workers around anymore.) Looking East, there is an UPS office, with another larger building a block behind that one.  Over the top of the 2nd building, I was what appeared to be an airplane at a very high altitude. It appeared to be moving quite slow.  It was small, and appeared to be very high up (miles).  It was noticeably black in color. As it moved from East to West, I remarked to myself that it no longer looked like an aircraft, but it looked more like a flock of birds flying; it a appeared to be in a &#34;formation.  This was not a &#34;strict&#34; V formation, as it looked sort of, well, like a flock of birds. Then the object stopped moving.   It seemed as if it was hovering, or just stopped moving. It remained in the same position for about 2-min, but the shape of the object changed again.  It looked more like a small black square, with a small protrusion on its side.  I do not recall actually seeing any physical change occur, but it was a different shape that when I first viewed it.<n>

It hung in the air and several people witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 7:30 this December night. Not particularly cold outside. Directly north of my house, I looked up to see a mysterious, glowing cloud. It was eerie because it was cloudy that evening, slightly foggy. I was leaving the house to go to our bookmobile as we do almost every Thursday night. When I saw it, I couldn&#39;t believe that this glowing formation was real. It made no sound. The air was crisp and it carried no sound. I went running back in to call my boys to come and see, that took at least 30 seconds and it was still there when we came outside to see it. We gazed at it for at least two minutes. It looked quite close, close enough to see the shape of the light emitted from within the formation. It was oval, a long oval that wasn&#39;t defined. It was almost like, being close enough behind a curtain, that the people on the other side can see your shape, but not you. If I held me arm out at shoulder length, I would say it was the length of my thumb. Up high in the sky at about 45% angle. Low enough to see that it&#39;s close, but not so close. It looked like it could&#39;ve been 1/2 away, but because of the formation and the play of light, it could be much farther away. We couldn&#39;t see what made the light. We started walking and I saw a beam come out from the top,  it stopped for a split second. Then the beam went to the 10 0&#39;clock position. Again, paused for a slit second and then went to 8 0&#39;clock. It paused there and moved to six o&#39;clock. It then retraced it&#39;s steps and the beam at midnight shot back into the cloud from whence it came. It then just melted away. It was gone quickly. The beam was perpendicular all the way along. It did not seem to start out as a slit and then become a circle which becomes wider as the beam lengthened. The end of the beam being much wider than the spot from which it originates. Of course, when we got to the bus, I told at least three people what I had seen and about four of us were talking about the glow, &#34;oh you saw it too!&#34;. Only one lady saw the beam, just the way I saw it. We knew it was otherworldly, but we thought it was weird that we couldn&#39;t figure out what had made it.<n>

I was with my Mom on the terasse of our house, to watch the starts as we usually do in winter time -- Orion is my favorite constellation. I&#39;m talking about this experience here for the first time officially. I did not know such a thing as your center existed before today, when I accidentally ended on your page. Well, so I was saying that I went out to watch the starts with my Mom, when -after 20 minutes of observing the sky- we both saw at the same time a sort of light, more intense than this of the stars, but not very neatly. My Mom asked me if I could have an idea on what it could be, but I couldn&#39;t answer, as I was realizing that this light we had just seen seemed to be getting closer and to move in a strange way, like no other planes or helicopters do -- and I know what I&#39;m talking about, as I used to live next to an airport. My Mom&#39;s eyes and mine were stuck on the light, which gradually became a sort of oval-like ship. We also quickly realized that it was shortly followed by 2 others, smaller, but with the same radiance and the same abnormal movement. The whole phenomenon lasted for less than a minute, however I will never forget it. I couldn&#39; believe it, but I had my Mom next who coul tell me that it really happened. We often talk about this speial night together, but only when we are the 2 of us - even my Dad don&#39;t want to hear about it. I hope I have found with you someone who will not judge so abruptly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS: I am sorry, my English is far from being fluent, but I hope you&#39;ll not have a hard time to understand the whole event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There seems to be increased activity around the harwich area essex england. Here is the email we recieved. So these are the details.  We were lucky as Sharon keeps a diary so we looked it up to get the date right. Was 13th December about 8pm ish  looked up to see a streak of what looked like greeny-blue fire going horizontal across the sky.  Looked very close and very fast.  Lasted longer and much bigger than your average shooting star.  It was one of the really windy nights and first considered a flare from lifeboat or ship being blown off course, but was going way too fast and too horizontal for that no matter how strong the wind was.  At the time I thought it was maybe a meteorite pretty close.  Was quite something though, never seen the like of it.  Only other thing i just thought was - when did the fire on the Mia Space Station start????  Could it have been that ?  I think considering the height above the earth of Mia, was too fast.  I did see the Mia docked with the shuttle a few years ago and that looked much slower.<n>

At first it was two white lights and a flashing red light. It started to move away from me very rapidly. Then all its lights started to flash and it looked as though there was more than the three orginal lights flashing. The area around where I saw these lights is flat with the outskirts of my village to one side of it. The rest is fields. It is in the heart of the Countryside. 20 minutes later I wondered if I could still see the lights so I looked out of my Bedroom Window and I couldn&#39;t see them at all.<n>

As I looked,I saw light moving maybe 20-30 degrees to the left of this star. I observed 3 lights in a triangle configuration moving from south to north. This configuration of lights moved south to north at a speed I judge to be supersonic. As I watched it,the spacing between the lights,and the intensity of the lights remained constant. Also there was absolutely no sound. After it was gone,I waited for about 30 seconds before I came in the house, to tell my wife and report this.During this 30 seconds,I heard no sound at all. I observed this for about 5-10 seconds.<n>

Then the lights moved very quickly in different directions.  At first they looked like stars, but when they started moving very rapidly and stoping on a dime it made me and my friend realize that this was something really weird, almost scary.  Then the lights became three lights, moving in all sorts of directions in almost a pattern like.  Then they moved very quickly and rapidly across the sky.  After that we struggled to find a video camera.  We ruturn to see the lights moving still accross the sky in different directions and stopping on a dime again.  It was like they were hovering, ten moving, then hovering then moving again.  Then the lights disapeared.  We then saw at least a dozen military jets converging on the area from three difernt directions.  My companion thought they were travelling from the direction of various military bases in the area.<n>

These lights from left to right where red, white and green in a triangurlar formation with the white light slightly above the other two, these lights did not flicker or fade or change colors and remained intact and did not devate from it&#39;s west south west course.  These lights where very very bright and stood out cleanlly on a bright and sunny day with no clouds in the area at all.  We looked at them for a short time maybe two mins and then each other, at that time we did not know what we saw, but as I looked around behind us I saw 4 high alltitude jets pursuing in the direction of the lights at a high rate of speed with enough alltitude to leave contrails behind them, they criss crossed the sky several times in an attempt to intercept the lights.  As the jets passed over head I remarked to my wife that what ever it was the naval air base at Brunswick Maine had scrambled jets to check it out, as I pointed them out to her she saw exactly what I saw, 4 jets trying to vecter an intercept course with the lights in the west south west sky.  We first noticed the lights some where between Portland and Kittery, The jets as far as we saw did not catch up to the lights. When we crossed the bridge at Kittery heading back into NH our view of the sky changed due to landscape in that area and could no longer see the jets nor the lights. I believe that the lights we saw was not any type of aircrft I&#39;ve ever seen and most certainlly had to have been seen by many motorist on I-95 So. as the traffic was moderate to heavy that day and it was so Bright that you would need to be blind not to see it, still to this day I&#39;ve heard of no reports of this sighting and have checked newspapers from NH and Maine from then till now. Also I believe that it was picked up on radar at Brunswick naval air base and the air p! ort at p ortland. My wife and I are of sound mind and very honest and creditable folks and have worked in the electronic warfare divisions of several firms for many years and have seen some unbelievable technologies being developed, but this was unlike any thing we had ever seen before. My only misgiven is that on that day I had no camera with me.<n>

He was out there for a few minutes, 3-5 minutes before I came out. As I came out I could hear a the sound of humming like a jet engine. I stepped off my porch onto the driveway and heard a loud close, rushing sound speed away. I looked up and saw a shape moving off over the trees. I thought it must have been a fighter jet. When I heard the sound my son said, &#34; Mom did you see that plane?&#34;, I said, &#34;well, I heard it&#34;. He said, &#34;It was weird &#39;cause it was round&#34;. I said oh, did you see it?. Reply &#34; Yeah I was watching it for a while.&#34; I said, &#34;Did it move slowly?&#34; Reply, &#34;No, it was just sitting there looking at me, then it flew away.&#34; Then he said, &#34; It had these two things sticking out the front.&#34; It had a red light on one side and a green one on the other.&#34; Quite non-chalantly he said, &#34;If I see it again, I&#39;ll point to it for you&#34; We had very low cloud cover that morning. I wondered if he saw a plane in the clouds. I asked if he saw a fuzzy shape in the clouds but he insisted it was a clear large shape under the clouds. It could not have been more than 300 ft up. He drew me a picture of it. Then he drew another one and I helped him to label it.<n>

Don&#39;t know what else to say...There was a film student from the local jr. college who happened to have a video camera (she was unsure that the quality of it would collect images well in the given light of pre-dawn) who I may be able to refind some morning should you feel it worth pursuing.<n>

All three times i was driving and the light seemed to literally come out of houses on one side of the road and disappear into houses on the opposite side. All three times the objects were seen within a square mile radius. Tonight, the light seemed to appear out of the middle of a vacant field and hovered south-bound about 15-25 feet above the ground (tree level) and disappeared into nearby house rooftops.<n>

We talked about the location of the airport and the speed of what we had seen. I also told Mom I had seen a similar object some days before. I don&#39;t know what we saw that night, but I know it wasn&#39;t natural.<n>

At first we thought it was a helicopter with unusually bright anti-collision lights, but the light wasn&#39;t white, it was yellow/orange, like a campfire. The size at first was approximately 3 to 4 times the size of Venus, which was visible in the west at that time. We turned off the radio to hear it, but there was no sound. As we watched, it gradually travelled south over the house, and we were still thinking it was a helicopter, but that is was on fire inside. As it travelled south, it gradually slowed down. A bit past our chimney, the object stopped, and just hovered in place for about 2 minutes, while we watched it flicker. There was no pulse or regularity to the flickering. The object began to move again, this time towards the northeast, and faster. Then it appeared to turn away from us.  The &#34;flames&#34; were no longer so easily seen, and it ascended and disappeared. We live in a very heavy aircraft traffic area, and this object did not display any normal navigation or anti-collision lights.<n>

After commenting on this, we all hurried outside to witness the event. Soon on the lawn, we became aware that the craft was much closer (within 3-5 miles) than originally thought and was moving in differning directions. I had the 11 year old get the sony camcorder from the house and I recorded the following: The craft is filmed for about 2 minutes moving in differing directions. Definietly not a helicopter or plane. There appeared to be two-three distinct lights on the craft, but could have been more. It is seen traveling behind a pine tree in the distance (the tree being about 200 yrds off) and slowly is lost from the field of vision. There may have been one other such craft in the sky at the time, but I was unable to capture both objects simultaniously on film. I have retained the footage and intend to have it analyzed<n>

I happened to look up to my right when I saw a row of dim lights, what seem to be close, right above me (about 200yards ) It could have been one thing or four seperate things. They made no noise- hum or buzzing- nothing. It moved a little faster than I was walking. The four lights did not blink or flash, they were very dim. If I was not looking right at them I would not have seen them.In about 15 seconds it was ahead of me. I started to run in the direction it was moving. I&#39;m not sure but it might have increased it&#39;s speed than disapeared over the sight line. I tried to tell myself that it was the belly of birds reflecting light from a near by Hospital&#39;s parking lot lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I had been looking out the window periodically to see if I could see any lightning strikes.  It was slightly foggy also.  The storm was over and I was about to go to bed when I noticed a light coming though the window shades.  I opend the blinds and in my neighbors yard about 100 yars away and only around 30 feet in there air, a very bright object was glowing infront of some trees.  It was ovalish and one end was slightly tilted up.  The thing had a metalic, band through the middle with atleast 3, round, bright windows that did not seem to orbit the craft.  It was very bright but did not seem to light up and trees around it.  The ball of light was bright yellow, with long rays of light coming off of it, like the Rising Sun in the Japanese flag. The metalic band was silver/white, and was slightly brighter then the yellow.  The windows were even brighter and may have been spot lights, they were yellow also.  I had only seen it for a second or two when it started to move slowly twards the South East, it passed behind a few trees then back into the open and into my other nighbors back yard.  It had moved over  about 40 or 50 feet, and had gained about 10 feet in altatude (it was moving diaganaly).  It quickly dimmed, a tiny bit then disapeared giving the impression that it moved faster then the speed of light.  I did not hear anything at that time.  It seemed like the craft knew I was looking at it so it disapeared. And the next day I rememberd also seeing a shadow move infront of one of the  windows, but I am not sure if I actually saw it.  I have no idea what that was,  could it have been a ball of lightning?  I could also tell the next day that the UFO was atleast as big as a riding lawn mower.. Later that night I heard a two toned buzzing sound that sounded like something was idling and somthing else was spining at the same time.     Disk shaped with a very bright opaque aura or an oval with a band through the middle,  ver! y odd.<n>

I woke my husband and asked him , &#39;&#39;WHAT IS THAT NOISE?&#34;.  He listened and said &#34;I don&#39;t know &#34; and run to the window toward the side of the noise. Not seeing anything he ran to the den and approached the window facing the side of the house the noise was emmitting from. It became louder and faster in a burst of noise suddenly faded off. The dogs and cat had been barking continally while the niose was present and immediately quietened after the noise stopped. It was unlike anything we have ever heard. My Husband said what ever was outside saw him come toward the window as it speed up the beat and vanished. Our dogs are out loose as we live in the country and only bark at strange animals or people.  We had our christmas lights on outside and inside the house. Could it have been attracted to the lights of the christmas tree?  The window my husband approached had wood blinds partially opened so outsiders could see the lights easily.  We have a large pasture next to the house-1/2 mile or so. It was a noise with a fast variable beep similar to the sound a touch tone phone makes on redial but more defined and scaled variable beeps. Their are no electical or phone lines outside that side of the house. I would be interested if anyone has had similar  events or if an explaination could be given.<n>
12/9/00 21:00|Beaver|PA|Triangle|1.30|Like a red traffic light, behind the trees, it flew in unison with a light too, bright to be an approaching plane.|12/20/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15456.html|173|ndxe200012| Like a red traffic light, behind the trees, it flew in unison with a light too, bright to be an approaching plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On December, 9th, 2000, about 9PM, while driving north, on Dutch Ridge Road, in Brighton Township, PA. alone, after having attending a funeral gathering, I noticed two bright, non-blinking lights of equal size, moving in unison, side by side (horizontally) in the northwest sky, behind some trees. The left light was a yellow-white color which, equalled the brilliance of an approaching aircraft headlight but, slightly larger and less &#34;amber&#34; in color. The light just to its right was of equal size but very red. It resembled a red traffic light more than, an aircraft&#39;s smaller red running lights. These lights were moving slowly and in an area where I don&#39;t usually see planes flying that low. After catching glimpses of them, behind trees, I drove onto Maplewood Drive and stopped my car, for a better look. The craft was, now, almost overhead and it seemed, unusually large (about two or three fingers wide, at arms length). It&#39;s altitude seemed low, too and, if it were flying at an airliner&#39;s altitude than, it would have been huge. Except for the five lights, on its underside the craft was very dark and, barely moving. On its underside were three dim, non-blinking, rounded, yellow-white lights, one at each corner. At the center of its underside were two smaller, alternately pulsing lights, one red with a smaller, white light, beside it. These alternately, pulsing lights, created a confusing mix of red, pink and white flashing light with a very faint, pinkish haze flickering beneath it. But none of these lights were as large nor as bright, as, those seen during the craft&#39;s approach and departure. While overhead, the object seemed to be barely moving, yet, rotating slightly, to its right (about 20 degrees in 5 seconds). After this turn, it then, began to move, noticeably, forward and gradually, it picking up speed. Only then, did I notice that this triangle was flying backwards, with two corners towards its front and one towards its rear. As it flew towards the southern horizon or towards Vanport, I saw three large, bright, non-blinking, hazy, yellow-white lights, evenly spaced (horizontally) in a row, across its rear side. This craft seemed to be flying into a hazy, gray luminous fog as it departed. This haze might have been only the effects from lights from town but, then, I&#39;ve never noticed large, bright, hazy, yellow-white lights, like these, on any aircraft, at night. I didn&#39;t notice any sound. My car&#39;s engine might have masked them, though. This sighting&#39;s duration was about 60 to 90 seconds. I&#39;ve now, had three triangular sightings, all within a mile of each other. The first was during the summer of 1999 and the seconds was in February of 2000. Both flew with one or more immensely smaller companion crafts. All three occurred around 9PM.<n>

She let me know about it and we went out side to look. Sure enough we could see it clearly. A deep red glowing light hovering high in the sky. We observed it through binoculars and it was without a doubt this &#34;Bubba&#34; object that I&#39;ve heard about.

I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be 4 stars lined up in a straight row above the moon.  I waited for my husband to put down what he was carrying to tell him to look at the stars. Just as I pointed them out to him, the two &#34;stars&#34; to the south suddenly started moving!  They accelerated very rapidly and disappeared within just a couple of seconds.  They did not fade out or anything, they just started moving and then disappeared.  My husband and I both saw it very clearly. They were moving way too fast to be any kind of aircraft I know of. There was no sound at all.<n>

As I continued to watch this light I noticed it would travel across the  horizon it would travel slowly ,seem to stop or disappear and reappear a great distance away. It would jump from one spot to another very quickly.Soon another light appeared above the first and another above the second light and all three objects traveled together then would split up in different directions and then reappear one ontop of the other as if looking for something. I watched this for a couple of hours off and on. Because of the cold weather I finally went in for the night. I tried to video tape the objects ,but my camera would not focus inthe night sky.<n>

I was totally freaked out because I&#39;ve never seen such white bright lights before!!!  As I pulled over to the right curb, I looked up once more and the disc was gone.  It couldn&#39;t have been the street lights because every single one of the lights were dead. I encountered another disc out passed Bakersfield, California.  My mother and I were coming from a trip to Los Angeles and as she was driving, I was glacing through the sky when I encountered a round, circle craft.  It appeared one second and the next minute it disappeared.  This went on for like at least 30 mins or so.  I might add that the craft was changing colors, but it was appearing one second and then disappearing the next minute. ((name deleted))<n>

I was drawn to a star which was in a westernly direction from where I was. I thought at first it was an aeroplane or helicopter, but watching it for a few minutes it didn&#39;t move, so I thought it must be a star even though it was foggy. I looked through the binoculars and could see it was winking red,white and green lights. I was interested because I have seen a star overhead at times like this before, but thought it had changed it&#39;s position. As I watched, it turned into a solid red circle, after which it straightened out to a worm shape with some white along the side, also turning into an oblong shape. I must have watched for about twenty minutes while it was changing mostly from a circle to a straight line. A second one came from behind some trees and passed out of sight. I know it was the same but cannot remember now how I knew as I never wrote down any details at the time. It was still there when I left the window but had gone maybe half an hour or so later when I looked again. The next morning I phoned the R.C.M.P. to see if anyone else had reported anything about it, and not knowing who else to contact as I was unaware of this website until now.<n>

I called to my mother to come quickly and as she stepped out the front door, this object flew right over our heads, about 10 feet above the roof of the house [It&#39;s a 2-story house]. There was absolutely no noise what-so-ever. My mother was very startled and said &#34;What was that?&#34;. I said &#34;What do you think it was? Did you hear any noise like a helicopter or a plane?&#34;. She said &#34;No&#34;. I said &#34;It was a UFO&#34;. She didn&#39;t want to believe that but it was a clear night with no storm in the forecast and I have never heard of any reports of ball lightning in this area.<n>

From a mile away, it looked to be about a size somewhere between a large seagull and the front-end of a compact-car. It had an amazing brilliance--shimmering like a white diamond that was being spun in all directions (though it had a distinct round-shape, as an outer-&#34;shell,&#34; that was almost transparent).  It moved slowly and steadily but occasionally seemed to &#34;down-shift&#34; (veering slightly off it&#39;s otherwise straight-trajectory as if &#34;studying&#34; the surrounding area).  It seemed to be intelligently guided (with spinning internal-parts) and did not resemble those metallic party-balloons (that occasionally float around Hollywood).  I&#39;ve seen this thing before, in the same general-area, since around 1998:  Sometimes it was high-up near the clouds too (and appeared drab-gray in color before the sun came up).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pointed out the one I spotted out to my brother and as they moved closer together, we noticed they were on a collision course! My brother kept repeating, &#34;They&#39;re gonna hit, they&#39;re gonna hit, they&#39;re gonna hit,&#34; getting louder each time he said the phrase. When they did hit it appeared that they either combined or one destroyed the other. There was a flash of light about twice the brightness of either one, and it, or them, started flying 90 degrees a little faster this time. My brother ran up a hill to see over the tree tops and his mouth dropped. He said, &#34;They just shot off!&#34; After he came back down he said that after about five seconds the lights were really bright and shot off in a 11 o&#39;clock direction, like star trek.<n>

As i got closer i slowed down to approx 5 mph and looked directly up to my left to see a triangluar shaped object which looked similar to the Stealth fighter plane and was a dark grey colour and was about 36 foot long.I wound my window down to see if i could hear any rotary blades but there was no sound at all.I know that the Stealth fighter plane can&#39;t hover, and this object was hovering about 600 metres above the top of the cut. I couldn&#39;t stop the car because this was on a dual carriageway so i carried on down the cut and took the Houghton le Spring turning off the A690 and turned left into the housing estate where my girlfriend lives.I looked back and it was still there. I told my girlfriend to get into the car and we went back up to the top of Houghton cut to find that it had gone. We returned back to my girlfriends house and i telephoned Newcastle Airport security and someone took my details and the description of what had happened.He said that someone would telephone me but still no one has. The next day i went back along the route that i took and timed myself from the moment that i first saw the object until the time when i looked back and it was approx 5 minutes.Can anyone please explain this, or did anyone else witness this sighting apart from me.<n>

At first we thought it was an airplane, due to the loud airplane like sound we heard.  We looked up at the sky to locate where the &#34;airplane&#34; was. Instead we saw a large red light moving about in the sky in large circles. The object intentionally stopped near the moon for what seemed like a &#34;look&#34;.  After two minutes, another light paralell to the other appeared. We now think this might have been the back end of the craft.  The lights quickly jolyed back and forth in the sky unlike an airplanes capibilities.  When reaching the moon for the third time the object shot down towards the earth as if landing but was not seen afterwards. We have three photos taken.  After the sighting, we did reasearch, and have come to the conclusion that we have had an encounter of the first kind. We are almost certain it was a cigar shaped object, yet no evidence has been found yet.<n>

I called out my friend and my wife who both saw what I saw up to this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still coming towards me but started drifting away to my left and came to a full stop about 800 yards to my left, and not a sound from it, both my wife and my friend watched as something peculiar happened, the object changed shape as we watched, it sort of dipped and as it did it turned into a triangle both red and green lights vanished, as it did from off centre of this triangle came a very bright flashing strobe light which was pulsating, next we saw three bright white lights in the shape of a triangle these lights clearly showed the shape of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we saw the triangle it reversed itself and silently disappeared in the same direction I had seen it approaching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting lasted for approx.5-6 minutes, witnessed for part of the time by two other people, I reported (On a report form) this sighting the next day at 11.50pm, at the International UFO Museum in Roswell at the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request reports from other witnesses.

12/6/00 12:30|Pueblo|CO|Unknown|15 seconds|Fast moving object  in middle of day|12/9/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15326.html|192|ndxe200012| Fast moving object  in middle of day<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were in our backyard playing with our dogs at lunch time when I spotted a object traveling from the northeast to the southwest. There were other airplains in the sky which were leaving contrails but this object was moving much faster then the other airplanes and it was leaving no contrails. It seemed to be about the same altitude as all other airplains. I told my wife to keep an eye on the object while I ran inside to get my binoculars and by the time I grabbed them and came outside(5 seconds)it vanished. She told me that it just dissappeared. If I had to describe the shape I would say it was Cigar shape and it was white in color.<n>
12/6/00 04:55|Tonawanda|NY|Light|25 minutes|Three bright, distinct objects, each "bouncing around".  Near object had fainter white and red pulses around it.  Observed 25 minutes.|12/9/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15325.html|193|ndxe200012| Three bright, distinct objects, each &#34;bouncing around&#34;.  Near object had fainter white and red pulses around it.  Observed 25 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had left the blinds open to let in the moonlight as I went to sleep.  Just before five in the morning I awoke (as I often do several times a night to roll-over) when I noticed a bright light bouncing around outside the window.  I looked at it for a while without my glasses, concluded it deserved a better look because of the brightness and the motion (which I couldn&#39;t dismiss as a tree branch waiving in front of a star or an airplane), put my glasses on and went to the window.  There was an object of moderately bright light (as bright as the moon had been hours earlier) with occasional fainter white and red pulses associated with it in the sky to the WSW, just more than halfway up (50-55 degrees?) from the horizon.  The object did not appear to be very close, but it kept skipping around that sector of the sky.  There were also two eratically moving objects farther to the West, perhaps 20 degrees above the horizon, which appeared as a single bright light.  I couldn&#39;t tell much about the two distant objects--only that they were &#34;bouncing around&#34; and moving in the sky.  The nearer object zigzagged about, sometimes nearer, sometimes farther (although always fairly distant).  I observed for almost half an hour.  I looked at the objects both straight-on and with my perhipheral vision and they appeared the same. I noted the position of several stars and, since I watched for a fair bit of time, noted how the stars moved.  These objects (even the far ones) did not move with the celestial bodies.  That is, I could tell that the sector of sky they were bouncing-around in was moving relative to the stars. Ocassionally, fainter objects appeared in the sky, but I think those were stars...they didn&#39;t bounce around.  An airplane at altitude flew over, but did not appear at all like the objects and did not interact with the objects.  As time wore on the near object gradually was working its way to the SW and wasn&#39;t getting any closer.  I decided I&#39;d seen the best I was going to see and it was time to get back to sleep.  The time was just past 5:20 AM. The weather was very cold (maybe about 10F), winds were present but low, the ground was snow-covered (2&#34; snowpack) and the sky was cloudless. What a wierd thing to see!<n>

They shone out, like on the four corners of a square, and the &#34;square&#34; was lit up too.  Then the light veered to the left.  I was scared so I drove off, and I tried to keep an eye on the light, but when it went over my van, I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  I didn&#39;t want to see it.  It was high.  Not low enough to see or hear anything.  I&#39;m very afraid of alien abduction.  I don&#39;t know if I saw and actual ufo, but it scared me nontheless.  There were airplanes I saw later, but why wouldn&#39;t I have heard that if that is what I acutally saw?<n>

I took two pictures and then walked towards the end of the driveway to get another shot.  I caught movement out of the corner of my eye, looked up, and there was a bright light.  It was mostly gold with some red lights underneath.  The lights were steady and not blinking.  I couldn&#39;t see a shape in the light but there was something hanging down below the lights.  There was no sound coming from the object and it was close enough that I would have heard any noise it made. It was traveling at a steady height and speed.  Since I had my camera I took a couple pictures and then went in the house to get my husband so he could see it.  By then it was beside the house moving towards the back, so we went to the back patio.  As we got to the end of the patio where we could see the object there was a bright white flash and the colors changed going from gold to red and back to the original gold with the red lights on the bottom.  It looked like a second white light/object split from the first and went shooting off in a different direction.  Then the object was moving away from us and my husband clearly saw the red lights underneath.  There was still no sound.  The thing seemed to be floating.  The camera I used was digital and I downloaded the pictures right away.  They look black until they are enhanced.  The enhancements bring out some very strange details that don&#39;t seem to fit planes, helos or balloons.<n>

Burnside Street to meet with someone when I seen a bright light out of the corner of my eye.  Upon looking directly at the object I could see that it was twice as bright as the moon and about the same size as the currently half-moon that is in the south eastern sky.  The object was in the north western sky and too bright to see any details.  It was circular in shape.  I stood there looking at it and noticed that it never moved and made no sound.  It also never changed color.  There was no flickering of light, fading or otherwise.  I then thought to go back to the apartment and grab my camera.  When I returned, the object was gone.  On the corner looking one block up at a three story building, the object appeared about 2 to 3 inches above the building.  The streets were very busy with vehicular and pedestrian traffic but no one took notice of the object.  I originally seen it looking between two buildings and then went around the corner to the next street up to get a better view.  It was then that I thought to grab my camera.  While looking at it there was nothing attached to the object or coming from it.  There was construction in the area and the lights from the cranes were smaller and not as bright.<n>

It was still broad daylight, so I thought maybe it was an Iridium flare.  But the object didn&#39;t appear to be moving in the sky, and it didn&#39;t fade out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out my spotting scope.  At 45X magnification it appeared larger, as though it was much closer and/or bigger than a star.  It looked like a thick ring of light with a darker center, but that may have been something to do with the scope&#39;s optics.  It moved out of my scope&#39;s field of vision pretty quickly, so it was moving after all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 4:40 pm it was WNW at about 30 degrees altitude.  I lost sight of it for a second, then I&#39;m almost certain what I saw next was the same object:  I saw about 10-15 tiny but bright sparkles, as though the object had exploded.  The sparkles were just points of light.  Then I lost sight of that in the scope.  I couldn&#39;t see anything unusual with my naked eye any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I had not changed the focus between seeing the single object and the multiple points of light, and the multiple points appeared tiny, I assume my scope was in focus when viewing the single object.<n>

12/5/00 00:00|O'Fallon|IL|Triangle|5-6 minutes|Watched Triangular Object Hover Over My Barn For At Least 5 Minutes|2/12/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34954.html|201|ndxe200012| Watched Triangular Object Hover Over My Barn For At Least 5 Minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just arrived home late at night and as I parked in front of the barn at the end of the driveway I noticed two lights in the air, no more than 50 feet above the roof of the barn.  I assumed it was a plane coming in to land at the local Air Force Base (Scott AFB)and proceded to gather my things from the back seat of the car.  About 20 to 30 seconds later I turned back towards the windshield and was about to get out of the car when I noticed that the lights had not moved - at all.  This occurance went against my intuitive understanding of the laws of physics, being that objects very close to the ground, such as this one in particular, move across the field of view much quicker than objects that are further from the ground... right?  So I watched this thing hover for the next 3 minutes totally motionless over my barn. Honestly I was scared out of my mind.  I was afraid that at any minute I would get beamed up or something.  I couldn&#39;t stop watching though; I had to figure out an explanation.  Then a third light came on so that total there were now 3 white lights forming a triangle.  I unrolled my window to listen for any noise and there was none.  Absolute silence.  It was unreal!  I didn&#39;t think anyone would believe me, but the next day the whole town was talking about the UFO that was sighted and documented by the police because even THEY had seen it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It seemed to be traveling North but suddenly changed directions a few times. It began to travel easterly towards us diagonally across the road. As it came closer I noticed it had 5 or 6 white lights in a boomerang formation with a few aqua colored lights near the center. I pulled off to the side of a road in front of a house as it got closer. We turned of the radio and opened our windows as it passed in front of us not much higher than tree level. We could clearly make out a gray stealth-like shape about the size of a jet with 2 or 3 aqua lights towards the center. There was no sound &amp; was travelling at a very slow speed. As it passed behind the house we were stopped in front of it stopped for a second and a white beam or spotlight began to search the field behind the house. It continued slowly eastward. The light turned off &amp; then on again &amp; it began to pick up speed. I wanted to turn my car around &amp; follow it but my 12 year old son was frightened so we drove straight home (approx 1/2 mile from sighting. As for background information I am 37, a divorced mother of one, I have attended college, and I have worked as an office manager at a local payphone company for over 10 years. I have lived in the same apartment near the sighting for almost 12 years. My son will be 13 next month. He is a well adjusted, mature, and intelligent child. Neither one of us ever expected to ever have an experience like this. I am now a UFO agnostic who has become a believer.<n>

I caught a flash of light to my left in the south east just above the trees.  It started as a pinpoint and then a bright flash, then nothing.  Then it would appear again in a random pattern.  Sometimes to the left, then the right, then up, then down behind the trees.  I had seen such a light about 1 month ago just as I was about to arrive at my turnoff to my house. It was more to the north and a very bright flash and as suddenly gone.  I am a paraprofessional and my husband is employed in the trailer business and is also a Beef Farmer.  About 7 years ago, I also saw, again when I was nearly home, a bright, enormous, saucer shaped object hovering over a cleared field to my left.  It was a bright, moonlight night and I rolled the truck window down to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing a reflection.  It wasn&#39;t and it was as big as a fotball field and absolutely silent.  I slowed down almost to a stop but I was too scared to completely stop. It  was like nothing I had ever seen before.<n>

The other night I heard a jet passing overhead.  I looked up.  It was low but...the distance wing to wing of it&#39;s lights was small.  I can&#39;t guess how high it was but it answered a question I had been considering for a few weeks now.  This craft was not super high up and not low...and I could hear it clearly over the road noise.  And the distance, wing to wing of its lights was quite small.  Why is this important? A couple weeks ago I was about to enter my home.  I live in the suburbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very clear night.  Stars could be seen.  The city lights obscured the horizon though.  I looked up.  At about 45 degrees I saw something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say something because I stared at it and could not figure out what it was.  I ran every explanation and captured as much detail about the experience in my head as I could because I knew I would be trying to recognize what I saw for some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hold your arm out at 45 degrees.  Spread your index finger and thumb apart.  This is the approximate distance tip to tip of two of the lights on this thing.  The front light, making a triangle, was not way out in front.  It made the shape of a  hangglider, not a jet.  There were 3 lights in this triangle shape.  The lights moved synchronous with each other so I assumed that they were attached to the same object.  Given it&#39;s wingspan I figured it was either very low...or if high...it was very big...<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was very high then it was larger than any aircraft I could even conceive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was very low then I should hear the noise of whatever was powering it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was totally silent...not a bit of noise...it simply floated by.  It could have been a hangglider but it&#39;s movement didn&#39;t suggest that and there was no hill and again no sound from a motor so it would be governed by the wind...it did not suggest this...besides what idiot would do this in the dark? The &#34;thing&#34; simply cruised across the sky at a steady speed..not fast..not slow.  Making absolutely no noise.  It took a matter of about 20 seconds for it to move from me spotting it above me until it just vanished into the horizon lit by the city lights....it just sort of faded into the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had an idea that between the 3 lights there was a craft yet it seemed like I could see thru that part to the dark sky behind it.  Since I was in the city and the stars...although visible, did not fill the sky...I had no means to determine if I could see the stars thru the craft or that there was a solid mass between the lights which would block out the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s about it.  I keep replaying this happening for me in my mind. Over and over.  Trying to determine what known flying object that could have been.  I never dreamed that I would ever be destined to see a craft from another world...but now I&#39;m reconsidering that.<n>

We strongly believe that people are seeing, and reporting, typical contrails behind aircraft at high altitude.  Also, some aircraft are not painted, so their skin appears metallic.   PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I WORK AT THE BOEING PLANT IN AUBURN. I WAS WALKING IN THE GATE AND NOTICING THAT THERE WERE CHEMTRAILS ALL OVER THE SKY. I ALSO NOTICED A PLANE COMMING IN MY DIRECTION AND HEADING SOUTH LEAVING A CHEMTRAIL. ONE CHEMTRAIL PASSED RIGHT OVER OUR BUILDING. I REMEMBERED BY READING SOME ITEMS THAT PEOPLE WROTE THAT SPECIFIED SEEING UFOS AROUND AIRCRAFT THAT WERE SPRAYING CHEMTRAILS. SO WHILE WALKING OUTSIDE AS I USUALLY DO ON A NICE DAY, I LOOKED UP-  I WAS TARGETING CLOUDS AFTER THE DISPERSAL OF THE CHEMTRAIL AND ANY CLOUDS NEARBY. ABOUT 20 OR 30 MILES TO THE LEFT OF THE CHEMPLANE I SAW WHAT WAS AT FIRST A PLANE. IT FLEW SLOW LIKE A PLANE AND NO OTHER CHARACTERISTICS THAN THAT OF A PLANE. IT WAS QUITE FAR AWAY TO IDENTIFY A PARTICULAR SHAPE THOUGH I COULD QUITE TELL IT WAS METALLIC AND SAW NO MEANS OF PROPULSION OR EXHAUST. IT WAS BASICALLY POPPING FROM ONE CLOUD TO ANOTHER UNDER COVER BUT ONLY ONE BASIC SPEED WHICH WAS SLOW LIKE A PLANE. THE ONLY REASON I AM REPORTING THIS IS BECAUSE IT WAS METALLIC AND AS I KNOW AFTER WORKING AT BOEING 19 YEARS AT MOST OF THE LOCATIONS, I KNOW PLANES ARE PAINTED AND ALMOST NEVER LEFT METALLIC. I DIDN&#39;T SEE ANY WINGS EITHER LIKE I SHOULD, BUT WAS A WAYS AWAY. AFTER THE SECOND SIGHTING OF THE OBJECT GOING FROM ONE CLOUD TO THE OTHER, IT NEVER RESURFACED, AND WENT ON IN TO WORK. THIS WAS YESTERDAY AND I NOTICED A BUNCH OF CHEMTRAILS OUT AGAIN TODAY BUT NO OBJECTS. I HEARD NO SOUND BUT DIDN&#39;T HEAR THE CHEMPLANES EITHER BECAUSE THEY WERE SO HIGH- I HAVE NEVER SEEN A UFO, BUT HAVE A KEEN INTEREST JUST THE SAME.<n>

I had opened my bedroom window so as to get a clean shot and took a quick one of the barn and landscape in the back yard. I noticed nothing anamolous when I took the pic. Of course when I downloaded it off my camera it showed the 3 lights in a trangular pattern... I was inside the house at the time and the sun was in the west, the camera angle points to the east, so I think that lens flare or reflection of sunlight would not be an issue here. Not sure of that though. But would like to here if you have anything to say about this. Also, am not an avid ufo type, or I should say I wasnt out there looking for a ufo pic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Photograph accompanied report.

THE LIGHTS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN FOR A PARTICULAR BUSINESS OR LANDMARK AS I TAKE THIS DRIVE HOME EVERY NIGHT AFTER WORK.  IT WAS IN A SEMI-REMOTE AREA AND I OBSERVED THE LIGHT PATTERN FOR APPROX. 5 MIN.  THE LIGHTS WERE STILL FOR THE DURATION OF MY SIGTING UNTIL THE END WHERE THE FAR RIGHT LIGHT GRADUALLY LEFT FIRST.  BEING ONE WHO HAS SEEN MANY UFO SHOWS ETC., THIS PROBABLY DISCOUNTS ANY UFO AS THE LIGHTS DIDN&#39;T TAKE OFF TOGETHER IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS IF IT WERE ONE SHIP.  THESE LIGHTS CLEARLY STOOD OUT AND DIDN&#39;T BELONG THERE.  I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A REPORT TO SEE IF OTHERS MAY HAVE ALSO WITNESSED THEM PERHAPS LONGER IN DURATION.<n>

My brother told my mom and I and we went outside and watched it for about 25 min. At first we thought it was an airplane but it was hovering stationary the whole time we saw it. The light was much brighter than an airplanes light, it lit up the whole sky. There were a few other airplanes in the sky during this period but they didnt even compare in size or brightness.  It was much larger then anything any of us have ever seen before in the sky. It was circular and shaped like a disk and must of been the size of 2 football fields. We looked at it through our telescope and it was very hard to see the object because the light was so bright. It looked gray and we saw what looked to be 2 fin shaped things close together on one side. Then after about 25 min and approximately 22:25 we looked up and it was completely gone. It was there and then it was gone and there were no traces of it. There must of been other people who saw this and I would like to hear from them.<n>

It was perfectly alined with the moon, (not a planet, definitely!) and it was varying from side to side.  It would move slightly, then move very noticably.  It was a circle light, and it just hovered in the distance for a while, then disappeared.  Suddenly they came back (there were 2 now) and they were dancing with one another kind of, and I don&#39;t think they noticed that people did actuay notice them.  I bet they were fooling around of some sort.  They eventually went away, just suddenly disappeared.  I dont think that this is a matter for getting to contact me, I just wanted to make this noticable to add to the reports in Arizona.  I am a beleiver, so I am trying my best.  My parents thought (well, my Dad, not Mom, she beleives in them) it was just something else, but beleive me, it wasn&#39;t.  If you have any reports that come from Arizona, I would really like to know about them, so please somebody send them to me.  I know what I saw, and that was definitely a UFO.  Thanks for your time.  They are out there.<n>

It was in 2000, so the events aren&#39;t exactly fresh in my mind.  We took the highway from San Francisco which was our origin and made the most direct route to Lake Tahoe.  I do not know the name of the highway.  I had just returned from a long stay in Hawaii and answered an ad on craigslist.org-san francisco posted by a business professional seeking someone to drive up to Lake Tahoe with him and save on fuel.  We must have been about 30-40 miles outside of Lake Tahoe and it was dark in the sky already.  The time I gave above is an estimate.  We left San Francisco around 5 PM.  We must have been about 30-40 miles outside of Lake Tahoe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ***In front of us was the highway stretching through the valley, a space between two mountains.  We were heading North, or Northeast and in that same direction, high up in the sky between, but definitely much higher than the two mountains we both saw a large, bright neon green fireball suddenly appear and then quickly vanish.  It streaked for a few seconds, possibly leaving a slight green trail, like a tail of a comet.  The business man I was with did not want to talk about it and neither did I because I was quite scared.  I had never seen anything like that in my life-not even on TV.  I would like to know if what I saw was a meteor, or what?  I have told many people about this event in these past years, but only as an amusing anecdote.  It is only until now that I heard of a way to officially report this after listening to Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It disappeared behing the hill that leads up to Dogtown, and did not reappear.<n>

I noticed (what I believe are) Jupiter and Saturn in front of me.  Then I noticed a very bright light just to the right (South) of the planets.  It was about the brightness of Venus, but it was not Venus.  My first thought was that it was a plane but as I continued to watch it I noticed that it did not move or blink at all.  I commented to my daughters that it must, then, be a planet and I was amazed that either Mars or Mercury would be so bright.  As I was watching the light it dimmed to a tiny dot (without moving from it&#39;s position) and dissappeared.  There were virtually no clouds in the sky at this time.<n>

I called my friend, and by looks it could not have been an airplane or a helicopter. It had three incredibly bright white lights arranged one on top, two on bottom (like a triangle). It was stationary for five minutes, then slowly rose up, then to the left. It did it again, this time a bit faster, and twice more. It was very smooth in motion. It suddenly accellerated to the left, and when it passed by us, I could discern a red strobe between the lights. We watched... and then it sharply accelerated and was gone.<n>

At that time the russin robot shutel was haveing trouble and I assumed that it had come apart and fallen in to the aptmospher, leaving a green trail as it fell to earth.  How wrong I was, because a couple of seconds later, a lot of little white dots appeared and lit up the plasma arround them, leaving a multi-colord trail. Each one of the little dots was either obove or below the one in front. These &#34;craft&#34; were traveling in a south to north direction and passed over I-80. I had reached for my camera but was to engrosed in counting the things to take a picture.I had counted 26 and quiting counting.

We were driving home. this was in the 6pm hour. just before 7:30, i went to the back door of my house to quiet my dog who was barking a t pedestrians or another dog. When i opened the door, i noticed a round steady light in the west sky. I was surprised at how far the planet (jupiter?) had moved away from the moon, which i could see to the south. I looked at the &#39;planet&#39; for a few seconds, and picked up a red hue in it. i thought that it might be mars. i looked away to yell at the dog. when i looked back up, the light was gone. I never heard a noise, or saw any movement. It&#39;s a very clear, cold night here. I could see planes clearly. I have peered around the garage to see if it had set, i saw nothing. it was there, i looked away for a few seconds, looked back, and it was gone.<n>

There was  one small white light on each corner, that would flash simultaneously every 3/4 of a second. I was only able to see the lights; no outline of the craft. The craft was at a very high altitude such as a comercial airplane. The object was moving in the same direction as us at a fast pace, ahead of our truck on the right side of the road. The craft began to move across the sky over to the left side over the road at a very fast pace; such as a military jet, except it didn&#39;t move like any plane i knew, instead of flying in a straight line it moved in a stagnant criss-cross action that was differnt everytime, every time the light blinked off it was in a diffrent position either a little above or a little below the normal line of flight. After about a minute of flashing and moving on the left side it proceded back across to the right side of the road in the same stagnant unpredictable pattern. After about another minute of chasing it was getting to far to see and was soon gone, but not before we stopped the car and got out of the car making sure it wasn&#39;t just some bizarre glare off the windshield. My friend and I witnessed this event for about five minutes<n>

The first was in 1996 and the object was still above the treeline next to the US-23 expressway between Grand Blanc and Torrey Road exits.  I could see the lights on it which it had a red triangle underneath in the middle and a white light in front - it was a complete triangle not a stealth bomber which has like a triangle but v-shape to it. If it wasn&#39;t a UFO then is it a new military airplane???  Well since then I have seen two more farther off and they seemed to be at a standstill also.  They were also around the Genesee County area.  I haven&#39;t told anyone of the last two sightings but I know I&#39;m not seeing things because the first one was so close and visible.

One of our two dogs barked as the light/flash came until the explosion sounded.  The way the dog barked was unusual, like he was suddenly frightened. The entire event lasted about 5 seconds.<n>

At that time an extremely bright, white light flashed twice through the bedroom window.  Thsi light was brighter than any I have ever encountered.  At first I thought it might be sheet lightning and waited for thunder to follow. It never came. This light was so intense that it blinded everything around it.  I thought to myself how unusually bright the flashes were.  It had not been raining, the weather was clear, there was no wind and several stars could be seen.  I also noticed that there was absolutely no noise and did not hear a helecopter, airplane or machinery of any kind.  Approximately 5 minutes or less, after the bright, flashing lights, the front windows of our house rattled.  It reminded me of the rattling I used to hear when planes would break the sound barrier.  However, again, I heard no sound of planes, missles, helecopters etc.  We are very used to hearing those types of aircraft as the Naval Missle Base is here on our island. Later that morning, the radio was busy with callers around our small island who reported seeing the same or similar observations.  No one at the Missle Base has commented or taken any responsibility for any activity in the area at that hour.  One radio caller reported her sighting as a blue/white light dropping from the sky. My husband was aslepp and only woke up to hear the rattling of the windows.  We have lived on Kaua&#39;i for the past 7 years and retired here from Los Angeles.  Our backgrounds California afforded us the opportinity to be trained observers and are quite clear in our visual observation of thsi event.<n>

It was as though lightening had struck.  I immediately opened my eyes to see what appeared to be a shooting star, but it was close to the earth, very close and had a tail of lightening.  It was decending onto property probably 500 feet south of my house.  In a few seconds, the light was extinguished.  I had never seen anything like this, especially the portion of lightening attached to this firery missle.  I was very alarmed, got up and noticed it was 4:30 A.M.  Later in the day, other people on the Hawaiian island of Kauai reported seeing this sight 40 miles south in Kalaheo.  I believe I witnessed a meteorite with a tail of bluish electricity.<n>

I knew the light source was coming from behind me and turned in my seat to see a huge, blue fireball, with yellow orange tail, falling from the sky at an angle of approximately 35 degrees.  Guessing at it&#39;s size and proximity, I felt that the object appeared to be headed toward land and I presume it did touch down on Kauai.  Entire duration of this event was approximately 5 seconds.<n>
