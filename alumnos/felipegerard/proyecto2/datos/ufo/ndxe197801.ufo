1/22/78 22:00|Meriden|CT|Diamond|10 minutes|amazing diamond shape craft at low altitude  seeminly moving  too slow to stay aloft|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63835.html|2|ndxe197801| amazing diamond shape craft at low altitude  seeminly moving  too slow to stay aloft<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a cold winter evening my friend and I were driving into Meriden Ct. from Cheshire, Ct. We were driving in a small sports car on River Rd. near Red Bridge. I saw what I thought was the reflection of my shifter light on the windshield. I realized I was seeing something reflecting on the windshield from the outside. I pulled over, stopped my car and opened the window. Just above the tops of the telephone poles was an enormous diamond shaped craft. It was so close I could see that the surface looked like the dull side of aluminium foil. The underside had two bullet shaped ducts side by side with heat emitting from them. Maybe propulsion? No sound what so ever came from this craft. Around the perimeter was a redish/pink fuzzy difused light. The craft was traveling very slow. I wondered how it was staying in the air. It followed large high tension wires toward Hubbard park and was gone.   Totally unforgetable. I hope to witness again. I honestly felt no fear, only awe..<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/20/78 02:00|Midland|TX|Cigar|30 seconds|Large cigar shaped hovering craft with flashing lights.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42354.html|3|ndxe197801| Large cigar shaped hovering craft with flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always wanted to report this but never knew who to tell unti last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think something very interesting about my encounter is that it happened again in 1989.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first encounter happened when I was 8 years old with my friend ((name deleted)) also 8. We were camping out in his front yard. He and his family lived out in the country. We were about to go to sleep in his Pop up trailer and all of a sudden there was a very deep thrust noise and the trailer began to vibrate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran outside to see what was happening and looked up and saw a very large cigar shaped object hovering above us. Lights underneath the craft of different colors seemed to flash from left to right one after the other across the bottom of the craft. We ran inside to get binoculars and accidentally wake up his father who than came out with us. We were outside again within seconds and the craft was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did think we could barely see it hovering on the horizon for some time but it was too far away to see anything. Chad and I were avid model airplane builders and were very familiar with military aircraft. We knew what we saw was not a blimp because there was no way it could have hovered over us and then been miles off the horizon within seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second encounter happened in 1989. Also in Midland, at my child hood home. At approximately 2am again I had pulled into my driveway after leaving my girlfriends home. I decided to listen to a song before I went inside. As I was sitting in my car my car began to vibrate and I heard a very low base noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suprised, I made sure my woofers were turned off in my car and turned down my stereo. I noticed lights reflecting off my sisters car and immediately looked around for other cars and there were none in sight. Then I noticed the lights were reflecting off the top of her car. I got out, looked up and saw once again a large cigar shaped object with lights flashing left to right across the bottom of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both times it seemed to to be about 100 yards long and about 100 ft. in the air. Once again I ran inside to get binoculars and ran back outside (waking my mother accidentally). once again it was gone. As I scanned the horizon I could see it. This time I was 19 and had a car so I got into my car to chase it. I never could get any closer to it. It seemed to just stay out of my visual reference, no matter how far I drove. So I turned around and went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time, please call with any questions or collaborating evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> John DeFrance<n>
1/12/78 20:00|Grand Rapids|MI|Disk|5 minutes|I submitted this report back in 2005.  I have been reviewing my report from that time.

The craft may have been 3 to 4 times the size that I stated (200-300 ft.)  As we were driving up Cenntenial Drive (steep incline) the lights caught my eye.  It was about 20-30 miles away, it was coming at us at a very high rate of speed.  It had multiple lights rotating around the middle of the saucer.  As in other reports that I read, the middle of the craft did not come to a point, it had was a verticle surface (5-10 feet or more)  The strangest thing was that as soon as the spot lights under the object focused on us (my friend who was driving killed the lights and coasted to the end of the road, so I felt it did not know we were there) it rose and speed off at an unbelievable rate of speed (thousands of miles an hour or more)  I was in the passenger seat and never took my eyes off of it.  It traveled 30 miles in two or three seconds.  We jumped on 196 East and followed it for about ten minutes.  It looked like a moving star off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest thing of all is that after we headed back home, none of us spoke about it to each other or anyone that night (family members, etc.).  It wasn&#39;t until weeks later that we were all hanging out together, and I mentioned it as a dream.  Instantly both of my friends who were with me had the wierdest looks on thier faces.  I could tell they were freaked out.  We had one or two other friends present at this time.  They thought we were joking.  Each of us took turns telling exactly the same thing that happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone would like to talk to me about this, I would like to talk to someone if possible.<n>

1/10/78 20:00|Walberswick Suffolk (UK/England)||Disk|1-2 hours|Saw flying saucer with coloured lights in 1978 and then a different craft in 1979.|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39625.html|6|ndxe197801| Saw flying saucer with coloured lights in 1978 and then a different craft in 1979.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Walking along a road in Walberswick along the coast with a friend.  Looked up and saw in the distance, coloured lights, thought it was a helicopter at first, there is a US base nearby.  Then the object came closer and was clearly a flying saucer.  The object had a band of moving lights around the centre of the craft.  The lights were all different colours they did not merge but moved around.  The craft manoeuvered fast, shot up and down then away then back then hovered sometimes coming almost above us.  It was a spectacular sight.  We were absolutely transfixed to the spot. There was so much movement and changing position.  The speed of the craft was phenomenal. Then the craft went away and we stayed for 30 mins or so and thought it wasn&#39;t going to come back, but then it did and it all started over again.  I don&#39;t really know how long we were there.  There was no sound, the craft was large and moved like nothing I had ever seen before. Finally it went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A year later in central London I was walking alone to work early one sunday morning, I looked up and there was something I thought at first was a helicopter, the sun was reflecting off a very shiny, but matt, silver coloured object.  Then I realised it was not a helicopter, there were no blades rotating it was just this thing in the sky, completely motionless and again no sound.  I stopped and stared at it.  It had no windows no lights no nothing and it was a cone shape.  Then in shot up and stopped and then came down again and finally just shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that the second sighting was linked to the first.  I beleive that even though I have no recollection of it, that at the first encounter something happened that has been wiped from my memory.  There is no fear attached to this, although I have the feeling they are coming back one day.  It is impossible to explain how or why I feel this, I just know it to be true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of these sightings I was 17 and 18 years old.  I am 42 now. I am a tax adviser.  I seek no publicity and I know what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/9/78 04:30|Thousand Oaks|CA|circle|60 seconds|I awoke at 4:30 a.m. and was lying awake in bed looking out the window.  I saw a large round yellow glowing object close to the ground|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02331.html|8|ndxe197801| I awoke at 4:30 a.m. and was lying awake in bed looking out the window.  I saw a large round yellow glowing object close to the ground far off in the distance and did not take note of it because I thought it was a full moon close to the ground.  It was partially blocked by some thin trees.As I lay there, the object began to ascend very very slowly.  As it began moving, I jumped out of bed and ran to the window watching as it rose above the tree level and house level.  I cannot tell how far off it was -- perhaps a few miles.Once it finished rising, it sat in the sky for a few seconds not moving -- then in a split second shot off to the right, disappearing.  I ran out of my room, down the hall, and into the living room which was the direction that the object flew.  I looked out of the sliding glass door in the living room, but the object was gone.Again, it was just a round, glowing, yellow object, with no other distinctive features.I have only told a very few select individuals about this over the past almost 20 years -- people that I knew would at least believe that I was not lying to them -- even if they don&#39;t happen to believe in UFO&#39;s.  When I heard about your organization, I figured I would at least log this siting with you -- perhaps it can help you  in some way.<n>
1/9/78 03:30|Chatsworth|CA|Circle|3 minutes|One night I looked up and saw one "star" slowly move into another. 3 days later I saw a 15 foot wide orange circle.|5/24/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/007/S07748.html|9|ndxe197801| One night I looked up and saw one &#34;star&#34; slowly move into another. 3 days later I saw a 15 foot wide orange circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was eight years old. I remember because my sister was an infant and she is eight years younger, born 11/01/77. I must admit that I saw &#34;Star Wars&#34; but there were aspects that I only came to understand many (14) years later. My Mother, Sister and I lived in one large room of a guest house on a ranch near Topanga Canyon Blvd. and Chatsworth Blvd. in the San Fernando Valley, California. For a few days prior to the sighting I would walk outside on the ranch. I would look into the sky and say to myself &#34;I know they&#39;re coming, I know they&#39;re coming...&#34; over and over again. After a few days of this I looked straight up into the stars and was only moderately surprised to see one very bright (like Venus) &#34;star&#34; slowly move toward another that was about 3-5 degrees of arc away from the first. When the first &#34;star&#34; reached the other &#34;star&#34; the moving one simply dissapeared into the other. Three nights later I awoke in bed and was drawn to look for where the bright orange light was comming from. I sat up in bed to see about a 15 foot wide circle or sphere of orange light moving slowly from left to right behind some big eucalyptus trees which were on the far side of a horse corral. The object was less than 100 feet away. I could see a, possibly, solid core with a glowing corona around the edge. I thought I should yell for my Mother who was only 20 feet away and in the same room as I. I did not yell; instead I had a very strong urge to grab the 110 Kodak Instamatic camera on my window sill. My next thought was &#34;No, I don&#39;t want to scare &#39;them&#39; away.&#34; As the light slowly moved down and to the right, behind some large bushes, I yelled &#34;Mother!!! U.F.O.&#34; She sat up in bed just in time to see the light but not the &#39;craft.&#39; The next day, at school, I told my friends. They asked me to draw pictures. I drew pictures of the &#39;craft&#39; changing shape, moving toward me and prepairing to land. I told my friends that I then yelled for my Mother and &#39;it&#39; flew away. The reason I mention about my &#39;lying&#39; about what I saw was that 14 years later I went to a hypnotist. I was not seeing the hypnotist for any reason at all related to the U.F.O. In the hypnosis session I began to see my childhood drawings in photographic form. I was not in deep hypnosis so I clearly remember the images, much to my surprise. Only later in life did I learn how children sometimes tend to draw their suppressed memories. I have done very little more significant investigation into my sighting. The date of the sighting IS APPROXIMATE but it &#39;feels&#39; very accurate. The true reason I picked that date is the 1/9/78 4:30 AM Thousand Oaks sighting listed in this same list. Thousand Oaks is only about 15 miles from Chatsworth. I strongly feel that we may have both seen the same craft. I do know that the year is correct and that the day of month is approximate.<n>
1/8/78 22:00|Cardiff (UK/Wales)||Triangle|20 mins|light in the sky splits into 3, one of which is observed to be a huge triangle|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30663.html|10|ndxe197801| light in the sky splits into 3, one of which is observed to be a huge triangle<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whilst I was waiting for a lift on a slip road to the M4 motorway, I spotted a light moving low on the horizon to the west. It went from left to right. I was looking out for a car, so I kept glancing at it until, all of a sudden it split into 3 lights one went back the way it had come, one carried on the way it was going and the third appeared to go straight up. The sun had just gone over the horizon and there was a little after glow in the sky. My attention switched to the light that was going upwards and I rialized that it was going to pass over me. As it got higher and closer I saw that it was a huge triangular craft with one light at the front. It passed over me silently [as far as I could tell]. Noone else saw it and it disappeared to the east in the direction of Cardiff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We would be surprised if the date is accurate, although the witness indicates that it is exact.  One of three reports from same source.  PD))<n>
1/7/78 02:00|Bristol|TN||10 minutes|Bright White Light|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53132.html|11|ndxe197801| Bright White Light<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was lying in my bed to be woken up by barking dogs and an intense, white light pulsating through my bedroom window. I lived in the mountains and there are no lights in that area. I was too terrified to look out the window, somehow I knew it was a UFO. I pulled the blanket over my head and apparently passed out. I wouldn&#39;t of remembered the light if it wasn&#39;t for a TV news report that 2 cops saw a UFO over State Street. When I heard that, the memory of the light came back and I was dumbfounded that I had forgotten and suprised I had fallen back asleep, espesially since I was so terrified. A couple nights later I dreamed that I had gotten out of bed that night and encountered 4 small, big-eyed, big-headed grey aliens in my kitchen. They transported me into a huge ship, and escorted me through a hall to an another alien who was much taller, but identical in appearance. I thought the tall one was going to take me into a door on the left, but instead he took me to a glass room at the top of the craft. I saw 2 tall, beautiful, angelic-looking entities, male and female, with long, blondish-white hair, wearing glowing white robes. I asked them what they were doing here on earth. They said they were from a dying planet and took me there. I saw a dark, ancient city at the foot of a huge, craggy mountain, and realized it was built with technology unknown on earth. They explained that earth will one day be their home, and to accomplish this they have to mix their dna with ours in an attempt to fully adapt to earth&#39;s environment. The man told me that &#34;they are us and we are them.&#34; I asked the entities if there was a God. The answer was Yes. I asked them if they knew who God was and if they were connected to God. They answered that they didn&#39;t know everything about God, but that they did know more about God than humans did and they could teach us about God and other marvelous things. Then I was asked if I wanted to stay with them or go back. By this time I&#39;am prostrate on the floor with fear, and an! swered t hat I wanted to go back to what I know and to be with those I love, that I&#39;am not ready to handle the reality they have shown me. Since this event I have spoken with 3 other people who saw a UFO that night and also heard the report about the 2 cops who saw the UFO, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object did not move and my friend was scared and ran away.  I stayed and watched until it just vanished (approx.. 10 minutes later).  I called the Ottawa airport and reported it to the air traffic control tower but they didn’t see anything in the sky.  Weird occurrence…  I checked in the distance and there was a plane but it was way too far away to create what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

1/6/78 01:00|Westport (about 10 miles North of, US Hwy.1)|CA|Other|15 min|Three humongus craft with about 30 saucers about them loading and unloading something.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03106.html|14|ndxe197801| Three humongus craft with about 30 saucers about them loading and unloading something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stuck at Usal Beach (on the road going out to US Hwy 1) after finally getting unstuck and traveling to Hwy, 1 I went South and at the top of the hill just before going down to the ocean I stopped to have a ciggarette and let my friend behind me catch up. When he did catch up he got into the cab of my truck and we talked a bit trying to decide where we would camp for the night.  We decided on Union Landing, about 2 miles above Westport on Hwy 1.  While setting there alongside the road I noticed a blue light like electric arc welding flashes in the trees ahead.  I thought another fisherman was up late working on his boat.  Upon finishing my smoke we pulled out onto the road and started down towards the beach and union landing.  When I came to a point abreast of where the lights were I looked over to see what kind of a boat etc. the supposed fisherman was working on.  There was no boat, no house, garage or anything else.  The terrain dropped off steeply and I had a view of the ocean.  I was up about 800 feet above the ocean and looking out at one hell of a sight:  3 large ufo&#39;s, each big enough to put the Kibby Dome in (the Kibby Dome is a Football Stadium at The University of Idaho at Moscow, Idaho) as I said there were 3 of them they were the shape of a childs top or a beet.  They were staggered one in front of me another further out and to the right and the third to the left of the first two and further out still.  From my position on the Highway the first was a mile from me the second aboutthree miles out and the fourth about five miles out from me.  I saw two or three white light saucers to the left of the first big ship.  The second ship had none or maybe one about it but the third big ship had about thirty saucers around it.  The big ships were outlined with pink lights and the saucers were solid white light colored.  What was happening as far as I could determine was that the saucers were taking turns going into the bigger craft, one would come out and another from outside would go in.  I watc! hed this for about 15 minutes, all the time trying to describe to myself what they looked like and what it was they were doing.  Finally I got into my truck and went the 5 or so miles to the ocean(the road wound down to the place where it followed the contour of the ocean).  Upon arriving at the ocean I could not see the UFO&#39;S at all.  They had left.  I then continued on down Hwy. 1 to Union Landing where I made camp and stayed for 30 days.  The next morrning we saw 1 or2 F-4 Phantoms flying at about 100 feet elevation and going up the coast.  They were very close to the coast, 1/4 to 1/2 mile.<n>

The place was Warwick, Rhode Island, the Buttonwoods/Appanoag Section.  It was sometime late at night or early morning.  My parents were sleeping. I went to the bedroom window.  I observed round (like a ball) light, slowly decending to the ground.  The distance I&#39;d guess was about a city block away.  Since I was a child, I said to myself, &#34;Oh a plane light fell off&#34;. I had not heard of UFO&#39;s, etc. The next day I went to my babysitter&#39;s house.  I told he about the &#34;red plane light&#34; in a nonchalantly way.  It was not a big deal to me.  The babysitter&#39;s husband, worked at TF Green airport in Warwick about a mile away.  When I recall his uniform it had decoration like an Airforce uniform.  I guess he might have been in the service somehow.  The babysitter told her Husband what I saw. The Husband came home and I overheard him telling his wife there was a lot of phone calls about the red light and that no airplanes lost lights.  He proceeded to question me about it.  I simply told him that I saw an airplane light fall. He made a phone call and then returned to work. As an adult now, I realize that an airplane light, if it fell off a plane, would not still be lighted up red.  I researched old newspapers for any mention of this incident.  For all the phone calls there supposedly were, not one mention in the local Providence Journal Bulletin.<n>

At first it appeared as a triangular formation of bright greenish lights, each emmiting a trai. The trees and lights below it were clearly visible, as if the craft was transparent or it was a formation of tiny craft flying together. It made no sound, and moved slowly down the valley, then rose, shrank into a single light, and shot away at incredible speed, vanishing in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother, sister and her boyfriend saw it first, and called me. It was a triangular shaped cluster of lights, like an invisible delta winged aircraft with lights along the edges of its wings, nose and tail. The lights were bright, greenish and teardrop shaped, like flames. It moved very slowly down the valley below us, making no sound. As it moved away it gathered speed and shrank to a single light, then shot away at incredible speed. That same night, it was sighted in several other places over Mahe and the surrounding sea, each time described differently. Over the airport, witnesses described it as a disc shaped craft with lights all around it, the tracking station described it as a cylinder of lights, and it was seen out at sea as a sphere of lights hovering over the ocean. This was all reported in the local newspaper the following day, complete with illustrations. These sightings were made within minutes of each other, and all the witnesses agreed that it made no sound.<n>

It concerned a woman who spotted a flying object over the 605 freeway in 1977 or 1978 (she couldn&#39;t remember exact date).  This sighting was actually posted in 2000, since the woman was new to the web.  Well, back in 1978, my neighbor told me of a VERY SIMILAR sighting that she had the night before.  She was driving home travelling south on the 605 Freeway (Southeast Los Angeles County) at 2:30 AM (the woman was driving north on 605 fwy), when she saw a bright light that she first thought to be a helicopter spotlight.  She estimated the object to be a couple of miles away.  As she drove south, the object was slowly flying north towards her.  To this day, it is a desolate stretch of freeway.  My neighbor slowed to a crawl as it approached, since it was hugh and obviously not a helicopted or airplane of any type she had ever seen.  She did not stop as it slowly flew directly over her at what she estimated to be 100 feet or so- VERY LOW.  She said it was dark in color and possibly triangle in shape and looked like some sort of &#34;hugh flying machine with lights.&#34;  She was uncomfortable telling the story and had NO reason to lie and only told me after repeated questioning of the slight sunburn on ONE side of her face- which she admitted she thought was caused by object.  I  am guessing my neighbor probably saw the same object that this woman saw.  I travel the same freeway about a dozen times per week and have never seen anything unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

1/1/78 00:00|London (UK/Englnd)||Disk|1 second|Twin-disc 'pivoting' UFO observed to rapidly cross the skies of Slough, U.K., in 1977/ 1978.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63727.html|21|ndxe197801| Twin-disc &#39;pivoting&#39; UFO observed to rapidly cross the skies of Slough, U.K., in 1977/ 1978.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I regret that the incident happened so long ago that I am unable to give a precise date. My experience happened in 1977 or 1978, when I was 15 or 16 years old. I was the only witness. At the time, I was a member of my local astronomical society, with responsibility for co-ordinating meteor observation. Astronomy was a serious hobby for me then, and I was used to observing the skies and being able to identify the normal kind of objects in the heavens, e.g. stars, meteors, planets, satellites, and planes. It was late, possibly past midnight – I often did meteor watches through the early hours. I was doing a meteor watch, alone, and lying on a camp bed out on the balcony in front of my house in Slough, Berkshire, UK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly there was an astonishing phenomenon in the sky of a kind I had never seen before, and have never seen since. It was definitely not an astronomical phenomenon or any description of human vehicle I know of. The object(s) crossed my field of vision rapidly, within a second or maybe even half a second, so it was moving at incredibly high speed. It consisted of two discs of light. They moved so rapidly that it was difficult to distinguish whether they were clearly defined discs or whether the edges were diffuse, but my memory recalls my perception as being that they were fairly diffuse. Although the discs were about a third or half the diameter of the moon, they were not particularly bright – certainly not as bright as the moon – but not particularly dull, either. The strange thing about them is that they seemed to be connected in some way, as the two discs seemed to be rocking or pivoting about a central axis as they rapidly crossed the skies, so that the discs would during this rocking process be alternately one further in front than the other. The angle of the rocking from the perpendicular was possibly between 30 and 45 degrees, and during the transit, the discs probably repeated this backwards and forwards rocking motion twice. They were separated by a distance of perhaps four or five times the diameter of the moon. The lights were white, and I saw no colour in them. They left no trail, and the trajectory was practically overhead, and they crossed the whole of my field of vision, until it was obscured by the houses on my left-hand side: I was lying on the camp bed facing perpendicularly into the skies. It was a clear, cloudless night. There was no accompanying sound. I did not perceive anything in the object other than these lights, and at the time assumed that these were two separate objects that happened to be flying together in a formation, but was puzzled as to why they seemed to be rocking backwards and forwards about a common axis. However, in more recent years I have wondered whether they! were bo th fixed to the base of a larger, dark craft, whose base was undergoing this rocking motion for some reason: although I was not able to distinguish any craft to which the lights were joined, because of its speed, and the state of utter shock and anxiety I was in when I saw the phenomenon, it could just be the case that I did not notice it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shared this information with my parents, and I wrote a report containing much of the detail above, though I cannot remember after all this time what I did with the report: whether I lodged it anywhere - which I think is unlikely, as the Internet wasn’t yet available then, and I wouldn’t have known where to send it – or more likely, whether I filed it somewhere at home and have lost it in the course of the years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of witnessing this event, I was very much a sceptic with regard to the question of UFOs: I knew enough about relativity to believe that other stars were too far away for extraterrestrial visits to be possible, given the velocity limit of the speed of light. I was simply forced to abandon my scepticism by what I saw with my own eyes. As mentioned above, I was also used to astronomical observations, and could easily have identified a very unusual but natural object, such as a fireball, or a satellite re-entering the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have scoured the Internet to find out whether anyone has seen anything at all similar to my rocking twin-disc UFO, but have been unsuccessful. I would be extremely interested to know whether you have ever received a report describing anything similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
