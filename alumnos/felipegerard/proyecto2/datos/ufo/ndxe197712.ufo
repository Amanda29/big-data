12/29/77 02:00|Whitehorse (Canada)|BC|Flash|1 hour|Nightime sighting by many witnesses which forced a police car and fire truck off the road|5/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70017.html|1|ndxe197712| Nightime sighting by many witnesses which forced a police car and fire truck off the road<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving down the Alcan Highway from Alaska a few days after Christmas in 1977.  It was a marathon drive and by the time my cousin and I hit Whitehorse in BC, we had been on the road non-stop for over 40 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was shortly after midnight, and I was driving down a long dark straight stretch of highway, about 10 miles North of Whitehorse, heading South.  I remember it being a clear night, as I could see the stars as I drove.  This section of the highway was heavily lined with Douglas Fir trees, so it was darker to the left and right of the roadway, and slightly brighter directly above, due to starlight and maybe moonlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When suddenly I was startled by what appeared to my mind as a flash of lightning going directly overhead, straight down the highway the same southerly direction as my car, but what struck me as odd is that it was straight.  Not like jagged lightening.  Plus there was no sound of thunder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time my cousin was sleeping and the flash of light was bright enough that it woke him up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When he asked what that was, I simply said I thought it was lightening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10 minutes later, as we approached the outskirts of the small town of Whitehorse, we noticed that a police car was in the ditch on the left side of the road with his lights flashing. The officer was standing next to his car looking straight up.  I just continued to drive on (not sure why) and half a mile later, there was a fire truck in the ditch on the right side of the road, and the firemen were standing outside their vehicle look up at the sky.  By this time we were coming up to the first signs of habitation, which was a gas station. It was brightly lit, and there was another police car there with lights flashing, and about 6 people standing outside looking up at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled up to a pump and got out to fill up the car, and the attendant was standing a few feet away looking up, and I asked him what was going on?  He looked at me incredulously and said, &#34;You mean you did not see it??!&#34;  I shrugged and said, &#34;I was driving into town from the north, I did not see anything.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> He shook his head and stated, &#34;How could you have missed it? The damn UFO was flying low enough to force the fire truck and cop car off the road, then it went and buzzed this station and then headed up the road you were just on!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I could say was, &#34;WOW!&#34;  My cousin and I just shrugged our shoulders.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

12/28/77 20:00|Worcester|MA|Disk|15 sec|We observed a 60-80 ft diameter metalic craft (disk shaped- flat on top)move by us at 70 ft high & 100 yards of dista-nce.|2/22/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02267.html|2|ndxe197712| Summary : We observed a 60-80 ft diameter metalic craft (disk shaped- flat on top) move by us at 70 ft high &amp; 100 yards of dista-nce.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft made no sound and was moving at approx 10 mph. The outside surface had a metalic appearence. Much like stainless steel. The underneath had many interweaved objects. They looked like pipes or metal counduits. The craft was moving over a parking lot that was illuminated by bright lights. The light intensity was magnified by the snow that was on the ground. The craft continued to move away at tree top level and move out of our line of sight. I have never seen a UFO since this incident in 1977.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

12/20/77 21:00|Uxmal (Mexico)||Disk|20 min.|Two saucers seen at Mayan ruins of Uxmal, Yucatan, Mexico.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29543.html|5|ndxe197712| Two saucers seen at Mayan ruins of Uxmal, Yucatan, Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in December of 1977, ans as far as I know no one has ever reported it, but I saw in the database that there was a sighting in exactly the same place on May 23, 2003, so thought I would report it. Five us went to the light show at Uxmal in Yucatan, which took place at about nine in the evening. There were about fifty people there. During the show a disc appeared in the air about 50 yards to the right of where the audience was seated. It was about 80 to 100 feet across. It revolved slowly, counterclockwise as seen from below. It was no more than 100 feet off the ground. There were yellow and orange lights around the outside of the disc. When we first saw it, there were things that looked like long thin neon tubes hanging from the edge of the disc. They changed color, and were retracted into the edges of the disc, as it spun around. The top side of the disc was slightly domed, and gave off a red glow. As we watched the disc moved forward, and gained altitude. Then we noticed that there was another one, very high overhead, also rotating and giving off the orange and yellow lights around the rim. We watch the first one climb and then join the other one, and they both moved off toward the west in the sky, until they were so far away we lost sight of them. Some people may have actually thought that it was part of the light show. After it was over everyone moved out of there as fast as possible. The five of us who were together talked about it afterwards, and even drew some pictures. No one had a camera; as far as I know no one else that was there took any pictures. This was twenty-five years ago but we still talk about it when we run into each other.<n>
12/18/77 18:30|Minsk (Belarus)||Disk|a few minutes|the silver object  looked like as a plate that flew with amazing speed, hanged in the sky for  a few minutes|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32784.html|6|ndxe197712| the silver object  looked like as a plate that flew with amazing speed, hanged in the sky for  a few minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all, I saw a fallen star, then it became biger and biger. In a few seconds, this star turned into a very big strange silver object. It looked like a big plate that was overturned, and right on the top of this object was a little light.About 3-5 minutes, it was hanging in the night sky twenty metres (probably, difficult to say, but it was close enough) above the ground, without any sound, like it waited for me. I did not feel anything but excitement, but my mom draged me to the bus. We had two tickets that evening and were late.  I saw how this object flew south.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/17/77 19:30|Muscoda|WI|Triangle|20 sec.|I saw lights in a triangle shape decending straight down and a red light came on as it went behind the hills.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65890.html|7|ndxe197712| I saw lights in a triangle shape decending straight down and a red light came on as it went behind the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In December, 1977, I was on my way to a dance in Richland center, WI. Somewhere near Muscoda, WI, I looked out my drivers side window as I rounded a right curve and saw 3 lights in a triangle coming straight down out of the sky. I would approximate the distance from me to be 1/4 to 1/2 mile away from me. There was no airport in the area , it was not a plane and it was decending to fast to be a helicopter. It also did not have a beacon light. The landscape to my left dropped into a short low area and then rose quickly to hills 3 or 4 hundred yards from the road. It was dark, so I could&#39;t see the shape, but the lights were in a triangle. Just before it dropped behind the hills, a red light came on in the center of the triangle and stayed on as it dropped behind the hills. I was late already for the dance and didn&#39;t stop to investigate, but to this day, I sure wish I had.I hope to see it again someday...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

12/15/77 12:00|New Albany|IN|Disk|1to 2 minutes|Flat black disc, no lights, spinning with a slight wobble, no sound|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48529.html|9|ndxe197712| Flat black disc, no lights, spinning with a slight wobble, no sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1977, my friend &amp; his younger brother &amp; I were walking through a field which is part of st Mary&#39;s Cemetary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend spotted the disk first.  We just stood there saying,&#34;What is that?&#34;.  The disk was flat black in color and seemed to have a darker small circle in the center of the disk.  It appeared to spin in a clockwise or counter clockwise manner but would also wobble slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound, I&#39;m not sure how high up this craft was, but I would estimate its size to the hole in the center of a compact disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this same disk years later at this field while watching New Albanys&#39; football team practice there. I&#39;ve often wondered if this was a weather balloon, experimental military aircraft, or aliens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can honestly say I will never cease to wonder what it was that I saw during the blizzard of &#34;77&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

12/3/77 00:50|Fort Lauderdale|FL|Chevron|Seven Minutes|Chevron Wedge of approx. 20 small luminescent disks; in actuality one large individual UFO with round "running lights" below.|4/8/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22291.html|10|ndxe197712| Chevron Wedge of approx. 20 small luminescent disks; in actuality one large individual UFO with round &#34;running lights&#34; below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Telescope observation. Full moon; three major planets. Orion high. Paused for clearing eye. Looking towards the east [Ft. Lauderdale beach]at Lupus constellation. Slow rising wege [reverse chevron configuration]. Approx. 20 small round luminescent discs [one out of &#34;formation&#34;]visible, rising from east in slow arc towards Orion constellation. Unaware of height in night sky - meteor burn below chevron-shape cluster of discs [disc-circles small as smaller floppy-disk circle]. Height estimated above 100,000 ft. Chevron wedge of disc-light flight takes them across first two stars of Orion belt, and stars disappear behind chevron wedge shadow [the dark space between, and surrounding disc-lights]! Lights thought to be many objects, now appear to be one large object [by large...meaning enormous - like small satellite moon!]. Arc of flight continues past zenith until object &#34;falls off sky&#34; as would an object outside Earth&#39;s atmosphere! Contacted Jimmy Carter Washington telephone number to report sighting; received confirmation as being one of four sighters at 1:10 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. [repeated particulars of sighting to both callers]. Received e-mail from stranger a few years ago [around 1995] from viewer in boat out at sea that smae night who reported to me that he not only saw the same object as I, but another smaller craft from larger one which &#34;buzzed&#34; Ft. Lauderdale beach, and caused small Piper Cub type aircraft to crash, killing dentist and family! Could not corroborate my sighting because of problem with his party whose members did not wish to be identified as being where they were at the time! Was told by Professor Hynek [the 6:30 a.m. call from California] that my sighting was one of &#34;Mother-Ship&#34; first seen in 1888 and then again in 1950.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to establish whether the date is exact, or approximate.  We will invite the witness to locate the article of the crashed aircraft.  PD))<n>
