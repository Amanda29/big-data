It was a clear night and the sky was almost completely dark at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t take our eyes off of it even though we wanted to go in and tell everyone to come see, we just couldn&#39;t pull ourselves away from looking at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of minutes of it hanging motionless in the sky, it shot straight up in the air and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it happened we decided not to say anything to our families that were inside because we didn&#39;t want to be made fun of, since none of them would have believed it.  So hard as it was, we kept it quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the next day at school, I overheard some of my classmates whispering together in a huddle about the same thing that I had seen.  So I chimed in about my account, and they told me that they had been practically under it (which made sense because my friend lived just across that field) and they said that it was a glowing red ball but they could see three white lights on the bottom that formed a triangle pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They also watched it for a while and it shot straight up in the sky, there were four of them that seen it including my friend&#39;s father.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never seen anything like that before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate, elects to remain totally anonymous.

9/15/83 22:00|Holden (Canada)|AB|Oval|20-30 seconds|Small white light makes 90 degree turn in sky.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36120.html|2|ndxe198309| Small white light makes 90 degree turn in sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the fall grain harvest in approx 1983 around 2200hrs, I was the truck driver waiting for the combine to have it&#39;s next load of grain.  I was facing west and the combine was approx 1/4 mile away at the time and hidden behind a roll of hills.  There was no lights from buildings in the area, no road traffic, there was no moon light that evening &amp; it was nice and clear.  I was standing outside of the grain truck looking at the stars, when I noticed what I thought was a satellite coming from the north/west going south/east.  It was just a bright little light, just like any satellite which I had seen several times before.  When I first noticed it, it was almost straight above me, approx 80 degrees off the horizon.  It was travelling about the speed of other satellites I had seen in the past &amp; since.  After watching this light move for approx 5-10 seconds, and at this point it was almost directly above me at 90 degrees, it made a perfect 90 degree turn without losing any speed and started to head directly east.  A split second after the object turned, I noticed a second object, a red flashing light which I assumed to be a tail light or wing light of an aircraft following the first object.  It appeared to be coming from the same direction as the first object.  It made a more of a swooping/banking turn to turn to the east and followed the first object.  Very much like any normal aircraft would have to do, in making a turn.  Both objects headed east, the first object from what I recall was way ahead of the red flashing light in no time at all.  I don&#39;t recall the first object changing speed or streaking away or anything like that, but making that 90 degree turn was pretty wild and it got ahead very quickly becasue the other object took longer to turn to the east.  After the 90 turn I could see the objects for approx another 5 seconds.  I didn&#39;t hear anything unusual during the event, however an hour or two latter when we had finished working for the evening and I was taking a shower and my ! father was upstairs in the house, he heard a loud boom or a bang, which I didn&#39;t hear.  A sonic boom?? maybe??  The closest military airbase with jets, is in Cold Lake, about 2 hrs away by ground to the north/west.  At the time there was a military air base in Edmonton about an hour away by ground,to the west, however I think they only had helicopters at that site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

9/15/83 21:00|Stratford|CT|Triangle|45 minutes|V shaped UFO tracked for miles by Ct residents  (Hudson Valley Connected)|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30979.html|3|ndxe198309| ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event is approximate, although the witness probably is correct in his recollection of the date.  The first major sighting to occur in a series of sightings, which later were to become known as the &#34;Hudson Valley Sighting,&#34; occurred on March 23, 1983, according to &#34;The Encyclopedia of Extraterrestrial Encounters,&#34; by Ronald D. Story.  [Please see the NUFORC website for details of that publication.]  The Hudson Valley sightings continued into the year 1984.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> V shaped UFO tracked for miles by Ct residents  (Hudson Valley Connected)<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting had taking place some time ago near the year 1983. It was witnessed by hundreds in Connecticut and I had later found out it was first spotted in Lond Island NY. I seems it was tracked form Long Island all the way to Waterbury CT. My sister had received a phone call from a friend saying there was a UFO comming towards our house and it had just passed her house. Well by the time we had gotten outside a few other calls must had been made because we were not the only ones out there. As we waited more people from the nieborhood came out to see what was going on. To my best count there were more than 25 people outside in the street just in our area. It did not take long for this object to appear. The houses in the area were all two story and pleanty of tree&#39;s that stood a bit higher blocked our vision so we all stood in the street that never reiced much traffic. As this object came into view over the houses no one spoke. There wasn&#39;t much to see as it blocked out the stars and the underside was lightless. No sound from the craft was herd as we looked upon it. You could make out shapes on the bottom but not clearly becuase of the lack of light and it all seemed to be the same color a dull dark grey almost black. It had taken a close to a minute to travel over us, it moved very slowly but steady. It seemed to be just over the tree tops wich made judging the size nearly impossible because you could not see all of it at once. Like I had said it just blocked out the stars as it passed over us like we wernt there. As it passed out of sight nobody said a thing and people just seemed to go back to there houses a bit stunned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandfather was ranting saying &#34; there&#39;s no such thing as UFO&#39;s when we received the phone call but after it had passed by he hadn&#39;t said much. We went into the house and he turned on the am radio (WICC in Bpt) and we listened as people called in about this object in the sky. People tracked it all the way to Waterbury and it was said it followed Rt 8 all the way there causing traffic to stop. People got out of there cars on a highway to watch. As it hit Waterbury new reports came in saying it had lights on it and that it was V shaped, something I could not see for myself. The lights were reported as large white lights and it had hoverd there for some time as hundreds of people watched. If I am not mistaken it left at a very high rate of speed but I did not see this and my memory of what I had herd is a bit cloudy now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My reason for writting this now is to gather more information on this sighting. I would like to research this further along with a few other sightings around that time. What I need is the exact date and time. I am planing to go to the library to see what I can pull up. You see this sighting was so huge that the next day it was in all the news papers dressed up as a hoax. It was reported as five ultralight aircraft flying in tight formation with huge lights on them that had come out of a NY airport. I can&#39;t speak for the sightings in Waterbury but what I had seen was by no means explained away by this. I have researched a bit about the Hudson Valley Sightings and I believe these are all linked but this one was seen by far more people than any of them I had read about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have read many of storys that revolved around this and one even went as far as to speak of the military shooting one down that came on regular intervuls in Long Island. Something of a plasma weapon used to take it down and it was tracked with dobblar radar ( a military radar before used weather forcasters, or so its said) I&#39;m getting a bit off track here but if you have any information on this please post it here. It will be a great help to me... thank you.<n>
9/15/83 21:00|Clovis|NM|Triangle|5 minutes|it blocked out the stars as it slowly tracked across town towards Cannon AFB, so I could make out its giant triangular shape easily|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66264.html|4|ndxe198309| I was a young man about 9(1984), but I have told this story to anyone who would listen my whole life as proof UFO&#39;s are not a myth. I was outside playing by myself on a moonless night and I cant say that I heard it, but I felt it for lack of a better term. It seemed audible but not really. I should have been able to hear it because it was not more than a thousand feet. I could not see the craft directly, but it blocked out the stars as it slowly tracked across town towards Cannon AFB, so I could make out its giant triangular shape easily, although I couldn&#39;t see the craft directly. I grew up near the AFB and was fascinated with it. I can remember not getting an &#34;extra-terrestrial&#34; feeling from the craft, but I always assumed it was carrying something to Cannon. The reason I am reporting this is because I went to meet a good friend of mine in Houston, TX just last week and over dinner he described seeing the exact same thing over Houston. He was doing relief work (we are wildland firefighters) and camping at the KOA. He saw a triangle object tracking across the sky. He said it blended in with the sky, but the moonlight was interfearing with its &#34;cloak&#34;. Anyway, I know these things were around as early as 1984. I felt it needed to be documented, the seem to be hard to see. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

No lights or windows  were observed  they reminded me of enormous baloons but could not tell if they were metallic. I was driving taxi at that time and went to work  not making a report but telling a few of my friends about it ,    of course no one had any notion of what it could have been, but several years later in casual conversation with a sranger the subject of UFOs came up and he told of seeing the same thing at the same place except he was observing from highway 395 heading south into Minden (at least 2-3 miles out in the valley.<n>

I saw an silver disk hoovering about 3 1/8 of my hands held up with the bottom of my hand equal to the breakers on the shore. It was about 100 feet in distance from the shore out across the water in the Eastern not very cloudy blue sky. The object appeared to be 4 1/2 fingers thick , held vertically, and tapered down to a left sharp edged saucer and also on the right side tapered down to a right sharp edged saucer sort of like when you put two china plates with the tops on top of each other held horizontally only thicker in the middle.I only saw one saucer flying off in a south-easterly direction slowly at first then gaining speed.The time it took to leave was to count to 18 taking normal counts not in a hurry and by the twenty &amp; the twenty-third count it was gone into thin air way off South-east of myself and a fellow witness.I said to him, &#34;Did you see that?,&#34;Or am I crazy!&#34; Then he replied, &#34; No youre not crazy cause I saw it too ,dont worry about it.&#34;<n>
9/12/83 21:00|Plomosa Mountains|AZ|Fireball|I have no idea.|I was travelling East on I-10 as a passanger in a Semi headed for Phoenix.  It was night time and I was star gazing as I usually do whe|8/10/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08525.html|7|ndxe198309| I was travelling East on I-10 as a passanger in a Semi headed for Phoenix.  It was night time and I was star gazing as I usually do when I saw this ball of fire heading straight for Earth.  I was beside myself with excitement and I told my friend who was driving to stop the truck. I watched this thing as it was approaching and then it stopped dead in its tracks and just hovered there, a great glowing ball of fire. It was pulsating, then it split into two spheres of fire.  They started to move like the shape of an atom inbetween each other, so fast, I couldn&#39;t move, all I could do was watch this most amazing thing that I have ever experienced.  After I don&#39;t know for how long they formed together as one and landed on the ground.  This happened when I was 17, and I am know 33.  Something didn&#39;t occur to me until later, there were other people there, those who had stopped just like we did, but I was the first one there, they were after.  We all just got into our vehicles and drove away completely mesmerized by what we had just seen. The driver is a Cherokee Indian and very supersticious, it freaked her out.  Me, the electricity that I feel everytime that  I releay my account is of a readable measure.  The other passanger in the truck with us was freaked out too, and she too will never forget what we saw.  Because the object was glowing, after much analysis of my oberservation I have come to conclude that I think there were mountains in the back.  That is why I think it might be on the mountain range that I named above.   I know that we were into Az about 45 minutes to an hour when it happened.  When I found this website, I got out my Atlas and estimated my approximate location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a ball of fire that was falling straight to earth that split into two balls of fire that  then started to move at an amazing speed within each other like the shape of an atom without the middle one. The color was a ball of fire.  I think that I could see mountains in the backround.<n>

First, the frequencies are dramatically different.  Also, military a/c may have the ability to encrypt communications during priority activities.  Moreover, if the witness was 16 years of age in 1983, it raises the question of why he might still be a student today, as he indicates.  He does not indicate that he is a university student.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aircraft chasing ufo<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry i don&#39;t remember the exact date of this, but thought it may interest you anyway. I was about 16 years old. I was waiting outside for my friend to come over. I heard the cows at a nearby farm making alot of noise and the neighborhood dogs were barking and howling. I listened to this racket for a few minutes not really thinking much about it. I looked up in the sky and saw a large white ball of light. It was moving very slow over the tree tops. It made no noise at all. I watched it for a few minutes and then ran inside to get my binoculars. When I came back out, I did not see it. My friend pulled up at that time and ran out to my backyard to see what I was doing. As I was telling him about it a military fighter aircraft came right out of the sky. It swooped over the trees, low enough that we could read the writing on the wings. We got in my buddy&#39;s truck and turned on the cb radio. We heard what we thought were two pilots. One said &#34;I can&#39;t see it it&#39;s on ! my backside&#34; another said &#34;I am dropping down to get a better look&#34;. That was all we heard. That night we saw many small lights in the sky moving around and some bright flashes in the woods. The next day I watched several large helicopters circle our property and the fields around us. This was a very strange experience for me.<n>

I lived in a small apartment with only one bedroom, with my son then about two and half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night  exactly on the 7th of September at about 7.00pm I was watching television, the  program was that comedy American called The American Hero.  ((name deleted)) my son was playng with  some toy in the front hall of the apartment, which was very small.  Approximately at 7.13 my  friend ((name deleted)) knock the door. I said :  Come in!  As she come in she said &#34;can I take  ((name delted)) to the laundry, which it was located downstairs. I said yes mainly because it was a  cold night.  As soon she close the door the hall light went off and also the living room, simultaneous.  I could not understand the way, the television was still on, the door didn&#39;t  slam to turn the light switch off.  I remain lying down watching the television.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two minutes approximately later I hear in my mind the words &#34; Female Women Mother, by them I  already turn around on the sofa and on my knees, it continued without stopping:  Turn Around  Count All The Lights On And Off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My vision at the window was off 180 degrees.  On the top right I saw six lights very small  but very bright.  Five of them where in a circle the other one was inside the circle, but not  in middle, it was near the bottom on the left side.  I immidiately start to count, within  five second the outher five lights just went off.  The light that was inside started to move  umbilieved fast towards the middle of the sky, then stopped for approximately one second,  then it moved again to the right, again one second it moved to the far left of my vision in  the sky,one second again it start to move to the centre of the sky, then left again and  again after one sec it moved back to its original position on the right.  After five second  that I count the other five lights reappear and then another five exactly seconds they all  went off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew them that was somenthing out of this World, because to cover the distance that I saw  at that speed, was not humanly possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted))come back from the laundry, and as ((name deleted)) opened the door,she said &#34; why did you switch the lights off? I said - ((name deleted)) I dindn&#39;t move from here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that both light switches were on.  Again I was puzzled, becuse the switches were the old type, which were harder to turn on or off, unlike the modern ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood up next to the sofa by the window and showed to ((name deleted)) what I had seen.  She looked at  me and listened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never spoke about it again, until the other day when I rang and asked her if she remembered it.  Of course she did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> p.s the movement of the light was in a perfect horizontal manner.  There was a dense beam, so dense it looked solid.  The beam was blueish with a blueish metallic glow.<n>

9/4/83 15:10|Maroa|IL|Disk|:30 seconds|Enormous luminous disc seen over farmstead in broad daylight|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69428.html|11|ndxe198309| Enormous luminous disc seen over farmstead in broad daylight<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1983, I was a sophomore in High School, staying with friends of the family in Argenta Illinois, while my father, stepmother, and baby half brother were in Massachusetts for five months where dad was doing coursework for his P.h.D.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One Sunday that September, I was riding with Dan, the father of the family I was staying with, on the way to Maroa, Illinois to have Sunday dinner at his wife&#39;s parent&#39;s house.  I believe it was Sunday, September 4th 1983, but it could have been a later Sunday that month.  Dan was in his late 20’s at the time, an insurance salesman, married with a 7-year old child.  I was a just a boy in high school, editor of the school paper, active in the marching band and school plays.  I went on to a successful career in radio broadcasting and commercial voice-over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dan was driving, and I was in the passenger seat of his black 1978 Gremlin.  We were going approximately 50 miles per hour, due west along Washington Street Road between Argenta and Maroa, roughly two miles west of Maroa and Illinois Highway 51 North.  It was sometime past three o’clock in the afternoon, as we were near the intersection of Washington Street Road and Greenswitch Road, just where there’s a junction tower of high voltage lines, where two sets of north-south lines and one set of east-west lines cross.  The temperature was in the mid 70’s so we had the windows down and the radio playing, but not very loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this moment that I noticed what at first looked like a cirrus cloud--it was a very bright white &#34;cigar”&#34; shape, tapering in a very shallow curve from the ends to the middle, the same shape top and bottom, like a discus viewed edge-on.  It was approximately 200 feet above the ground, directly above a farmstead on the left side of the road, about a ¾ of a mile ahead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was noticeably larger across than the farmstead, which consisted of a house, some trees, a couple of equipment barns and large round grain bin.  This would make the size of the object between 100 and 200 yards across, and about 30 to 40 feet thick in the middle, top to bottom.  Immediately, I realized that it couldn’t be a cloud, because it was far too low for a cirrus cloud, and there were no other clouds visible in the sky.  Also, it appeared to be brighter white than a cloud should be.  It appeared to be shining with it’s own bright white light.  In describing it to people, I have sometimes said that it looked as if the sky were a light blue sheet, and someone had cut a horizontal gash in it with a knife, and sunlight was shining through from behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so bright, I immediately thought it might be a glare on the windshield, so I moved my head from side to side, and forward and back, to see if the “glare” moved respectively with me.  It did not.  It just appeared to hang motionless above the farm house.  At this point, I’d been watching it for all of about ten seconds, and I was starting to wrap my brain around it.  I realized that I was looking at a very large luminous solid object floating in the air above a farmhouse.  I felt adrenaline kick-in hard, and I couldn’t take my eyes off it… I didn’t even dare blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I began to be afraid, because we were essentially heading right towards it at 50 miles an hour!  I could hear no sound from it, but with the windows down and the radio on, I can’t say conclusively that it was silent.  My mind was racing, as I could hardly believe my eyes.  I didn’t know whether Dan had noticed it, and I had just thought about telling him to stop the car, when the object moved.  It didn’t seem to accelerate.  One split second, it was absolutely stationary, and the next split second, it was moving at incredible speed, toward us, parallel to the road.  It covered the half mile or so between the farmhouse and the car in less than two seconds, and passed above the car.  Though it moved very fast, I could tell with absolute certainty that it was a circular disc.  It appeared simply luminous white, with no discernable surface features at all.  I lost sight of it as it passed above the car at an altitude of about 200 feet.  I turned around to see if I could spot it out the rear window, but I couldn’t see it.  As I turned back to the front, I caught sight of Dan (a very religious Christian, incidentally.)  He had turned white as a bed sheet.  It was so striking that for a moment, I just sat staring at him as he gazed ahead, eyes transfixed on the road.  Slowly, he turned to look at me.  As his eyes met mine, he snapped his head to the front again.  I could tell he was breathing hard, and his heart was racing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked him, &#34;Dan, did you see that?&#34;  &#34;That had to be a glare on the windshield,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;That was no glare on the windshield, and you know it!&#34; I said.  He refused to acknowledge what he’d seen, or describe it for me.  He was in an almost catatonic state of denial.  But when I described what I saw, and why I was sure it wasn’t a glare on the windshield, he didn’t contradict my description.  He simply refused to accept that what he’d seen was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire duration of the sighting was less than thirty seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very agitated and frightened for hours afterward, and I had trouble sleeping for weeks thereafter.  As long as I live, I will never forget the sight of that huge disc above the farmhouse.  I was skeptically curious about UFO phenomena before then, but ever since, I have taken reports of such sightings much more seriously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Appeared hot, again like a burning coal in a fire.  No noise whatsoever.  Trajectory towards the north. Size and speed hard to judge against a perfectly starlit sky, but estimated that it was 20-50 m wide at the triangular base, provided that it was 200-500 m above ground as I estimated.  Could have have been much larger if higher.  I saw it directly overhead, until it disppeared over a small hill. Maybe 10-12 seconds in total, so it appeared to be sub-sonic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a professional field biologist and a so-called &#34;highly trained observer.&#34;  I also grew up on CDN airforce bases, so am intimately familiar with aircraft of all shapes and sizes.  At the time of the sighting reported, I had NO IDEA what I had seen.  15 years later, I could be convinced that this was an early test of the stealth fighter/bomber, given the similarity in its configuration (delta-winged, triangular shaped with unknown &#34;stealth&#34; capacities).  I have no tangible evidence proving this sighting.  I did report it to my wife, who happened to be in the outhouse at the time (even as I as personally shittin bricks!), and missed the whole thing.  As as quasi-professional artist, I painted a full colour picture of the object about 6 months after the sighting, based upon a sketch I did a day or two later.  It took me a long time to get my head around this (and I&#39;m still not sure that I have); I was quite excited about what I had seen, but also quite numbed by it, especially since I didn&#39;t have any corroborating evidence.  It was like witnessing a traffic accident, where everything seems sort of like a dream, and yet is burned into the memory receptors permanently, but you&#39;re still not entirely sure that it was you who witnessed what you saw.  It&#39;s like the brain doesn&#39;t quite recognize the input it&#39;s recieving as being valid somehow, and then you start to doubt your own eyes.  If you guys are seriously interested in records and scientific follow ups, I can scan an image of my painting and send it to you for your research and historic files (not monetary gain on either side).

9/1/83 21:30|Boulder|CO|Triangle|10 seconds|I observed a large triangular shaped object in 1983 in the same area and with identical characteristics described in a 2005 report.|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62211.html|13|ndxe198309| I observed a large triangular shaped object in 1983 in the same area and with identical characteristics described in a 2005 report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report is submitted only after reading an existing report dated September 19, 2005.  I too was in Boulder Colorado, watching the night sky, at approximately 2130, in a park near Boulder Canyon.  There were only a few lights on at the time in the area so that my vision of the night sky was not obscured.  I too saw a very large (probably the size of a football field) triangular / boomerang shaped object cross the sky above me – going from west to east (I know because I was near the mountains and the object came from over the mountains).  It was very large, traveling surprisingly slow, and at an altitude I would guess to be less than 1,000 feet.  There was no sound associated with the craft, there were no lights visible at all, and it was very dark in color.  The only way I knew the craft was there was because I noticed it block out the stars above it as it passed in front of them directly above me.  I focused in on it and observed the very distinct outline of the craft and watched it maintain a straight course for 10 seconds until I lost sight of it as it passed directly over the City of Boulder.  It startled me so that I immediately went to a pay phone and called the Boulder Police Department.  Dispatch for the Boulder Police Department informed me that they had recently received over 20 calls already on the same observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This wasn’t 2005 as was the case of the report that has caused me to file this report – My experience was in 1983.  Unfortunately I don’t recall the exact day.  I can only guess that it was late in the year, very possibly September.  I do know that I saw a craft, however.   I had recently spent 4 years in the Navy and was familiar with every type of ‘publicly known’ military aircraft, and this fit the profile of none of them.  I have since gone on to develop a career in the Navy and have spent a great deal of time in a flying status.  To this day, I cannot identify a possible aircraft profile that I know of that is similar to what I saw in 1983.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was still at school in those days, my best mate and I used to find any excuse to get out of a night time and go up behind his place (It was a nature reserve.)  We just sat in a cleariing and smoked a packet of cigaretes, shining our high powered torches all over the place.  The whole idea was just to have a smoke, (as if our parents couldn&#39;t smell it on us when we went home)  any how, this one night, we were smoking, and talking about nothing when we looked up to see what looked like a few satalites moving across the &#34;milky way&#34;.  This was nothing out of the ordinary as it is very clear at night.  All of a sudden, the satalites changed direction and went shooting all over the place at high speed.  Big tough 15 year old boys that we were, we both said something to the effect of &#34;It would be great if it were UFO&#39;s and we got to meet an alien.&#34;  So wee started shining our torches in the direction of these lights in the sky.  It was at this time, we realised the lights were getting larger, and the sound of the night crickets and other sounds were gone.  At the same time, We saw a very bright light come out from the right side above the trees, it took up most of the sky.  The only noise to be heard was a hum .  It was more felt than heard though.  Like a big sub woofer for the Hi Fi systme.  This light went over tthe trees and as it went out of sight over to the left of the clearing the light and sound were gone aswell.  Like big tough men, we turned to each other and said something less than pleasant.  Turned again and ran a good mile in what seemed like only seconds.  As we got tho the house, we saw the dog jumping over the fence to go the way we came.  We called it to stop but it never took direction very well and ignored us completely.  Within a few minutes, we heard the dog yelp in pain, we thought about going to see if it was OK but chickened out.  The next day, th! e dog came home but was sluggish for a couple of days before it came back to its old self.  It had no visable marks or anything and wee can only guess as to why it yelped. I don&#39;t know if anyone else has experienced anything similar, but this is the first time I have told this story to anyone other than Family in almost 15 years, It is as clear today as it was then.

I was leaving from the side entrance of Pathmark grocery store on Hanover Ave and was stopped at the red light. I noticed a silver saucer hovering above the row homes to my left.  It may have been about 150 ft above me. There was no sound or air movement coming from the craft.  There were little squares that may have been windows going around the top part of the craft.  I saw no lights. I got the attention of the man in the car aside of me and pointed to the craft, he was surprised.  The light changed and I made a left on Hanover Ave still in view of the craft and darted into the gas station where there was a group of people gathered. I asked them if they could tell me what that thing was as I pointed to.  They were shocked.  I quick left to follow it as it floated very slowly above Hanover Ave.  I flashed my lights to on coming cars to get them to look up.  I followed the craft till it got to Dorney Park.  It was floating over the park for about 5 minutes when all of a sudden it dropped and then shot up in the sky and was gone. I drove around looking for it but had no luck.  I called the ABE Airport to see if they knew what it was and they didn&#39;t.  They gave me a number to report it to in Washington.  I called and filed a report at that time.  I recently research the files and didn&#39;t find my report.  I purposely stopped people on the street so that in the future I wouldn&#39;t question the incident. I was very close to the craft and couldn&#39;t believe how quiet it was and the fact there was no wind or air being emitted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
