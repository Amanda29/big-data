4/15/64 22:00|Seattle (80miles west of)|WA|Disk|20 min|Many sighting in the sky|1/29/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21470.html|1|ndxe196404| Many sighting in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is written by a 48yr old wm. who In 1964/1965 dont remember correct month or day but school who in, at the age of 11/12 6th grader at the time was in our cabin on a lake which had a beautiful view of the Olympic Mt Range and the full sight of the three sister peaks. My parents and another couple were outside and us 3 sisters and there two boys were all in the bedroom bunked down for the night or so our parents thought. It was around late night maybe 9pm or later, Its sketchy still but i remember a bunch of activitie and excitement going on in the back of the cabin (our bedroom window faced the back of the property not the lake). My dad came running in to the cabin and told us kids to go to sleep and not look out the window ( we tried and couldnt see anything anyway) when parent speak we listened anyway.  Dad got a camera and his gun and ran out side. I dont remember much after that. This is the story we were told by our parent and there friends  They would not lie to us for we have witnessed many and i mean many saucer and wierd stuff in the sky for years over the olypmic mt and our lake.  the story is that there was a flying disk with lights around the bottom of the disk flashing the many colors and they could see the port holes (as mom called them) i dont recall if they saw any aliens in windows or not. Dads gun had a scope on it and they looked thru it. The male friend was a very large man and had to huge a big pine tree he was so frightened, my mother ran up the driveway away from the cabin to get away from it,she said and my dad yelled and said we got kids in the house.  she was so frightened. The disk hovered for about 15 to 20 min. if i recall right.  They got many pictures . We were unaware and dont remember much except that us kids were frightened. The next morning the lake was down a foot and there were dead fish floating in the water. We left for home earlier than usual. My parent had family develop the pictures and they called the authorities and newspapers. The newspaper story said da! d shot a t it which he did not and they said it was spotted over whidbey island which it was not. and the pictures were confiscated by the athourities along with the negatives. I did a share and tell at school with the newspaper articule and never did it again. Us kids were ridiculed and told we were weird. We weren&#39;t  This kind of observation was natuarl to us girls. We&#39;ve seen cigar shaped clouds over the lake, we&#39;ve see orbs, we&#39;ve seen mothership(main) with 4 or more little lights on either side go into it. Alot of the times we would hear a how would you discribe this sound   woowoo  woowooo humming. We brought friends from school after we moved to cabin permantly 1 1/2 later to see the sky at night at lake and they abserved it also.  We&#39;ve seen the public access with three prong hole burned into the ground with the grass pressed down. My grandparent even in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s were still observing these sights. Needless to say my parents are dead. We used to wish as kids that they would land and heal our mother of hodgekins disease. Yes they are up their and we girls are messed up because of it. This is true and unreal to anyone else but we lived it for years. Did we get abducted who knows If so they rejected us, The three of us girls are bi-polar and many physical aliaments, but who doesn&#39;t have these problems.  So im so glad there is this sight to tell my story. To think it is in Seattle, Wa the hot play ground of other beings. Tell your storys it does help. The times have changed Authorities can&#39;t hurt you now its to open and its the 2002 not the 60&#39;s where you were told not to talk about it by your parents and authorities. We are not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

4/15/64 19:00|Valley Station|KY|Other|7 minutes|Very close view of oval/disk shaped craft in the spring of 1964|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38255.html|3|ndxe196404| Very close view of oval/disk shaped craft in the spring of 1964<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a clear spring night before the leaves returned to the trees in 1964 (April I think) just after sunset, my girl friend and I were in the front yard of my parents house with my reflector telescope. The location was Valley Station, Kentucky, about ¾ mile east of Pond Creek on a lightly traveled road with houses and fields.  We were checking out the moon and stars. I tried to sight in a large yellow star directly above us but I just could not get the proper angle, so I shifted the scope to a bright star more along the horizon to the southeast. I was adjusting the focus, with one eye on the eyepiece, and the other eye looking at the ground. My friend started yelling, &#34;Look&#34; and at the same time I noticed the ground started to take on a yellow glow.  I looked up and there was an oval shaped glowing and humming craft above us. The craft was about 50 foot by 40 foot and about 15 foot tall at the peak of the center.  It was hovering about 15 feet above the tree top, approximately 100 feet above the ground and slightly to the south of us about 10 feet. It was somewhat elongated (left to right) and the outer edge of the craft was beveled or rounded and had 3 windows along the edge I saw, and the orientation of the craft did not change very much so I don’t know what the other side looked like. The windows were about 1.5 foot wide by 1 foot tall and they were somewhat oval shaped with a bluish white florescent glow inside, but I could only see slightly inside and saw nothing other than a white overhead. There were some sort of recessed/level red lights around it.  We could feel the heat from the craft, no smell other than heat, and as the very low hum rose in pitch, the glow changed from dark yellow to a golden color.  There appeared to be some sort of burnt crusty material on the under surface that was a slightly darker glow. As the hum rose in pitch the craft glowed golden, and then slowly moved about 300 feet to the south over a field. A bright spotlight came out of the bottom of the craft and it scanned the hills from east to the north and stopping directly on us.  The light was of the intensity of a carbon arc search light even thought the light housing was about football size. After the light shown directly on us for about 5 seconds it turned off and the light was retracted inside. The hum then increased rapidly in pitch, the glow was almost white, and the craft raised and move to the west at an ever increasing speed. As it approached the creek something that looked like a chunk of the crusty material from the bottom fell (nobody could find anything) near the creek. As it moved rapidly off to the west in a straight line, it abruptly changed course about 30 degrees to the northwest and faded off into the distance at an incredible speed. Total time: 6 to 7 minutes. From the time it started to move to the west were screaming for my family to come out and see it but they were too late.  We gave my family all the details and I drew a picture of it.  The next day my Aunt, who was visiting one of my uncles at a nearby house, told my mom she saw it too. The one thing about this that still sticks in my mind was the exit. As it changed course, it reminded me the way a stick looks when you put it into a bucket of water, how the image appears to bend. I have not told many about this, because I didn’t want to be ridiculed.  I am getting old now and thought this may be useful to someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was just getting dark and we saw a very bright star in the north sky.  It then turned into a cloud of mist or smoke, it then formed into a blimp looking craft.  Very LARGE, miles possibly.  It had the same look as the Moon, it appeared to be out of the atmosphere, BUT HUGE and silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it passed over, maybe five minutes, I went in to tell my parents.  Of course they poo-pooed me but turned on the radio and, sure enough the news was reporting a UFO over Miami.  They reported that it was believed to be a Russian derelict satelite, in 1963-4??<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
