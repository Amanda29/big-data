Noticed the first object roughly 5miles south of Mt. Washington, KY.  Object seemed just to be very large and bright, but didn&#39;t seem to be moving, so I figured it was a cell tower.  As we got closer, we noticed that the object was in fact moving, but at an exceptionally slow pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon turning into Wal-Mart on John Rowan Blvd in Bardstown, stopped on the road to look up as an object the size of an airplane but angled more in a chevron shape flew over head.  The center light was extremely bright, and it had smaller red and green blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I assumed maybe it was a jet, but, while traveling farther south out of Bardstown, I watched three of these crafts travel in a line formation in the same direction (South down 31E towards Hodgenville) too far apart to be on a military mission.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the three dispersed into a triangular shape each going in opposite direction, until they were too far away to really decipher anymore, though all the while they still seemed to be moving very slowly.<n>

The 3 leftside lights went north ,in a straight line and disappeared. The remaing lights stayed,while one went straight up to around 100 times the distance of the original line of lights. It then took off north faster than a meteor,then disapeard.I looked back to the original line of lights, and they were gone.  Both myself and my bud&#39;s friend saw the same thing.<n>

At around 10 PM we both witnessed a bright, circular light on the south east horizon.  We were listening to the radio and both noticed the light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 10 seconds it disappeared and my fiancée interrupted the silence asking, &#34;Did you just see that?&#34;  I quickly replied, &#34;YES!! I DID!&#34;  Then about another 10 seconds later to the east of us we noticed the light flickering then it dipped down in a swirling motion, leaving traces of light in it&#39;s path and it disappeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancée told me that when she first saw it she thought it was a giant shooting star, because it had a trace of light following it.  She was excited because she had never seen a shooting star, but then the light abruptly stopped in the sky and stayed there until it blinked out of sight (and then later appeared to the east like I described).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We know it was not a plane, it was much bigger than a star, an! d it was far too high in the sky to be a street light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, we can not explain.  She never fully believed in UFO&#39;s until our experience.<n>
10/31/10 21:50|Stayton|OR|Changing|15 minutes|A cylindrical, than triangulat object floating in the sky with many different colors of light flickering!!!|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78682.html|4|ndxe201010| A cylindrical, than triangulat object floating in the sky with many different colors of light flickering!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11/ 1/10   On 10/31/10 at approximately 2150 my wife called me and said there is an object floating in the air right above our car and you need to come here now to the end of the street with a camera. In the van was my wife and two of our children who also witnessed this object, and were very scared. My wife indicated looking at an object above her no bigger than a large trashcan and it was about 40 feet above the ground.  She stated the object was cylindrical in shape, orange and white in color and with a yellow glow. There was no wind at the time. She said as soon as she got out of the van to look at it, it immediately started to move away in a northern direction and upward.  Her whole initial interaction lasted about 2-3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now driving to where she is and as I am driving and looking in the sky, I now notice an odd lit object floating fairly high in the sky, north of me. I pulled over and began to video tape it. There were some high clouds, but no wind or rain. What I saw with my naked eye was an object the size of a tennis ball at arm’s length away. There was a reddish-yellow constant glow that also varied in brightness.  Through the video camera I was able to zoom in and see a completely different object. Now I see an object that was initially the shape and color that my wife described to me. It was hazy and had a radiant glow of orange. Then it suddenly changed shape and now I see a distinct triangular shape with multiple colors flashing in no specific pattern. The lights were yellow, blue, green, red, purple, orange and pink.  As the lights flashed in a triangular direction there was also another set of lights that were moving around the triangular ones in an elliptical direction, which! were mostly yellow and orange in color and had a more constant brightness.  The object continued to move upward and north westerly. Towards the end of the sighting, the shape of the object clustered together and became blurry.  However, you could still distinctly see the different colors flashing.   Then a ball of colors appeared to drop from the object and was visible for only a second. A total of three of the colored balls or globs of light fell or dropped from the main object. After the third one dropped, the object seemed to fade in brightness, flickered a couple times, then vanished possibly behind the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called and reported this to the 911 operator at 2231.  The operator documented the information and then called me back with the UFO report line, which I then called as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are still unable to determine what we saw in the sky…<n>

Another adult and I were walking up the street in our neighborhood subdivision and spotted a brightly lit orange, orb-like light moving slowly from the north to the east about 50 to 60 degrees up in a clear, cloudless night sky.  As it moved to the north, it gradually dimmed and completely disappeared in mid-air.  At that time, we then approached two other adults we knew personally who said there was another orange light preceding the last one just minutes before going in the exact same direction and it disappeared the same way.<n>

After slow hesitation...disappeared quickly!<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:53 pm on Oct. 31, 2010 we saw a very bright light in the sky. Not sure how to describe. Like 2 bright stars touching each other. It appeared to be about 4 or 5 miles from us. About a 25 degree angle in the sky.  We were in our driveway in Wentzville, Mo facing east toward Josephville/O&#39;fallon, Mo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still for about 4 min., then started slowly changing colors from white to a reddish glow/flash to a greennish glow/flash. Then it looked like it separated into 2 shapes  like balloons almost touching each other with a reddish glow to it, and went out of our sight behind a rooftop... then out of no where,  the light appeared again. Like it circled an area and came back to starting point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright light again, but more rounded or diamond shaped. It looked like it was a little closer at first, then went back to same area. It looked like it was flashing lights and spinning.When it would move, it looked like it was shadowed like a moon, but you could see it happen as it would spin. It was eventually getting smaller, further away, almost like it was hesitating. Then it vanished quickly with a slight tracer. That was the last time we saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disappeared from our sight at 8:02pm to the east north east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have video, file to big to send via email.<n>
10/31/10 19:30|Northridge|CA|Triangle|15 seconds|rounded “boomerang” shape of about seven or nine dark circles moved slow and absolutely quiet|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78793.html|9|ndxe201010| rounded “boomerang” shape of about seven or nine dark circles moved slow and absolutely quiet<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date was 31 Oct 2010 around 7:00 to 7:30 PM. The location was Northridge, CA. The night sky was pretty clear, the wind pretty calm, temperature was mild 60’s. I was in the backyard star watching which is pretty typical for my weekend evenings. Our backyard is on a south facing hill overlooking the San Fernando Valley, is quite dark for the Valley, and there are no homes behind us. From almost directly overhead a dark object caught my eye. As I focused it was a third round, or a rounded “boomerang” shape, of about seven or nine dark circles, I did not think to count them. It was pretty close overhead and moving slowly although it seemed to move past rather quickly. Its motion was very “smooth” and it was absolutely quiet. It moved from Northwest to Southeast with the center circle in front and the others tailing out left and right. It appeared and “disappeared” quickly. Not that it moved so far into the distance that I could no longer see it but that it just ! got so dark it sort of “disappeared” into the night sky. The entire time I actually saw it was maybe 10 – 15 seconds. My first thought was “what the hell is that?” But logically I assumed it must have been a string of large black balloons let loose on Halloween night, although there remained some small hint of my initial thought “what was that”. Then last night, 7 Nov, I Googled “why move to Florida” (nothing related to that night), and eight or nine results down I saw “A Florida parent and 18-year-old son report watching a large, fast-moving, boomerang-shaped object with no lights moved directly overhead on November 3”. I clicked on and read the article. I do not know what I saw that night, but the witness statements and description of what they saw could have been describing what I saw. Attached is a representation I made of what I saw that night. The entire object appeared to be just the circles which were a dark “grey”, or at least appeared to have no color or illuminat! ion that I could distinguish. Again it moved slowly and smooth! ly, had no lights, and made not a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was facing west, it had an oval shape and appeared to be hollow in the middle and donut shaped. It was illuminated.  It clearly was not a plane or a helicopter, and not a shooting star.  It hovered back and forth and then traveled south at a slow speed, then continued to make a sharp turn west and then the lights went out.  It also had rays of light beamning down from the left and right side.<n>
10/31/10 19:15|Cincinnati|OH|Fireball|4 minutes|Four reddish-orange lights traveling slowly across the sky in Cincinnati, OH|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78762.html|11|ndxe201010| Four reddish-orange lights traveling slowly across the sky in Cincinnati, OH<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Halloween evening, my daughter, my neighbor and I were standing at the end of my driveway handing out candy to trick-or-treater’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were facing north, all three of us observed a line of 4 reddish-orange circular lights emerging slowly from behind the trees to the north. I saw what appeared to be a 5th reddish-orange light trailing the other four at a somewhat greater distance, but when the group of 4 emerged into our line of sight I no longer saw the 5th light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 4 lights traveled as if they were attached by a string, that is, the distance between them did not vary at all as they moved. Perhaps this indicates that they were attached to a craft of some sort, but none was visible from where we stood..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights traveled very slowly, from right to left, across our line of sight in a westward direction. As they moved far to the left they dimmed and flickered out, one by one, until they all disappeared. I tried to take note of whether they passed behind a cloud; I don’t think that was the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Relative to the diameter of a full moon, the length of the formation appeared to be about 6 times that diameter. The angle above the horizon was approximately 55-60 degrees as best I can determine. Each of these “orbs” was about 4 times larger than the brightest star I’ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us heard any sound from this craft, if that’s what it was, but given the distance from us, one wouldn’t likely hear any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor dismissed this whole thing, saying they were “balloons”, but that doesn’t make sense. I’ve been thinking about this and decided it’s definitely out of the ordinary, so decided to report it. My daughter agrees.<n>

10/31/10 18:06|Oak Lawn|IL|Light|6 minutes|((HOAX??))  I bet it was that Chupacabra from the 80's that I saw flying this want to be Dish UFO|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78666.html|15|ndxe201010| I bet it was that Chupacabra from the 80&#39;s that I saw flying this want to be Dish UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> Went outside to the garbage to throw away garbage and saw a light thinking an bright star. The star looking to be moving but was not sure.  But it was moving.  Then was far from distance coming towards moving slow. As I was watching I called someone to come outside and see this light in the distance. They told me there doing something and I told them to hurry up. I watched it slowing getting closer. Thinking at times it looks like the light is sun gleaming on the object or is it a orb or something. Told them hurry up get out here now before you miss it looking sorta high in sky or not no chinese lantern. Then witness who i been saying get outhere comes out side as the light got closer and said something like it might be a Dish I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a plane no sound. Then a blinking plane flew past it above it the light then got out of seeing range for about 10 seconds. Then got over and see it again go past us and notices a very small tiny dot behind it blink onc! e evey 10 seconds but my witness could not see what I was saying. No sound,no blinking light in front but may have blinking light in back that blinks every 10 seconds that you can barely even see. Witness say he could not see the blink that I was talking about. It kept down 99th street sorta. It was getting dimmer the farther it was going as I could see other planes lights clearly as the planes were father than this light. It was around 8:06 to 8:12pm. It was dark around I think 6:30pm so think maybe the sun was glaring on object. But behind the object as it was going past has a very slow blink light on it. I don&#39;t think Dishes have a Blink light on it? Witness think its was a dish with a blink light behind it. It was no Jet,or no plane. Oak Lawn i seen stuff in past. Weird because I was just reading about Betty and Barny the ones who got abducted story. I saw the back of light blink very lightly every 10 seconds as it was passing after around 4 mintues and 35 seconds but t! he witness could not see that. I see stuff like weird simmular! before but behind object light had maybe a beacon blink really slow that blends in too much with the sunlight glare. Moved in a 33 degree anlge going straight. Just kidding why would that Chupacabra from the 80&#39;s want to come back to boring Oak Lawn. Happy Halloween.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

There was even a squirrel that’s making creepy noises on top of an apple tree in front of our house, but what caught my sight was this white, silverish flying on top of my dad’s house. I wasn’t sure how high it was but it was low and visible enough for me and my daughter to see that it had no wings or tail like an airplane.  I was sure it was not an airplane because another airplane was coming by the opposite side heading towards O’Hare airport.  This unidentified flying object was flying on steady speed but without an engine airplane noise that we used to hear every time an airplane would pass by.  This is the third time I’ve seen an unidentified flying object this month and it’s starting to scare me even my daughter as well<n>
10/31/10 12:41|Philipsburg|PA|Circle|c. 4 seconds|Night observation of bright, white circular light descending soundlessly in straight path from sky toward the ground.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78651.html|17|ndxe201010| Night observation of bright, white circular light descending soundlessly in straight path from sky toward the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A sudden light caught my attention in a clear, black, sky. I observed what appeared to be a bright white circle in a perfectly straight downward motion.  I had been looking straight ahead,NNW direction,and it appeared that the light suddenly clicked on. Blackness was in my upper field of vision, then, there it was. Comparing it to a moving car, I would approximate the speed to be 20-25 miles per hour. No wavering; no curve; no speed variance; no light trail.    There were many stars overhead, but none visible in the field behind this dropping light.  . I say “dropping” rather than “falling” because it seemed to me that it was moving more slowly than an object that size would fall the distance that it did.  It also seems that, if it were an object that it was of a weight heavy enough that it would not drift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I caught sight of it as it was was approximately 45 degrees up from ground level. As I do not know the distance from me, I am unsure of its size, however, when extending my thumb, it would have just covered it.   It appeared to be dropping straight to the ground at a steady speed. Comparing the speed to a road vehicle, I would approximate the speed from my vantage point to be 20 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the first things I had noticed as I stepped outside was how very quiet the neighborhood is tonight.  Not a sound could be heard from my deck and not a sound from the descending light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of it as my vision was blocked by a tree, still “solid” with leaves, so I could not see if it followed the straight descending path, but it seems that it would have had to make a very fast turn to avoid the ground.  There was neither sound of impact heard nor explosion of light observed.  Lack of either may have been due to distance, of course, but it just seemed like there should have been something…   As a former high school teacher, then as a hospital unit director,  I have become accustomed to looking up to see some very oddly interesting sights, many of which I learned to quickly dismiss.  There was something about this one, however, that got my attention.  And kept it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the morning, I will check with others, hoping that someone else happened to be outside and looking up at that late hour.  I hope that I find someone, as an unwelcome addition to my wardrobe would be a needed T-shirt reading, “Of all the things that I have lost, I miss my mind the most.”  Thank you, Mr. Davenport, for your dedication to the valuable work that you do, and for this opportunity to share the odd sight that I observed.<n>

I gazed up at the sky and noticed what I thought to be a star. I realized it was too bright and it was moving. It seemed to be coming toward me (going east).  I then stopped to observe it because of its strong single light and the fact it seemed it was moving rather fast.  I live along the coast of Florida and it’s not so unusual to see planes, both private and commercial as we are within around 20 miles from an international airport. I have also seen many helicopters, even at night assisting in police searches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believed this was something I hadn’t seen before.  I listened carefully, as I can usually hear the aircraft, but could not hear anything.  The sky was very clear, I compared the object to a star and it was similar, but too big, too bright and distinctly moving eastward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 15 or 20 seconds, this bright moving light abruptly became an oval shaped white light with a dark center facing downward and it slowed down, practically hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time it had been at least a minute and I ran to the front door and called my wife to see it. She concurred it was nothing we had ever seen before and we should call the police.  Instead I knocked on a neighbor’s door and asked him to come quickly.  He happens to be an avid fan of flying and sometimes attends the air force demonstrations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He as well concurred and together the three of us watched this object move laterally, slower than I had first observed. Now it was traveling south.  For about 30 seconds more it continued, the turned sharply west, moving away from us and just as the oval light had seemingly been switched on, it switched off.  Then it started moving at the original speed I had observed and we lost sight of it into the horizon, as if it went very far west.<n>

It appeared high in the sky.  It was moving slowly.  It would then stop for a minute or two at a time and stay stationary, then move again.  It was partly cloudy and it appeared that sometimes it would maneuver to get into or more clear area of the sky.  In its maneuvers to re-position, it would move in very short, extremely fast speeds. This having appeared so to me, at its seemingly high altitude the speed there must have been tremendously fast.  I watched for approximately an hour, after which it became faint and I could not see it anymore<n>

There were no clouds in the sky and absolutely no wind. At first we thought it had to be a plane but it seemed to move a lot faster and made no noise.  They were bright orange or amber in color and seemed to flicker or glow as they flew over our heads.  They were moving at a very fast speed coming from the South and headed towards North. It took them about 30 seconds from when they came into sight until they flew across the entire sky.  They seemed to be consistently travelling in groups of twos, with the first one being brighter than the second. We were able to make out the dimmer craft following the glowing one to be a disc or circular shaped.  The first time we saw them there were four waves of two crafts per wave. We waited about 30 minutes and a fifth wave came in the same pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

They where all perfectly identical and symmetry.  I ask my spouse DO YOU SEE THAT? Yes she says.  So now I know that its real.  They pass directly over us headed south, no noise, and moving fast.  But right as they pass over us the last four on the right change pattern into a box type. (...::)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they all start moving like they were dancing and their gone just that fast.

We looked over to the right, not sure what direction, and over the houses in the nieghborhood were 5 orange/red lights.  they did not look to be pulsating but they were all in a semi-correlated line, some at different elevations but not drastically.  quickly followed two more and within the minute they were off in the horizon. my only explanation is a group of helicopters, but we didnt hear anything and I am not sure where they would have came from in the first place. I attempted to get a video/pic on my cellphone but the street light ruled that out unfortunately. and yes we were all completely sober. they were no further than the end of the street so they were very close to our proximity.<n>

At first we were going to go ghost hunting around the nearby &#34;haunted&#34; high school. We got out of the car and saw the last thing we thought we would see…  A flying object in the sky, way too close to the ground! It was outlined like a triangle or diamond with lights on the outlining (yellow, kinda orange lights, five of them) but what I noticed is that you couldn’t really see anything in the middle, like it was cloaked or something. We were very alarmed by this so we started walking towards the direction it went (northern, kinda).  After about 15 mins went by we started to walk back (we had seen it once again, but with 3 lights this time).  When we were walking back, all of a sudden, we hear coyotes howling but there was no moon?! We looked back and it was the same UFO we saw but this time it was coming towards us! We ran back to the car, frightened.  At first the car wouldn’t s! tart, but we drove back to the house and saw the flying object once again!  The object was totally silent...no noise at all.<n>

We were looking up at the stars at the time, and it was surprising that there were no stars in the bright, star-lit sky. The wind, out of nowhere, began picking up. We all witnessed 5 yellowish-orange lights (one in the very middle, ahead of all the others, two behind, and two more behind the other two, forming a &#34;V&#34; shape,) flying overhead, headed North, North-Eastern direction (probably about 300 feet above the ground). It made no noise, at all, and when it was approaching, the wind would pick up and would immediately stop when overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of us were astonished, we did not believe our eyes; we decided keep watching the night sky. A couple minutes later, once the wind began to pick up (which was weird, because there was no wind at all during the day-time or through-out the whole day and no clouds,) this light over the track which is usually dimly lit and only comes on every minute or two was fully lit. We were searching for the UFO, and the wind began to come down and we saw 3 yellowish-orange lights headed in the same direction (300 feet above the ground?), this one looked like the other one but without the two lights on the very end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The wind picked up again and dyed down once it disappeared.  The light over the track then dimmed down. We were hearing distant screams, in a manly voice. Within a few seconds, we heard a &#34;metallic,&#34;bang by some nearby bleachers. By then, we started walking on the track, since we got spooked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 2 minutes later, some nearby coyotes started going wild, yelping for help it sounded like. The wind began to pick up, which was our &#34;sign,&#34; and we saw the 3 yellowish-orange lights again (probably 150 feet above the ground), and it did a curving motion above us, speeding up and tilted toward us. (It was hard to keep up with the UFO at the speed it was traveling at; it seemed like the lights turned a white-ish color once they were moving at a fast speed.) We all ran for the car, it was on a mission, we thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The car, which is in good shape, a Ford Mustang, took approximately 3 times to start, which is very, very peculiar. The four of us went to a house, only 50 yards away. We exited the vehicle, and one of us called a friend and he witnessed the UFO too, once it came around the fourth time, headed slightly in a North-Western direction about 3 minutes after we arrived at the house. Once the UFO did come around the final time, a street-light that was off, came on suddenly and was bright; the rest of the lights became slightly brighter<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on that night, all of our phones were having service problems but then again we do all have the same service provider..., an odd night indeed…<n>

We were driving home from the Tampa airport about 8 miles away driving on the suncoast pkwy towards home after welcoming home my mother in law.  I look from a distance and of course just thought it was an airplane, but as we got closer it stayed in the same place, I am sure 747&#39;s do not hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up in Cleveland Ohio and right by the hopkins airport and never seen a plane hover like this,as I got closer it was larger than any plane that of a 747,  This plane that we saw was just hovering over this building, my oldest son said mom its not moving, I said its just a slow desent, trying to keep my eyes on the road as well.  Then I said as we got closer holy crap its not moving! I thought it might be a stealth, since we did have windows down I did not hear anything as far as an airplane engine, it was rather close and still not moving.  I of course did not think anything of it, since it was so close to t! he airport, and macdill airforce base... but with my boys they and now I believe it was a UFO I have never seen an airplane hover like this then just disapear. but not to alarm my 12 yr old who still to this day the movie Signs freaks him out,  I said must be a stealth but my oldest reasoned with me, it couldnt be. Are we right did any one encounter this or are we just seeing a new air craft hover?  I just wish I would have thought to take a pic with my cell phone.<n>

The actual date I have now forgotten.  We live on the route of a nearby airport and I see and know what planes flying over looks like and we also live very close to an army depot which reported NO activities this particular evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were standing facing the open sky and I saw a glowing green flash hurdle to the ground descending from South to North...  It looked as though it hit the ground less than a visible mile from my house.  (Though we didn&#39;t witness ground impact).  The green glowing ball had a tail of sparks trailing behind it.  I have no idea the size of the object, but it was way bigger than a falling star and traveled slower than one time.  By the time I saw it, I had enough time to tell my friend to look too and we both witnessed it fall.   We stood outside long after, nervous of what might happen next and trying to explain what we saw.  Suddenly between 5 and 10 white lights appeared in the sky.  We at first thought them to be airplanes (comparably to the size an airplane light leaves in the sky)  However, these lights were doing figure 8&#39;s in the sky and would continuously travel towards and away from one another in a star like pattern.  This lasted for at least 20 minutes, and we had no video c! amera to record it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called everyone I knew in the area, who also went outside and saw the event of the white lights.  About 15 people witnessed it during those 20 minutes.  I posted that I had seen a UFO of some kind in the area on facebook and got a response from two different people who were traveling a nearby highway who saw the green light also hurdle to the ground.  Both described the sighting exactly how I saw it without my going into detail first. No one ever mentioned the happening again.  I checked the newspaper the next day to see if anything had been said or reported or if their was an explanation and we couldn&#39;t find anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My location is close to O&#39;Hare airport, but no sounds of jet engines were heard, craft appeared to be maybe 1.5&gt;2 larger in diameter and in length of a 757 aircraft.  No tail assembly or wings were visable, even though the craft appeared against a patch of blue sky for several seconds, and was highlighted by a bright sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve since noticed conventional aircraft flying at approximately the same altitude and distance as a comparison, and I&#39;m convinced that what I saw was not an aircraft. It was much too slow and totally silent.<n>

It appeared as jet streaks usually do, moving in a straight, more or less horizontal path and dissipating slowly.  However, near it to the bottom left, I also noticed a teardrop shaped &#34;streak&#34; that did not seem to be moving and was pointed downwards.  I could only faintly make out a solid object at the base of the teardrop, as if it were leaving a tail behind it. I thought this was strange, since it wasn&#39;t really moving.  (And even later, when it did move, it did not move downard, as the position of the &#34;tail&#34; would have suggested.)  I made a note of it at that point but was in a hurry, so I had to stop watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 9:00, after running some errands and returning to work again, I noticed the teardrop-shaped &#34;object&#34; again.  As I was driving towards it at the time, it was difficult to tell if and how quickly it was moving.  However, it seemed to be slowly drifting west.  It appeared larger (perhaps closer?) than before and slightly further north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I parked my car behind the building that I work in and came back around to the main road to get a better look, as there were trees, power lines and other buildings blocking my view.  The process of parking and walking around could not have taken more than 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came back to the main road, though, the object was much smaller (farther away?) and much farther south in the sky.  At this point it was obviously drifting southwest steadily but not particularly quickly.  I attempted to record it on my phone but the sun was too bright for the object to show up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside my place of work and described to my employees what I had seen. I was inside for about 5 minutes before walking back out to check if the object was still visible. It had disappeared from view.<n>

I noticed that an object (which I thought to be an airplane) had recently flown over the woods to my right; however, as I drove closer to the object I noticed that it was hovering silently above the trees.  It then passed over the highway (from right to left) to a lighted gas station.  It then hovered, dropped three balls of light and silently flew over the highway directly above me. At that point I could see it had three lights on its point and smaller lights lining the triangle shape.  I slammed on my breaks hoping to get a picture; however, I was unsuccessful.  (My phone and subsequently phone camera froze)  The truck driver next to me also slammed on breaks and pointed to the object with a dumbfounded expression.<n>

It was a bit chilly but no wind. No cars were out that late at night and no one was around but myself and my friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got to the middle of the parking lot, I looked up at the moon, the sky was completely clear of clouds. The moon was full. But I stood there and noticed a completely dark black diagonal line going through the middle of the moon. The line was like this: / . It didn’t change shape, shrink in size, or change in direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The line was moving at a very slow pace through the moon. I also noticed that this line, from the earth to the moon and from the outer rim of the moon out through the night sky, the dark line was connected to a sun-beam-like light. As the dark line moved to the right, finally completely off the moon, the dark line vanished and formed completely with the ‘light’ line. In my opinion, this object seemed to bend light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By watching this line for 5 minutes or so, I realized that this line was very long.  Possibly as if it went from the side of Earth, through the moon and continuing through the night sky to reach the other end of the Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not the only one to see this.  My friend watched with me and my mother, who was on my cell phone on loud speaker, heard me explain what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know about how my friend felt as we watched, but even though I was slightly cold from the weather, I felt very peaceful.  As if there were no threat.<n>

It was traveling South-East at approx. 1,000 feet or less and cruising slowly. It flew in this direction for several minutes before turning and back to the North and disappearing behind the tree line.  This craft was first seen by me as a friend pulled into my driveway.  My friend, Editor and Chief of the local paper and his wife also witnessed the sighting.  The sky is crystal clear.

The lights seem to be round in shape, white to light silver in color but definatley outlined the shap of a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to myself three times, &#34;What the heck is that&#34;?   After seingin it disappear, I opened the door and asked my wife, &#34;what time is it&#34;?

In around two minutes time it was past my vessel and disappeared from my visible horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not enough, as again on the 30th Oct 2010 at around 2100 UTC in position 01 30N 075 06E off the Lakshadweep Islands, I again sighted a similar object with similar characteristics but this time it was there for around 1.5 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vessel was travelling at the speed of 14 knots heading north.  The objects bearing remained constant for the entire period of its visibility, latter its altitude was reduced and finally it disappeared behind the clouds and then below my visible horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The difference between the two sightings was that the first one was much closer, brighter and travelling fast whilst the second sighting was in a constant position with respect to my ship.<n>

These lights were HUGE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Marine Corps aviation veteran from a very well respected Harrier squadron and worked at the biggest airfield on the east coast. I have extensive knowledge about American military aviation, and this was not an aircraft being it was too high in altitude.  They also did not have any Com-lights like all military and civilian aircraft. I wish I could say it was a satellite, but satellites do not zig-zag, and cannot move nearly as fast as these lights were moving, let alone stopping in mid flight. Also the size would of these orbs would cancel that out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time in the last month that these lights have been witnessed.

I am pretty sure they were regular planes because they stayed straight, and I could hear the engines...<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is still going on right now... I have not seen the planes! return, and the strange lights are still hanging out in the same spot, and keeps moving around in the same area in all different directions...<n>
10/29/10 19:30|St. Matthew Village (Belize)||Light|35 minutes|over 50 lights appearing in the sky and landing in the jungle of Belize|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79257.html|44|ndxe201010| over 50 lights appearing in the sky and landing in the jungle of Belize<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 29, 2010 I was watching TV on the second floor of my house when my dad came to me and said “go look outside”.  So I got up and went on the front verandah where I saw three lights up in the sky.  I was puzzled because we were live we are the last occupants and the road does not go that far back into the jungle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a fact, everyone here knows there is nothing but raw jungle back there that local villagers sometimes go to hunt.  At first I was thinking it might be flares, but then I said to myself flares shoot up from the ground into the sky, exploded and light up the sky while coming down.  But these lights didn’t come from the ground and they weren’t falling.  One just appeared and moved down slowly, then stopped and hovered there for a while.  Then two more lights appeared and the left and right of It and did the same thing.  The three lights just hovered there for about 10 minutes and then one by one followed each other behind the jungle.  We could see the top of the trees when it was landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I was just amazed and puzzled at what I just saw trying to figure out what it could be.  My dad told me that they often comes every now and then around the same time and then leave about 20 minutes after.  So I stayed on kept watching and sure indeed in 15 minutes, one by one they came back up.  It flew up for about 200 feet in the sky and then just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night, October 30, 2010 they came back.  However, this time there were about 20 lights up in the sky at the same time hovering over the same place.  I started to get scared a little because they just kept coming in and landing one after the next.   My entire family came out to watch as one by one they appeared up in the sky.  I was really scared because I taught it was like an invasion or something like war of the worlds going to happen and my family was going to be the first.  My sister didn’t want to scare her kids so she took them down and sent them to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To make sure we were not the only ones seeing these lights, I took my cell phone and texts all my friends in the village about the lights so they too can see them.  And I also took some photos on my cell phone that you can have to analyze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never believed until I saw it for myself.  I have never believed that humans are alone in this universe but I didn’t expect to see something like that.  My dad who I have had this discussion with several times arguing that there is nothing out there realized that he may well be wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I don’t know what to think and this is making all of us re assess our beliefs into what man has made us to believe.  I’m not going to just drop my faith but I know what I saw and that was not human.  When watching the television serious “Ancient Aliens” I connected right away with it.  And maybe what they say is true.  That is the human race realize we are not alone we will react in chaos.  Governmental Structures and religion will fall as this is our backbone of our present society structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BUT I know what we saw.  We all did.  No way on earth can those be man made as there were way too close to each other.  And living in this area for the past 10 years, I know, we all know, there is no airport or city or villages in that area of any kind.  JUST RAW JUNGLE<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Bright orange oblong shaped aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on Hwy 161 towards York , SC. I had just gotten off of exit 8 ( Kings Mountain , NC ). The sun was setting to the right of me. The sky was already dark to the left of me. Out of the corner of my eye , I noticed an oblong ( circular and oval shaped ) aircraft that originally appeared to be the moon. However , it instantly shot to the other side of the road and moved towards the setting sun at a snails pace. It had two becons ( on top and on the bottom ).  These becons flashed a red light , independently of each other. Had it not been for the contrasting skyline , this aircraft would not have been seen.  The aircraft resembled a blimp , however , it was totally illunated with an orange glow . The glow wasn&#39;t bright like the sun.  However , it was entirely orange ( like a sunset ) and this illumination stayed within the context of it&#39;s frame. It had no windows and no jet stream at anytime. Yet it moved in a blink of an eye when manuvered to do so. It! first appeared on the right hand side of the road and moved within an instant ( a matter of a second ) to the left hand side and continued to hover at about 10,000 feet about the ground. I came to an opening on the side of the road and noticed other vehicles pulled over and people observing the same thing as me. I pulled over and observed this craft moving towards the orange skyline and vanish. The first thing I thought was &#34; Military &#34;. But the more I dwell on it...it could&#39;ve been something else. However , I&#39;ve been in the military and seen all types of things. This WAS NOT anything other than something entirely foreign to the best of my knowledge. It WAS a UFO. Albeit , alien or government. But something is most definately out there !! Later that night....my sense of smell would only smell supher or moth balls. The carried on through the remainder of the night. I write this on day 2. I wonder what will happen next as I hear that sometimes , people get sick from radiatio! n or something. I&#39;ll be back in touch.<n>

When we started the walk around some of the condo clusters at Point Edwards in Edmonds I noticed a reddish light in the westerly direction over the Olympics in about the usual location for an inbound commercial flight. It looked a little odd because of the predominate reddish sort of glow and slightly larger than usual size and lack of apparent movement (which is not uncommon when you see a jet coming in from the west). I thought it was a little odd but figured it was just another airliner and continued the walk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later when I rounded the easterly corner of the complex and turned back in a westerly and then southwesterly direction I was surprised to see 4-5 “glowing red spherical lights” coming from the south, maybe a mile south of the Edmonds breakwater.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought they were probably helicopters at first, although unusually lit, as their motion resembled that of helicopters. There were white and red flashing lights in what seemed a spherical shape. The lights appeared less than a mile off the shoreline and maybe at an altitude of about a thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really caught my attention was a total lack of noise. The lights seemed to float in a loose formation slowly north and then turned west, slowly gaining altitude. They were about the size of my thumbnail held at arms length when not far off the south end of the Edmonds breakwater. One of the lights that turned west before the others disappeared while I was watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to my condo for binoculars but the lights were gone when I got back outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A car with a family in it came by while I was watching the lights and the driver stopped and asked me what the lights were but neither of us had a clue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The evening was clear, the sky dark, and the major stars easily visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer: male, 63, MBA degree, former pilot, hunter, businessman, sailor.<n>

There was a haze between the object, my son said &#39;that object looks like the Phoenix lights&#39;.  The line of orbs was followed by what appeared to be a helicopter, flying above and behind the line.  As the linear formation traveled further to the south, the orbs scattered, became very bright and then disappeared.  A couple of helicopters circled the area for some time after.  There was a lot of traffic and others must have encountered this formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

As I watched whatever it was it became clear it wasn’t an airplane or helicopters.  All of a sudden it (or they) seemed to stop in the sky briefly and shoot out a huge black / gray cloud of smoke then within a split second turned 180 degrees (maybe it turned before it sprayed the smoke…) and in what seemed like a second it was back over the river headed NW and once again sprayed another huge black or dark grey cloud after which the lights were gone.   Both ‘clouds’ didn’t move, they just hung there for as long as I could see as I passed under one and what I could see in my review mirror as I passed through Vicksburg.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She went to the restroom so I started staring at the clear sky, it&#39;s completely clear out today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 700 yards away I saw the brightest light I&#39;ve ever seen in the daytime sky.  It moved across the sky instantly and it was at this point I&#39;m screaming for my girlfriend to come outside out of the restroom.  It moved to the edge of where I could see in about 10 seconds started blinking and for about 5 seconds blinked very bright and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally my girlfriend makes it to the door to see it do the blinking thing then just was gone… About 1 minute later we saw a cigar shaped craft that was able to move very quickly also.  It wasn&#39;t as bright and you could actually make out the shape, it was moving so quick by the time we got the camera the cigar had blinked out too.   About 2 minutes later there were 3 fighter jets that appeared in the sky that were circling where we saw them both.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know the difference and you can tell very easily planes from different things and these two freaked me out.<n>

I stopped walking and watched the object for 2 minutes .  The object did not move at all it sat perfectly still, made no noise and was approximately  300 to 500 feet in the  air (not certain how high up it was).  I turned for a minute to see if anyone else had noticed this and by the time I turned around the object was gone.  I checked  the sky all around me and saw no chemtrail  or  anything associated with fast moving planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At  5:49, I saw 2 low flying fighter jets  pass by at a high rate of speed.  Then further up in the sky I saw 2 more fighter jets climbing  up in the sky in the general area of where the object was located.  The sun was still out and this object was a very bright silver, I almost had to cover my eyes to look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My co-workers also saw it.  One guy said, &#34;It&#39;s just a hot air balloon.&#34;  I was a bit more suspicious.  We parked the truck and all got out, soon to be astonished.   The object in the distance sat suspended almost completely still aside from its candle light sort of bob (I can best describe it as a shiny, glowing, white candle light...maybe not so much a teardrop).  It begins to appear to fly up and left in a curve.  I tell myself that most planes fly straight.  It moves very slowly.  I begin to notice a small tail behind it.  Then, we notice two more.  We did not see where they came from.  One begins making a slow descent toward the ground or maybe into the horizon.  Very slow.  It begins to stretch vertically across the sky into a long, thin sliver.  It takes about five minutes for the object to completely stretch out and eventually split apart.  At this point, it looks lik! e it has made a slice into the clouds.  By now, the second object began doing the same thing but much less dramatic (possibly further away).  The first object moves ever closer.  The tail is very apparent now.  It is very much shaped like a cone moving across the sky.  We start to make out a body.  When it comes in really close range, I notice another candle light-like object off in the horizon.  The one nearest to us now appears to be splitting between the &#34;body&#34; and the &#34;cone.&#34;  It also appears to be dropping some sort of mist out of the back - very similar to a crop duster releasing pesticides.  I see no propellors.  I can vaguely make out what appears to be wing(s).  There is no sound coming from the object.  It gets near enough to where it flies almost directly over us.  There is still no sound.  At this point, I believe I am seeing an airplane of some sort.  It looks like an airplane, but it is odd.  I want to say it is an airplane, but I have an odd feeling that it i! s not.  It has a strange, round shape in some places.  And I c! an only make out one wing.  I see that it is silver, and the round part may be red.  No lights.  Not that I can tell.  Also, the speed and altitude at which the object is traveling not to mention the misty trail it leaves behind are perplexing to say the least.  We snap a few photos and later find the object in the photo to look quite different from what we believed to have seen.  After flying behind the trees for only a few seconds it seemed to disappear.  The other object off in the horizon is still there.  My co-workers go inside, and I stay outside still in awe.  The one begins to stretch just like the object before.  Again, this object stretches out vertically and splits making a cut / slice in the clouds off in the horizon.  I go inside, do my work for a few minutes, and come back outside.  I see one more that never gets past the shiny, teardrop, candle light stage.  It bobs like a candle light in the distance and moves a little to the left.  It instantly disappears after abou! t 30 seconds.  I have never seen anything like this in my life, but I have found other pictures on the internet of EXACTLY what we saw.  The stories entail very similar descriptions as well.  The photos taken of other accounts I have discovered to be of higher quality than the photos we have.<n>

GA mountain top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I made a trip to a mountaintop west of the city of Franklin, I took two photos.I was told the mountain top was the highest point in Heard Co. I was with six other people.  The best view was to the west.  My grandfather&#39;s old home place was about 20 miles to the west.  We were trying to locate an mircowave tower that was not too far from the old home place.  We could just see it. it was around 2:00 to 3:00pm so the sun was still high in the sky so we wer not viewing the sunset.  We did not see anything but a distance view,trees and green except the distant microwave tower.  I had just purchased a new camara so I shot two photos befor we when back down the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that afternoon I viewed the pictures I took.  The first photo of the mountain top had a strange light in it.  The light appeared to be just over the tree tops a few miles away. I thought that maybe the sun was reflecting from something, except I had not seen anything for it to reflect off of.  Then I thought may be a drop of something may be on the camara lens.  The #2 photo had the same light but it was to the right of the photo because I had shot the view more to the left.  It proved to me that the light was not caused from anything on the lens.  My camara was not set on flash so the light was not from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more I looked at the photos the more it appears that my camara had been able to catch the images of something that my and others with me could not see.<n>

The shape was somewhat of a diamond with 2 seperate lights following..Reminded me of a kite. I called for my boyfriend and son (he&#39;s 8) to witness with me.  The UFO was moving forward and also back and forth and left and right. At one point it appeared to hover and move back and forth.  While my son was watching with me we saw it turn around and then come back again.  The type of turn reminds me of a wide turn in a car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last I seen of it it was traveling South moving closer to flying over my home.  It was headed in the direction of Bridgeport Ct.  There were airplanes flying and this object was higher in the air than the smaller aircraft flying.<n>

The light was hazy and bright and quite low to the ground: not where bird fly, typically, but probably a few hundred feet higher.  Though the clouds were somewhat dark and thick that night and we were driving (roughly) in the same direction the craft was heading, we didn&#39;t see it again.  There were two of us that saw the craft and we both commented on both the odd shape as well as how low it was flying. Not to mention, the direction was not horizontal as a plane would fly.  These were not flood lights either as the craft was unmistakably a shape and glowing.  Flood lights reflect on the clouds: no comparison.  We didn&#39;t have time to react to get any audio.  The time was about 3-4 seconds at most for the sighting.<n>

It was daylight and approximately 8:10-830 in the morning.  I looked up because the moon being visible in the daylight caught my eye.  Then I looked to the left of the moon and saw a rectangular object hovering overhead.  It was clear enough that I could make out it was rectangular in shape.  It was silent and seemed to be gliding or hovering very slowly.  It was not flat and there was something underneath it more like a square shaped box attached to the rectangular portion.  It was silvery white and very shiny.  It was not very high up but there was a haze and glare that prevented me from seeing clear details.  I said to my friend what is that?  Could it be a plane?  I really couldn&#39;t believe what I saw.  She looked up, but as we were both continuing to walk towards my car our view became obstructed by trees.  I said lets get on the other side of these 2 trees, you have! to see this so I&#39;ll know I&#39;m not crazy. It only took us approximately 5 seconds to get past the tall trees. After I cleared the trees it took me a few seconds to find it. It was way higher up and way off in the distance and now looked like a distant shining star.  My friend said where is it.  I tried to point it out to her but within seconds it traveled so fast it became what looked like a distant star to completely vanishing. My friend never got a glimpse of it.  We continued on to my car for our break.  The more I thought about it the more strange I felt.  I am sure it was not any kind of aircraft that I have seen before.  I have never seen a UFO but this is definitely what I would classify it as.  After about 5 minutes we got out of the car to walk back into work.  My friend looked up and there was a jet in the sky and she jokingly said maybe its chasing your UFO.  I laughed, but then looked to the left farther out in the sky and I said to her look at that.  We both saw! approximately 6-8 jets extremely close together all traveling! in the same direction and towards the direction that I lost sight of the UFO about 5 minutes prior.  My friend said now that is really weird, because it looks like they are chasing the UFO that you saw only minutes before. We both stood there dumbfounded. I have never seen that many jets so close together and especially all traveling in the same direction.  I feel that it was a bit strange and coincidental.  I am really confused as to what I saw and still cannot believe it.  It seems so unreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I realized they lasted a lot longer than a shooting star and had a tail, kind of like a firework that is ending.  Then they converged into one big fireball, that continued to fall with a tail.  I thought maybe I was witnessing some type of meteor or something.  After this large ball fell for a bout two minutes, it kind of exploded in 10-12 smaller objects that were lighted and were obviously controlled by something, they were no longer &#34;falling&#34;   They moved around, formed a large circle and finally disappeared.  This was the strangest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.<n>

I looked up at a low horizon star constellation as i have been daily.  A orange fireball flew by the stars slowly.  I could not tell it&#39;s distance, but i believe it was quite far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event took place West of my location (of Herkimer). I watched it for maybe 15-20 seconds and seen a flash.  Nothing further to report.<n>

I noticed a string of about 10 to 12 lights in a loose V-formation very high up moving quickly across the sky.  A tree blocked my vision for a moment and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up at the moon, and something to the right of the moon immediately caught my attention. It was a small point of light in the sky, roughly the same size as Jupiter but noticeably brighter and changing VERY quickly between red/green/blue colors. After scanning the rest of the sky to get an idea of how a few bright stars were twinkling I realized I could probably get a better look at these lights through my telescope, so I went inside and gathered my telescope and three different optics pieces. I also grabbed my digital camera, which I used together with my telescope to capture some video and two still shots. I observed the lights for about ten minutes total before going back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

THE MOON WAS FULL THAT NIGHT.  AS I WAS LOOKING THRU THE TELESCOPE AT THE MOON, ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS A BLACK DISC SHAPED OBJECT.  IT MOVED ACROSS THE LENS OF MY TELESCOPE.  IT PASSED IN FRONT OF THE MOON, AS I WAS OBSERVING THIS EVENT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE LENS OF MY TELESCOPE IS 3 INCHES IN DIAMETER, SO THE MOON ALMOST COVERS THE LENS OF MY TELESCOPE.

I looked left and was shocked to see a Very large looking Triangle shaped craft.  It had about five or six very bright white lights around it&#39;s front. It was silent and moved rather quickly.  It was gone behind some houses after about 1-2 seconds.  I ran outside to try to see it but did not witness it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listened for the sound of a plane just in case that is what I saw and there was no sound.<n>

It made it from the sky to the tree area in about 5 seconds. It looked like a ball of fire but the bottom of it was flashing.  All it really did was fall from the sky we sort of looked for it but couldn&#39;t find anything so it must have went into a field or something.  It also made a loud noise like a airplane would for just a second until it reached ground area.<n>
10/28/10 19:50|Stanton|NE|Light|30-45 seconds|I saw an amzingly bright light in the night sky and then it disappeared.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78608.html|68|ndxe201010| I saw an amzingly bright light in the night sky and then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a very small town of 1,500 people and tonight I was on my driveway looking up at the stars with a friend of mine looking for Orion (but its not summer), and she wanted to download an app on her phone called the Google Star Map. I was looking at something similar to Orion’s belt towards the West, when I saw a “Shooting Star” shoot towards it.  Immediately after that occurred, she said her phone wasn’t downloading right. I didn’t think much of that, so we started walking towards her car to charge her phone. There was a problem though, everything was dead silent. Usually you can hear my dog barking, but nothing, dead silent. So then, I look back in the direction of the “Shooting Star”, when I see an EXTREMELY bright light coming towards us. It was heading East. I asked my friend if that was a satellite, (but I’ve seen satellites before, and it was moving way to fast to be one) she said no, its too bright. As it moved closer, it got brighter and brighte! r from a light blue to a violet haze at its peak, just to the north of us.  At the UFO’s peak it took a dramatic turn heading Northeast. The entire time it was “wobbling” from side to side. She yelled for me to go get my sister and simultaneously, the craft started to get dimmer. So I ran to the house, and got her out there and she spotted it too. Then, it vanished. This thing was moving at a phenomenal speed. From one part of the sky to the other, it took around 30 seconds tops for the UFO to go to from one horizon the other.. There were planes in the sky at the time, so we indicated it wasn’t a plane, due to the fact it didn’t have any red or green lights illuminating from it. Also it was moving way to fast. After it exited our sight, everything went back to “normal”, the dogs were barking and her phone was working too. If I had to estimate the height, I would say around 20,000 feet, and if it was at that height, it had to been huge. And, if it was a supersonic jet, you w! ould of heard the sonic booms because I’ve seen the space shut! tle take off.  I didn’t know what that thing was, other than a UFO. Just earlier today I was watching things all about these kind of events. I just want to get this situation figured out. I was a skeptic before this, now I am a believer, and trust me, it takes a lot for me to get shook up like this.<n>

Adjusting just slightly off of the object, due to any auto-kenisis that could affect my vision, I was correct that there was movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The velocity of the object was extremely fast.  The altitude I would say was well above FL600. There is common carrier air traffic to the south of my location with a commonly used airway.  Those aircraft are all well below 45000&#39; and that airway travels an easterly/westerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object displayed no strobe lighting systems, nor anti-collision lighting systems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sounds were observed from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned inside after witnessing the object to note a time of 1945hrs local time or 0045Z.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also checked NASA&#39;s Skywatch for any satellites passing in the region that were visible around the time of my sighting.  All that were listed stated satellites approached from the northern sky sector and departed southerly.  The witnessed object traveled from SSE traveling NNW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a certified commercial pilot with over 20yrs of aviation experience and this object was not an airplane.  I am quite confused as to what I saw. Oct 28, 2010 approx 1937hrs local time, Oak Ridge, NC.<n>

I live in Tracy, CA and the occurrence happened near Mac Arthur Blvd. and Valpico Rd.  The ship had these lime green lights on it and was hovering in the air at approximately 7:25pm-7:40pm on October 28th 2010.  The craft was flying in a really weird pattern that a plane could not. It was circling around and flipping upside down, then pausing and staying in one spot for a long period of time almost like hovering.  I am not the only person who witnessed it, there was another car parked that was taking pictures and just as curious as I was.  Unfortunately I didn’t receive their names or numbers at the time cause I was on my way to pick up my friend and they left right before I did. I wish to know what this ship was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later my friend and I stepped outside and witnessed 5 more unidentified ships in the same area I saw the first ship.  We were in such astonishment that by the time we were walking back to my house to get a camera they started to scatter and disappear.  I never really believed 100% in space ships before now, but I am completely convinced now because there is no other explanation.  The shape were more circular and the places the lights were placed were NOWHERE near what an airplane would have them.  I really think that this needs to be explored more.<n>

Then he said to me, ‘What ‘s that’ ? I looked up and saw a commercial aircraft. We live by the main international airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said that it was a plane. He then said ‘Not that, what are those 2 white things’ ?  I looked up to see two bright white teardrop / triangle shapes - like an iron,  moving parallel to one another. They were moving so perfectly in sync and very very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here and there I could see some red on the upper surface. They flew over the clouds at times so I could tell that they were pretty high. I thought they might be helicopters but there was not a sound and no wings ! Just a body and total silence.

They got smaller and smaller, and I had to hurry back to the house after my son left in his bus, so I didn’t trail them after that. It was a strange feeling and looked and moved like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was mostly clear with some low level patchy clouds moving quickly due to the cold front moving through. I looked up and noticed a black rectangle silhouette against the night sky. The only lights were two white lights on each back corner and one red slow pulsing light on the rear right between the two white lights. It was dead silent. It actually sent chills up my back b/c it was not normal. I&#39;m very in tune with military jets and aircraft in general. I have friends that fly military planes...this was no plane...no airline...no blimp. The size of it and the fact that it was completely quiet is was gave me chills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it could be a blimp...but the black outline against the night sky was definitely a rectangle. It was moving very slow if it was at a low altitude...maybe a bit faster than the clouds were moving? When it passed over our house, it was almost directly overhead...maybe just a few degrees off. The altitude was hard to determine. To me it seemed to be flying at the height that the airlines fly across the city to land at the local airport...only it moving away from town towards the direction of Kinston, NC. If it was flying at the altitude of airlines, then it must have been massive. The wind is blowing out of the S towards the N at about 13mph. The rectangle was kind of moving with the direction of the wind....crossing the wind just a bit. If I had to guess the size, it would be like holding up a dominio against the sky with your hand. It was defintely above the low lying clouds..maybe about the height of a low flying airline across a city to land (only example! I can think of). It was moving from South to North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside and yelled for my wife to come out. It was worth me missing a few seconds of watching it to have a 2nd witness. She got to see it for the last 20-30 seconds as it continue away from our house over the tree line in the back of our yard. I attempted to video it with my Flip HD but was unable to catch it in time. I jumped in the car and attempted to drive towards it in the direction it was moving. I could still see the pulsing red light off in the distance. As I drove towards it, the red pulsing light seemed to change direction and move towards the Northwest. It continued to get further away as I got stuck at several traffic lights. Finally it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I kept telling my boyfriend I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing and was very shaken by it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just want to know if there was anyone else that seen the same thing I saw.  I have no clue what a weather balloon would even look like and have never seen a comet that big!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could someone give me any information on this please? Thank you.<n>

10/27/10 20:15|Wabash|IN|Light|4 minutes|Fast moving light..no sound.. disappeared right before our eyes.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78604.html|83|ndxe201010| Fast moving light..no sound.. disappeared right before our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a completely clear sky.  I live in a remote prairie area so it is easy to see a large sky with no light from town..etc.  My mother and I were pulling into the driveway when I saw what at the time I thought was just another airplane as we live only about 20 miles from Grissom AirForce Base and there are alot of them.  I was joking with her to quickly park so we could get out to see a &#34;ufo&#34;.  After we both got out of the car and looked up into the sky it was a light about the size of a pencil eraser at arms length moving toward us from the west and almost straight overhead of us.  I told her that I believed that all aircraft by faa regs had to have a blinking light.. this had NONE.  It was also moving faster than an airplane would but not fast enough to be completely unusuall.  Just my best guess it would seem to be around 300 feet hight??<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I still believed it to be a jet, however it was making NO sound.  Ive lived out here all my life so ! I know the sound a plane makes. After about 2-3 minutes of watching it..It completely DISAPEARED before our eyes.  I told her it must have went behind a cloud..and she reminded me that there were absolutely not even a single cloud in the sky last night.  As it disappeared it got &#34;fainter&#34; until completely gone.  I believe that what I first thought was a cloud but actually the Milky Way where it disappeared into.  We think that the reason it got fainter was because it ascended at a high speed Upward into the milk way region.  I have never seen ANYTHING like this happen before.  Only a minute or two after it was gone..two planes came toward us from the east..opposite of its traveled direction and traveling a little lower than what the light was.  I have always been a skeptic of these things and never have reported anything like this until now.  I truly believe that theres no way a plane would be completely silent and completely disappear like that thing did.<n>
10/27/10 20:15|Asheville|NC|Light|30 MINUTES|Two gaslike lights moving in circular manner in southern sky|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78585.html|84|ndxe201010| Two gaslike lights moving in circular manner in southern sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking dog in backyard and I noticed moving lights above the trees in my yard. They were moving in a circular manner -two separate whitish lights.  They were fairly bright when I noticed them. I knocked on my 21 year old son&#39;s window and told him to come outside.  They were as bright when he saw them as they were for me.  I then told him to get my other son.   All three of us had never seen anything like it.  The lights were in the southern sky from my house.  They did not appear to be real high up  It is overcast and sort of foggy.  We first thought if someone had a flashlight or two.  But really, we could not see any light trails and basically there is nothing behind my house except fields.  The lights faded out from what they were at the start but kept going in circular manner for 30 mintues or so but not in the same tracks.  Looking up they would appear stongest on the right side of the circle and disappear on the left side of the circle.  If you s! aw Close Encounters, they moved as fast as those lights, but were different. They were gaseous looking lights -sort of cloudlike.  Really weird. There were no noises at all from these lights.  We are located in a rural setting.<n>

It was moving very slowly from West to East, maybe 1,000 feet in the air.  I only guess because I could see 3 airplanes in the sky and they were clearly 20,000 - 30,000 feet in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light was much much lower and as stated earlier, it was only 1 light, not flashing and moving very slow and no noise.<n>

What appeared to be a reflection off a sattelite, i observed this &#34;light&#34; traversing from west to s. east.&#34;light&#34;moving faster than conventional craft,appeared to be travelling at about a 10 degree angle for about 20 seconds, then what appeared to be &#34;chase planes&#34; (6) showed up far behind &#34;light&#34;. At which time &#34;light&#34; accelerated for approx. 2-3 seconds then vanished beyond atmosphere. 8-10 min. later another &#34;light&#34; appeared for approx. 25 sec. then accelerated for 2-3 seconds then vanished, no other craft besides normal air traffic. I went inside to get video camera, upon returning outside i observed 1 more &#34;light&#34; same as 1st 2 but orange tint to this one which accelerated for 2-3 seconds then vanished into &#34;space&#34;. All 3 had same trajectory, same acceleration pattern &amp; no sound. Pretty windy so i couldn&#39;t really hear much, but could still hear planes in normal flight path. What appeared as chase planes seemed to only foll! ow the first 1 i saw but there was no way any conv. craft i&#39;ve ever seen was going to even remotely catch these &#34;lights&#34;. Anyone else see anything above so. Michigan, no. Ohio. no. Indiana border? Couldn&#39;t capture on video.<n>

The object was triangular in shape emitting a constant bright white light. The light emitting from this object did not flicker nor had any variation to it.  There were no atmospheric between myself and the other two witnesses and the object. The object moved in a very slow manner across the sky and then completely disappeared.  All witnesses to this event cited seeing the exact same object and description.  Also note at 20:00 it was a clear sky.  The object was also silent and had no emitting noise from it.  This object was also seen at the same location a few weeks prior to this incident with the exact same details as listed with the incident stated above.<n>

At first, I thought it was a meteor, plane crash, or even missile attack, but whenever it stopped it’s fall and turned horizontal, we took notice and recorded a video of the orange looking object.  It went horizontal for a short time and looked to have even stopped.  After that, the width got smaller like it was going away, before that the width was the same from the decent vertically and then horizontally.  I don’t believe in aliens, so I’d like to know if anyone else has seen the same thing and can explain the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stepped outside and let the pouch pee. As soon as i looked up from my dog I noticed this large light a good distance away. It was yellow/gold and just sat there. At this moment I&#39;m just thinking, &#34;That&#39;s a pretty big light.&#34;  I don&#39;t remember exactly how big the light was, but it was pretty big, bigger than any of the stars or other lights around.  So after staring at this light for a moment, it began to move to the left pretty fast. While moving, the light disappeared but left three other small lights in a line. It continued moving to the left, then stopped. The large yellow light came back, except it was blinking. It moved back to the right, still going pretty fast, and while it was moving back, the yellow light would dim till it wasn&#39;t seen. It stopped again, and three small lights came on, two yellow, 1 red. And at this time i realized it was quite a distance away, which then means that the yellow light was maybe bright! er than i thought. So anyways, it went back to moving to the left, then came back to the right once more, and encountered another triplet of lights identical to itself. Both pairs of lights stopped when they were close together, then they both continued to go, the original lights kept going right, and the others, left until both were out of sight. At first i thought, &#34;Well maybe it&#39;s a plane..&#34; but planes don&#39;t emit that kind of a light, and wouldn&#39;t go in that kind of a pattern, back and forth.<n>

I will now give my account of a few days past that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We again witnessed our &#34;friends&#34; on the farm road on 10/25/10 at about the same time of night.  There was a car behind us when we stopped at my daughter&#39;s mailbox and it passed us and drove towards our ufo which was, once again, sitting in the middle of the farm road we were to take.  All the ufo did was move over into the field, as it did on our first encounter, to let the car make a left turn into a driveway of a farm there.  Then when the car came back out, the ufo didn&#39;t make a move to appear to just be another car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the car left, we approched the ufo to the same cinerio.  It when up and proceeded down the road ahead of us.  When it got to my daughter&#39;s rental home, it went behind the same trees, as it has done, and just hovered there; no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my husband, whom has been dying to see the ufo to come right away.  He was about 20 minutes away and when he got there, it was still there, yet he said he saw two lights in the middle of the hayfield near the mailboxes.  My daughter and I had seen two other lights to the left of the road out in the woods, I forgot to point out, as well.  The two lights over the house appeared to be wider apart, so we are thinking this to be the &#34;mother&#34;.  Anyway, we watched the thing for about a half an hour and took pictures with our cell phones.  None were as impressive as what we were seeing with our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we drove away, we kept stopping to see if it was following us and didn&#39;t see it anymore until we got to the mailboxes; then there it was in the middle of the hayfield.  We got out of the car and took more cell phone pics.  Then we went back down to the house and it again went on ahead of us stopping over the house again, no noise.  When we left the last time headed for home, if followed us all the way back to the mailboxes and stopped in the middle of the road.  It has never stopped more than 20 feet close to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following night when I took my daughter home after work at about the same time, there it was again,  Same thing, went ahead of us, than followed me back out.  I just rolled down the window and said &#34;See ya again, gotta go home&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have not seen our ufo again since that night, 10/26/10.  We hope our friends will come back to see us again sometime.  We miss &#34;them&#34;.<n>

The lights were not flashing. The upper light was arched with the center higher than the ends. The lower light was arched in the opposite direction with the center lower than the ends.  When I first saw the lights they were at a distance from and moving away from me.  The two lights gave the appearance of being in the front and rear of an oval or a circular craft.  The right and left sides had no lights that were visible to me.  The visible lights could have each extended approximately one third the distance around the craft.  The craft moved toward the lights of the city and behind a tall tree that blocked my vision of the red lights.  There was no engine or propeller noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Having a great view of the bridge from the roof of the building we were in, we went upstairs to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We first saw one bright orb-shaped light floating in the sky fairly low, maybe 100-200 feet above the skyline. It was not moving, so we weren&#39;t sure if it was actually floating or a light on top of a building.  As we watched, we started to notice small, bizarre reflections in the sky around it, tiny points of shimmering light (more like reflections of light then actual light itself) slowly moving around the sky, becoming more and less visible. Once, one of these reflection points hovered slowly before shooting off at an extreme velocity straight into the sky. After seeing this, we we&#39;re frightened and excited, and ran to get a video camera to film the events that followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video of the following events can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQzn0zFG6fk (note that youtube compression makes this much less dramatic, please contact me personally if you desire a higher resolution version of the video)  After we set the camera pointing at the still brightly glowing, low, non-moving light in the sky, we noticed that directly above the light two smaller lights came on, both moving fluidly but unnaturally above the initial light. They seemed to have emerged from the initial light. At first these were smaller, and they appeared approximating an upside-down triangle with the initial light at the base. All three then became equal in brightness for about half a minute. The two upper lights slowly switched positions, as the light at the bottom (which had been on for considerably longer) began to descend, very slowly. It descended completely below the skyline over the course of about 3 minutes, with the upper lights moving to approximate a vertical line. Then, the upper lights, each now as bright as the next, began to also descend, until all three had disappeared behind the skyline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses are two college graduates who live and work as artists in Brooklyn, NY.<n>

I heard a crazy sound and immediately got sort of frightended. I looked up and saw a craft flying pretty fast and low towards the north east.  It then took a swooping turn towards what seemed like the Indiana area.  The manueverability was pretty impressive. About 30 seconds later, I saw another craft do pretty much the same thing. I&#39;m sure it was some sort of military craft, but it was nothing that I had ever seen before.  And sound was loud as they approached over my house.  As they got further away, I couldnt hear them anymore. By the lighting on the craft, they apppeared to by triangular.  Could have been a SR-71 Blackbird or so I thought. But after checking out pics of that plane, I would highly doubt it.<n>

There were several people gathered and looking at it.  It was a bright light situated in front of the dark part of a crescent moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be getting closer, so I decided to run to the store and purchase binoculars.<n> <n><n> Viewing it through binoculars clearly showed two white lights and a dim cigar-shaped outline, which was corroborated by several bystanders both at the apartment and the parking lot of the store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 35-40 minutes, the object moved quickly out of the shadowed part of the moon and vanished.<n>

The light appeared to be a glowing circle and immediately broke apart into three separate glowing circles that formed in a three point triangle.  They immediately disappeared and then in the sky where the light had been there was a bunch of tiny white blinking lights like baby stars that flashed randomly.  A few seconds later the same thing happened again.  It was too high in the sky to be anything such as a plane.  I would say it was on the magnitude where you would say “oh that’s a meteor or something” but it was too organized and to repeat identically makes me believe that it was something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a believer in this sort of thing so I am looking to someone to explain to me what this might have been that I saw in the sky.

I could immediately tell it wasn&#39;t an airplane. It lacked the usual appearance of the commercial airline planes I see periodically; tail, wings, exhaust stream, markings of any kind, windows. It was a gleaming white yet translucent. Each end was &#34;rounded&#34; and the center was a different shade which made it look like it had a &#34;band&#34; around it. There was absolutely no sound coming from this craft.  The weather was calm; no wind, blue skies, and a bright morning sun in the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I had been uploading vacation photos from my camera into my laptop that was on the kitchen table, I had my camera in an accessible location. I ran into the house and grabbed the camera which took less than 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon returning to the back yard, it was evident that this object was moving faster than any commercial airliner. I decided to put my camera on &#34;consecutive&#34; shooting but the craft was moving so fast and had changed it&#39;s course from a straight North to South path to an ascending southerly path and was gaining altitude with such speed that I was losing visual in a matter of seconds.  It went from a size where it would have taken a nickel to cover the entire craft to a pinpoint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was only able to catch one pretty clear photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within just a few minutes of seeing this craft, I heard multiple helicopters in the area but never got a visual on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is 20 years as an Insurance Agent and Mutual Fund Investment Adviser.

The light was motionless or seemed that way while I watched as I drove. It looked to be floating about a mile from the tower off to the south.  I was 6 miles from the tower traveling strait towards it.  The light was there and then seemed to fade away slowly getting dim then gone. The light was brighter then the sun rise in the east and was not located near the actual rising sun but quite a bit further south.  There was some light cloud cover and the light was under the clouds.  A very bright white light is the best way to describe it like the sun refecting off of it.  This object would have been 200 ft from the ground.I watched to see if I could spot aircraft lights as I drove past but could see none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We noticed a strange light in the sky that was beaming very brightly onto the water and you could see the water very visibly by the light and then the light would go out and dissapear for a few seconds and reappear in another location close to it previous positon this happened about 4 times and stopped and happened again in 30minutes and the same thing happened again like before but not as long.  Below in the water where it was happening were two squid boats fishing with bright lights and the lights in the sky were hovering above them , ive never seen anything like  this before and it was not an airplane as there was no noise or other lights flashing like they do on airplanes, that weekend I heard of other weird lights in the same location at Curio Bay which is not far from this location. We tryed to get a video on our camera and mobile phones but they wouldnt work! while this occurred.  I endevor to go out there and begin a study to see how frequent this is happening .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We thought it was a plane at first but it was making no noise and then we realized it was only about 200 feet from the ground.  It was too dark to make out what it was put the lights on it were flashing in a circular shape.  When it came into the moonlight it was no longer circular but square. I thought it was a kite and I thought I saw a string but that could not be true because it floated miles away over a river with no one following it.  We thought it could have been a balloon but it was moving much to fast and there was no wind blowing.  It was also to dark to take pictures.<n>

We live near the Otis Air Base on Cape Cod and we are used to seeing airplanes and helicopters in the sky every day. I am also a licensed pilot and I am familiar with aircraft flight, landings etc. What I saw was not an airplane or a helicopter.  The 3 lights were in a chevron pattern with the right most light being the brightest and a bit further from the center than the left loght. I could not tell if these lights were part of a larger craft or if they were separate items.  I would estimate their altitude to be around 1000 feet.  As these lights moved toward me I called to my wife to come and look. She saw them too and asked what they were. As they approached we noticed that there was absolutely no sound coming from them.  If they were airplanes or helicopters there would be some sound coming from them but there was not a whisper of sound co! ming from them.  My wife was uncomfortable watching as they passed overhead and she stepped into the garage to watch under cover.  They passed overhead and over some clouds and we could not see them anymore.<n>

Both had white tails that trailed it for a short distance. They both suddenly stopped and hovered.  The were side by side.  Then one light ball goes off. Then the other.  They then go back on again. They repeated this several times.  They hovered for approxiametly 5 minutes. They then slowly traveled north and went behind a mountain. We think we saw them re-appear farther north beyond the mountain where they appeared to just hover for 10 minutes.  We also noted that air traffic seemed to either stop going in that direction or was diverted to east and west.  We&#39;d like to know if anyone else saw this.<n>

The objects initially looked like meteors as they appeared one after the other and left a trail of sparks in a streak.  When the first object stopped emitting sparks, it changed direction, and then the other object did the same thing.  Both objects then started changing direction numerous times, occasionally emitting sparks.  On a couple of occasions, the objects appeared to hover briefly before moving again.  The objects first appeared overhead moving west to east and appeared to be moving at a very high speed.  After about two minutes of high speed travel, both objects traveled beyond view.  The estimated distance traveled was well over the Phoenix metro area.  Neither object made a sound and no chase vehicles were observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Shortly after both objects disappeared at the same time.  Ten to fifteen seconds later one of the objects reappeared moving in a 45 degree angle upwards. Soon after it disappeared completely.<n>

The first light had a tail behind it that disappeared when the light remained still. Within seconds another light was visible directly next to the first.	 	The two lights began to move in the same direction at about a 55 degree angle to the N/NW of where we were standing, and both had tails behind them at that point. They were moving up and to my right,  immediately changing to separate directions, and began to move downward, then continued to move in multiple directions. (one would spiral down while the other would zip in the opposite direction and vice versa) 	Multiple times both lights would look as if they had burned out or moved behind clouds and then reappear just as brightly as before. This lasted for about 5 minutes, then it seemed they were too low to see from where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were very bright (almost white) and the tails were similar to sparks. The shape was round or possibly oval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were also two other women in the parking lot that observed the entire occurrence, but I didn’t get their names.<n>

They were moderately bright, red/orange in color. They were moving west to east at a slow, stable pace. After the large cluster was no longer visible, a few more objects came into view in the same area, moving west to east. Compared to several obvious commercial airplanes within my field of vision, they were moving slower than the planes and did not have blinking or rotating lights like most airplanes have. Their size, shape, and color were constant. When I went outside onto my deck to get a better view, I saw my neighbors in my driveway looking at the lights. I borrowed their binoculars, but the objects were too far away to identify.  I have never seen a flying object that I couldn&#39;t easily identify. I called the New Garden Flying Field in Toughkeamon, PA but didn&#39;t get an answer.  I am not sure if they have an air traffic control tower or not. If they do, they should! have been able to view the objects as the field is several miles north of my home.  The closest airport that I know of that does have an air traffic control tower is the New Castle County, DE airport.  I took 2 photographs with my iPhone, but the lights are not visible in the photos.<n>

It did not seem to be travelling in any particular direction.  It seemed to be more stationary in the sky.

They seemed to float and we strikingly shinny/bright against the black storm cloud of the approaching storm. There were three game delays and it was announched that the storms were severe containing hail and high winds. I thought the weather service may have been releasing weather ballons into the sky. The floated in succession at close intervals and each one took about 2-3 minutes to be sucked up into the storm. There were at least eight of these that we saw.

My initial thought was it was a comet or meteor because it was bright and had a flame trailing it.  At first it appeared to get closer and was moving horizontally at a slight downward angle then it appeared to just stop with the flame like tail diminishing as it did.  Then it began to move completely horizontal across the sky in the opposite direction it was initially traveling.  There was a group of people standing there and I wanted to stop to ask if “do you see this?” but they were in the middle of an argument.  I called my friend co-worker on the phone, somebody to try to correlate what I was seeing but by the time I completed the call the orange globe slowly started ascending into the twilight sky and disappeared.   I was driving and pulled off the road to watch the object.  Total time observed was about 2 minutes.  The time was exactly 9:24 PM by my cell ph! one history on Friday October 22.  Friday night was a clear crisp cloudless evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Chief in a branch of Public Safety for the City of Pittsburgh and have never and would never report something like this if I was not absolutely certain that what I saw could be explained away as a manmade object or a natural celestial occurrence.  I called the local TV station (WPXI in Pittsburgh) to ask if they had any reports of anything strange in the sky.  The person who answered sounded as if I was annoying him so I cut the conversation short leaving no other information.<n>

I told my freind to look up and the first thing he said was,&#39;holy crap thats a ufo&#39;!  The ufo look like it was like a boombrang or chevron with two big yellowish-reddish circle lights at the bottom.  It lasted about 24 seconds up in the air until it came way to much close to me and my freind.  For a moment i thought it was going to abduct us but instead flew over us.

Another appears and approaches, and hovers then dissapears. .Moves upand down , dims in/out<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night I saw a bright orange orb hovering in the sky. I was standing on my back porch which is 1 story off the ground. I live in the center-most area of my city (Oakland, Ca) and according to Google satellite my street is 400 ft elevated (I live on a hill).  The orb looked as if it was roughly between 10 and 20 thousand feet off the ground,. I was standing on top of a chair, and with doing so it looked like it was in my direct line of sight, but way across town (I was facing NW).  It seemed to be getting brighter then it would dim out then come back, and it was moving up and down very slowly, then it would stay it one spot. The size of it was small compared to the moon, but large compared to a star.  I saw another orb appear that was not bright as the first, and it slowly drifted towards the first orb making its way directly on top of it.  It then stayed then and got very bright, so bright that they almost looked like one.  The second orb then dimmed out )but! still visible) about a minute later and drifted away in the same direction it was going and disappeared (it went in a straight line).  I zoomed in with my camera and the shape of the object looks like a geometric Pac-man shape.  The original orb stayed in the sky for about 20 minutes (that I saw of it that is)  periodically dimming out then getting bright again. Eventually it drifted slowly away and disappeared.<n>
10/22/10 20:00|Atlanta|GA|Disk|continuing|Disk shaped aircraft with bubble top illuminated from within, orange pulsing light on underneath, hovering south of I-75 near Atlanta|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78638.html|136|ndxe201010| Disk shaped aircraft with bubble top illuminated from within, orange pulsing light on underneath, hovering south of I-75 near Atlanta<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday evening at night fall I was driving north on I-75 (Atlanta, Georgia) but was still south of Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport.  To the west of I-75 I would say a couple of miles or so away – difficult to judge distance when the object is in the air – I saw a large illuminated craft hovering in the sky.  At first I thought I was seeing an airplane coming in for a landing; I was driving and trying to look at the same time.  It was evident that the object was NOT an airplane although it could have been the size of a small plane.  The object was disk shaped and looked to have a bubble top.  There was an orange colored light on the underneath side that pulsed maybe every 10-15 seconds.  I was intent on getting to my destination in Atlanta so I did not pull over or exit the Interstate to investigate – wish I had.  I look for a logical explanation – have never seen an object in the air that I could not identify and thought that this object should be a! blimp or an advertising attention getter.  I was told that there has been a blimp in that area for around a week, but I saw that blimp and it is the wrong shape, not illuminated from within, and the light it has is on top of the craft and pulsates more frequently – and the blimp is on the move, not hovering.  I never saw this other aircraft move.  I was only able to observe it for probably 2 – 3 minutes as I was driving, but it was unusual to the extent that I thought I should report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Above the toll gate, but just South of the NH liquor store. I saw what I thought were fireflies in the sky, maybe 100 ft above the freeway , maybe 1000 yards ahead. As I approached the firefly like lights, I looked up and saw a triangular shaped craft traveling about the speed of a helicopter headed South above the freeway passing directly over me. It was dark and unlit, but clearly triangular in shape and with 3 funnels hanging from its underside, reminiscent of the kind of thrusters you would see at the bottom of the space shuttle. I only saw the underside of this object, and swerved my car all over the road as I looked up in amazement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 minutes after this, I pulled over at the NH liquor store and drew a diagram of what I just seen, I also wrote down a description (I wanted to capture this bizarre event while it was still fresh in my mind). While I only saw this for a second or two, I got a really close look at the funnels on the underside.<n>

Maybe that is what I saw, but it was most unusual.  Four bright lights moved down from right to left like slowly falling stars.  They faded then reappeared.  They then moved horizontally to the north.  Then they seemed to stop.  Then I lost sight of them.  It was puzzling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister told me yesterday that there was supposed to be a comet visible this morning.  Maybe that is somehow related.<n>

I look up to see several airplanes leaving an exhaust trail as they fly through the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As two planes going opposite directions came closer to each other before passing one another an bright object appeared in the sky. after the planes passed each other the UFO proceeded to follow one of the planes. It followed for about 10 seconds stopped then slowly got dimmer until it disappeared.  This UFO was not another plane because it did not have an exhaust trail like all the other planes in the sky and also was able to stop and accelerate again, and did so two times.<n>

I went into a co-worker&#39;s office with a south-facing window and we both observed the object which appeared to be at least a couple of miles into the sky, over in the direction of the southern-most part of Richland County. The object didn&#39;t look tear-shaped from our angle, however, it was more like a very short contrail, the way you would think a meteor would look, however, it wasn&#39;t moving enough to be an airplane. It just stayed there, adn eventually got smaller and disappeared. I went back to my office and phoned my daughter and she said they watched the object until it disappeared as well. They tried to video tape it but it wasn&#39;t showing up on their phone camera.  Our local t! elevision station said no one has called anything in.<n>

No one but me saw them on a bus going west on 190.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was riding Dart bus on 190 taking 75 exit to go south to Dallas on Central Expressway when I saw a formation of grey cones that were still in a circle over city hall on Avenue K.  No one on the bus saw them when I said out loud look at the cones in the sky over Plano.   When the bus took the exit they were out of sight.  I&#39;ve asked around and no one has seen such a vehicle that did not move hovering over city hall.  The sky was over cast. A few days later, I was standing in my back yard one morning and 5 black small pyrimid military jets flew low over my home in formation shacking the ground under my feet with  loud engines noises flying from north to west flying upward into the sky.  I worked as a Human Service Spealist for FEMA from 1996 to 2001.  Office was located off I35. I got dizzy because I could feel ground moving from fault line in area.  A guy from Washington called me into his office and stated that I was a senseative and  not disclose to others beca! use they would not understand. I have seen stainless steel 5&#39;x4&#39; thin 1&#39; thick triangular objects appear and disappear in the sky several feet away from me in Alvarado TX 6 years ago making a static noise when no one else sees them.   I could see the screws that held them together like a quilt of stainless steel pieces.  Three years ago I have seen orange basket balls size balls  of fire spew across the sky within several feet from me in Alvarado TX while visiting my family.  We all saw the balls of fire and hope some day to get a maginet on a stick and try to find them where they land in a field near a creek.<n>

It took off very quickly, but we were able to get some video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back to last night’s sighting; again the craft was on the ground, just within sight of my daughter’s mailbox.  We saw it when we stopped to check her mail.  I approached it with my headlights off-parking lights only and my daughter tried to get some video.  She did get some good footage, although with the bumpy road and the speed I was going, the ufo appears to be moving erratically, but it was us doing the moving.  The craft when out over the hay field, within perfect sight of us and went ahead down the road to my daughter’s rental house.  It was there in the sky overhead when we got to the house. . Then it just disappeared!  It didn’t take off as quickly as it did back in August and seemed to be waiting behind some trees for us to catch up before stopping over her house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We know that this thing is real.  It makes no noise and can go as fast or slow as it wants.  The lights change from small to pretty large  and there seems to be yellow lights on each side.  We noticed last night that the thing looks to be at least as big as a good sized car in width and from the way it looked it is most likely an oval shaped craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone has seem anything like this in the area, please, don’t  be afraid to post it.  We haven’t contacted any local authorities since we fear a bombardment of curiosity seekers might scare “our” friends away.  And it really does look like, AFTER SEEING IT 6 TIMES NOW that it wants us to see it.<n>

It was traveling East to Northwest. I could see a long object above the dangling fireball, it 5 orange and red lights, three in a row behind it, two lights to the left and right of the fireball. It was moving forward in the beginning and then started swaying slightly north and south (almost wobbling) as it traveled. It stopped and hovered with the fireball still lit and what still looked like drips of fire. By this time I had gotten my neighbor up who also saw the object.  As it hovered the fireball went out, but I could still see one orange light from the object. It started moving again, slowly, then it I lost site of it.<n>

However in this late October of 2010 the skies there were crystal clear though not as good as in the desert.  I decided to sky-watch specifically for satellites  but also to see how much college astronomy I could remember which, I&#39;m sorry to say turned out to be mostly forgotten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was perhaps 10 PM in the third week of October.  It took a few minutes to sight the first moving object and I was surprised that there seemed to be so few considering how many now exist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was following one with my eyes it suddenly veered off at an odd angle and sped away!  Okay, I haven&#39;t kept up with the technology so I thought that maybe they do that now instead of being tied to a specific course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time I was trying to identify constellations and noted a formation of perhaps eight stars in the low Northeast.  I was curious about this as I had viewed this direction before when the sky was not as clear and these had not been visible though they were as bright as the brightest in the sky.  Strangely, they all had equal brilliance.  Not being too concerned I looked away to again search for satellites and then saw from the corner of my eye a flash from where I had sighted this unknown constellation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly looked back and didn&#39;t notice a change and thought it may have been a farm building&#39;s house light that I knew to be in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked away again and AGAIN  I saw a definite flash from that direction and turned back.  Now I was certain that at least one of the bright starts was gone.  Before I could digest that and while looking directly at them ANOTHER of them &#34;flared&#34; to roughly ten times its brilliance, sort of like a Nova and just vanished.  Momentarily another flared and also disappeared.  Another five did this in succession, flared, then were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Naturally, I tried to rationalize this event thinking that maybe there were some kind of booster rockets on them.  I know that some satellites appear stationary but I have never seen any that were white in color (Most I have seen appeared a kind of red, I assume because they are reflecting the sun from their position so high above the planet).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the entire &#34;constellation&#34; of eight stars was gone!  I continued to scan the skies all around and again saw several more high altitude smaller red moving dots some of whom took off at different angles, including AWAY from earth and at high speed.  There were some red moving dots sighted that did not act in this way,as I had expected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all took place in about twenty minutes when I gave up and returned inside perplexed.  The following days I asked others their opinion as to whether modern satellites could or would maneuver in this way.  No one I spoke to thought that possible especially the very bright white ones the size of major stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having seen aerial phenomenon a number of times in my life and not being a skeptic on the subject, I didn&#39;t give it much more thought.  I have had far better sightings one of which I reported in the past and two more that I need to chronicle for Peter and any investigators.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing that I did notice when I looked at the recent sighting reports for on this site is that in the same week there are listed two or three similar reports made in the Pacific Northwest.<n>

Then about twenty seconds later the light appeared but much higher than the first sighting and not in the same location. It was to high to be any type of aircraft.  For about another ten to fifteen seconds the light was moving very slow then it just simply just vanished again. The color of the light was very strange and I couldn&#39;t really describe the color. I want to say maybe a combo of red and yellow,It was just a very bright steady light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The view from the dock over the water looks west, and to  the west about 25 miles away is Roanoke Virginia, which has a regional airport, and sometimes I watch the planes land, circle or take off. Tonight was very calm, no clouds, clear blue skies and unlimited visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well the sun set, and as usual, the glow from the city took its place in the west, as the stars began to come out. The brightest ones first of course. Now this must have been around or a little after 8 o&#39;clock pm and I noticed two bright stars in the western horizon towards Roanoke. I figured they were both planets, thinking Venus on the left which was the dimmer of the two, and the brighter one on the right, well....had to be Jupiter I guessed, but pretty bright for Jupiter. Both were low in the horizon and nearly horizontally aligned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Behind me (towards the east) was a full moon rising and that gave off quite a bit  of light as well.  It was a very nice and rather bright evening to sit outside and enjoy the end of the day which I continued to do for the next 25 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 minutes I looked above me thinking that the other stars would be coming out now as well, and a few were out, but much more dimmer in relationship to the two I had been watching. Well let me rephrase that, the one on the left could still have been Venus, but the Jupiter light on the right was still too bright. Even for Jupiter.  Now I will admit, I am not even sure what planets are suppose to be out there at this time. But I supposed it was possible I was seeing two planets and Jupiter was really bright tonight. Then it happened. The &#34;Jupiter&#34; light on the right, after being absolutely motionless and hanging there with the &#34;Venus” light for 25 minutes, began to move slowly in a northerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I need to say that I wouldn’t be writing this if I thought there was any way this could have been a plane, I have lived here all my life, I am very familiar with seeing planes in the distance landing at the Roanoke Airport. I have seen them when I was positioned &#34;dead on&#34; to their approach or take off and it can look like they are just vertically rising or vertically coming down. I have seen them land or take off at angles to me, and seen that gradual rise in take-off or gradual drop in landing. But this one was brighter, sat absolutely motionless for about 25 minutes, and then moved to the north. It eventually was obscured by the hills and I lost sight of it, but it was a lot closer than I thought. It really was astounding to see it move after all that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn’t a plane, and it wasn’t Jupiter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now wondering, if, because the moon was so bright behind me, that the moon was reflecting upon this &#34;object&#34; and making it seem brighter. It’s possible, but I know it wasn’t a plane; it hung in the sky for too long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s my story.<n>

I had just arrived home and was sitting in my car in my driveway talking on the phone, when a circular light appeared in the sky towards Laurel. At first I thought it was a plane, but it soon became clear that it was not. It was lower than a plane or helicopter, and moving extremely slow, so slow it was almost hovering. It was moving slowly in the same circular patch of sky, changing directions every few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it doing this same thing for around ten minutes. Then got out of my car, and continued to watch it from outside. It appeared as if there was multiple lights shining from the object, but not flashing or colored like an airplane. I then ran into the house and got my Mom, by the time we got back outside it was a little further away, but still visible and doing the same thing. She confirmed it was not a star or airplane, or anything like she had seen. The whole event lasted at least 15 minutes, and we went inside before it disappeared so it could have been there much longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still in awe over the entire thing and know it was unlike anything I have ever witnessed before. I am 21 years old and have never in my life bought into the whole UFO phenomena, but I have no other explanation for what I witnessed last night.<n>

It zipped in the sky in a very weird angle. almost like a ~ .  It was moving really fast and all of the sudden stopped, sat there for a second or two and then shot straight up vertically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then saw a number of what looked like jets in the distance each direction coming towards the UFO. We were at the intersection of Smith&#39;s Bridge Road and Brandywine Creek Road. (On google maps, it is 901 Smith&#39;s Bridge Road)It was at about a 90-100 degree angle in the sky.  The UFO was a solid glowing off-white in color and seemed semi-transparent on the lower portion.  It had red circular lights on the bottom, but no blinking lights like a normal plane.<n>

It was large, and perfectly still and had no strobe.  It had a rectangular red light, a circular white light in the center, and then a rectangular blue light.  It was clearly very, very far away and higher up than the second craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, as I was watching, a small orange sphere that appeared to be on fire moved very quickly above the tree line and into my field of vision.  The circular, central white light on the first craft flashed, or flickered (very clearly, though), and the orange sphere exploded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all happened very quickly and I was driving the entire time.

They were flying one directly behind the other and appeared to be pulsating a firey reddish/orange color.  Regarding size: If you held out a dime away from you they would be that size.  Distance: About as high as an aircraft approaching a landing.  Speed: each object maintained it&#39;s distance from one another until the object in the front &#34;took off&#34; at an incredibly high rate of speed at about a 70 degree angle away from us until the light disappeared (about 3-5 seconds).  Just about the time the fist object disappeared, the second object stopped and appeared to simply hover (much like a helicopter).  Then, it too, lifted straight up to the sky and took off at an incredibly high rate of speed and within 3-5 seconds, was gone from sight.  There were no sounds that accompanied either object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It came out of the middle of the sky it did not fall from the top. I though it was a airplane of fire or a meteor but it was moving at a moderate almost controlled speed then it made a very rounded turn to my left then slowed to a complete stop where it just sat and eventually faded. It left a very obvious trail of fire behind it and was very prominent against the horizon, the entire event was a full 5 minutes. I took to very good pictures, i am certain it was on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have a reasonably good knowledge of aircraft, and what we saw slightly resembled an F-117 stealth aircraft.  The object was flying at 2500(m)-3000(m) above wooded hills and perhaps flying at 400 (kph) or more.  As I&#39;ve mentioned, the object looked like an F-117, except that it appeared to have &#39;canards&#39; or some awkward and long rectangular shapes sticking diagonally beneath the object.  Quite awkward to see.  If it was an aircraft I&#39;d like to know how the pilot made the aircraft move as nicely as it did.  No nav. lights on the object.<n>

The sun was close to setting.  It was a very bright, clear, cloudless sky.  To the right of the sun, I noticed a bright, ball-shaped spot of light.  At first I thought to myself &#34;Is this Jupiter?&#34; because it&#39;s been visible in the sky at night all during the summer.  But then the light starting fading away and within 5 seconds, it was as if it was never thee at all.  Another thing: there was a regular airplane high in the sky at the same time that day, there was the tell-tale contrail of smoke left behind it.  There was no smoke around this ball of light at all. Looking back on it I can describe it as seeing something reflecting the bright sunlight off of it&#39;s surface. This makes the second time that I&#39;ve seen  and reported something strange and unexplained in the sky.<n>

The crafts didn&#39;t have any sound.  Next, they began to move away from each other and then the one that was traveling in the SE direction...get this, one APPEARED out of nothing and traveled alongside it, very slow, but closer to me.

I regularly observe the night skies and am familiar with the usual constellations at different times of the year, and follow the movements of planets as well.  I live outside of Burnsville, NC, in a very rural area with little light pollution, and the night sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw were three sets of lights, each set arranged as three points of an equilateral triangle, and those arranged as a triangle.  The lights were not blinking, two, maybe three of them had a greenish color.  They were low on the horizon, I detected no solid shape associated with them.  Most unusual was the three sets of lights moved, slightly up and down, with respect to each other.  I tested this by positioning myself in a place in the yard where I could align the top of a hemlock tree (stationary in a breeze-less night) to a set of lights, which definitely moved with respect to the treetop.  I detected no sound, nor was able to perceive how far away they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching this for one minute, maybe more, I rushed inside the house to get my wife and daughter to see it, and by the time they were alerted and out, the lights were gone, not visible anywhere else in the sky.  I regret not waiting to see how they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having watched the night sky where I live for many years, seen the ISS several times, seen comets, a bolide, assorted aircraft, I’d never witnessed lights like these and the fact that they moved was compelling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I only had about two seconds to look at them before they vanish, these lights were stationary when I observed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to my neighbors house to get them, and we stand out there for no more than a minute before I look to the south east and there the bright red lights were again this time the lights were pulsing the highest ball of light first then the second, third, and fourth all lit up in an arch shape before vanishing, these lights were also stationary at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No activity was seen again for about 30 seconds until I look south again, I see two bright white/orange colored lights flying across the sky headed north at a very high speed. I observe the two objects for approximately one minute before the lead light vanishes and the one that was trailing it goes out on my line of sight behind the mountainside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night, and the moon was very bright.<n>
10/19/10 20:18|Crescent City/Gasquet|CA|Triangle|12 mins|Miltary refueling aircraft illuminated with green laser, large triangle of brights lights seen, F-15s in pursuit all in a 30 mins time|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78528.html|178|ndxe201010| Miltary refueling aircraft illuminated with green laser, large triangle of brights lights seen, F-15s in pursuit all in a 30 mins time<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 10/19/10, at about 2030 hrs, I was home watching TV with the sound fairly high.  Several bright lights caught my attention to my right out my glass door.  Looking out my sliding glass door directly adjacent to my chair, I observed a series of five (5) light in a “V” formation in the sky moving directly west of my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My home lies in the Smith River canyon with a ridgeline on the southern, eastern and western sides on my home. This series of lights were moving slowly from east to west.  They were extremely bright and white in color.  The lights disappeared in sequence as they traveled in the sky over the western ridgeline out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had several impressions.  Firstly fireworks, however there was no smoke trail,  independent movement of the light nor vertical movement.  Secondly, a major aircraft (possible airliner) was in the process of crashing or forced landing.  I ran out to my deck overlooking that portion of the sky horizon and heard nothing.  No jet aircraft noise at all.  The lights I had observed were as bright and illuminating traveling away from my position as they would have been had they been landing lights traveling towards my position only brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran upstairs to my bedroom and asked my wife if she had seen these exceptionally bright lights.  She said no, but she had heard a rumble and the second floor of the home had been shaking.  I considered calling the sheriff’s department (where I work), but reconsidered, as I did not want to be made fun of for crackpot questions.  I did not call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 102010, at 0600 hrs I went to work and relieved the night shift patrol sergeant, exchanging highlights from the previous evening.  I casually asked if there had been any report of lights.  I was briefed on the following events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 1953 hrs (101910), the Del Norte Sheriff’s Office received a call from Russ Burks of the FAA in Seattle, WA.  Burks stated that a U.S. Air Force refueling aircraft had been “completely” illuminated by a green laser.  This occurred somewhere between Crescent City, CA and Happy Camp, CA.  The aircraft was at 22,000 feet when this illumination occurred.  Burks requested DNSO to respond to the Gasquet, CA area to investigate any unusual activity and possible source of the laser.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The nightshift sergeant and a trainee were already in this area for 35 to 40 minutes without seeing anything suspicious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the Ft. Dick area just north of Crescent City a deputy sheriff observed a series of lights that were very bright, large and believed to be some type of aircraft.  This deputy is a former US Marine and insisted the lights were not flares or any type of military aircraft he had seen prior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From 2018 hrs (101910) to 2037 hrs, multiple calls were received by DNSO dispatch through “911” regarding white/orange lights, possible flares and military jets in the area.  The sergeant had dispatch re-contact FAA Seattle Center to inquire about possible military jets being in Del Norte County.  The response from the FAA was that F-15s were in our County “doing their thing”.  This is all they would say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later this same day (102010), I spoke to many of our staff about the previous evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One staff member had seen these lights (orange to white) while leaving an event in Smith River, CA (just south of the Oregon border).  The lights were exceptionally bright.  They seemed to blink off two at a time until gone from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another staff member reported seeing the refueling aircraft at a high altitude and that this aircraft was completely visible from underneath by a bright green light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another staff member had spoken to a local business owner (Owner operator of an air ambulance fight company).  This owner stated that he and his wife had been exiting a store in Brookings, Oregon (20 miles north of Crescent City) and had seen these bright lights.  He had told our staff member that he believed there was some large aircraft “on approach” to the Brookings small aircraft field.  Then the lights seemed to blink out two or three at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His secretary later told this owner that she had been leaving a gym in Harbor, Oregon (adjacent to Brookings) when her car had been completely illuminated from overhead by a bright white light.  She had thought at the time that a streetlight may have blown up, but now suspects that it was something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In summary, this event was highly unusual for this area.  The report of a military aircraft being illuminated at 22,000 feet by a green laser, the later appearance of tactical aircraft flying at low altitude pursuing or training pursuit, the large set of lights slowly moving east to west at low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions this evening were clear skies, 50’s in temp and a nearly full moon in the southeastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I observed was massive and brighter than any light I have seen on an aircraft.  I did not hear any noise when I went outside seconds after it went over the ridgeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The military regularly uses an air corridor that is south to north directly over my home.  Their altitude is always 20,000 or above. I am very familiar with that activity. What I saw that night was nothing like I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE:  I am willing to speak to an investigator, but DO NOT release my name or information to ANY outside source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are official two official entries into the DNSO CAD (computer assisted dispatch) system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> CAD #201010190057 relates the call from FAA Seattle Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> CAD #201010190060 relates to the “911” calls about lights seen and jets in the area.<n>

10/19/10 20:15|Raleigh|NC|Light|15 seconds|2 objects that looked like bright stars moving in parallel about 45 degrees above the horizon|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78466.html|180|ndxe201010| 2 objects that looked like bright stars moving in parallel about 45 degrees above the horizon<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 2 objects moving in parallel that each looked like a bright star.  The moon was bright and there was some high altitude haze in the atmosphere, so most stars were barely visible at the time.  At first glance this looked like 2 stars, but then I noticed they were moving slowly.  They appeared to be at very high altitude, maybe 40K feet.  The moved due East in parallel to each other for about 10 seconds.  Then they faded away gradually over a ~5 second period.   I estimate the lights were about 45 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are no major airports due East of Raleigh, but there are military bases East of here.  These lights did not have the typical strobes flashing that is common on commercial aircraft.   Most high altitude air traffic over Raleigh is running North-South up the East coast of the country.  Given the lack of strobes on what I observed, I&#39;m confident these were not commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only plausible explanation would be military aircraft.  Military aircraft can run without lights.  But do they have bright lights to illuminate them like a star?  These objects were bright and no strobes were present.  The looked like bright stars or a planet would look, such as Venus.  Given that they appeared to be at high altitude, they would not have been flying in close military formation.  I would estimate the distance between these 2 objects would have been over a mile if they were at 40K feet.  Given that they were well above the horizon and the lights faded relatively quickly (~5 seconds), it&#39;s not consistent with an aircraft slowing flying out of sight over the horizon.  I have no explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, high altitude commercial air traffic was leaving vapor trails in the atmosphere on this night, visible by the moonlight.  These objects left no vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

First, one appeared, then the other immediately there after! They moved in unison, traveling in a SSE direction, slowly fading in the distance! In hopes of having another witness to this event, I ran up to a window of the main building, and got the attention of a co-worker, whom I prompted to hurry outside to see what I had seen! He came out, and, we both watched both lights slowly travel and fade away to the SSE! I have checked, and as far as any information I can obtain, the ISS was not anywhere near this location and the described time of this event! The! se lights were visible for approximately 15 seconds or so. They also appeared to be in a sub-orbital elevation, though, being a night time sighting, that is speculative! The sky was clear and dark, with no clouds anywhere to be seen!<n>

Cedar St., traveling past Tacoma Central, when I looked up towards the moon.  The moon was close to full in the east, with what I assumed to be a planet below and slightly to the left of it.  There were two more lights, less bright, that formed a slightly acute triangle with the planet (Jupiter, perhaps?).  Initially, the formation looked like nothing more than a constellation; however, after less than a second, I noticed the two bottom lights begin to drift away from the planet, breaking the triangular formation.  I lost sight of them when they were blocked from view by the old Costco, now a police station.  When I cleared the police station they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was approximately 7pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to know if anyone else saw this phenomenon.<n>

I called the whole class out to see this as it was so amazing.  I did not know who to tell or where to report thank you for your site and work.<n>

Tonight though it was stranger than the past nights i saw them.  The red and white lights are flashing incredibly.  But they&#39;re aralso these golden lights  When i was walking up to my left i saw the red and white flashing light and the to the right i saw the two golden lights, they were in line with each other perfectly and they were evenly spaced apart. I notice that the flashing lights will turn into the steady golden lights.   Also i saw this huge craft and i thought it was a plane but this craft stopped and it changed direction quickly.  Now a total of 4 other people are seeing what i&#39;m seeing, and i know i&#39;m not crazy i just want help to know what these beautiful yet mysterious lights are.<n>

I was marveling at the brightness of the moon and the alignment of Jupiter just below it. A moment later I looked up again and saw two lights (only slightly smaller and less bright than the planet) below Jupiter. My first thought was that they appeared to be &#34;dripping&#34; from the planet. They were very slowly falling, approximately equidistant from one another and the planet. Their motion reminded me of the slow drift of a flare in the sky, though this most certainly was not anything like a flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my bike to watch and my heart began to race as I realized they were not airplanes. I have lived in this city my whole life and am very keenly aware of the flight paths over the city, as well as the movement of lights emitted from airplanes. These two lights were very far away, extremely bright white and not flashing or irregular in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They paused their motion for a moment, then rapidly &#34;flew&#34; away into the distance, with a trajectory that made them appear to be moving directly away from me. (No lateral movement.) The whole sighting took approximately 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course, I don&#39;t know what I saw but I can say with great certainty that I have NEVER seen anything move that way in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness  elects to remain totally anonymous.

10/18/10 20:40|Reidsville|GA|Triangle|One hour and approximatel|Arrowhead shaped craft with three obvious lights flew overhead, pursued by military aircraft.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78457.html|187|ndxe201010| Arrowhead shaped craft with three obvious lights flew overhead, pursued by military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me first just give clarity to the reviewing administrator that myself, along with the other two witnesses have normally shot down the idea of UFO&#39;s in the stereotypical sense. That being said, here&#39;s our story from my perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, October 18th, 2010, around 8:00, my fiance, and our mutual friend made plans to cruise dirt roads and over-all just pass the night away. A little after 8:00 P.M (Perhaps a little before), our friend called to let us know she was on her way, and arrived shortly after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We made our way down the usual stretch of the Old Reidsville Collin&#39;s Highway (Anderson Street, now), and passed through Collins, Georgia. I was in the back seat, and my fiance` was sitting in the front alongside our friend. I was taking notice at the vast amount of movement in the sky, and the fact that the clouds were streaked, as if they&#39;d been raked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 8:40 or so, we arrived at the entrance to a dirt road outside of Collins, then proceeded to turn down into it. By this time, I&#39;d pointed out the activity in the sky, which we joked around about being UFO&#39;s. It wasn&#39;t until we noticed that what looked to be a military air-craft was pursuing a very vague object that was seamless against the sky, did we stop to think we might be right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked like a very dull star at first, though it was indeed moving. I told our friend to stop the car, and when she inquired why, I told her we&#39;d be able to make it out in a moment because it was about to pass under the moon&#39;s light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once she stopped the car, our friend, my fiance`, and myself exited the car, and watched this very vague craft become more visible the closer it drew towards the moon. The craft then passed over-head, under the moon&#39;s light, and we were all utterly dumbfounded by the very prospect of just having witnessed a UFO. We watched as what appeared to be military aircraft, or aircraft of some sort trailing this object. A description of the UFO is provided below;  The craft I saw was in the shape of a soft featured arrowhead. Being overhead, I assume it was the bottom I saw. There were three obvious lights, one at each point, and a design in the middle of the lights that mimicked the original shape of the object. The design was a lighter color than the rest of the craft. The craft itself was black. Almost seamless against the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We reentered the vehicle, and the time was 9:00. (Not exactly, but I believe it was around 9:05-(9:10). My fiance grabbed our friend&#39;s phone, and decided she was going to call her mother in total shock of what she&#39;d just seen. There was no service on the phone. I suddenly felt rather ill. Extremely fatigued, my face felt like it had been doused with boiling water. I mentioned it, and our friend and my fiance` both agreed they felt the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After contemplating what to do, we decided to follow the UFO. It wasn&#39;t soon after that it disappeared from all visibility behind a very thin cloud. The aircraft that were pursuing the UFO looked as if they were circling around the cloud. We were sure it&#39;d disappeared, when they began forming a triangular shaped pattern near this cloud. Seemingly out of no-where, this bright orange tinted light suddenly appeared through the cloud, and the UFO became visible once more as it sped past the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO once again passed near the moon&#39;s light, and then began to turn, which granted me the ability of gauging the craft had multiple dimensions and was indeed soft-featured. Once the craft completed it&#39;s turn, it began a slow diagonal ascension.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, all disbelief has left the three of us. We&#39;re intrigued, but tired. Rather distraught, but morbidly curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While still following the craft, we turned back onto the main highway outside of Collins. We all watched in disbelief as the UFO disappeared yet again. We watched as aircraft began swarming the area it&#39;d disappeared in. We made it back to my fiance&#39;s mother&#39;s house around 10:00. The three of us decided to ensure no one was lying, we all decided to draw it and not show anyone until we were all finished with the sketches. Sure enough, the sketches were all identical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning, I woke up earlier than usual, feeling extremely tired and beat. I felt as if I&#39;d been beaten with a bat. It took my fiance&#39; a while to finally coerce me out of bed. She wasn&#39;t feeling well either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1:00 P.M today (October 19th, 2010), our friend called us, saying she&#39;d missed her class because she couldn&#39;t really move this morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all decided this needed to be reported.<n>

I looked out the window and seen something moving through the sky.  I was watching it out of boredom, and I thought it kind of looked like a plastic bag.  Then I continued watching it, and I noticed it would go into the clouds.  So then I knew it couldn’t be a plastic bag because they just aren’t that big.  I walked and sat closer to the window to get a better view, and I watched it go all the way across the sky.  It was see through, a whitish tint, and a darker edge.  It moved weird (up, down, sideways, and circular motions) slowly across the sky (it started out on the right side of my vision, and moved to the left).  Then I went to go see my dad to ask him something, and I also brought him out to see what I had seen.  By this time it was gone (4:10 PM / 16:10 PM military time).  There was someone else in the room wit! h me, but they were reading while I was watching it.  I&#39;m really angry I left my phone over my friends house, so in short, I couldn&#39;t take pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I cant remember the exact date nor the month, but it was very cold and they had given out a warning of snow. I must state that up until this point i had never really believed in UFO&#39;S only because the idea of them absolutley terrify me and i try not to think about it. Anyway we were travelling down the road and as we got to the top of the hill above the trees there was a shiny silver cube turned on its side like a diamond. The sun was hitting the object and reflecting of it. Both me and my boyfriend said what&#39;s that?. We continued down the hill and when we reached the otherside the object had disappeared. For the last year i have searched the web to see if anyone well saw this, but i have found nothing. The object did not appear to be moving, but stationary. The viewing was only short and nothing was coming out of the object and there were no lights. i just hope th! at someone is able to explain to me what it was that i saw.

The object appeared lower in the sky then normal jets that fly though all the time.  There was no sound as with a normal jet.  The object covered the distance from the prison that is ½ block from on the north east side my house, to past the rail road tracks which is ½ block south east of my house in approximately 3 seconds, my property covers one entire city block.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was in the shape of a triangle, with lights on all three sides.  The lights did not appear to strobe, as would an airplane, and they did not seem to be just at the three points of the triangle, but rather all along the three sides.  The object had a strange appearance to it, if you saw the movie Predator with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the object seemed to have the same shimmer as the alien did in the movie.  The object appeared to travel in a straight line, not moving around or at different speeds.  There is an US Air Force Base 30 some odd miles south west of my home, Vance Air Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What scares me most is that people were walking on Columbus ave at this late night .  But they did not pay any attention to to the sky.

10/17/10 18:40|Nazareth|PA|Light|2 minutes|Hovering / Pulsing Blue light  observed by 2 buses of students and adults|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78489.html|198|ndxe201010| Hovering / Pulsing Blue light  observed by 2 busses of students and adults<n> <n><n> <n><n> While traveling home with a marching band from a competition in New Jersey, 2 entire buses of students, parents and staff witnessed something we are having difficulty in explaining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Sunday evening  October 17, 2010 at approximately 6:40 pm.  The skies were predominantly clear and the sun had set, but the skies were not completely dark.  By the end of the encounter a few short minutes later, the skies were dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The buses had exited I-78 and just south of Nazareth, PA were turning left from Country Club Road onto Newburg Road, when an adult noticed a vibrant blue light out the left (drivers side) windows of the bus.  This light was far brighter than any of the stars which were visible.  As the bus made the left onto Newburg Road, the blue light was now out the right (passenger side) of the bus.  The light was now just above the tree line and was completely stationary.  We observed it for what seemed like an eternity, but in reality was only a few minutes.  During this time, several noted a “pulsing” twice from this light.  It then disappeared as though someone turned off a light switch.  I personally notice a very faint diagonal white line (vapor trail??) which quickly disappeared, but I am not sure if anyone else noticed this.  A few seconds later, the blue light reappeared in the exact same location, but now was bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I only noticed what I thought to be more “pulsing” some of the students (with better vision than me) said it appeared to briefly divide into 3 lights which rotated and expanded outward slightly and then returned.  Others seemed to notice a reddish hue to the right side of the light, but I personally did not see these features.  Since the windows were closed, no sounds could be reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the buses did not stop, within a few minutes we lost sight of the light out of the back of the bus.  It was clearly in our field of view well after we crossed rt. 191.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the adults on the bus continued to search for rational explanations.  We decided to not say anything to the second bus to test the consistency of our story.  Immediately upon exiting the second bus, the students from bus 2 eagerly asked us if we saw the blue light.  They proceeded to validate the identical story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several photos were taken from cell phones, but since the buses continued their journey without slowing, these images are slightly blurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It remained at the same spot in the sky with a blinking white glow for about a hour.  Later as I went back outside I saw the object start to gain a intense light, then the white light turned red and pulsed very brightly.  Brighter then any star or aircraft I have ever seen.   After the objects light turned red and pulsed brightly it rapidly started to dim out going back to having a white light then disappeared and I didn’t see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I was in Blowing Rock but the object was a very far distance from me.<n>

I looked up at it and it was massive, probably about half as big as a half-moon.  It was very white, almost blinding. Its shape was like the sun, with a circle and light radiating from the circle.  It didn’t flash like an airplane or helicopter.  The object moved very slightly down and to the right, and then it completely disappeared.  I couldn’t hear the object at all as well.<n>

As I watched it I could see sparkles and stars in the reflection of the craft.  After20 seconds it uniformly was covered by the night sky.

Object remained fixed in its location. Went inside for binoculars, which revealed more clearly that there were regular and rapid flashes of red and white light.  Object was located to the left of the moon and resembled airplane lights, but never changed position.  Checked back in an hour and object appeared to have faded to a dull orange-red glow with less twinkle.

I went outside and sure enough there was an object in the sky, it looked metallic it was a little too far to see any definition of the object. The unidentified object stayed in one place, no noise was heard and it did not move at all. I went inside to get my binoculars to get a closer look, unfortunately, I was unable to locate the object. But I could still see it will out the binoculars. So, next I moved up so I was not standing in front of the apartment complex looking silly. By the time I moved up the object was no where in sight and I could see most of the sky, and it only took 5 seconds to reposition my self.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was starting to turn dark right after it left so I went into my house.  Well, after making a few phone calls to tell people what I had seen, I went back outside (about 20 min after the object left) to see if there was a light or anything else. The Unidentified object was definitely gone. However, I did notice planes coming at a high speed from the south, which is the same direction that Buckley Air Force Base is located. There were about 10 of them and they flew directly to the location where the unidentified object was. After the planes flew over I noticed that about 5 of them were circling the exact area that the unidentified object was. They soon left the area, and there was no more action that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did try to take everything into consideration, especially the fact that it was the anniversary of the balloon UFO. But I could have seen a balloon moving across the sky. It could have been moving away from me but I would have still been able to see it after moving to another position. Also, in the year that I have lived in Greeley there has never been an airplane fly directly over our apartments and definitely not 10 planes at high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n>

I&#39;d prefer to remain anonymous.  I&#39;ve already reported a few of my sightings to another website/organization &amp; regretted it immediately. Two other witnesses and I were laughed at, mocked, and interrogated into silence when the investigators came out to take a look at what we were seeing. We were pretty much told to &#39;forget about it&#39; and that they were &#39;just airplanes&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three of us were so offended and shocked at the ignorant behavior of these two men that we didn&#39;t even say goodbye to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were all out there (the three of us &amp; the two investigators) I stood there and counted a dozen &#39;airplanes&#39;.  Yes, they looked JUST LIKE AIRPLANES at first. I stood there and tried to explain this to the main investigator, but he literally ignored me and kept jabbering to my friend about things that didn&#39;t even pertain to what we were doing.  They weren&#39;t moving like planes. They didn&#39;t make any sound. And they popped up randomly all over the sky. My friend and I had seen this several nights in a row. That&#39;s how it would all begin. First the flashy &#39;airplanes&#39;, and then the weirder stuff would show up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On our way out to the location, I had seen a very large cigar-shaped golden-yellow glowing craft off in the distance, near the horizon, first just hovering and then moving slowly, horizontally.  It literally appeared out of no where.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After all the of the flashy guys showed up (the fake airplanes), another one of these very large cigar-shaped crafts popped up again. Right along the horizon. My friend and I pointed it out to the investigator and he acted as if he didn&#39;t even see it at first. It wasn&#39;t until it started moving (because it was hovering in that spot) that he noticed it, and before anything else could be said... he LOUDLY and very forcibly said, &#39;girls, it&#39;s just an airplane!&#39;  Just an airplane? My friend and I looked at each other (the other witness (my Mom) was in the vehicle, as it was very cold out and she couldn&#39;t handle it) and shook are heads. The investigator acted totally oblivious when we started talking about him in front of him, about how he had to be blind and that he must have thought we were stupid to believe his lies. These rude and interrogating tactics may work with other people, but we know what we&#39;ve been seeing. It&#39;s like trying to tell someone that there is no sun, even as it&#39;s beating down on their heads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Mom later told us that when she was looking in the sky with the binoculars that one of the investigators had let her use, she saw something really strange near this odd cluster of stars no one could seem to identify, (despite the fact that they&#39;d brought one of those star-detecting things) and when she went to tell the investigator about it, he ripped the binoculars out of her hands and ignored her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can&#39;t imagine the things I&#39;ve seen on a nightly basis! Amazing things! I&#39;ve seen an &#39;airplane&#39; split in half, like mitosis, forming two flying crafts. I&#39;ve watched an &#39;airplane&#39; transform into a triangular-shaped UFO and then watched it descend towards the ground. I&#39;ve seen the same triangular-shaped UFO pop up, out of no where, under the very cloudy sky, at treetops height, fly OVER my car, and see it land in a cornfield. I&#39;ve seen what I thought were stars suddenly begin moving and flying all over the sky in strange formations. Strange blue glowing lights that move from left to right, left to right, right to left, right to left,... Weird balls of plasma-like light that have strange flashing red lights going off all around it like a sea of drunken sailors in the night sky. I&#39;ve seen hundreds upon hundreds of UFOs-- some possibly top secret military &amp; some not of this earth, all different types, doing things that can only be described as &#39;magic&#39;. Glowing mists in the sky! . Animals acting very strange (especially the dogs in town &amp; the cattle outside of town). Odd sounds in the middle of the night-- sonic booms, electrical pulses, tapping on the walls... Being jolted awake in the middle of the night, terrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There have been a lot of landings recently, too. I&#39;ve seen landings in cornfields, strange glowing lights in the middle of the field, and often I see craft that hover over several of my neighbors houses and several nights later I&#39;ll see UFOs landing in their backyards. On Thanksgiving, my nephew told about a UFO he had seen in a cornfield. He described it. Saucer-shaped. Dark and metallic. With what appeared to be very strange &#39;Christmas-like&#39; lights on it. It&#39;s funny because both myself &amp; my friend have seen similar lights on other crafts before. My friend also had a triangular-shaped UFO fly over her van after she left my place on the 9th of November. It hovered over her for a bit as she pulled over, rolled down the window, and stuck her head out the window. She said it had super-fast moving Christmas-like lights on the underside and she felt as if she were being hypnotized. It left her feeling dizzy and nauseous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They notice when you notice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On November the 12th I was in my bedroom, about to get ready for bed. I don&#39;t really remember exactly what I was doing - if I was reading a book or making my bed or what. But I heard an owl hooting outside of my bedroom window. I don&#39;t remember when I first noticed it, but I remember going to the window and opening it up. It kept hooting. It was VERY STRANGE. I&#39;d never heard an owl out here before. My room is in the basement so the window is literally ground level. I could tell the owl was sitting on the ground right beside the window, but when I looked out (stretching the screen as far as I could) I NEVER saw it. But it was RIGHT THERE. And it wouldn&#39;t stop hooting. On and on it went. With only a second or two in between. For what I would guess to be 15-20 minutes, but I can&#39;t be sure on that because I don&#39;t really even remember when it stopped. While it was hooting I looked towards the night sky. There were UFOs all over. Fake airplanes morphing into random things. Flying ! saucers. Shooting stars and fire balls. Plasma balls. The night sky was going crazy. But that&#39;s it. That&#39;s all I remember. I only guess that the owl hooted for 15-20 minutes, but I don&#39;t know. It could have been hooting for all of eternity. I don&#39;t remember leaving the window. I don&#39;t remember shutting the window. I don&#39;t even remember going to bed. The only thing I do remember is a strange dream I had involving my Dad (who died 9 months ago), aliens, a HUGE holographic telescope in my backyard, and Saturn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember having seen The Fourth Kind not too long after it came out. And upon remembering hearing the owl, I remembered this movie. So I did a little research online. Most people only report having SEEN the owl. But my case is totally different. I never saw the owl, I only heard it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 13th, though, I didn&#39;t quite place how weird the entire night before was right away. I didn&#39;t even know that I had forgotten. I just remembered the owl and was oblivious to the fact that it was weird that I had forgotten all else. It wasn&#39;t until weeks after that night that I realized how bizarre it all really was. And the more I tried to remember, the more I forgot. It&#39;s like a twisted mind-game and it leaves me feeling like I&#39;m losing my mind!  My friend and I would discuss things we had seen separately. We both had a lot of the same experiences even when we were apart. Especially concerning our dreams. On nights that one of us would call about having a strange dream about aliens &amp; UFOs, the other would confirm that she, too, had been having vivid dreams of aliens &amp; UFOs. These dreams involve the government and how they&#39;re trying to control us &amp; keep us unaware of the alien presence, others about upcoming earth changes that could be devastating on a mass scale, others involving strange experimentation with genetics &amp; reproduction,... I could go on and on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is so much to say,... but this is getting long. All I want are answers. I want to know what&#39;s going on. I want to know about the strange creatures that talk to me in my dreams - some of them that look like Grays, some that look like Dragons... I have a hard time sleeping at night,...<n> <n><n> <n><n> If possible, I would like this sighting removed from the site as soon as possible. I just want someone to email me, and discuss it that way. No phone calls. No investigations. Nothing. I just need someone to talk to.<n>

I was driving home to Arcadia, CA taking streets. Approximately at 12:30 am I saw  ball of light hovering about 200 feet in the air. I was about 3 blocks away from it. There was a beam of light shining from it. There was no noise and the beam of light was shining in one direction. I first thought it was a helicopter but I thought the light was way too bright, there was no sound, and it flew very strangly. The light was too bright to be a helicopter. I hovered for a bit then moved back and forth. After it became obscured by sme trees I could not see the object again. I arrived home and told my fiance what I had seen. She said that earlier in the night around 10pm she had spotted a similar object in Arcadia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiance said that she was driving around 10pm in Arcadia when she spotted a bright white light zipping back and forth. It was exactly the same description as what I saw later in the night. It also was a bright light with a beam of light coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered what the object was now. I then told my friend about the object the following week. He surprisingly said he saw a similar object. He was driving home from us having a very late dinner. He was headed to La Palma, CA about 20 minutes later than me, 12:50 am. He said he saw a bright light for a few secondshovering in the sky. He described it the same as me and my fiance except that there was no beam of light coming from it. It was after he had confirmed seeing it as well that I felt that I had to report it to someone.<n>

I saw several objects in the night sky floating by from my viewing right to my viewing left.  I was in a suburb of Buffalo, NY.  I grabbed my cell phone out of my pocket and took a few pictures.  My cell phone at the time didn&#39;t have any zooming capabilities.  The objects looked like balls of fire floating by.  They did not appear to be dropping in altitude like flares do.  They seemed to be orangeish/reddish/yellowish in nature....like fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I even sent the pictures to a local TV station who put one of the pictures on the air in a short story reporting that a viewer (myself) saw some unexplained lights in the skies of West Seneca, NY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I showed the pictures to several people asking if anyone else had seen them.  Only one person told me that they saw something similar 2 hours earlier several miles away in the skies before dark.  My experience occurred during the dark night.  I remember pointing and asking a few strangers outside to look and asked what they could be.  They thought it was odd and didn&#39;t know.  I couldn&#39;t count the number of objects due to them moving as well as some appearing further away.  Trees also cut off the viewing capabilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects all seemed to be moving at the same speed in the same direction.  They didn&#39;t appear to be dropping or rising in altitude.  They were moving slow enough for me to observe, but too fast to keep observing and taking pictures for more than a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Charleston on a Friday night I observed a very large object about somewhere around 30 to 35 degrees above the horizon of indeterminate shape but having many lights hovering and stationary directly to my right.  AS I was driving I attempted to keep it in sight for a few minutes and passed a car pulled over onto the berm  with all of its lights off.  The reason I am sure it was not a star or other celestial object is it was suddenly gone.  Not having anywhere to pull over on my side of the road I couldn&#39;t stop and look toward that general area to observe if had moved into a new position.  This is the second time in four and one-half years that I have seen something in this general area and reported the other encounter for April 2006 on this website.  Later I wondered if the people in the other car had stopped and were watching the same object.  For some reason that didn&#39;t cross my mind at the time!<n>

I am an ameteur astronomer and I don't necessarily believe in UFO|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92651.html|227|ndxe201010| This happened a few years ago and I&#39;ve wondered about it every since. I am an ameteur astronomer and I don&#39;t necessarily believe in UFOs, but I have no explaination for what I saw. I was in my yard one fall night letting waiting for my dog to do his thing when I looked up and saw a jupiter-like bright object in the sky. My house yard faces northwest so that Polaris is in the right corner and the sun sets in the left corner. The star I saw shouldn&#39;t have been there. I was just northwest of Polaris, a few degrees  higher and as bright as Jupiter. I watched it with intrigue for a minute or so and then the object got smaller before my eyes - I mean in a matter of a minute or so - until it was a red dot and then vanished. When I first looked at it I assumed it was an airplane, but it didn&#39;t move or flash. Then I wondered if there was a comet I didn&#39;t know about.  When the thing go small and vanished I really became puzzled and told my wife and, later, some people ! I know.  Was it a rocket sent up by some ameteur rocket club? Whatever it was it moved away from the earth into space at a tremendous speed - the time it went from a Jupiter sized glowing object to a faint red dot was only a  matter of a minute or two.  I have never been able to reconcile this event with anything that makes sense so I am reporting this in the hope of some explaination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

The lights were moving back and forth between each other and pulsating red, yellow, blue and, green.  They would fly close to each other and then at high speeds, fly away.  Every few minutes one or two of the lights would get extremely bright emit other lights. After about 15 minutes of watching the lights i called the sheriffs office of Boulder County and reported the sighting.  A few minutes later one of the local deputies called me back and said there had been multiple reports in the area of the same lights.  The deputy then told me that he was driving out to east Longmont to check out the lights for himself.  A few minutes after hanging up with the sheriff my friend called back and said that he had talked to another dep! uty who said he saw the lights and called the FAA(Federal Aviation Association)who said they had gotten three reports from from sheriffs offices around Colorado who said they had also gotten multiple reports.  The FAA then said they scanned the area with radar and got 3 blips for a few seconds then the blips flew below the radar.  They also said that they hadn&#39;t determined if they were going to scramble jets yet.  The entire encounter lasted about 2 hours.<n>

I reported a sighting on 10-15-2010, I remember the date because there were reports on the TV about that day being the anniversary of UFO balloon boy from 2009. It is because of those reports that I did not report this during the incident.  However, I have seen pictures of this type of UFO on the previous UFO images.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept trying to convince myself that this had something to do with the UFO balloon boy, but I went inside for a moment to check something, this took about 20 seconds, and when I came back outside to view it again it was nowhere to be found.  Even though, I had a full view of its location in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought at that point this was a hoax.  What convinced me that this was a real UFO, was that at 18:20, I counted 12 fighter jets flying in a direct pattern from the direction of Buckley AFB to the location where the UFO was hovering.  I know they were fighter jets because they flew directly over the apartment complex that I live in.  We have never had any sort of air craft fly directly overhead here before this incident and we have not had any air craft fly over since then.  The air craft flew directly to the location where the UFO was located.  The last 10 fighters continued on past the area and the first 2 approached the location and flew in circles at the exact location for a few minutes before continuing on with the original flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My report was not considered to be credible because I was so excited that I forgot to take pictures or video tape this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am just wondering if there was any information or verification of this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know I had no pictures but, I KNOW WHAT I SAW!<n>

The craft had a solid white sphere on both the left and right sides and was held together by a thin black rod in the middle. The craft swayed as it flew at a moderate speed. A few minutes later, another identical craft followed the same route. As the hour progressed, up to 14 followed in the same area of the sky. No more than two flew over at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Toward the end of these sightings, a short rod-like object was sighted headed in the same direction, at the same height.

This object had white, red, blue and green lights around the outside of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: 3:35am- went inside my apartment to get my binoculars to get a closer look. Object still appeared to have white, red, blue and green lights flashing around the object. Called the police department, they seemed to have no interest in what was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: - 3:40am drove car to the convenient store 1/20th mile from my apartment to see if I could get the attendant to witness what I was seeing. He was sweeping the parking lot. He was more than willing to give me a few minutes of his time and was as amassed as I was at what we were witnessing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: 3:50am - Went back to my apartment parking lot to watch some more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: 4:00am - Walked across the street to the local supermarket where a truck driver delivering product had just pulled in. I walked to his truck and asked him if he had a video camera and if he would like to see something strange in the sky. He didn&#39;t have a video camera, but was willing to take  time and look at the object in the sky. I had my binoculars with me and we both continued to look at the object through the binoculars for over 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: 4:10am Police department called me back and asked me where I was located. 5 minutes later a police officer showed up at the supermarket. After exchanging a few words I handed the police officer my binoculars, he thought it was moving and said it could be any number of terrestrial objects, but was strange. He saw the colored lights...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: 4:20am - went back to my apartment parking lot to continue watching the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: 5:10am - Was clear sky&#39;s all night, at 5:10am cloud cover was moving in and was now blocking the object so I decided to call it a night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I tried all night to find someone with a video camera, but was unsuccessful. Also tried to see if my neighbor had a telescope, but was also unsuccessful...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did everything I could to get credible witnesses and video footage...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also would like to mention I was located 3 miles east of the buffalo international airport...

10/15/10 03:00|Harleysville|PA|Circle|2 hours|UFO above my house. Possibly abducted.|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83644.html|237|ndxe201010| UFO above my house. Possibly abducted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime in the middle of October 2010, I was up late playing computer games in my bedroom on the second story of my home here in Harleysville Pennsylvania. I was getting tired around 12:30am and decided to go to sleep around 1:00am. I fell asleep quite quickly in nothing but my boxers.  Before I go into detail about the encounter I experienced, allow me to explain the layout of my room relative to the map I submitted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My bedroom is on the second story on the southwest end of my home. I have 3 windows in my room on the front face of the house and have access to both the attic and the only fire escape on the building. This house used to be an old office building in which my bedroom was one of the offices used. My actual bed is located in the southwest corner next to a window and directly next to the fire escape door. This door has no handle on the outside and only a bar-release on the inside similar to what you would find on the inside of a school entrance door or office building. The door also has a 1.3x1.3 foot window in the top center. The actual fire escape on the outside of the door is nothing more than a metal platform and railing leading down the side of my house with metal stairs. I often use this to have a cigarette when I am at home since smoking inside the house is forbidden by the landlord. This goes to say I am quite familiar with what the scenery on the outside of my home ! looks like in this location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke on this day around 3am based on the dark of night outside, however, when I awoke I was already outside on my fire escape platform. I had not been dreaming as far as I could tell since everything was as it was when I am awake, and have had many vivid almost lucid dreams in the past, and I can tell you this was not that sensation. I was very groggy and confused as to how I had walked in my sleep. I have not sleepwalked since I was about 8 years old, and at this time I was 19 almost 20. I almost immediately noticed something very very large above me after this initial confusion, and took quick notice to my door being closed behind me leaving no way of re-entering my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I noticed this however, I felt the urge to look at this large object hovering above me. As I looked up I noticed it was sort of rounded in shape but had many many lights on the underside of it. It was directly above me so I had no view of the sides of the object.  The lights were a very very bright white.  Nothing like any fluorescent bulb I have ever seen. These lights were flashing without any pattern it seemed and were located all over the underside of the object in rectangular and very long trapezoidal shapes.  The object had to have been at least 250 feet in diameter, possibly larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The underside of the object also had many things jutting out from it with these lights on it as well, but I took a firm notice to one in particular.  There was this large piece with the lights on the side of it coming out from the right of the object. It&#39;s shape was like an upside down cone with the end cut off. It resembled an air filter for a high performance engine in a car.  It had symmetrical lights all around its sides that were identical to the ones on the underside of the object, however the bottom of this piece jutting out was a very very dark gray-black color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I had first looked up, the lights were so blinding that I had to shield my eyes with one hand to see they were flashing and their shapes and locations. I observed all of this within less than 90 seconds before I became very disoriented. I forgot what I was doing, where I was at, and who I was. Almost as if these lights were inducing an acute case of amnesia. The last thing I can remember before passing out was the strange sensation of floating. I had never experienced this before, but it was as if I were suddenly weightless. My feet were no longer touching the cold metal platform and I was no longer shielding my eyes. As soon as I was blinded by the lights that were flashing I seemed to lose consciousness, unless the lights caused me to forget everything leaving me no memory of anything afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout these short minutes the object made absolutely no sound. It was as if it was making everything around it completely quiet. If you have ever heard the saying &#34;Silence is Deafening,&#34; I would have to agree, there were no sounds made after I noticed the object above me. This was extremely strange since my home is on a main road, and relatively close to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Hearing not even the sound of a cricket chirp or the hum of the highway was definitely weird. I also remember the silence being almost suffocating. It felt very heavy, as if it were making the air thick like soup.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my short, and very close observation, I remember the object being about 20 to 40 feet above me and the space in between my house and the neighbors house, and the tree in between the front of our homes was blocking out a portion of this large object. There was no wind, as if Time had stopped in its tracks. This is all simply speculation, but it was what it seemed to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I lost consciousness, it got extremely bizarre. I remember waking up without any senses except for my sight and sense of balance. I was laying down with my eyes looking upwards towards what seemed to be a ceiling. My eyes were not working correctly though. It was as if I had been administered eye drops that you would get at the doctors to dilate your pupils. Everything was very blurry and distorted. I remember very little, but I do remember everything was a green/brown/gray color around me. I also remember seeing strange objects above me that appeared to be tools or examination equipment above me, none of which seemed to be created by humans. It was very very blurry though so it was hard to tell if that was exactly what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then remember a figure move into view above me. I was unable to move at all, and my vision was very poor so I could discern nothing about this being other than it seemed a little taller than I am and it had appendages like a human being (arms, torso, head, legs, etc.). It did not speak to me, however, I seemed to hear a voice in my head. It was much less a voice than it was a feeling or emotion being conveyed. The very last thing I can remember was feeling very calm, as if this being was trying to help me in some sort of way. The &#34;trying to help you&#34; feeling I received was much less about me in particular, but more of a &#34;you&#34; as in &#34;your race.&#34; I then saw one of the objects above me move slightly, and I lost consciousness again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came to I was sitting on the edge of my bed. My bed was made very neatly as if I had never layed down at all that night. When i looked at my alarm clock, the time was about 4:45am. I tried to remember how I got there, but nothing came to mind. I tried to sleep, but my thoughts were buzzing faster than I could even keep up with. I could not sleep no matter how hard I tried that night. The only thing I kept asking myself was &#34;Why wasn&#39;t I scared or afraid throughout this entire experience?&#34;   I am not trying to garner attention in any way shape or form with this.. This is why I am choosing to remain anonymous. I just hope that maybe this can help somebody understand things a little better, even if I can not understand any of this myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always thought the UFO phenomenon was a bunch of crap before this experience. Since this experience I have been haunted, and have wanted to tell somebody but have always been too afraid of being called a crackpot. The only person I have ever told this story to is my best friend, and he is probably the only person who will ever know who I am and what I witnessed. I have witnessed a few other strange occurrences that happened after this account I have just given you, but they are far less important I think..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this will help in some way shape or form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I noticed what I thought was a star,low but motionless, flickering brilliant colors of green, blue and white. In awww, I stayed focused on this &#34;star.&#34; My opinion changed once I noticed this light was swaying slowly back and forth, low enough to be obscurred by the parking lot&#39;s lamp post. I felt as if it knew I could see it, because as I would follow it, it would move slowly back behind the lamp post&#39;s cover at an angle that I would have to change constantly to keep spotting it. I thought for a second, &#34;I really need somebody else to see this with me,&#34; I stepped back in, ran up the stairs and awoke my girlfriend in panic to go see. She got up, got dressed and came out. I pointed at it and it was in the same little area I spotted it at, low but dead still. She seemed sort of mad because it could easily be mi! staken as a &#34;star.&#34; I told her to focus on it and after a minute of watching this thing it surely started moving slowly back and forth again. I asked what she thought about it and she replied sort of confused. She then said, &#34;look it moved more towards the right,&#34; then instantly this light stopped in place, lifted a little and then completely disappeared. She asked &#34;Did it just disappear?&#34; I didn&#39;t know what to say, I wanted to think it didn&#39;t disappear but it did and I felt like falling over literally. What I had seen wasn&#39;t man-made at all because of its behavior. The flickering of the lights of green, blue and white and sometimes dimming for a second, to its motionless sway and it&#39;s elusive movements from my view. It layed low in altitude probably about 800 ft in the air, and out about 5 or 6 miles from our point of location. Thankfully I had my girlfriend as witness to this marvelous but mind boggling event, because if I had seen it alone, I would of probably went mad. ! I am hoping that there was somebody else in town or out in tha! t area, witnessing this light. It has left me sort of paranoid and just weirded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

10/14/10 22:30|Northwich (UK/England)||Other|2-3 min's|orange flare like sightings over Cheshire|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78386.html|240|ndxe201010| orange flare like sightings over Cheshire<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the past 12 months I have witnessed orange lights in the night sky.  The first occasion there was a single orange flare like light crossing the night sky, my daughter also saw this.  Some month later I was walking my dog and saw 2 orange flare like lights seemingly keeping the same distance apart as they went over the sky line, both occasions they don’t flash across the sky,  I guess a little faster than an aeroplane. A fellow dog walker also witnessed this (this sighting was during the no fly period because of the volcanic ash cloud early this year.) last night whilst letting the dog out I saw a orange flare again crossing the night sky, not at a high altitude, as normal the light just goes out and normally that’s the end of the sighting, but last night I kept looking a couple of minutes later a black object came in sight, no lights no noise, there was very little or no wind.  The object wasn’t massive I would say smaller than a 737 aircraft, it wasn’t mov! ing very fast, after only 30-45seconds it just vanished. It was a cloudy night (high cloud not low.)<n>

I noticed two objects coming from the north, traveling parallel with each other aprox. ½-inch apart as viewed in the night sky, in the area of the big dipper, moving south toward the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, I noticed there was a third object in front of the first two, approximately three inches in front of them.  All three objects were moving at the same rate of speed until they reached directly over head of me.  Then the western most object of the two rear objects, pulled ahead of the eastern most object, accelerated, then dropped back.  It did this five times while I observed them.  They continued on at a very high rate of speed &amp; I lost sight of them as they approached the moon’s glare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the airport &amp; talked airport authority, told him what I saw, and asked if he could call the tower &amp; see if air traffic control had seen anything weird on their radar.  When he came back on line he said they hadn’t seen anything on radar &amp; gave me your phone # to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were moving with the speed of a satellite re-entering earth orbit on burn up. Very fast!! It took only about 20 seconds to cover a huge portion of the sky.  I would estimate their altitude @ over 30,000 feet.  I realize it’s hard to approximate altitude @ night, but they seemed very high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of the objects is as follows, they had a brownish / copper color nucleus in the center, almost square shaped with a weak halo encircling them.  The scale of the halo would be the same size if you placed a dime over top of  Jupiter in the night sky.  The color is what made me notice them, they seemed darker than the night sky and were blocking out starlight as they came toward me.  The halo was a perfect sphere with a very pale bluish, white light to it, almost transparent.  The intensity of the object never changed, but the clarity of my view improved as they went directly overhead of me. The size is as stated previously, approximately Jupiter sized object as viewed in the night sky, with the halo extending approximately the size of dime if laid over Jupiter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a amateur astronomer, with a 12&#34; Mead LX200 scope.  I was out in the night sky since dusk &amp; my eyes had adapted to the low light. Unfortunately I did not get the chance to put the scope on the objects as they were moving very fast &amp; I just was too excited &amp; didn’t want to miss what I was seeing or lose them in the night sky.   I have view comets, chased satellites with my naked eye &amp; scope.  Spent countless hours observing the stars &amp; sky’s at night and never have seen anything like this before.  The thing that really got me was when the one object accelerated &amp; dropped back several times, nothing in the night sky does that!!   I have lived by the airport for 11 years &amp; observed all kinds of aircraft @ night, it definitely was not any type of aircraft.   I did think it was a satellite until I noticed the second object &amp; then a third object which led me to the realization that they were U.F.O.’S!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with the source of the report, on two occasions, and we deem him to be an exceptionally good witness.<n>

10/14/10 21:25|Livermore|CA|Light|90 seconds|I observed a bright object in the sky traveling erratically.  90 seconds|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78416.html|243|ndxe201010| I observed a bright object in the sky traveling erratically.  90 seconds<n> <n><n> <n><n> Details. On the night of 14 October 2010 I observed an unusual object in the sky.  I have been an amateur astronomer for over 40 years and had setup my 8-inch Newtonian reflector telescope for viewing the night sky.  After aligning my telescope with the polar axis, I started to observe the night sky (it was a clear night for viewing). I had already observed the planet Jupiter and the first quarter moon when I decided to train my telescope on the celestial object M-31 (the galaxy in the constellation Andromeda).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I moved my telescope toward the area of M-31 I noticed a brief flash of light near the star Beta Andromedae.  At first, I thought I had caught a glimpse of a meteor, however, a few seconds later the object reappeared near the northeast corner of the “Great Square” of Pegasus.  When it reappeared it was moving in a southern direction. I was going to change my assessment that this bright object was probably a satellite, but I then noticed it had a reddish-copper like halo around it. I then noted the time on my watch as 21:25.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location and Description of Object.  At this time of year in northern California, the constellations Andromeda and Pegasus are approximately 45 to 50 degrees above the northeastern horizon.  The object itself appeared to be a white star in appearance.  The halo was about the same brightness and was the size of a dime (if you held a dime in your hand and fully extended your arm).  As I will mention later this object varied in brightness. In astronomical terms it changed from between a magnitude 1.5 down to a magnitude of 4.0.  The object also faded away (or disappeared) a total of three times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Movement and Behavior of Object.  As this object moved south, it appeared to be behaving like a satellite.  However, the object made a “loop” in the sky.  The best way to describe objects movement is imaging drawing a straight line then writing a small letter “L” and then continuing the line for a short distance.  The loop would be the size of my thumb when held at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object looped it dimmed briefly for a few seconds but then got brighter again.  This is when it made sudden move south through Pegasus at high speed and made a another “loop” before stopping and fading from view near the ecliptic just east of Jupiter (this rapid movement occurred in just two to three seconds).  After another few seconds, the object reappeared and continued south at the pace of a satellite.  But once again, as it neared the star Fomalhaut in the southern hemisphere, it made another loop and dimmed again from view.  It would reappear one more time and head south and I would lose the object  in the sky glow near the southern horizon.  I looked at my watch and it flipped from 21:26 to 21:27.  So the length of the event I estimate to be between 60 to 90 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conclusion. The only way I can relate the object to anything else is it looked like a moving “ring-type” nebula.  As I mentioned before I have an amateur astronomer for over 40 years and have never see anything like this. I you have an explanation to what I saw I would enjoy hearing it.  I hope this information helps.<n>
10/14/10 19:30|Ripon|CA|Triangle|5-8 minutes|Object observed over orchard North of Ripon, CA.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78419.html|244|ndxe201010| Object observed over orchard North of Ripon, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.839276,-121.1586&amp;spn=0.041416,0.104284&amp;z=14  UFO Observation: I was driving East on French Camp road on a clear night. It’s a couple of miles to S. Jack Tone road. In the distance, slightly to my left, where two bright lights, the lights where North/South, looked to be about over S. Jack Tone road, hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Continuing East I observed the object to be stationary.  As I approached S. Jack Tone road it began to move West, in a straight line, paralleling French Camp road.  The object, at first, appeared to me dark metallic. I could see angles reflecting from its lights. As it approached suddenly I noted three lights. One light each facing West, North and South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assumed it to be a Helicopter and slowed down and opened the window to listen. There was no sound. No rotating beacons or strobe lights like all aircraft have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was around 100 feet gliding over an orchard.  As we passed I could see it was large and possibly triangular. On the East end was a dull red object.  After we had passed the lights appeared to be on the bottom.  It accelerated west as I had already slowed to observe it. From the westbound lane to the edge of the orchard must be less than 500 feet.  I had my head turned back to watch it but had the Jack Tone road stop sign.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In retrospect, I feel it was a UFO.   An airport KSCK is North/West from the sighting.  I looked at Flight aware and it showed an Allegiant Air MD88 landing at 1936.  Once turned South on Jack Tone road I looked at the radio clock it was 1938.  I don’t see how an MD88 could be that low and off course on a clear night. Also no engine sound or any sound at all from my observation.  If was larger than an Ultralight or Helicopter.  The size seemed to vary as it passed which does make be believe it was triangular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a vehicle behind me that I noticed was right on my bumper from my slowing.  A couple of cars had passed North/South on S. Jack Tone road. Nobody seemed to take notice or slow to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer:  I am a truck driver near 20 years and have seen many things at night.  Most can be explained.  Not all, always.  I’m not prone to just assume something is a UFO.  In fact if I had, in this case, I could have had video with my phone. A lot of where I drive is around orchards. I’ve seen Helicopters spraying at night.  There are odd implements working at night and many lights, in the sky, that turn out to be airplanes.

As I got closer, I saw it had a cylinder/triangular shape to it. It hovered... It wasn&#39;t moving at all! No Sound..<n> <n><n> <n><n> My redlight was green and there were 4 cars in front of me, all stopped.  Also at the 4-way, there were a total of about 15-20 cars all stopped from different directions looking, too.  I snapped a picture on my cell phone, blurry of course, before I stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t understand! It didn&#39;t move- it completely sat still! It didn&#39;t make a sound. No motor sound or anything...I was looking at the picture I took to see if it was blurry or not and I realized I should take more pictures anyways.

Right when it start getting dark i see flashing lights.  The lights flash on and off repeatedly. Its been following me for the past 5 nights. I called my friend to see if she saw what i saw, she stepped outside and she describe everything that i was seeing.  The weird thing is, is that when i called her the flashing light was moving to the right and when i told her to step outside it stopped and moved to the left.  I see these lights all the time now, i know for a fact when i go jogging tonight that i will see them again. This is serious and is no joke i don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.   The lights are mostly white and flashy, sometimes they are a mix of white and red.  They move slowly and sometimes stops.  I&#39;ve seen a multiple of 3 in one night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Central time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a cluster of orbs in a circular fashion.  The center orb, or light, was the largest not necessarily the brightest. There were at least 8 smaller orbs, or lights surrounding the center light in a circular fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cluster was stationary in the sky for at least 20 minutes.  The center light pulsed but the outer lights did not.  As daylight came I could still make out the lights but lost them as dawn broke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There location in my opinion may have been in the Kansas City Missouri area.  My location is south of St. Louis Missouri about 18 miles.  The location on the horizon would have been at around 9 o&#39;clock and it was west and south of St. Louis.  That&#39;s why I figure it was over Kansas City Missouri area and for some reason I&#39;m thinking they were that many miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t get an image with my phone.  When I went back out after dawn they were still in the same position.  Then as I said as daylight became brighter I couldn&#39;t see them anymore, I don&#39;t believe they left, I think I was just no longer able to make them out.<n>

It was traveling very fast and seemed to be at a very high altitude.  It was traveling in a generally north to south direction. It covered an approximately 30 degree arc in about three seconds. At first, I thought it must be a satellite but then it slightly altered its flight path twice from left to right in a kind of jerky motion. After that I lost sight of it as the tree in my front yard blocked the view. The light  was much brighter than the background stars.  The weather was absolutely clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived at work, I mentioned to my boss that I’d seen this strange light.  He said that when he had left his home in Ana, Texas, he had seen the same light and though he had seen it when it was closer to the southern horizon. He said because it was so fast and so bright he thought it was “a falling star.”  But he said he had not seen it pass overhead.<n>

We went outside and took our binoculars, what we saw was rotating lights, Ruby Red, Green and Yellow. It wasn’t distortion as they were sequential.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this object for at least  20 minutes. At that time, the lights became brighter, more intense and then it suddenly disappeared, it didn’t fly off, it was just gone. I had seen this exact same object in 1997 on the Alaska Hwy, when a missile shipment was going to Alaska, The drivers in the convoy had also mentioned seeing it when they returned.<n>

We drove up to the screen that was showing our movie which pointed the car in the north direction in the large parking area.  I was sitting in the driver&#39;s seat and my friend was in the passenger&#39;s seat to the right of me.  There were a few cars around us and another screen directly to the right. It was facing east and playing another movie.  There was also another screen facing east that was next to the second screen farther south of the parking area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour into the film, my friend gasped and asked &#34;what is that?&#34;  I glanced above the screen that was showing our film and we both noticed a V shaped object with circular lights on its underside. It was descending at a 90 degree angle just above and to the right of the screen.  It was smaller than the moon in comparison.  Its overall color was not determinable.  It seemed to descend in a fashion that mimicked a bird&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before it passed behind the screen that was directly to the right of our car, the V shape of the object changed into a W shape.  I still can&#39;t explain how it managed to do this.  There was no sound of an engine or anything that would propel the craft.  After it passed behind the screen to the right and right before it disappeared behind the second screen to the right, it began to fade away into nothingness.  It looked as if it activated some sort of cloaking mechanism that appeared otherworldly and frankly, unnerving.  I don&#39;t know if it landed because it disappeared in a manner compared to smoke dispersing.  After the fading object passed behind the second screen, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if anyone else noticed this but I would assume that others had to, giving that the craft was quite noticeable and projected a feeling of fear and a foreboding presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly migratory birds, but that is only a guess.

Saw 2 or 3 more orange light spheres rise up in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Third thought was weather balloons, or maybe glowing kites, but then the spheres rose up higher, some faster than the others, all moving up but not in a uniform direction.   The spheres then moved south towards Pacifica and disappeared.  Never seen anything like this and couldn’t find any reference online &#34;mysterious lights&#34;; lights over Ocean Beach&#34; etc, to what I saw.  Finally found these postings and am so glad someone else saw this too.  Overall sighting lasted maybe three or four minutes- a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other post mentions being over by 24th St which is high on a hill but far from Golden Gate Park/Ocean Beach.  They saw three but I think it was due to the distance; I was much closer and the lights were closer to the ground, also lots of tall houses/buildings in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No particular background for me, other than I believe in UFOs and that we aren&#39;t alone in this universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It seemed almost like a kid&#39;s toy as it was droppping like 1:15,3:15, 4:15, on a clock!  It seemed to have very unusual way of controling its movement and then soon after persihed behind the Vargas Hills. I have seen many stars over the years, yet none like this. It also had a very bright whitish firey tail that was very bright! What is more interesting, is it was 10x bigger than any falling star I have ever seen! I did not see a craft.

Then the object began to bobble, shifting positions quickly and erratically, left to right, up and down.  At one point the light turned to blue and then changed back to red.   Colors changed intermittently from red to blue several times.  Then it displayed both red and blue and slowly and controllably descended out of the field of view in a straight line.  The lighted object was much larger than traditional airplane lights, approximately 1/8th the size of the moon last night.<n>

I often stand on the deck in the center of the yard and gaze up at the stars at such times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a dim light in the sky to the east-northeast, moving a bit fast.  I thought it was a meteorite, but as I watched, it seemed to change course and “fly” horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light approached, it appeared to have a definitive shape, sort of like a wedge or boomerang.  The entire object seemed to glow with a faint reddish-orange light, and there appeared to be rows of slightly brighter lights underneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my perspective, it would have been approximately half an inch wide.  I heard no engine or wind noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object passed overhead and continued on a straight path toward the west-southwest.

Normally this would be of no concern or significance as we live in an area less than 2 miles from our municipal airport and between Beal AFB and Sac IAP, but the strobe of the light was a bit odd, a white light strobing at a pace of slightly slower than 1 sec per flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I casually followed the path of the object as it traveled south east then made a long turn that eventually became a large counter-clockwise circle several miles in diameter.  Once again this would not be unusual as planes often circle around waiting for an open runway to land on, but the arc took a long time to complete and the object was at an abnormally high altitude for a plane waiting to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I brought this to the attention of my wife then called my two daughters and my mother in law to observe and see if they found it odd.  As we watched the object continued to circle around at the same altitude and speed with each lap taking approximately 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On one lap the object passed directly overhead and we could see that it was two distinct lights of the same size one in front of the other with a small red light that did not strobe joining the two lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the lights would fade out between strobes there did not appear to be any discernible shape to the object and there was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, faint lights or reflective objects appeared to fall away from the object from time to time and proceeded in every direction, but were observable for only a very short time, a second or two at the most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This continued until 9:00 pm PST the object then took a path directly north east till we could no longer see it.<n>

It did not seem to move, but I was driving at the time and could not keep my eyes on the object.  It was quite bigger than any visible stars or planets, but a very small fraction of the size of the moon.<n>

When the evening came around, the sky was beautifully clear and blue.  I was driving, 10 and 2, and looked over my left shoulder.  I was heading West bound.  I saw something in the sky and passed it off at first.  I took another look over and it was still there.  I continued to observe it for roughly a minute.  It was stationary and I was just WAITING for it to move.  Since it wasn&#39;t moving I figured I would get my cell phone out of my pocket and video it.  I turned my head toward the road to concentrate on driving, pulled out my cell phone, turned on the camera, and the object was gone.  It was shaped sort of like a cross.  The center was more of a thin oval.  There was a small protrusion on the top of the object and a protrusion on the bottom that was about twice as long as the one on top.  It was VERY low to the ground.  Probably about 200 yards from me, and 80! -100 feet in the air.  There is little to no air traffic in this small town.  We have a couple of bright yellow crop dusters, and they&#39;re hard to mistake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was lying on my back outside looking skyward when I noticed the round object that appeared to glow a bright yellow and white color. It did not move at all. I showed my wife and 3.5 year old daughter and both saw the object. After watching it for about 7-10 minutes it appeared to get larger in one instant and then about 10 seconds later it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking at it we speculated that it might be a balloon but concluded it was too large. We then wondered if it was a star shining very brightly but we have never seen a star glow so much in the day... it was not a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not going to tell anyone about what we witnessed until by chance I saw photos accompanying a story on AOL.com today of almost the exact same thing yesterday over New York!!!!!!!!!!

10/13/10 15:47|Green|OH|Triangle||I captured an unknown metallic flying object on my digital camera photo.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78390.html|275|ndxe201010| I captured an unknown metallic flying object on my digital camera photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were in our back yard taking photos of the sky.  We had a number of twin rotor helicopters fly over our home, about 6-7 times in an hour so we were just outside watching.  The last helicopter flew over at approximately 15:01 according to the time stamp on the cell phone video I took of it.  It was a nice day so we decided to stay outside in the yard.  We are near CAK and so there is a lot of jet traffic in our area all the time and we are used to it...however on this day there was much more air traffic than normal.  My husband noted that some of the jets were moving unusually fast and although they should have been in ear shot, were making no noise that we could hear from the ground. I began snapping photos of those jets and their contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon review of the photos on my digital camera I noticed a dark spot in one of them.  Thinking it was just a piece of dirt on the LCD screen I scrolled to the next photo, and when I did the spot disappeared. I went back to the previous photo and the spot was there again, at this time I took the memory card out and put it in my lap top so that I could zoom in. I fully expected the spot to be a bird or falling leaf, however it was neither of these things.  My husband and I know for a fact that at the time we took the photo there was no helicopter in the area and the closest jet was the one in the far distance of the photo.  I tried to debunk the spot, but I can find no plausible explanation for what I captured on the photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To me, it appears a dull gray metallic object, triangular or boomerang shaped, with a dark blue or black dome.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure why we did not see this object with our naked eyes...the only explanation I can give for that is that we were both focused on the jet in the distance and were talking to each other about it and the possibility that it was spraying chemtrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m really at a loss to explain what the object is and why it is there.  The fact that there were helicopter activity in the area leading up to the sighting makes me wonder if it may possibly be secret military craft, or something else.  I&#39;d just like to have some kind of an explanation for what it is.<n>
10/13/10 14:30|Las Vegas|NV|Circle|10 minutes|Sighting of 3 UFO's in the Las Vegas region in triangle formation that moved to a straight line.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78345.html|276|ndxe201010| Sighting of 3 UFO&#39;s in the Las Vegas region in triangle formation that moved to a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wanted to share an experience that I just shared this afternoon with several of my colleagues. So I&#39;m currently residing in Las Vegas, and today is just another cloudless day in the valley. At about 2:30pm PST, we went outside, my two colleagues for a smoke break and some fresh air for myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat down and I gazed up into the sky as it&#39;s been quite a long day. While looking up, I noticed three VERY high objects in the sky. Too high to be planes or helicopters. At first my colleagues thought they were planes but then I pointed out the fact that for starters, they were in a triangular formation and NOT moving. Then a plane actually passed by at a high altitude, close enough to the crafts for comparison (and it was very clearly a plane passing by)...it became very clearly the same kind of craft as these objects. I wish I could&#39;ve documented the experience but the objects were too far to bee captured by a grainy cell phone camera and difficult enough to see with the naked eye (a little more clear with sunglasses).<n> <n><n> <n><n> So now my colleagues and I are all observing these objects in a triangle and they appeared to be glowing white. When I put on my brown, polarized sunglasses, it became clear that two of them were glowing a pinkish purple color. I passed my sunglasses along and they all observed the same thing. Then, at the same time, we all noted their movement. It was too far to tell whether the two on the outsides or the one on the inside was moving from the triangle...or maybe all three were moving...but they shifted from a triangle to a straight line where they then continued to hover at a distance. We stared for a few more minutes and then decided to go in. When we told our coworkers, they wanted to see them too, so (two minutes later) we took our coworkers out to observe and the objects were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no professional experience in UFOlogy, but as an undergrad, took a class on UFOs in which I was trained to be the skeptic. My first thought was airplane and then I realized that they weren&#39;t moving but rather, static in a triangle formation. Then I thought weather balloons, but their movement was too controlled, too stable. There wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky or an ounce of humidity in the air, and nothing grounded to create St. Elmo&#39;s fire. An airplane had passed within the same pane of vision for comparison so it wasn&#39;t a plane. Normally I would consider a project from Nellis, but here&#39;s the thing--when the moved from a triangle to a line, the movement was very slow. It took us all a moment to realize that they were actually moving. In the span of time from when I went inside and when I went back out and they were gone, with how slowly they appeared to be moving, there&#39;s no way they would&#39;ve been out of our line of sight that quickly. Usually speed is exaggerated by dis! tance (the farther the object, the slower they appear to be moving) so I&#39;m totally stumped. Thoughts?<n>

I stepped outside in the early morning for a smoke break and to look at the sky since it was so clear out.  I walked around the firehouse to check and make sure everything was locked up and nothing was out of the ordinary.  As I turned the South West corner of the building I noticed a bright light approximately 10 miles away directly west of the firehouse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this light for approximately 15 minutes trying to figure out what it belonged to. I was figuring a helicopter until I compared the object with a stationary object close to me.  That is when I noticed the object was moving from left to right approximately 2-3 miles at a time in less than a minute.  The object continued doing this with-out ever dimming, so I was able to dismiss the bright light as being a landing light on the front of an aircraft. Since the landing light would dim as the aircraft turned away from me if it was circling something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 45 minutes of watching this light moving left to right and occasionally up and down I noticed the light seem to be moving away from me, West.  With-in 3 minutes the light had moved a great distance away from the original spot where I had first witnessed the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no noise associated with the light but I’m not sure if this is due to the distance from me. The light was bright with an orange glow.<n>

I first thought they were aircraft following each other towards TYS air field.  I called my wife and quickly got my binoculars after about 6 bright amber lights appeared in a straight line.  I tried to focus on each individual head lamp to get it into focus but I couldnt get a sharp image of an aircraft head lamp on none of the lights.  They seemed to have gained altitude about 30 miles downrange, rise and get closer to the air field in an unusual single file path. Their were about 12 amber lights.  I checked the objects for aircraft navigation lights, red, green, white flashing lights but there were none.  I commonly see aircraft takeoff and land from my front porch so not seeing navigation lights really alarmed me.  They appeared to fly about 2 miles apart and then they appeared to bank right turn to a visual landing at the field. Once they made the turn they appeared to fade out of sight one by one.  The airfie! ld is 14 miles ESE of my position. The unusual thing was that the lights stayed at the same altitude when they turned, no sighs of desent or loss of altitude.<n>

It appeared there were 3 lights rotating around it at very high speed creating a strobe effect and at the same time creating a rainbow effect in a circle around the perimeter.  There may have been a dim center light.  The second object was stationary and had green and blue lights which did not flash or rotate.  The third object I could not see very well.  The only way to view these was with a 36x spotting scope. I did not have a telescope.  The objects intensity became dimmer and dimmer but never totally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It did not change course or make any other movement other than traveling forward at a slight decent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no airport nearby in that direction.  I watched it for about five minutes until it passed out of my sight range.  The object had no structure, only bright white light.  Therefore, it was definitely not a plane.  Nothing was emitted from it, and I could hear no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was high in the sky, so did not get an up-close view of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was clear, about 75 degrees, and no moisture.<n>

I looked up in the South/East sky and saw something.  At first I assumed it was an airplane, but it was definitely not.  I appeared to be metallic color at times, and then at times it looked like it was white...like a little white solid ball in the sky.  It moved very slowly left and then seemed to stop, and then moved a little more.  I continued watching it for approximately 1-2 minutes. I had never taken a picture with my phone, so I looked down for a second to see how to do it, and looked back up, and it was gone.  I did not see it exit the area.   I looked and looked for it, but it was not there anymore.  I went home and told my friends what I&#39;d seen and none of them believed me, of course.  Then today when I logged onto the computer, I saw something on Yahoo! entitled Manhatten UFO&#39;s, and watched the video of what was over New York the very next day, I KNEW that is exactly what I&#39;d seen.   Only I saw only one of them...not many.  It looked exactly like the video that was taken on 10/13/10 in Manhatten.  I am absolutely sure that is what I saw.<n>

The reason we became suspicious was that the craft stayed in the sky it was hovering near a hospital. It stayed over a spot for over ten minutes in one location.  I started to call people to tell them what happened and everyone thought it was probablly gov craft.  But later I went on facebook to post what happened and an ex military personel commented that he as well saw the samething aand it was not military and that he knew for a fact it was ufo.<n>

The object was not but maybe 400 yards off the ground and about the same distance away or maybe less.  There was not a cloud in the sky.  The object did not move and remained stationary. It was the color of aluminum. We kept our eyes on it the entire time and then in vanished out of no where. The craft did not fly up or to the side in the sky...it just dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled the car over and got out of the car thinking I would see it somewhere in the sky but it was gone.  After looking around I then looked directly above me.  Above me there appeared a flock of birds in a circular pattern just hovering above my car about 50 yards in the sky.  Everything around us seemed very &#34;still&#34;.  The birds were the size of hawks and had white bellies and black wings...I have never seen these birds in Waco ever.  Not only that, they were not moving.  It was very strange. I got bac! k in my car drove down the street for a bit, looked out my window up in the sky and they were still hovering directly above us...drove a little bit more and the birds were gone.  Don&#39;t know if that had any correlation with the craft in the sky, but a strange experience none the less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first I thought they were coasting gulls and wondered why they would be so high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as long as my eyes could discern them disappearing over the Diablo range of mountains.  Looking straight up again I observed two - four more of the white dots drifting in the same direction.  At one point one of them appeared to be tumbling.  I then noticed a large jet aircraft flying at an intermediate altitude also west to east along the same line.  I thought it very unusual to see an aircraft at that altitude traveling west to east.  Typically the aircraft have just taken off from San jose where they make a 180 degree turn to the south  or they are lining up to land at Oakland in the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the tumbling observation I wrote it off as spider webs.  Told my wife about it when I got home and thought that was the end of the story.  This morning I caught a glimpse of a video clip on google news (news organization not remembered) about the sightings over NYC.  While the clip focused on what appeared to be cluster of balloons, at the very end there was a brief shot of these white dots in sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seeing the similarity I had to tell someone.

I got up, put on my glasses and go my camera out.  The object then moved away from me - not in a compass direction - but up while lights kept flashing.  Object moved up and too far to be seen after approx 10 - 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

I look out the window to my left and see a light as bright as and about as long as a crecent moon, yet it was not a crescent shape, only a straight line, and I do not believe the object had been there for long, I would have noticed it prior to this point. I could tell it was not moving because it seemed to sit right next to a tree in my yard, though I know for sure it was not that close. I stared at it for a good ten to fifteen seconds, I then looked down at my bowl of cereal for no more time than to find a spoonful, once I looked back up, the object or light was gone. I had not looked down for more than a second, and from my view I can clearly see the night sky and the surrounding area, it would have to have been a very fast object, or one that could easily disappear. I do not know what I saw, but I do know that where ever it went, it either got there quickly from a hovering position, or disappeared compl! etely.<n>

After a minute I realized that they were not moving so I thought perhaps a helicopter. The craft came a few miles closer and that is when I began to realize what I was looking at and it is something that I have never seen.  This ship seemed to move literally like a star destroyer (sorry I have not other reference, that is what it is) and it came a few more mile closer to me.  I tried recording with camera phone but it’s useless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I would snoop around and see if any of the popular sites had the same information and it turns out that a man saw the black triangle in August.  Because of the darkness, I could not get an accurate look but this is a huge ship with the engines stacked as four rectangles laid two by two horizontally.  I do not get panicked but this is something that I have never seen or thought was humanly possible.  It was dark but from what little light I had it looked menacing, it looked like it was the size of an aircraft carrier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not writing this as entertainment, I saw the ship shooting something out and I do not want to tell you what I think it was.  It made a few passes and looked like something was being ejected from the ship or flying around it like a swarm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, huge black triangular looking star destroyer object seen over North Texas approx. 30 miles north of Dallas on Tuesday morning 12:56 – 12:57 PM.  Object hovered in the sky for about a minute and then gingerly made a half-circle and then a slow straight line to the west and came closer to me as it flew to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a friggin joke--and this is not something from Skunkworks.  The sounds of the engine were not a mechanical noise that I am familiar with.<n>

After a matter of seconds the orb lifted into the sky and dissipated into a cloud.   I don&#39;t really believe in alien life forms, this was just an unexplained object unlike anything I have ever seen before.  Thank you.<n>

Within an instant it was gone.<n>

I have aspirations to become an aerospace engineer and pilot and know alot about aviation so I can recognize my aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft was totally out of the Minneapolis approah pattern and was fairly large looking.  It consisted of simply two bright white lights that blinked in a few second intervals.  The craft was directly in the KMSP approach pattern and was high above the houses at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After just a few seconds the two lights dropped down fast until they went below the trees and houses just behind our house.  I know that this was not an aircraft as it made no noise and had no other lights besides these two lights.  It also moved down without moving forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it was no longer visible I went down to our computer and went to liveatc.net, there I tuned Minneapolis approach and listened a while until I heard a transmission to a Compass Airways jet telling it to take caution in a certain zone of the approach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked up that zone in my FAA Minnesota Aviation Charts book and saw that it happened to be near where I saw the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also just a few minutes later heard them telling the planes to look for a certain traffic that I either missed the name of or they didn&#39;t know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this seems to point to a UFO in our area on 10/11/10 that was near the KMSP approach pattern.<n>

At first I tried to reassure him that it could possibly be a planet or other bright star that could be mistaken easily for a ufo.  However, on this particular night, while driving home from eating out late ( I’m a waitress and often leave work after midnight ),  my boyfriend once again points out this blinking light over the ocean.   After parking at home and standing on our balcony to get a better look, we see that it is three lights, varying in colors and changing often from red to blue to white.  The lights are at equal level and seem to be suspended in one place just hanging there.  It was clearly not a plane or helicopter, and this is obvious as planes and helicopters are continuously passing by it simultaneously.  There is no comparison between the normal planes to this craft of lights.  They were totally different.  After about twenty mi! nutes the three lights that were once at equal level seemed to turn into a diagonal line and then slowly fade in brightness and visibility.  It was undoubtedly an odd experience.  I think of myself as skeptical on issues such as these without hard evidence, but this sighting has me confused and sending an email in the middle of the night……<n>

Investigated by mysterous helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 23:45 hours on above date I recieved a call from a family member.  The family member was hysterical about a supposed UFO near our location.  This family member indicated that there was a UFO hovering over a major hotel in the area, that dozens of people had pulled over to watch it and that it showed no sign of leaving.  Myself and two other family members quickly got into a vehicle and drove to the location they were at.  While we were in transit, we saw a strange helicopter approach the area and alternatingly hover and search.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This helicopter had the apparent length of a CH-47 military helicopter, but was unidentifiable due to lack of lighting.  It had none of the regular blinking red lights, but had alternatingly green, orange, and blue bright lights flashing in a regular pattern.  It appeared to have some sort of attached storage device under it, cube or rectangular shaped. The light configuration and storage construct was unlike anything I had seen before.  The altitude of the helicopter was about 75 meters.  The helicopter was there from about the time I recieved the call (possibly earlier) and bugged out at approx. 0010 hours in a N/NW direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We approached the location my family member gave me and parked alongside 9 other vehicles, each with 2-5 people in them all looking in the same direction.  We personally were unable to see the UFO as it left minutes before we arrived.  We stayed for about 45 minutes and it did not reappear. The family member that called me took video on her cellphone and upon getting home, we loooked online and there was already one other video of the event posted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a perhaps unrelated note, a cell phone in the house at 2232 hours experienced service interruption and emitted an electronic tone I have never heard before.

Sometime they would regroup and then another would hover away from the other - off to the side and then the others would stay still.  The one away from the others would rejoin the line and then continue moving.  It was very surreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed at this point that #1) there was no sound whatsoever associated with them and #2) they were not part of one object but rather each a distinct and separate object as it was a clear night and I could see up into the very clear night sky between each object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed them with my eyes until they went over house and tree line and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could no longer see them but then I noticed way up in the sky, almost appearing to be part of the stars little twinkling red lights moving in a formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Previously, the objects had hovered over me at about the approximate height of what you would think of a rescue helicopter flying - I&#39;d approximate about 800 - 1000 feet.  The now appeared to be flying in formation as high as a jet.  Again, this all happened within seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that was the end and I was left thinking about what I had just seen.  Just then, I turned and looked back towards where they had come and noticed another line of same identical objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly yelled for my partner to wake up and come outside which he did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched first 3 then 3 or 4 more all line up and again, hover over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both were wondering what they were as our neighbors across the street pulled in from work and came out to walk their dog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pointed the lights out to them and they too stood there with us watching the strange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More lights came - approximately 10 in total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner and I also witnessed together the rapid ascend into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had pulled out my 300mm lens and my Nikon camera to try and photograph them but because of how dark it was I couldn&#39;t get the automatic focus to focus in properly on the objects and allow me to take a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was however able to use it as a telescope/binocular of sorts and catch glimpses of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner also took note that they had indeed disappeared into the night sky and became far distant twinkling red lights which seemed to fly in formation until they vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been searching on sites including youtube videos of similar reports and I have found the following which look identical to what we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imtq1_OxqPE  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaBjkjndDUg  I hope you can shed some light on this subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I did call 911 to report the sighting but they said that there where already handling it...there where several witness, on foot and cars some with video cameras filming it...and it did stop traffic dead in it tracks... I observed it for at lease 20 to 30 minutes and my friends really got scared of it so I left to take them home and came back to the scene where by that time the craft was already gone and from what the witness said that the ufo drop something which fell in a hotel parking lot and Garden Grove Police intercept it... and took! something in a unmarked police vehicle.... they already tried to make a cover story about it saying it was a fly home made air plane but it was not the case... the ufo I saw was at least 2 helicopters in size and huge... and no way it was man made... the flying rotation was not producible by man made technology and the bright blue lights where not from here... really no way ... and several witnesses say this event unfold...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It pulsated once for a second and then faded out as if it were moving away (up) from the clouds.  There was no football game and no directional light source (like a flashlight or searchlight).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked at each other and said, “Did you see that?!”<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems I’m not alone in seeing UFO’s in Albany, NY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

He reported the craft to be shaped like a crown with two orange lights where the points of the crown would be.  It had a dark blue glow at the middle part.

I was so certain as to what I saw I almost drove to the area where it may have touched down.  I thought it was an airplane engine because of the slow speed but was too big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going to call the area police but I didn&#39;t want to sound like a joker.  I was watching the news certain that many others saw it and called it in or it was some plane debris that crashed.  I found this website on 4/14 so I don&#39;t remember the exact date.  I&#39;ve seen all kinds of fireworks ,planes ,meteors and this thing was like a school bus sized object engulfed in fire traveling fairly slow and was only about 1-2 miles away and could see it clearly and for about 4-5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After over five years later I still remember like it was yesterday.  With all the radio controlled aircraft&#39;s today there are probably a lot of ufo hoaxers but this was way too big to be one and I&#39;m sure I wasn&#39;t hallucinating or exaggerating.  Also I am very surprised that it wasn&#39;t on the news or reported elsewhere.<n>

I parked my car and got out to see what this could be. It began moving and came right over my house, the distance was like a low flying airplane, but this was NOT an airplane.  It was bright orange and pulsating and made no noise at all.  It was moving south to north.  As it was going over my house it was picking up speed.  I called my son on his phone to come out and see this, but within a few seconds this object was gone.  I watched it as it kept going in a straight south to north direction and it just disappeared.  I have never seen anything like this before in my life. I would love to know if anyone else saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The craft was silver and reflective, it was traveling in several different directions taking sharp turns and making abrupt stops. As I got closer I noticed the triangle shape and the strip of red lights following the edge of the craft and blue on the oposit side. By that point the craft was to the left back side of my car traveling under the over pass. Shocking but true, yesterday evening myself as well as several other drivers witnessed an event that is truly out of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The sky was still relatively bright, as the sun had just barely started going down, so I remember thinking it was unusual to see a star in the sky.  It wasn’t until the light started fading in and out did I point it out to my girlfriend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took her a couple of minutes to spot it, but when she did she confirmed that it could not be a star or a plane.  It would fade in and out without any discernable rhythm.  We stared at it for at least ten minutes before getting off the highway, and losing it behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I&#39;d seen such an object.<n>

Some sun and blue sky was appearing since the storm was winding down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I observed a cigar shaped object that at first looked like the fusilage of an airliner with a blue metallic tint, but no windows evident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Further obervation failed to disclose wings or rotors, nor did I hear any sound whatsoever coming from this object.  It moved slowly to the southeast right into a cloud bank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch but it never reappeared.  Helicopters, airplanes and jets of all sorts frequent this area as this location is near several airports.  I can always hear the rotors or engines droning but this object made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took me several days to completely comprehend what I had observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am convinced that it was not any type of conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I focused my attention in that direction, which was almost straight up over head in the sky, and saw an object that looked like it was pulsating or flashing, then it disappeared. I pointed it out to my daughter and we kept looking at that spot in the sky and saw it again. The object pulsated or flashed and then went out. My daughter quickly lost interest, but my interest was peaked because I did not see anything but the flashing and it was in the exact same spot, like it never moved. But when it stopped flashing there was nothing in the sky, the sky looked empty. It did it one more time and went out again and that was it. I found it very odd and it made me wonder what I had just seen. I felt uncomfortable. A few days later I saw the video of the lights over NYC and I got chills. I did no! t see all three at one time. It was either one at a time or 3 separate in the same place in the sky. But how the lights blink out at the end was what I saw. Hard to tell color, it was either lights or they had a metallic color to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I then sat on the side of my house, which my house is about a 2 minute walk to lake erie.  I was sitting there for approximately 3 minutes, when I saw a glowing red blinking light (it blinked from red to white)(then would be a solid red and start blinking again) hover higher into the air, and as I was trying to figure out what this light was another one appeared in the same maner as the first one did, they both stoped at the same point in the sky and then the second object I saw, started to disappear very rapidely, into the sky.. The first stayed in the same place for about 30 seconds and disappeared into the sky slower then the first one did. You could still see the first one for a few extra seconds.. Then I did not experence anything after that<n>

I believed to see what was a triangle shape, but what was odd was the fact that the ‘whatever it was’ was near invisible. I saw the two orange lights clearly, but could also make out what appeared to be a triangle shape of ‘diffused light’ as if I was looking through water. The lights themselves were somewhat diffused as well, round and large, and never changing position relative to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself, ‘what was that?’ as I was standing in an area south of Boston and near Logan airport… after a moment of contemplation I thought ‘not a plane’ still looking up suddenly another object of similar shape, with two diffused orange lights, side by side, this one much smaller and following the same path as the larger ‘craft?’ Again, as if I was watching a flying triangle made of water, diffusing the light, but when looking directly at it, one could absolutely see it moving across the sky. Both were moving much faster than what I’d describe as normal speeds for an aircraft -plane or helicopter.<n>

The sky was clear and the weather was calm; it was not raining, snowing or foggy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a single, large orange ball of light with a slight trail (also orange in color).  It darted from the right to the left in a 45 degree angle and did not emit fragments or particles.  The duration lasted approximately three to five seconds and the object was somewhat low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have seen many meteors before and this did not appear to be a meteor.  The object was obviously not commercial or military aircraft, did not resemble a lightning ball and was definitely not an emergency flare.  The object was rather large but definitely smaller than the moon and appeared to be within our atmosphere.  The object entirely disappeared and did not fizzle out, burn up or make impact; it was spherical and disappeared as such, without fragmenting.   The object did not emit any sound.<n>

My eyes are always in the sky, and I was pointing out how bright Jupiter was in the South sky through the windshield...but noticed it was *really* bright and orange.  Then I saw Jupiter in the background and realized this orange thing was moving.  At first we thought it was a meteor, but it was too slow.  We were both a bit shocked and pulled into a parking lot, got out and observed the light moving almost directly south for about two minutes.  About half-way between our zenith and the horizon, it briefly swelled in brightness and dwindled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about five or six times the intensity of Jupiter...so it was very large in the night sky.  It was moving about the typical speed of a satellite, but I have seen dozens, perhaps hundreds, of satellites and the similarities end at speed.  I would estimate the altitude similar to a jet, based on observing a slight trajectory as the object moved away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got in the car, made note of the time and came home to check the satellite trackers.  As far as we could find, there was nothing in our sky around 9:20.  I wouldn&#39;t be filling out this report if the object wasn&#39;t so blatant!<n>

The object presented at about ¼ the diameter of a full moon, but almost as bright.  The color of the light was amber to orange.  The light constantly flickered at a random and varying frequency.  There were lighter and darker parts to the light.   It was similar to observing a camp fire in the sky in its makeup and color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Originally spotted, it was about 20 degrees above the horizon.  After about 2 minutes, it had moved to about 45 degrees above the horizon, and appeared to be moving at a constant altitude.  At this point the object slowly turned toward the northeast, parallel to the beach.  At this time the light started getting dimmer.  The light continued on this path, getting dimmer all the time, until after a total of about 4 minutes of observation the light dimmed to the point that it was no longer observable.  During the time the object was traveling NE it traversed an arc of about 45 degrees of the field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No accurate estimate of altitude was possible, and therefore actual speed estimations are difficult.   Feelings were, however, that the object could have been at five to ten thousand feet, which would translate to a relatively slow speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no detectable sound from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Atmospheric conditions at the time were:  cloudless sky; zero wind; approx. 70 deg. F.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time of day was approximately 21:00 edst, Saturday, October 9, 2010 at Ocean Isle Beach, NC.  There were two observers.<n>

Trees blocked my sight from where I was sitting, but my husband and friend still saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another friend was coming out of the house, and she said &#34;did you see that?<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was   swirling around&#34;,  then my other friend said &#34;it just changed direction!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then flew North, and we lost sight through the trees.<n>

This is the 4th sighting of UFO objects in this area in the last week.  The objects seem to be searching for something as they keep hovering over lakes and the thick forest in this area.  The area in around Palm Lake and Turnor Lake is also well known to be high in mineral deposits which may be a link in the sightings.  Many people are becoming scared of the high number of sightings now in this area.<n>

It was moving VERY fast and on an incredibly flat, straight path. It did not veer even the slightest bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it went toward the south it very SUDDENLY slowed to a near stop.  At that point, i could easily make out that it appeared to have a sort of triangular shape ~ pointy in the front, tall in the back and still quite orange.  Then it began to move very, very slowly until i lost sight of it behind the trees on our easterly property line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t have much of a horizon to the southwest because of trees, so i can only see about an acre back.  I measured with my thumb and forefinger how far up it was from the ground at the back of the acre and that measurement was about 5&#34;.  (Sorry; i know nothing about degrees and angles) All of the movement it made continued on the same very straight line, never going above or below that 5&#34; mark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my husband to come out because i was just sure it would come out from behind those trees, but it never did, so it would have to have continued heading due south ~ otherwise i would have seen it come from behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Checked the clock and it would have been right about 8:20p (9th Oct 2010) that i first saw it.<n>

Hwy 80W we watched the lights stay in the same position or a holding pattern and the lights which numbered at least 12 or more slowly go out one by one in no special order. We were slowed down on the divided highway because of other vehicles on the roadway that were also observing this unexplained sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Vehicles were on the shoulder on the West bound side and a car in the median and exit ramp on the East bound side at Bradley Park East exit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ft Benning, Georgia is South of Columbus, Georgia. I served 10 years in the military and in combat and can say that this was not helicopters, aircraft, night fire training flares or fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects in the numbers we saw would no way be any type of aircraft that could hold that position or that close of a pattern and then slowly go out. The only time I saw any aircraft not using marker lights was in a combat theater and there is not any combat operations happening in Columbus, Georgia that would result in aircraft having marker lights on and then turned off slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This ordeal lasted roughly 5-6 minutes from our account.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have never encountered anything like this ever in our lives or seen anything quite like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> End of statement.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then the aircraft would fly and maneuver straight up and down.  It would fly up towards other oncoming planes, then it would go back south to it&#39;s initial maneuvering position and fly straight up and down (from approximately 25,000 feet to about 10,000 feet).  In terms of distance away, it was the size of a human thumbnail at sight.  After about an hour, it went to a position of about 25,000, a red light came on at the tail, and it flew away at the speed of a normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The house is on a corner lot that is 102ft x 87ft.  I have been in this house for over 50 years.  There is a large front porch where I sit to have my &#34;peace and quiet.&#34;  My husband passed away ((deleted--about a decade ago.)).   We were married 52 ½ years,  We have 6 children, ages 40 to 63 years old and many grand children and great grand children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My porch is well used.  My grandchildren and I would sit for hours talking about the trees, the sky, stars, planets, clouds and the winds.  Yes, we are pretty observant.  I would tell them what I have learned from my grandfather.  When it starts to snow, the porch is closed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 9, 2010, Saturday around 6:30pm, I was sitting in my chair.  I saw clouds moving faster than normal.  On the south side of the house, I noticed the &#34;misplaced&#34; North star about 90 degrees from the ground.  I talk quietly to the star, as our loved ones are there.  Between the trees there is an open space like a platform.  As I sit, I don’t see the North star, but I saw a larger star that was glittering.  As I got up to walk to the banister of the porch, something on the south side naturally got my attention.  A &#34;star&#34; darted east to west  slowly.  Then it moved faster.  I was able to see this incident very clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the house and told my daughter and grandson, but of course the computer was important to them.  I grabbed my binoculars and went back by the banister on the south side.  I looked up and it looked like pretty glares.  It looked like an oblong box with 2 long lines and 2 shorter lines, with a big star and two or more stars that were not as big.  The big star was glowing and bouncing side to side.  The line on the big star was in the center of the top line.  It looked like a large picture frame.  The lines were darting here and there, inside the oblong shape, they zig-zagged back and forth, up and down as if a hand was waving or writing something.  This lasted for 21 minutes.  The whole area had a glow.  An airplane came from Midway Airport, heading west, the stars were to the east.  I turned to look at the airplane, and when I looked back at the stars they were gone, but the glow was still there. It had looked like the lights in Vegas, it was very pretty and eye catching, yet I was scared.  I never really believed in flying saucers, but now I believe in the stars...objects.  I hope this is a good omen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My thoughts are...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The oceans control almost everything, making more movement like tidal waves, hurricanes, etc.  Just about a pattern of towns and area, floods, damage and death.  The sun comes up from the east, over the house to the south for years.  For the last two years, the sun rises from the east over my neighbors house (north) and our backyard.  Now, Oct/Nov, the sun is over more south of my house.  The weather in Illinois is alike in the Spring and the Fall.  In the so called true Autumn, leaves fall, of course the winds and storms help the tree leaves fall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> November, 11 2010: The fall/Autumn colors are not like years before, the trees are so colorful.  Many trees still have their leaves.  The Mountain Ash are the same throughout the years.  1st to go bare.  My thoughts are, who controls the Earth’s movements?  Is it some other planets?  Do they help or hinder our Earth and why?  The moon comes from the east to the west, on the southern part of our block.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My birth date is ((summer; 1920&#39;s)).  I am ((deleted--octogenarian)) years old.  I keep busy and love to read more and more mysteries and non fiction the older I get.<n>

It was around 5:38 PM and I thought that this was odd because the sun wasn’t to set till about another 20 minutes at 6:01 and the sky was clear blue with plenty of sunlight.  I thought it might be a planet so I ran inside to get the binoculars. I came back and located it again as it was the only odd light in the sky. When looking through the scope it appeared to be a circular disc-like object that had a weird reddish light mixed with white light around it that appeared to be changing color. It was stationary and did not have the blinking lights of a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then ran inside to get my father and we got another set of binoculars. I couldn’t find the first object that I saw as it had moved. We then saw four distinct lights in the south southeast sky that had the same appearance as the first.  All four of them were stationary without blinking lights of a plane or movement of a satellite. With the naked eye they looked like faint stars in the sky but once again this was very odd as it was blue sky and before the sunset.  When they were magnified with the binoculars we both were able to see circular disc-like objects. I saw the same red and white lights that were around the first one almost like an orb or aura and appeared to change colors. My father only saw white lights when he looked but clearly saw the circular disc shape of the objects as I did. Three of the objects were in a line and the fourth was up and to the right of the other three. The objects stayed in the sky for around five to six minutes and then they were just gone! .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked my cell and it was 5:45 PM still 16 minutes before sunset. If they were stars or planets they would have gotten brighter as the sunset occurred but this was not the case as they vanished after observing them for six minutes. They were not a plane or satellite because they did not move or have the blinking lights.<n>

Object appeared cylindrical in shape and had a diameter of say 20 feet and a length of 50 feet, like a fat tin can shape. It was white.  It had a trailing tail or tentacle-like objects dangling from it. There was a band around the middle of it. It had windows.  The object revolved about on its own axis head over tail every few seconds at a angle.  It was  about 3000 ft. up or less, and traveling from north to south over the area. I could see it clearly.  I was standing at the back of my truck watching it for five minutes. It was not flying fast at all, very leisurely.  At first I thought it was a helium balloon, but after observing it, I can say it was too large for a child&#39;s balloon, and it was turning over and over.  I went to my truck to get my camera then lost sight of it.  I do not think it was a satellite, a balloon or a plane of any kind.<n>

(Philadelphia’s Finest)..working the graveyard shift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, after reading her text, I was very much awake.  It felt fairly cool out in the living room, that‘s when I realized I must have been pretty tired the night before, because I never forget to close my windows before I go to bed.  As I was closing all the windows, I went to close the second window in my kitchen above my sink, when I noticed this bright light out back between the break in the trees which is ordinarily pitch black especially at 5:00 a.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I seen the first light, and I thought to my self what is that?  This light was larger than a star and yellowish orange in color and round. It would get larger and smaller, but staying stationary. Then, another light, much larger in size, same yellowish orange in color and round, became visible to the left of the first light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not believe my eyes!  I realized at this time, these are not stars, this is something I have never seen before in my entire life!  This larger light, repeatedly would get very large, then very small and disappear entirely, several times! While the smaller light to the right was staying relatively the same size and remaining at the same location and stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly ran to wake up my youngest daughter, she jumped up to my amazement and I quickly took her to the kitchen window. The smaller light was barely visible, but returned to the original size when I first seen it.  The second light was gone, I waited for it to reappear, but it did not.  I got dressed and ran down to my car to take a drive to see if I could get a better glimpse past the trees, but I seen nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A short while later, as I was eating my breakfast and was preparing my coffee, I continued to look out the window above my sink.  When the smaller light reappeared. I called for my daughter and her father, to come to the window, my daughter&#39;s father who is a true skeptic could not believe his eyes!  The smaller light had remained the same yellowish orange color and round, at the same location as I first seen it. The second, larger light did not reappear.<n>

The Ort cloud and many meteorites are always visible. The typical meteor streaks brightly and burns out.  Tonight I witnessed a dim dot high overhead, traveling at a high rate of speed.  It was dim, equivalent to the dimmest star but disappeared to quickly to be a satellite or other object in orbit.  I have seen a thousand meteor&#39;s in my 39 years and this one looked nothing like any other.  It was directly overhead my location traveling South to North.  I am reporting this in case anyone else on my longitude reports a similar sighting.<n>

We had just stepped out of the car, when she pointed to the sky and asked if &#34;that&#34; was the little dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw was a slowly pulsing and blinking formation, looking a lot like a small constellation, save for the fact that it was slowly moving westwards.  (We were looking at it as it was over the East Ridge.)   It had a curved line of four spots of light on the left side, and a straight line of two spots that were parallel to the middle right points.  (They seemed to wobble slightly, but kept in that general pattern.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed it for about 15 minutes, at which point it became obscured by cloud.  About five minutes later, the cloud had moved and the formation was once again visible.  Through using a brace upon the top of my friend&#39;s car, we determined that it was, indeed, the shape moving and not the clouds beneath it fooling us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for another 10 or so minutes before going inside because it was cold and creepy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Two definite falling stars were sighted in the same area, along with a blinking reddish light that was probably an airplane.)<n>

10/9/10 01:00|St. Catharines (Canada)|ON|Other|Was still there when we l|I and other witnesses saw unknown objects/activity in the sky appearing from unknown origins.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78251.html|354|ndxe201010| I and other witnesses saw unknown objects/activity in the sky appearing from unknown origins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> U.F.O Sighting (St. Catharines, Ontario)  The U.F.O Sighting occured on Saturday October 9th  at 1:00 in the morning, Viewed from a park on Russle avenue.  There was only two witnesses, being myself, and another person.  The sighting had occured shortly after a previous sighting (unreported) a few weeks after, at the very same park.  The sighting A few weeks before appeared to be one big white light travelling towards the park (which was bigger than all stars in the sky).  As the light continued to travel overhead, it turned into three lights (all in a triangular formation).  But at no time was I, or the other two witnesses looking away.  As it flew over, it created a slightly noticeable soaring sound (noticeabley quieter than that of a Stealth Fighter Jet) and did not resemble the shape/form of one either.  The three lights appeared to stay white, and did not flash like commercial/military planes. Until the lights slowly faded at different times (NOT flash), to a lighter then darker blue, and then red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The current sighting that I and another saw today, was first noticed by myself when looking into the sky for unusual movement, colour, shape, and size.  I had just been taking a long gaze into the sky to see what I could find, when i noticed something strange about what i was watching.  I noticed how all other stars flickered in the sky and remained in shape/colour (as usual), when one “star” had been changing colours from white, to blue, red, green, and pink.  I and the witness could see the apparition in the sky with the naked eye clearly (without squinting) and decided to use the high quality picture camera/video camera that has a very extensive zoom.  What we saw through the camera was an even clearer image of what I had first seen.  It was a bigger image of a flickering (somewhat like a star) colour changing object in the sky.  Looking at other stars next to this unknown flying object, was clear evidence that what we had been looking at was clearly not a star.  Not any greenho! use gasses or anything reflecting off of whatever the government would try and excuse this for.  The only other thing that this unknown object was doing, was fading out almost as if it was about to disappear and then would come back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is NOT a joke/hoax, I am only extending this from my personal experiences for the purpose science, for the sake of anyone who has experienced the same, or something similiar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day, I am willing to take a professional lie detector test to prove what happened today.<n>

I am shocked beond anger, that i can show anyone who wants to see what i am seeing, (like my christian wife, who refuses to think of the possibilities of extra terrestrial life). I have tried to explain to her that in my opinnion this helps me believe that maybe there really is a god. Enough about all this, hoevver i just want you to understand i have a very good job and an amazing family and i am a need to see it for my self type scientific mind. on the evening of october ninth it was a clear cool night and i was on my back deck facing the south when i noticed the brightest star i thi! nk i had ever seen, while watching this  star or what i thought was a star i noticed two more orange smaller stars around it, and they were moving at incredible speeds and in every which way.  Diagonal, up down, in a circle unlike any known technology today. now that is just the beginning i have stories over the next week and today even as i write this. I am at an absolute loss for words with what i have seen. nobody would believe me if i told them.  I would never waste this much time on a computer for some wack job story like this. please someone who knows about this or cares contact me. i will show you what i am talking about and i have more really freaky stories, if you don&#39;t see anything than i would even pay for your time i just need someone to help, i feel like life and everything in it right now is.....has changed. imagine the possibilities of other beings, eternal life, happiness, or the opposite. how can so many people be so ignorantly scared. please contact me.<n>

We looked up to the west sky approximately at 45-50 degrees from the horizon and saw what we first thought was a meteor entering the atmosphere. There were actual orange and yellow flames coming from the object for about 5 seconds. Judging by the size of the flames the object must have been fairly large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flames went out and an oval object appeared.  It was translucent and an orange/yellow color.  The object did not move for about 30 seconds.  The oval object’s orange/yellow color or light went completely out and than a white light appeared as though it was a star in the night.  The object then moved in a straight line left for several seconds and then moved right in a straight line as well, also several seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then stopped for several seconds then went straight down vertically for about 15 seconds and then went west and disappeared into the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions that evening were clear skies with low humidity. The moon was not out. I have been in Phoenix since 1976 and have seen many falling stars and meteorites fall from the sky. None of them ever did what we saw that night.<n>

I saw at least ten of them fly in some sort of formation south then east to west across the north mountain range heading from the Area 51 / Groom Lake region.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I assumed they were helicopters but they seemed to move too slowly and upon zooming with the 10 X optical zoom and taking stills no structure could be seen. These were shot on auto mode ISO 800 1/30 + 1/25 F4.3 @ 9 megapixels, the camera was a Canon Powershot SX110 IS with 10 X Optical Zoom, a very good piece of consumer kit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know alot of helicopter flights go out to the Grand Canyon from Vegas but the lights were all the same and moved in a very odd way, bright pulsing white with strobes of red pulsing up and down it seemed (which the stills show). No solid structure can be seen at all, either behind or in front of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve checked the national weather data for Las Vegas for that day, the official wind direction was from the South South West, these things came from the North and made a turn east.<n>

On the way to the door I noticed a shiny silver disk flying east and told my mom to look.  As we watched the object we noticed a second one travelling west directly toward it.  Both of us thought that they might collide but instead passed very closely by each other.  The objects were travelling in what seemed to be exact opposite flight paths. They also seemed to make no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching the objects we noticed a large white jet travelling south toward us and the objects. The objects seemed to be at a lower altitude than the jet.  Where the objects passed by each other seemed to be in front of the jet and at a much lower altitude.  We watched the objects until they were both out of view.  The entire event that we witnessed lasted about 5 minutes. They seemed to fly at about the same height that a helicopter would normally be at.  The objects were definitely close enough that we should have been able to hear the engine noise but there was none.<n>

Upon waking I saw these lights hovering outside my window a few feet away. I grabbed my cell phone and snapped a picture before attending to my uncle, when I went back to my room, the lights were gone.  We have a barn right outside the house; the UFO was near the barn. We have a light attached to the outside of the barn.  A few days later my father went to change the light bulb in that light, and it was shattered.<n>

10/8/10 00:00|South San Gabriel|CA|Oval|a few seconds|Dull red or octagonal object flying west to east and observed with 10X50 binoculars.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78243.html|376|ndxe201010| Dull red or octagonal object flying west to east and observed with 10X50 binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 8th, 2010 at about 12 AM, I was looking at the stars with my 10X50 binoculars in the direction of constellation of Cassiopeia;  I was trying to find the Andromeda galaxy when I viewed an unknown aircraft flying from west to east.  I do not know how high it was.  Because it was dark, it appeared to be oval, but if may have had straight edges like an octagon.  It did not appear to have wings.  It was difficult to tell if it was an oval or an octagon because the color of the object appeared to be a dull red;  I don&#39;t know if the color of the underside was because it may have had a matted surface which dully reflected mercury vapor street lamps from below or whether the color of the underside was glowing.   The object had no aviation marker  lights.  I moved swiftly and silently. I did not track it without the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the north is the San Gabriel Mountains.  To the west of my house is Los Angeles International Airport; I can see in the distance the landing lights of the planes; depending on weather airliners will pass over my house.  To the east is Ontario International Airport, since I live on a hill and have deck over the my garage I can see airliners with their marker lights on departing Ontario airport.  To the northeast is El Monte Airport.  There was a slight breeze, but not enough to turn the ventilation turbines on the roof of my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not think that it was a novelty Mylar balloon because the underside of the object was parallel with the ground as it was flying.  I have seen the B-2 bomber in flight during the day and this was not that.<n>

At first glance it looked like it was a single star but as we started observing it was actually 3 bright balls of light with 3d rays of light in all directions.  You could see all the rays and where they ended, kindof like if you were to draw a picture of a sun with a bunch of sun rays.  The movement was slight side to side then stop and then hover in cirlce at same time it was moving forward.  It appeared to be bigger or closer than a planet or star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We video taped this event with our home camcorder.<n>

One of the other managers said for the past 2 nights he had been seeing strange lights in the sky above his house in Potosi, about 5 miles southeast of Abilene.  He called me at work on the night of October 7th, 2010 around 8:30 or so and told me to look outside. I went outside and looked southeast. I saw 2 red lights appear in the sky, hover stationary for 2 or 3 seconds and disappear. About 5 minutes later, my grill cook came outside to smoke a cigarette, he came over to stand next to me and saw the same exact thing happen again, in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/7/10 21:40|Clarksville|TN|Sphere|40 minutes|Pulsating sphere hovering over Ft. Campbell area for two nights in a row, moving erratically and shining brightly.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78249.html|379|ndxe201010| Pulsating sphere hovering over Ft. Campbell area for two nights in a row, moving erratically and shining brightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 40 year old military officer, who had worked for over 10 years in Army Aviation before switching to Military Intelligence.  Regarding this event, my wife and I had just returned from taking the kids to karate practice.  Because my wife had mentioned seeing a strange object in the sky a few weeks ago (over Labor-Day weekend), I went out onto the deck to look at the sky.  Having just returned from overseas duty on R&amp;R leave, I was not home on the night she had seen the strange craft.  Last night however, I quickly noticed a bright star-like object that was much brighter than any other star in the sky, and (assuming it was Venus or something) watched it for a few moments - not that I have any idea where Venus would normally be located.  The object I was looking at was located to the WNW, seeming to be over or near Ft. Campbell (approximately 10 miles away).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before I was about to turn around and go in, it suddenly dropped about a third of the way from where it was in the sky towards the ground, almost dipping below the outline of a tree in my neigbors yard (the neighbor who lives one house over and behind me).  Shocked that I was possibly seeing a real UFO, I yelled for my daughters to come outside.  Both of them came out to see what I was looking at.  The object was moving slowly left and right now, but then darted back up to where it had originally been in the sky.  It moved far faster than any Army Helicopter I have ever seen would be able to, and bobbed around in a manner that was disconcerting to watch.  It seemed wierd.  I would have to guess that it was less than 10,000 feet high, since jetliners in the sky crossed nearby a couple of times and looked much higher.  It looked like a bright star that was alternating between staying there and darting left and right, occassionally swwooping down and up in no discernible pattern.  I finally went and got my daughter&#39;s telescope, using it to focus on the object as best! I could (hate it because her tripod is broken).  When I could! get it to stay centered, it was clearly visible as a sphere-like object that was translucent - containing pulsating lights flashing from within the sphere - reddish lights mixed with white flashes.  It was pretty impressive.  I don&#39;t know if it was from the telescope or from the object, but the sphere seemed to have some sort of texture to it&#39;s surface - like lots of blocks or lines making up it&#39;s shape.  My daughter also was able to see it through the telescope.  After a while, we got tired of looking at it and went back inside.  About 30 minutes later, I went to bed... but poked my head out the back door to see if it was still there.  It was, but it was not moving a whole lot now.  Today (the next day) I looked in that area of the sky numerous times throughout the day to see if there was anything there.  No luck.  Tonight, the object is back, but seems much higher and farther away than it did last night.  It is moving also... but not as crazy as it was last night, at least not in! the few minutes I spent watching it.  The pulsating lights on it are fairly obvious though... far brighter than the typical &#39;twinkling&#39; you get from stars (the Doppler effect).  If it comes closer, I will try to film it with my camcorder.<n>

The lights were larger than stars but dimmer almost fuzzy looking.It took about 4 seconds for them to travel from directly over head to about a little over three fourths the way across the sky and faded away.  They stayed in a perfect formation.The formation of lights was larger than any plane that has ever flown over.  I can not say for certain if this was one object or seven.One more thing there was no sound at all.  The size is hard to explain,but here goes. The width of my hand (4 and 1/2 inches)stretched out arm length (2ft from face).<n>
10/7/10 21:00|Paint Rock|TX|Light|Approx. 2 hrs.|Lights over Paint Rock|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78235.html|381|ndxe201010| Lights over Paint Rock<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Thursday, October 7th at about 9 PM while fishing at the dam in Paint Rock Texas, I saw a reddish orange light appear over the tree tops in the distance  to the north-east. It could have been 2 miles away or it could have been 20 miles away, I can&#39;t be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One light appeared for a few seconds. It flashed a couple of times (not like a plane) and moved erratically (which caught my attention) and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, two lights appeared about 10 degrees apart in the sky near the same location as the original light. They could be seen flashing and  moving erratically, and they vanished after only a few seconds visual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 10 minutes later, two lights then appeared much closer together in the sky nearer the location of the original light. They flashed alternately,  in sync, and vanished after a minute or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, and about half hour later, one light reappeared in the sky about 10 degrees west of the original light location. It moved erratically, vertically  and horizontally, and then seemed to get further away and climb higher in the sky for the next 30 minutes, and it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the way the lights flashed and moved; I don&#39;t believe them to have been created by any airplanes, helicopters, satellites, weather balloons, falling  stars or fireflies. It was very unusual. I have witnessed my first UFO.<n>

I noticed very bright lights in the East Southeast sky that were unusually bright.  They had the appearance and bright light of a planet but I knew this could not be the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what planet is in the Eastern sky over Texas this time of year, but these two objects were due South of this planet and appeared just as bright.  Almost to the point where you would think there three planets in a small cluster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several planes in the sky at the time, so it was easy to distinguish the two objects that I was observing and determine that they were not planes.  Plus, the objects were at a such a far distance that you would not be able to spot a plane that far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I got up out of my chair to observe further, the object closest to the South vanished very quickly.  It did not appear to move away quickly, but rather it just faded out very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other object was still shining brightly, just as bright as the planet to the North, and then, it too vanished almost immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I live very near to an Air Force and observe the flight patterns all of the time, this by no means resembled any of the planes that fly by and these objects were so very, very far in the distance that I do not think a plane could fly that high.<n>

At first, I thought it was a single cloud, and noticed there were no other clouds near the object.  The object was a bit blurry with a definite crescent shape. The object was white, with no other colors.  The object then appeared to get larger and closer. As the object got closer it looked less like a cloud, however remained its crescent moon shape.  The object also appeared to rise in the sky.  I noticed a few people on the street looking at the object. I turned onto Watt to pick up my daughter from cheerleading.  I returned to Elverta road, but saw nothing in the sky.  I then drove back toward home to turn around hopefully to see and explain the object; however, no object was in the sky.  Clouds do not just disappear.  I have no explanation for the object.  Due to not having a camera with me, I was unable to get a photograph o! f the object.<n>
10/7/10 05:05|Aurora|IL|Other|5-10 seconds|Crystal clear morning (either 10/7 or 10/8).

I went out to get my newspaper in the driveway and looked up at the sky to enjoy the stars.  Over my house, a faint bow-shaped glow (bluish in color) glided by going north to south. It was in view for 5-10 seconds.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to rationalize it thinking it was perhaps a large bird and that some lighting was reflecting off the front edge of the wings.  The more I thought about it, I couldn’t think of a bird in our area large enough to glide by with this effect.  The herons &amp; egrets in the area keep flapping their wings when they fly, so it couldn’t have been one of them since what I saw was a steady movement.  It wasn’t Canadian Geese in formation either.  Also, the object appeared quite large, so if it was a bird and it appeared that large to me, it would’ve been flying very low and I should’ve been able to see the body to some extent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I could see no other part of the figure, I assume the object was at a pretty high altitude. If I’m correct in that assumption, then the object was quite large.  After the object disappeared, I extended my arm and with my thumb and forefinger I approximated the size.  The object from tip to tip of the bow (crescent?) was about an inch and a half spread of my thumb and forefinger with my arm extended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It appeared to be between my house and the water at about 500 feet.  It was shaped kind of like the nose of an airplane.  This object was facing north and not moving. Looked  closer and at the south end of object was a vertical line also lit.  As I looked the line started vibrating and the thing shot straight up and out of my vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire incident was only less than a minute. It had no red or green lights nor color of any kind.  Just a bright white light.  We have no street light and the neighborhood is very dark.  I have no idea what it could have been.<n>

They seem to be slowly moving together, keeping there shape. I have lived in saint louis my whole life and I have seen this before, I have seen it about 3 times this year alone. All 3 times this year and a the other times threw out my life, they have always been in the same spot in the sky, it is always 3 redish lights making a triangle shape in the sky(I can&#39;t tell if its one big object our 3 small ones), and its always the same size, it almost seems like its floating there, I have sat out one night just to wach to see how long it stays there, I sat there for about 2 hours before going to bed due to boredom. The lights did not move. I have seen the object move a little bit before, when it dose move it always keeps the same shape size and speed wich makes me think it is one HUGE object in the sky with 3 lights on its coners. But yeah, oi have seen this th! ing for years and I will keep seeing it for years to come, its almost come part of nomal life for me to see this object a few times a year( its always a few moths apart) the next time it shows up ill take pics and videos of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We all heard this loud helicopter, and looked up and saw this oval shaped green glowing object, flying fast in front of this helicopter, we all said what the heck was that.  I have never seen anything like that,   we could see the black outer of the object, and green glowing in the middle of the craft that the helicopter was chasing.

The object appeared to be the shape of a boomer rang or a &#34;v&#34; shape.  It had very faint lights or it possibly reflection of parking lot lights off of it&#39;s exterior. It was rather low and very large. It appeared to be a grey color almost in the night sky.  There was absolutly no sound coming from the object even though it appeared to be very low in the sky.  There was some sort of haze or fog that appeared around it maybe... I think that is why it sort of looked like it was blocking the lights out almost. This happened at about aprox. 20:56 Eastern Standard Time. The object flew south towards Tampa from Spring Hill, FL. or South along U.S. 19.<n>

ON WEDNESDAY 10/06/2010 AT AROUND 8:45pm. Myself and my 11 year son where driving home from seeing my mom when i saw a bright burnt orange light just above tree top level hovering over a pasture at first i thought maybe it was a helicopter but there was no strobe lights normally seen on a helicopter . i turned to my son and said look at that light when all the sudden there appeared another light next to the first light we first noticed then there appeared more lights one after the other of the same color and size there where like maybe six of them all in a perfect horizontal roll. we stopped in the middle of the road and watched these light they where not moving just still when all the sudden the lights began to flash in sequence from left to right beginning with the first light we saw the flashes where not random but in a pattern left to right. the flashing lights started flashing slow at first but began flashing f! aster and faster left to right then it was like theses balls of light became one light ball and in that instant it moved like nothing i had ever seen before it accelerated i am not sure how to describe it  it was like it was there and in a instant it move maybe like a mile away and again began to hover over a mountain range. i remember think there is no way i am seeing this and turned to my son who at this point was halfway in the floor board of my truck he was yelling oh my god over and over again i looked at him and said did you just see that he said yes take me home dad.I then got out of the truck it was off i dont remember shutting it off but i must have i could still see the light in the distance and there was no noise and i called my mom who lived a couple of miles away and told her to walk outside and look to my direction to see if she could see the same ball of light but she said she could not see anything. i dont know how far we where from the lights when they appe! ared i am not good with distance to me we where less than 100 ! yards aw ay it was just there right in front of us in this pasture its a plowed field with just one tree in the pasture. i dont know what myself and my son saw all i know is that i have never seen anything like it before i know it wasn&#39;t a gas ball or whatever people say they are the flashing was not ram-dome but patterned left to right over and over again slow at first then faster and faster then when became one ball and  it accelerated. Look i have told some people what i saw and they look at me like i am crazy i know what we saw i just want to know what is it it wasn&#39;t a helicopter or a bunch of helicopters it wasn&#39;t a gas ball there was intelligence behind the flashing. i just want to know what it is we saw. that is why i am reporting this i just want to know has anyone other than me and my son has had similar experience happen to them and yes I did call it in to my department when i got home after about an hour debated with my wife if i should.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/6/10 20:40|Chalk Hill|TX|Rectangle|1-2 minutes|Hovering lights above tree line in remote wooded area.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78500.html|391|ndxe201010| Hovering lights above tree line in remote wooded area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving home along FM 1716, I noticed bright lights hovering above the tree line (approximately 40 feet above ground) on the left side of the highway.  At first glance, I thought it was a tower of some kind, but I’ve lived on the road for five years and have never noticed lights or a tower of any kind before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I processed that it was something unusual, I had turned onto county road I live on, which intersects the section of highway where the sighting occurred.  I turned my car around and went back, but whatever the lights were, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Six to eight bright white lights formed a rectangle, there were blue or red lights mixed in, as well.  I also thought it might have been an oil platform that had been put up just that day, which would explain why I’d never noticed any lights on that section of highway before.  However, I drove past the same spot the next day. No oil rigs, no tower, just un-cleared forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen a sighting before.  I&#39;m not a skeptic or a believer, as there is no indisputable evidence for either stance. I&#39;m an educated Christian - stable and reasonable - and I have no explanation for what I saw.  It was too low and small to be a plane, and it was in a stationary hover when I saw it.<n>

All appeared stationary traveling East towards Chicago.  The span was enormous! I thought are they planes going to land at O&#39;Hare but then I thought how can they have a tiered formation and all of a sudden on the right side tier, more lights appeared as if they were switched on.  I stopped and all of a sudden the second level tier light shot off from the left side and as fast as a blink of an eye was immediately to my left.  It glowed bigger and had a red hue and then all of a sudden it vanished like the light went out.  I looked to my right and the formation had changed, still tiered but so low. I can not believe that this is not in the paper and I am sure many people had to have seen this as it was so low and so big! I have never in my 48 years ever seen anything that moved so quickly in my life as I saw when that light left the tier and moved to my left.  I am not sure of the distance but it covered so many miles in less than a blink of eye.<n>

We have a big window that faces west.  At 14:40 I looked out the window and saw a silver object, tear drop shape move across the sky from north to south.  It appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed.  I had a full view of it for approximately 2 second and then was partially obstructed by a small 15&#39; tree we have in our front yard.  The object was still visible due to leaves being off this tree.  The whole incident lasted approximately 5 seconds.  We do have commercial airlines that typically fly from west to east into Mpls/St.Paul Airport.  We also have a small community airport in the city of Eden Prairie which is east of where I live.  Those planes are easily identified due to low elevation they are in for landing or take off.  It definitely was not a commercial or private aircraft.  I also called the Carver Co. Sheriffs office to see if there were any other reports, there were non! e nor did I file a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in the medical field currently on disability due to on the job injury.

As I go to catch up with him, he spots this bright bulb of light that seemed to be hovering several thousands of feet above the apartment buildings in which I live at and spinning in a counter-clockwise pattern.  Also, the lighting pattern was very sperratic.  Anyways, the anomaly was hovering for about two minutes and then it started moving eastbound, first very slowly and then picking up speed, and then it disappeared into the horizon. I don&#39;t know what it was, but both my friend and I rule out the fact that it was a plane.  Also as we go back into my friends house, we realize that his mom received a bizarre phone call; the number was labeled &#34;unavailable.&#34;  If an investigator wishes to contact me, please do so via email.  Thanks.<n>

Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw a search light streatch up from behind the top of a large tree. Upon looking directly, I realized it was 3 oval redish purplish lights in a straight line up and down but instantly they took a 45 deg.  Turn, but maintained their distance and relation to each other and sped off quickly to the east &amp; disapeared into the sky.<n>

I was facing east when I saw 2 blue/white florescent lights hovering below very low cloud cover.  They were a few hundred feet apart and no more than a few miles above my house.  They seemed to be &#34;dancing&#34; with each other moving in circular patterns quickly accelerating and performing maneuvers in the air that are physically IMPOSIBLE.  They were black triangular silhouttes with one neon/white/blue headlight.  These objects would circle around the sky and accelerate quickly and then stop and move at a measured pace -periodically stoping and &#34;floating/hovering&#34; in the same spot.  They moved through the air with ameoba like precision and performed calculated routines that seemed to be for surveying the area below.  After 5 minutes due to the cloud cover and the fact that they were headed west (headlight leaving me) I lost track of them.  Again I am not a physici! st but what I just saw defied the laws of nature and gravity and was like nothing I have ever seen or imagined I&#39;d be reporting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object appeared slightly larger than a star and seemed to twinkle.  With the naked eye some color variations could be seen.  When viewed with binoculars, the object cycled through a pattern of colored lights – red-green-blue, red-green-blue.  The object appears stationary in the sky for longer than an hour.  It was still in the sky when I went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 10/5/10, at approximately 9:30pm, the same multi-color object was again seen 30-35 degrees above the horizon in the Northeast sky.

Gauging from my position and the towers close to it, it was approximately 4 times the height of the closest tower.   My first instinct was that it was an aircraft because it was close to a small airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, then more lights appeared, at the same elevation, all equadistant from eachother, a total of eleven lights, almost like what you would see on a sign where one appears and then more come on from the center.  Once all the light were on, they all disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So immediately, I just dismissed it as maybe a reflection of some kind.  Then, it happened again, the very same thing and at the same elevation.   I knew then that it must be something.   It happened again and you could see by the illumination of the lights, it was turning to my right.   My first and second sighting was from broadside.  The I say one more glimpse of it as it constinued to turn and then nothing.   I talked to a friend of mine and they said they had saw it too, however in the past, not this time.  Not sure those sightings were reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never discounted the fact that there could be this type of thing but have never experienced it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am retired Air Force and have viewed many strange lights before which could always be explained and factually proven to be aircraft, sometimes due to clouds and different type of aircraft.  However, this was no aircraft and could not of been a group of aircraft unless they were helicopters practicing a syncronised light show, even that, there were no collision lights observed and they were too close together I would think and too much of a straight line to be that.<n>

The lights to me had a bright glow that i have never seen in my life and im 37, from Iowa, seen beautifull clear skyes and all kinds of things in them day and night not once like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving to Badger Creek on a gravel road. Then we noticed 2 more.  Then one more. there was also 2 small jet lines that faded and a black thing that appered to be maybe a hellicopter flying towards them from the north looked like it went under one and the just disappered .  Closest location point would be Going west about 5 miles south of I 80 and 10 miles east of U.S. Highway 169 and driving to it on i think, 120th ave(?). Started seeing them from about 10 miles east of hwy 169 After about 1 hour of watching them appeare and fade out like going behing clouds but no clouds then re-appere slightly changing from circle to oblong, not all 5, but all would change positions mostly they  patterned this.   ! .   , &#39;    &#39; ,   The first 2 that we seen were to the right of our view and then 2 to left and the 5th one was a little more to the left.  They would fade out not at the exact time but close and fade back in, in new positions. Didn&#39;t know if were plains at first, then knew not, thought, too bright. They never got closer or farther away like standing still in the sky untill we realised that for a brife moment thought it could be Armagedon but we didnt die. Once 2 faded and  didnt,t see them but seen 2 lighs in the trees  but thought they coulnt  be in the trees. Dont know. They then re-appered one at a time back in about same position (was 2 from the left side of our view and the trees were ferether left. Tryed to use cell phone to capture them on film but the lights wouldnt show up in camera or video mode on any settings. After sun was about compleatly set they disappered and that was it, seemed to be all 5 at same time not sure. By that time we had slowly been ! driving and stopping by then were about 2 miles from U.S. high! way 160.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With-in about 5 to 10 minutes after they were gone another big, maybe Armey helicopter, came from the east. The Des Moines Airport and military base would be the direction it came from.  We just know it had to be UFOs.  We arent UFO belivers but we had not one possible explanation and we went through every opption possible.<n>

I headed back home (Southern Utah) in October, but decided to go through Northern California, see some friends in Sacramento, then head to Salt Lake City and stay with family for a few days before returning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took the PCH to somewhere around San Luis Obispo or Paso Robles, then I believe I cut east to the I-5. It was very late (or early)... maybe 3 or 4am... I was about an hour and a half from Sacramento in some rural area with a lot of farm land from what I could tell. From maybe 1 mile away, I started seeing some lights that were really bright and aiming straight down. I slowed down to about 45 miles per hour and was watching them flying from east to west, VERY low (maybe 30&#39; from the ground) over a field, then they would lift to maybe 80&#39; as they flew over the Interstate, then dropped down again on the west side of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer, I noticed that a semi was parked almost directly under the line of flight on the east shoulder of the I-5 North I drove up a little further and parked as well. There was almost no traffic at all, so I got out and watched. Being that close, it looked like a large, boomerang shaped wing with 4 or 5 lights (it&#39;s been a while and I don&#39;t recall exactly how many) aimed straight down. It was completely silent and I estimate it was around 40&#39;-50&#39; from tip to tip. Again, it would fly over the Interstate heading east (toward a little ranch house approximately .5 miles east of the shoulder I was parked on), 20&#39;-30&#39; above the field, then it would raise in elevation right before the ranch house, continue out maybe another mile, make a smooth turn south, and fly directly back to the west again. Always descending in elevation over the field, then raising up over the Interstate, then dropping again. I watched it for around 30 minutes and then decided to continue on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been searching for anyone else who may have seen something like that near Sacramento. I simply want to know if it was a civilian or military craft, or something else. If it was civilian or military, why would they be flying over someone&#39;s house with spotlights on, over and over and over? And what kind of craft makes absolutely no noise except for the sound of moving through the air? I know it seems strange to write now, but I have wanted some kind of answer since I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I went outside to see &amp; check power pole &amp; noticed street lights were at same power state, so low that they went off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living out in the woods where I lived there are several other homes &amp; mobile homes on the street.  Normally a lot of dogs in the area always barking, with the woody area, &amp; river close by, frogs and other noise makers as usuall.  Well this night was different, all went quite I mean nothing was making noise &amp; if it was, it all stopped.  When I noticed a slight hum, a very weird hum, like a washing machine on spin dry but not that loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up I could see a dark object, triangle in shape, huge!  I would say football field lenght in size. No lights, no blinkin lights, nothing.  The only reason I saw it was because the moon was not quite halffull when it got blocked out of view &amp; stars as well.  Moving slowly from east to west towards the perdido river.  My girlfriend, her brother &amp; myself all seen this.  Not sure if anyone else in the area did.  I reported this to MUFON, I guess a week later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well a month went by when I took vacation from work &amp; was barbequing on grill late afternoon I noticed the strangest damn thing.  All the tops of the trees, about the same width of the triangle thing we saw, had turned brownish &amp; wilted, more wilted than brown, you could see the pine trees just looked sick like if u don&#39;t water a plant enuff or you water the leaves &amp; put it in the hot sun &amp; they wilt.  But it was fall so no way it was from weather.  2 days into my vacaction, 3 vehicles come cruising down the road which dead ends &amp; we all know each other so veh not from residents, 1 humvee, &amp; 2 chevy suv&#39;s all with white gov.  Plates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They got out, took pics of trees, that I saw as well.. they where in the area for about 2 hours. I went up to the two that got out of the suv they were dressed in blue coveralls like flight suit lookin military clothin! g no nam es on clothes but patches on side on velcro lookin spot on upper arm what looked to be lighting bolts with I think a missile between the bolts, I think the numbers were 38th, at least that&#39;s what I think it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway I asked them are they here because of the low flying craft 3 or 4 weeks ago?  They looked at each other &amp; told me what craft, I went on explaining what I saw and what i thought caused the trees to welt.  They told me no that&#39;s not what caused it &amp; it was a fuel release from an aircraft that had problems, which was a damn lie cause fuel would have been all over the trees falling from sky not a straight line.  I didn&#39;t argue with them of course &amp; they asked me my name &amp; address &amp; who all was with me, &amp; I&#39;m like why would u guys want to know all this if it was a fuel release from airplane? They said In case of sickness or medical complications they told me.  But why didn&#39;t they ask rest of neighborhood? Some guy called me from MUFON about 6 months ago but not sure if he was who he said he was.. I never saw the military guys again, just 2 helicopters flying over area checking out the same area, I really wish I could have got a photo from the air to see the distance that this thing made because it was 3 streets in lenght from ground view and some.  maybe 1/2 mile of wilted tree tops 80 to 100 yards wide..it was crazy..  I mean craziest thing I have ever seen! I wonder how they knew who else was with me that night, that&#39;s the other thing that really bothers me..<n>

It almost looked like the body of a squid with 3 legs instead of tentacles under it. When it faded I don&#39;t believe it went behind a cloud, as it faded from back to front. This was seen in the distance South of Flagpole Hill Park in Dallas, Texas. I do have a photo but it only shows up as a very faint shadow in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw along both sides of the interstate 3 triangle shaped objects with 2 bright lights in the middle on the bottom of them.  I opened the windows and the sunroof and could hear no engines or other sound.  I drove directly beneath one of the objects and could see the outline of the triangle against the sky.  In the rear view mirror I could see that one of the objects changed to red and started sending out red lights.  I was scared and didn’t stay to watch, I headed home and ran in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was heading from southwest to northeast.  The object was brighter and larger than the planet Saturn.  The sky was clear and cloudless and there was no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took the object less than 60 seconds to cover horizon to horizon.  After the object covered about 2/3 of its translation across the sky, the bright white light turned off and it became a dull orange color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise and the object appeared to be travelling several times faster than any commercial jets that have been observed in the same area.  It was also much faster and brighter than any satellite that has been observed at the same location.<n>

The skies were mostly clear with the upper clouds moving east and the lower clouds moving to the north.  I would guess the object was between the cloud layers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object sat stationary for about 10 minutes.  It seemed to get smaller, and then back to its original size when we first saw it.  All 5 of us were speculating as to what it may be but nothing made much sense to me.  The brightness never changed during the entire event, even when it appeared smaller or slowly flew directly overhead to the east.  Just a very bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point it looked like a triangular shape, at another point it looked like a baloon shape - could not really tell from the naked eye.  I don&#39;t know what it was, but a jet cannot hover, I think a weather balloon would have been influenced by the winds and would not have moved east at a faster pace than the clouds, and a reflection of the sun off a metallic object would have changed as it flew directly overhead and been more yellow in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One person believed he saw a halo shape above it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what it was.  It was too far to see a definate shape or hear any noise from it.  Probably a rational explanation, but perhaps other have seen it or may know what it was.<n>

I saw what I thought to be a star at first but it was very bright and flashing different colors very quickly.  Then I thought it might be a plane, but it stayed in one spot.  As I kept watching it moved from side to side and then stayed still a while. It continued this for the duration of its time in the sky.  Then it seemed to get smaller until it was gone. I do not have a video camara.<n>

No one was about and there was little to no air traffic at that time.  It was a moonless night I was watching Taurus rise in the eastern sky.  Out of the corner of my eye and towards my left field of vision, I noticed a large optical blur- like a wave effect- directly over the constellation Cassiopeia.  A triangular or, perhaps, wide wedge shaped object seemed to materialize into existence at that point against the star field.  The exact shape was difficult to ascertain, because my eyes were dazzled by an absolute matte blackness which seemed to cloak the thing and travel with it, and was profound and visually confounding; but I was able to discern that it was roughly triangular in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each of its three blunt or rounded corners was steadily illuminated, but these stripes of luminosity did not seem mechanical.  Rather, they appeared dim and phosphorescent, of a sickly yellow-green hue, reminiscent of a weak glow-stick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object first appeared roughly 50- 60 degrees above the horizon, north-north-east, at an altitude of approximately 300- 400 feet, headed due south, skirted the Pleiades to the west, and passed almost over my head and behind the top of the hill.  Its initial flight-path was slow and deliberate, like a helicopter or a glider.  It could not have been either one of these vehicles, though, because it was absolutely silent and was traveling almost against the wind.  It was much too slow for a prop plane or, especially, a jet.  I will reiterate: the thing was silent as death.  I estimate its diameter (point to point) to have been about 20- 30 feet.  This first sighting lasted 8- 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is perhaps irrelevant, but noteworthy, that within 10 seconds after this sighting I witnessed a brilliant white falling star in the east, very near on the horizon, directly behind what was the object’s flight- path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About three minutes later, it (I assume it was the same object) proceeded back the way it came- this time at a much higher altitude and at an impossibly high speed.  Had I not still been scrutinizing the sky, or had I even blinked, I would have missed it.  This second time it was only recognizable as a distant black point of mass that blanked out the highest stars as it passed.  Any object traveling at that speed should have (according to my understanding of Newtonian physics) produced a sonic boom, but it was, again, completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will add a final, perhaps irrelevant, detail.  For sake of a complete record I state here that I have never in my life felt such a prescient sense of dread and malevolence as I did while witnessing this object and after the fact.  I soon departed the area.  Since that time, I have been plagued with vicious nightmares and a disrupted sleeping pattern.<n>

Light was very bright at times fading to just visible.  Went slowly back and forth in the SW and was heading back to the E when last seen, still pulsing in and out. Light was at least several miles SW of Coffey MO when I broke off  pursuit and headed back home where it was still visible for about 15 min. I went in house and came back out for several min but it was gone.<n>

On clear nights I try to spot satellites and track them as far as I can (a habit I had since I was a kid).  On this night, I spotted what looked like a typical fuzzy blueish satellite traveling slowly accross the center of the sky from south to north.  As the light headed north it grew brighter then &#34;flared&#34; into a very bright diamond shape for about 5 seconds.  Then, the light dimmed as it traveled and returned to the fuzzy dot and continued on it&#39;s path. Theres a large, very bright star/planet in the southern sky at that time of night and I would say the brightness was the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the impression of something entering our atmosphere for a moment, then leaving on the same path since it never burned out like a shooting star.  At no point did the light change speed or it&#39;s trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also like to mention that I saw something similar to the Bloomington report on 5/11/10.  However, I thought it was closer to 10pm.  I&#39;m not sure what the person is referring to as the &#34;right&#34; side of the sky, but what I saw was red/orange light travelling slightly southwest direction.  It was moving about the same speed of a commercial jet, however it was single bright light with no strobes that you would expect to see on a jet.  There was no sound, however it came to an almost immediate stop directly above, faded, then disappeared.  I would even describe the fading as if the object rose directly up as it disappeared because it grew smaller as it faded.<n>

Then all three of them faded out - one by one. Not all at the same time.  They did not move fast left, right or up - they just faded into darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought they could be flares, but who would light 3 flares at the same time?? The only conclusion i can reach after reading up on UFOs on the internet is that this must have been a UFO sighting.<n>

I went outside and they soon began to move apart in random directions.  One very bright light stayed in the same place for most of the time while others randomly moved away and came back to the stationary light.  The moving lights would sometimes die off to the point you could not see them, but then eventually reappeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, one light moved toward the stationary light and disappeared when it met it.  The stationary light moved rapidly a short distance to the left and quickly went back to its place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights gradually seemed to be dimmer or farther away and eventually we could not see them any more.  The stationary light seemed to be the brightest and at one point flashed from bright red to orange, to blue to white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights did not have flashing lights like a traditional aircraft and moved in ways that are nearly impossible to our technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible stars??

They went to the west and then back to the east and then back to the west again and all of a sudden a third object shot across the sky from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movements of the first two objects were exactly at the same time. All three objects were a light gray in color. They were not as light as the clouds in the background. They were I would say about one fourth the size of the moon. They also covered a large area, zigzagging west east and west again maybe 10 degree every movement. Never saw anything like this before<n>

We had plenty of bright daylight which made this seem kind of odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live just 35 miles west of Atlanta, Ga. we see lots of aircraft from the airport and we are amazed at the number of flights coming in most days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was most assuredly NOT a plane or even a single craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was very clear and I don’t recall a cloud in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I glanced upward kind of in a southern direction and saw what I thought at first was a star and immediately realized it was not a star as my understanding is that stars twinkle so then I thought a planet and it must be Jupiter since it had been in the news that it was very close. Keep in mind these thoughts flooded my mind in just a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was processing what I was seeing I realized that I could see a cluster and to my amazement  a geometric shape took place and I was really not believing my eyes at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape “connecting the dots” so to speak would have been a six pointed star. All of the other “Fire balls” were somewhat inside of the main area. I had a tough time with the count because at least two of them seemed to be interacting or moving very closely together this movement was very obvious to me but all the others either had no movement or it was undetectable. Also most of the “fire balls” were yellow but several of them maybe four or five were red or orange in color but had the same shape and size as well as amount of light intensity. It became harder to see the objects as time went so I would say the faded rather than moved in a horizontal direction. But the main star outline remained the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife came over to where I was standing and said she could see about five of them. I went in to get my camera and when I returned I had a hard time getting my eyes to focus at first but I did see them again but my photo did not show what I had hoped and so I have no other evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to add that if this had happened at night it may well have went unnoticed to the untrained eye, namely me. We know we saw something but as to what we could not really say. UFO or US military makes no matter to me because I have never seen anything like it before. I do hope I get the pleasure again.<n>
10/3/10 10:30|Amelia|OH|Changing|5-8 seconds|Bright white object streaking across the front yard then disappearing.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78142.html|438|ndxe201010| Bright white object streaking across the front yard then disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> October 4, 2010  I was standing in my kitchen at approximately 10:30 AM on Sunday morning, October 3, 2010, when I looked toward the front of my house where the front door is located.  We have two side windows running the length of the door on either side.  I saw a slightly larger than beach ball sized white object coming toward our house from the road, which is about 200 yards.  The color of the object was a bright white, which was what originally caught my attention, and travelling fast, about 6 – 8 inches above the ground.  It appeared somewhat transparent.  When it was about 30 yards from our house, it shot off to the left toward our driveway and the woods beyond.  As it changed directions, it changed from being a sphere-like shape to an elongated shape, almost like an oval.  During the time it travelled from the road toward our house, my eyes didn’t leave the object.  I walked down the hall toward the side window watching its approach.  By the time I reached the front door, it shot off ! to the left.  I opened the front door, still perplexed by what I’d seen, and walked outside.  I looked to the left and to the right trying to figure out what it was.  I saw nothing.  I walked down the front sidewalk toward our side entry garage in the direction it had gone and there was nothing there.  It had simply disappeared.   I thought maybe it was an empty plastic garbage bag that had been caught in the wind and was blowing back toward our house, but that was not what it appeared to be or looked like.  And if it had been a plastic bag, I would’ve seen it either caught up against one of the 3 fence lines on that side of the house or caught in the tall weeds and grass at the edge of the woods.  There was not enough time for a bag to simply disappear the way this object had.    I said to my wife when I first saw it ‘I just saw a glowing white ball of light’ coming down the yard, which was my first and initial impression.  My wife and I immediately walked to the back of t! he house and out into the back yard to get a better view of th! e wooded area behind our house and again, there was simply nothing.   I have no idea if this description of my experience is at all similar to any other ufo sightings, but it is the only explanation we can come up with.  It was a gloomy, gray day with no sun shining at all at that time.  There were no cars passing by on the road.  We couldn’t think of anything at all that could’ve caused what I witnessed.  I would very much like to know if this could have possibly have been a ufo sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then a week later on the 10th of October I seen it again but this time it was a 9:30 or 10:00 pm.  This time it was in the north sky and it was doing the same thing. Going up and down and back and forth. their looks to be a blinking or rotating light on it.  Today is October 14th and I have seen it again this morning it started at 530am and is 630am right now and is still out their.  It is back in the west sky this morning.  The 1st time I seen it I called the police and reported it but did not leave my name and number but this is the 3rd time I have seen it and don&#39;t know who to tell anymore I just want to know if anyone else has seen it as well in the western Sky&#39;s over southern Indiana!<n>

I observed What appeared to be a star,all of sudden it darted , dead still to a very fast speed for approximately two miles!Instantaneously it reveresed it&#39;s direction back to its original postion it stayed in it,original postion. A commercial Jet came along right under it!I would estimate the jet liner 5000 feet below the UFO was dead still at this time!Shortly it started roving the sky around it&#39;s original postion all of sudden it turned on a very wide violet colored spot light and continued roving the area around it,s original postion for a couple of minutes.then rain clouds overcame my view!After that I couldn&#39;t see anything!I would approximate the Star looking UFO was 15 to 25 miles away when this phenomenon occured!!!I wouldn&#39;t bet, but I would guess the alttitude to be around thirty five thousand feet!<n>

It is too close to be this bright and be a satalite or any kind of craft hovering in out atmaspher. I think I know what I see, and its not from us.

10/2/10 22:00|St. Louis (Clayton)|MO|Chevron|15 seconds|Saw what appeared to be a commercial jet headed for airport but no lights or sound|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78116.html|444|ndxe201010| Saw what appeared to be a commercial jet headed for airport but no lights or sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out running at the Clayton High School track/football field around 10:00 p.m. and saw what looked like a commercial airliner on a flight path towards Lambert Airport but it had absolutely no lights and it made no sound whatsoever.  I often run at night on this track and almost always see aircraft heading toward the airport during my run.  I am familiar with the typical flight path of planes on their way to Lambert.  What I saw tonight was a clear outline/silhouette of the wings of what looked like a typical jet headed for landing but it was lower (in altitude) and was traveling a little faster than the planes I usually see when running at this track.  I could make out the wings quite clearly but the tail and nose (assuming they were there) of the craft were less clear.  There were absolutely NO lights whatsoever - just a silhouette against the dark sky.  It moved just like a regular jet but there was absolutely no sound.  I had just seen a jet go by on! the same path about 5 minutes or so prior to this sighting.  After reporting by phone to NUFORC, I called Lambert Airport police/security and they transferred me to someone named John in &#34;Ops&#34; (couldn&#39;t clearly hear what John said when he answered). I told John what I had seen (jet with no lights/no sound headed toward Lambert) and he said they&#39;d had no reports of anything unusual tonight.  I will also mention that Boeing has a large facility right next to Lambert Airport - perhaps some kind of test plane?<n>

To my right above some building, aprox. 150-250yds high, was a large object.  Couldn&#39;t really see the body.  I was able to see a triangle of lights.  At first I thought it was a plane because the airport was not too far from the area.  However the lights never moved!  It was as if it was hovering in the same spot. Seemed quite large, maybe the size of a normal passanger plane...except possibly wider.  The thing that just confused me was that it never moved and how low it was to the ground.  This was in a suburban area near a small highway.  Only one object was observed, and it was too dark to see any detail of the &#34;craft&#34;, however the lights were very visible.  Looked like it would be a triangle.<n>

As I moved further away from my house, a second identical sphere appeared about an inch (from my perspective) beneath the original one, horizontally to the left, about thirty seconds after I saw the first craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my sister out of the house to come and look at the sighting, which she reluctantly did, and saw the two objects in the sky.  We went back in together, her to her room again, and I went to get binoculars to better see what they looked like and where they were moving to.  With the binoculars I could clearly make out the shape and exterior color/material.  It appeared to be a copper-silver blend, but was reflecting a piercing pearl light from the center, which I suspect was a reflection from the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the object was similar to a Chinese lantern laying on its side; the center was clearly defined by a built-in skeleton th! at resembled raised tubing on its shimmering surface.  Above this visible division was a row of black that I could not make out as compartmentalized in any way; it appeared to be a consistent strip around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about two minutes the secondary craft began to orbit around the primary one slowly, to which it went around twice and then stopped, mid-rotation, in the exact spot it had originally appeared, on the reverse side.  The duration of the rotations was approx. one minute, forty-five seconds.  I was timing as best I could with my watch.  The two drew together and separated three times in the same straight line position and then stopped moving.  They sat there for approx. 6 minutes, and then started to drift away, but slowly. It was another 8 minutes or so until I could not longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came back inside the house and drank some water, talked to my mother regarding the situation and found a hotline to report sightings.  I called and they suggested I submit my written report to document the sighting.  Here it is. I only wish I had a camera to document, but now I know that and will try to have something immediately available.  This is not the first sighting I have encountered, but it is the first I have reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, although the report may have been submitted by the person who called our Hotline.

The bright ness faded in and out and could have been the reflection of the sun.  The craft did not move for approx. four hours.  I used the compass on me phone for a direction and it was at 216+- degrees SSW from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder If this is what also was seen in the salt lake area today.  If it is, they were very high in elevation because salt lake city Utah is 240+ miles away.  There was normal aircraft in the vicinity but showed no reaction to the objects.  This could be due to the distance.<n>
10/2/10 12:15|Orange|CA|Unknown|2 min.|Mysterious Rays Light Up Night Sky in Orange, California|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78139.html|454|ndxe201010| Mysterious Rays Light Up Night Sky in Orange, California<n> <n><n> <n><n> So...Friday night my boyfriend and I were in Orange County visiting old friends at a kegger. We left the party at around midnight, October 2nd. After picking up some In-n-Out on Chapman Ave. we headed up Chapman towards the 241 to Riverside. My boyfriend was passed out drunk, and I was D.D. As soon as we went over the top of the hill, right after the Orange Hill Restaurant street ;ight, I saw these beautiful rays of light flashing upwards towards the sky. I want to describe it as similar to the lights you see at a car dealer, but there were way too many of them! So my best example is when you see in E.T. movies, a UFO sitting in the middle of the forest and it&#39;s lights are shining throughthe trees in a somewhat circular,waving motion?  Hope that makes sense. But NE ways, it light up the whole night sky, and it was coming from in front and to the left of me.  So my best guess is that it was coming from somewhere in between the Irvine Park and Santiago Oaks area! .  I saw the lights constantly moving from the top of the hill until right before I got to Santiago Canyon College.  My vision of the source of the lights was somewhat obscured by all the tall trees in the area. But whatever it was, it was very bright and had to have at least 5 lights around it to account for how many rays I saw shooting upwards. The color of the rays went from a pure white to a faint blue.<n>

We were outside enjoying the night when all of a sudden I noticed something different in the sky.  I was startled and unable to identify the object. It was completely quiet and pretty low in the sky.  It also seemed to be traveling in a straight line at a slow speed.  The object was shaped like a triangle with constant lights shining on each corner. It seemed like the center was black or dark and maybe transparent.  I grabbed my fiancé and had him look up as well.  And we both had no Idea what we were looking at. It lasted about 20 seconds. We both stood up to see and it better and it flew over the house and trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Omg what happened next I will never ever forget  The star that appeared that didn&#39;t belong there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden in started getting brighter brighter and then it took off  toward the top of the moon at an enormous speed leaving a beam of light behind it it got from the bottom of the moon to the top in seconds and it disappear leaving a trail of light.  Now I know for sure that did not belong to man.  The speed was way to fast from a stationa! ry position    Yeah right. We don&#39;t have those type of crafts.  What I witnessed  made my conclusion  and answered my question that are we alone.  No we are not.  Only those that have been selected to have the privilege to have witnessed such an event know the truth...........<n>

The porch light was off, but the Moon was very bright.  I looked right up above me and noticed a bright, somewhat green, light moving across the sky. It was moving way too fast to be a plane and didn’t have the flashing light that planes have. I continued to watch it move across till it just disappeared in the middle of the sky.  It wasn’t a shooting star, I’ve seen plenty of those, but I have never seen anything like that before. It was very eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/1/10 21:00|Saskatoon (Canada)|SK|Changing|30-60 seconds|hazy yellow-orange light(s) that changed shape and moved fluidly|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78107.html|459|ndxe201010| hazy yellow-orange light(s) that changed shape and moved fluidly<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 9pm on October 1, 2010. I was outside in my backyard with my dog, and as I waited for him I was glancing around at the stars. Movement in the east caught my attention. Above the city lights, perhaps around airplane height or a bit lower, I could see a soft orangey-yellow, self-illuminated object that moved like a piece of silky fabric in the wind. It was very faintly lit, so it was sometimes difficult to see against the light coming up from the city, but I watched it for about 30 seconds as it moved into the wind away from me and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple times I thought I could see three brighter lights within the glowing haze that moved and “danced” around each other. The flowing movement of the light made it appear to change shape as it went. It was not moving across the sky fast enough to be a meteor, and it was not traveling in a straight path. It meandered. The size of the object was large enough that at first I thought I was seeing a large bird swooping around, or a plastic bag blowing in the wind...but as I said, it was moving against the wind and it was self-illuminated. Afterwards I told myself I must have seen some Northern Lights activity, but I have never been able to see them from the city before, and the light was only visible in that one spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could hear an airplane flying somewhere directly above me but did not see one. The object did not have airplane lights, and did not move like any aircraft I have ever seen, though I am by no means an expert on aircraft.  There is a military base south of the city, but this is the first time I have witnessed something questionable.  I am 29 years old and I work in veterinary medicine. I am the type of person who demands proof before I believe anything, but I just can&#39;t explain what I saw.<n>

We had just bought our 5 acre property and were living in a fifth wheel, while developing the property for a home.  Our property is 15 miles outside of town and is in the woods.  We had a small campfire and it was about 8pm at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were standing outside around the campfire and the children were there as well.  It was a clear and cold October night sky.  My husband and I looked up, and right above the 70ft pine trees about 100 yards away, appeared a bright yellow light about the size of a washing machine and round in shape.  It was noiseless and moving towards us fairly slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got above the trees that were right around us, it shot up straight into the sky as fast as you could blink and disappeared.  There was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both saw this and the encounter lasted about 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My children did not see this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

THESE LIGHTS I ADMIT LOOKED LIKE FLARES BUT I WONDERED WHY FLARES NEVER HAS BEEN ON THAT SIDE OF TOWN OVER THE AIRPORT, ONLY TOWARDS FT BRAGG NC.  THATS WHEN I NOTICED AN EXTREMELY FAST VERY SMALL RED LIGHT, TRAVELING SOUTH TO NORTH,  JUST UNDER THE MAIN GROUP OF LIGHTS, MY EYES BARELY COULD KEEP UP WITH IT.  IT WAS JUST AN INSTANCE AND THE RED LIGHT WAS GONE.  AS WE WERE TRAVELING, WE DIDN&#39;T STOP SO SOON GOT OUT OF VIEW OF THESE LIGHTS.   TOTAL TIME WAS APPROXIMATELY 3 MINS.

Once on Rte. 11, parked at McDonald&#39;s to view safely.  One began a slow slight descent about 1/4 further down than the other.  Then it stopped.

Last Friday, I had exited the parking garage and turned onto Harvest Hill Road when I looked up.  I saw an airplane which was very low; I thought it was about to land.  Then I realized it was not moving nor was it making any sound.  It was not hovering the way a Harrier jet does - it was as if it were frozen in place.  I was even more astonished to realize no one else seemed to be paying attention.  Let me repeat: it was the afternoon rush hour on a Friday.<n>

I ran to the middle of the street and he pointed over the houses across the street and I saw four orange orbs in a square pattern moving across the sky in close proximity to each other. I immediately called my neighbors to come out and see. By the time they came out (maybe 1/2 min) ...one of the orbs faded out and was gone. One by one the last 3 dissapeared. After they were gone a 5th orb came into view and seemed a bit more intense and then faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They where looking for someone named the Omega.  They talked about several thing but I never saw who was talking and that I would know them because they would talk blended with the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they wanted me to come outside so I did and when I walked outside I noticed that there was an eclipe created by the moon. When I heard voice that told me to look up and I saw a ship but it was barely visable.  Then the craft disappeared and tha was the last time I saw that craft.  A series a event happened like someone was test my knowledge of events of the past, present, and future.  There is a park close to my house where a voice asked me to come and me someone. It was four right angles as I was guided my the voice and when I came to the park   I was instructed to go in a certain direction an push a spot in an figure that leaned against a series of triangles,retangles, that leaned to th! e left.  Then I was to stand ther but before this had  happened I saw a native American supposely to be a tribal nation looked like the wrong tribe but the eyes looked diffent than I have seen before because the one I saw that was in the mall had eyes that were blue but with white kind like specks not like or iris&#39;s. So, first went the port-a- pot when I came out then I walked to that structure but nothing then I went an sat on then bench. It was raining lighting an a figure appeared the being was almost light grey but see through at the same time. The being looked me in my face an I remember looking down an seeing a tranlucent worm that had what looked like squres and tringles in side it&#39;s body. Then I turn to leave an the being was gone and I went back home. I also remember talking to someone or a family from the voice I heard was a kid,mother,father, grandpa. We had several coversation about various subjects.I remember also at the mall the other which apeared human as we ! know; was a brown haired woman she motioned towards a shirt bu! t didn&#39;t speak. I wasn&#39;t a weird was more like why was contacted but something went wrong. One minute I was sitting in the forest at night still talking to someone but I heard a noice an out the corn of my eye I was a slinder figure with long hair move across the path with quickness; then he was gone.The srangest thing was the government made annoucement that they were conducting an test an if we heard something ignore it. Several day turned to months then some start yelling at me and one day while I was sitting in my chair  Iheard a strang sharp noise so loud that it made my ears hurt that I had to leave my home an go out side. I went to the doctors an he refered me to the audiolegist and they informed me that I had tenitious. An then about four months or so the same sound happened agin this it last sometimes fours and for several days. I t seemed like every where I went somebody or some being was testing my ears until I cried out in pain and  I heard a voice that told who ever was! doing that insane test to stop because it was hurting his ears.I went back a gain to the audiologist this time the test showed a 5% hearing an now my tenitious was worsted than before. Then thing started happening in my home that never happened before; like items coming up missing and feeling like being wanted to look over my body naked. I felt buring temporary feeling on my throat while I sat in my chair doing my art. The bed moved in a wave like motion but I never saw who was in my room. I am a dibetic so one night I thought I was having a diabetic attack because I feel some leechs like suck ing on my kindey areas. I felt thing I never felt before on my back thight lie two snail like feeling but when I wipped my my leg because I I though something might have crawled on me because I slept on the floor but when I did that it went away an never came back. Because of the tentious that I have now every thinh is amplfied because the ears is damaged an now some of those voice I! hear now screems.But one night when I slept I happed to feel ! my mouth mve but when I looked up I was a light green being with maybe arms or tentagles sort floating above me; then I went back to sleep. Another time I was sleep  an I happened to awake an I saw a pink and blue want appeared to be  what we call a snail an I looked an rolled over an went back to sleep. An between that time some people were standing out side an I didn&#39;t think much about expect when I walked pasted someone standing there an he spoke but he did&#39;nt open his mouth to speak and spoke back with my mouth as we do.  So many thing happen I didn&#39;t know what to think then something happen while I was sitting in my chair; I felt something crawl through my chair an I jumped up an something in now on my back especially every time I sit on any like right now.

10/1/10 08:30|Middleton|WI|Other|3 minutes ?|Glowing orange barrel-shaped objects in sky over town of Middleton, WI|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78157.html|471|ndxe201010| Glowing orange barrel-shaped objects in sky over town of Middleton, WI<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and 3 children, as well as a neighbor, and two of her children, were having a fire in our backyard firepit.  There are no streetlights, so our sky is dark, and you can see the stars very clearly. Between 8:00 and 8:30ish, we noticed a group of barrel shaped glowing orange lights coming from the near northern side of our neighborhood.  There was no sound, that we could detect,coming from the objects.They popped up out of nowhere, one by one, and floated at a moderate speed across the sky in a southerly direction, not very high, and eventually went into the clouds and disappeared (we could no longer see the glowing of the objects in the clouds)about a quarter of a mile for our home, as we could judge. We had no sense of fear, just pure surprise and curiosity.  I took photos as soon as I could run into the house and find my camera. My camera revealed some barrel shaped and some flatter oval objects, glowing as if on fire, or very hot.<n>
10/1/10 08:03|James Island|SC|Triangle|2 minutes (driving on the|10/1/10    James Island Connector Vshaped aircraft hovering over the JI Connector at 8: 12 pm|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78091.html|472|ndxe201010| 10/1/10    James Island Connector V-shaped aircraft hovering over the JI Connector at 8: 12 pm<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me note briefly that what I witnessed was some type of aircraft unknown to me. The reason I’m reporting this is because it was so strange and there were multiple witnesses that must have seen this plane hovering over the JI Connector.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving over the James Island connect from West Ashley towards Folly beach.  The time was exactly 8:12pm October 1st/2010.  There was a ton of traffic going to and from James Island tonight. As I’m driving I notice to my left a V shaped plane/helicopter with small white lights going down the sides of the V, there was one light at the tip of the V and then probably 4 or 5 smaller lights which pointed down the left and right side of the V.   In the middle of the V was a single blinking white light which blinked much like a normal airplane light except instead of the light being on the two tips of the wings, this blinking light was in the middle of this V.  The shape was very similar to a military stealth bomber; that was my fight thought.  Normally I would say &#34;damn that’s a weird airplane/helicopter&#34; and keep driving; however this V shaped plane/helicopter was literally  hovering  over the JI connector.  It was completely stagnate, it was as if it was motionless, hovering literally over what must have been 50 to 60 cars going to and from, over the JI connector.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so odd and so silent and completely motionless.  Looking back, I keep thinking no commercial or private plane would be able to fly so close over a US HWY.  Maybe it was some type of balloon; yet it seem to have mass and a such an unusual patter of lights.  I don’t know what this was but I know for a fact many people saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else is reporting on this V plan/helicopter please let me know your thoughts.<n>

The larger craft are spread out in different places in the sky.They stay at the same spot night after night. They all emit red, green, and blue lights. There are also other craft that move in the sky all over zipping back and forth. They are different than the others as to size and shape. They seem to spin alful fast at times. Lately i&#39;ve noticed them moving in an octagon pattern that when they finish the shape there looks like they throw off some kind of clould like stuff. At night you can see them moving thru the sky leaving a bright purplish contrail. Something is happening and it&#39;s real strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars, we suspect.  PD))<n>
