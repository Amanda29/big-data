While sitting in my hot tub I saw a bright orange glowing light coming towards from the eastern sky heading west.Soon to follow was Two more glowing Orange lights they seem to be scamming the area looking and searching which direction to go. The next thing that happened was that 16 smaller lights appeared in a cluster they also had a orange glow about them. They also stopped above us and then formed a line formattion like birds do. Then they formed a bird like pattern and stated to head south the Three larger lights then reunited together and followed the other sixteen smaller lights. When heading south the larger lights began to spew sparks like a welder would when welding then they continued south. I quickly called my sister in law which lives south of us and she also saw them. Can you tell me what I was seeing? It was not a ordinary sighting. They seem to have intellegnce of some sorts. Also when my sister in law was watching a plane had to manuver it self around them to miss them. Would had come from the Sonoma County Airport around the corner from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, ((name and contact information deleted))<n>

The object had an odd reflection as if it were made of chrome, and it was not moving in any direction at all. So I pointed it out to my friend and he spotted another one just a little higher in the sky with just a blue sky background. So I say to my friend, I think those are spaceships? Then without a blink they disappeared with no trace. It was wierd because they just were there and then were gone. They both looked like horizontal ovals of chrome or some type of reflective metal, and had nothing to campare to a regular plane or jet. That was the wierdest and most unreal 30 seconds of my life.<n>

That&#39;s what I did as usual last night from my balcony. This time though since I know that there are no airplains flying above the city at night I was right away brought into thinking that something different from an light airplain was visible up in the sky. It went on and off at intervals and it had a glare at times wide around itself at others that glare would shrink rapidly, although not compleately disappearing. It stood still for approx. 1 minute and a half then it started moving slowly westward. It stopped and went into shining again, like if it were a star pulsing. It was evident however that a star it was not. Hanging immobile there in the darkness it enlarged in shape still keeping a formidable and very bright light all around itself. But the strange thing it happened to be that as it broadened in shape the centre of it would turn dark as if hallow(empty) in fact at a point it was so large that it seemed like one could see the dark sky through it. 2 minutes approx. and as I was watching it shrunk again. It became a bright point in the sky and then begun moving further westward, slowly and it eventually disappeared.<n>

It was a bright steady glow..not moving, not blinking. I watched it for a minute or so wondering what it was. I figured it strange enough to get two witnesses from inside the house to come out and check it out with me. They both spotted it and we watched as it slowly began to drift East in the sky. It was approx. 3 times larger than Jupiter. One witness grabbed the telescope and tried to get it into view to no avail. While we were watching it we noticed it slowly looked as if it were fading into a pinpoint, then it would come back big and bright again. Finally after a few more minutes it just disappeared by fading into a pinpoint and then it was just gone. It seemed like it had traveled away from us the way it faded away. A few months earlier, one of the witnesses had spotted the exact same bright red light in the Western sky.<n>

Twice!<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my wife was getting out of the back yard spa she seen an unusual object quickly approach from the west. I was standing inside our kitchen, as she ran to follow the bright orange/red star like object. I ran outside to she what she was fussing about, at that time I saw the object and being a skeptic told her it was Jupiter. But I was astonished at its brightness. My first thought was what a good oppertunity to see this planet at its best. I then turned to get my binoculars from the house telling her to keep her eye on it. As I took my first step towards the house she shouted the something was going on. I turned to see the bright object drop or launch a shiney object that faded quickly followed by another less brilliant object. Then the main object pulsed sevral time then vanished. I was stunned at what I had just seen, yet I felt honored to witness such an event. It&#39;s not over yet. I went in and called the police since thier helocopter was flying in the same field of view. I reported to them what I had saw. They gave me a local MUFON phone number which I have not be contacted back yet. Story continues as the object returned again from the west with more brightness. At the time it reappeared my wife and I were discussing the first sighting with some neighbors. And at that point we gathered more neighbors to witness the second event that was very simular to the fist. Ten people witnessed the second event and nobody admits to ever seeing anything like it before.<n>

I disappeared at about 3:00pm.  At about 8:30 when the moon rose, beings approached me: my mother, grandmother, and a friend that had died and some others I didn&#39;t recognize.  They talked to me for awhile.  At one point I woke up lying on the ground in the nude.  My memory is very hazy since I was suffering from dehydration.  I would have thought I had dreamed it all except my shirt was wrong side out the next morning.  I found my way to my RV by 12:30 am on March 31.  I had traversed at least two miles barefoot and was relatively unscathed except for cactus spines in my feet.<n>
3/30/02 19:50|Jacksonville|FL|Changing|7 seconds|Cluster of lights passing overhead at high speed simultaneously changing configuration|4/8/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22403.html|12|ndxe200203| Cluster of lights passing overhead at high speed simultaneously changing configuration<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking across the yard Friday evening I paused to see if I could identify a newly discovered comet mentioned in the news recently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Facing west I scanned the cloudless sky trying to locate Mars in order to find the comet but a cluster of swiftly moving dim lights caught my attention. The lights numbered five or six and the intensity of their luminosity was no greater than the fainter visible stars that night. In fact had I not been starring in their general direction at the time I would not have noticed them. They moved from south to north at a high and relatively unchanging rate of speed. When I first noticed them they were arranged in a roughly straight line and I took them for conventional airplane lights except they didn&#39;t strobe and then I decided there were too many and the configuration was unusal. As I tried to determine what aircraft this was the lights reorganized into a rough arc. At that point I figured these were indivdual objects and not a solid lighted body. The reconfiguration took place very quickly and it seemed as if the trailing lights had increased speed slightly and took positions on the easterly side of the arc as the others spread out to the west. The pattern was very tight which lead me to discount the normal military aircraft in formations I&#39;m accustomed to seeing in the area skies. The lights remained in the arc formation and I had the impression they were breaking into another pattern but I lost sight of them in the glare of a street lamp. the glare of the street lights of the intersection north of my home coupled with the speed the lights travelled made it impossible to find a better vantage point to track them further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to listen for aircraft engines as they passed overhead but the din of passing traffic on the highway an eighth of a mile west of my location made this difficult. I couldn&#39;t make a determination of the altitude of the lights but their faint appearance gave the impression they were very distant. Likewise the individual lights seemed to be in close proximity of each other but this is impossible to determine definitively. Their size and luminosity gave the impression they were roughly at the same altitude and attitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be content to dismiss this formation as satellites but for two factors: Their high rate of speed and the ability to reconfigure their positions simultaneously. On the evening of Sunday, 3/31/02 I watched the sky between 7:45 PM and 8:10 PM with the perhaps eroneous assumption that I might see the same cluster of satellites pass by yet did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did however note two satellites, one passing north to south and the other the opposite, and noted that these had roughly the same luminosity as the cluster I&#39;d seen before but not the greater speed. I&#39;m read of four or five clusters of satellites launched into orbit by corporate entities but I&#39;m not aware that they can reorder their relation to one another or regulate their speed. A couple days of research hasn&#39;t yielded any information on such a satellite cluster but I&#39;m open to education.<n>

It then would pull up at about 80 degree angle wobbling a little as if it slitely out of controll,and make a slow very sharp u-turn headding down at the same angle and along the ground reapeating the same thing over and over agin untill we lost sight of it.just as we were lossing site a police car went speeding inthe directin of the object<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found him to be quite eloquent and serious-minded.

Two males and one female were traveling north on Cordon Road just on the East side of Salem where the city ends and farm land begins. They first noticed what appeared to be two bright car headlights just above some trees ahead about a quarter mile and above the tree line on the left of the road. As they began to approach the intersection of Cordon and Sunnyview, the view to the left and above became quite clear as the trees on their left gave way to the scene ahead of them...a craft slightly larger than the house it hovered above between 50 to 100 feet quietly sat as they and a few other drivers on the road passed in both directions. The house this craft was situated over was sitting by itself in an open farm field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point in the sighting, as they drove below and to the right of it, they report seeing what was described as a craft in the shape of a triangle, only the front end of the craft was not pointed, but instead having a straight edge. At the corners were two bright white lights which were bright enough to illuminate the crop in the field below in front of the home. As they came along side the craft, they stretched their necks to look up and out the car window. The middle section on each side began to rapidly flash red lights in a strobe like manner. They also report a dome like structure centered in the middle of the craft. One of the witnesses recalled wondering how the craft would land as the dome underneath would make the craft wobble upon landing. Passing the craft, they report seeing two bright white lights on the back corners as well. The witnesses continued down Cordon road a short distance and turned left on Walker road while viewing the back of the craft. They then turned again left as Walker road curves left in an attempt to come up on the other side of the craft. It was at this point that the craft departed the area at a high rate of speed. It was noted that there was no sign of &#34;slow to fast&#34; acceleration, that the craft simply &#34;took off&#34; from a point of motionless hover to speeding away at the blink of an eye. Several other motorists appeared to have seen this craft as well, according to the witnesses, but none have come forward as yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Salem Police Department was notified by the witnesses as they didn&#39;t know who else to contact. The Police put the witnesses in contact with Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, who in turn contacted Oregon UFO Research Director Skip Schultz.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, Saturday the 30th at 11am, Director Schultz and Assistant Director Eric Byler met with the two male witnesses at the intersection of Cordon and Sunnyview and were told of what had happened. Schultz and Byler were also given drawings of the craft in question. Both investigators were in agreement that both witnesses were sincere with their story and were of a very credible nature. A better idea of the altitude of the craft was given at that time and it was decided the craft was around 75 feet above the field rather than 100 feet. The female witness was working that morning and later sent a report to the Review via e-mail. Byler returned later that day and spoke with the home owners that lined the opposite side of the field in question in hopes of finding other witnesses. While no other witnesses were found in these homes, it was discovered that while some of the neighbors had not been home during the sighting, the rest conveyed that they were either in watching TV or eating dinner. None of them reported being either outside or in a position to see the silent hovering craft above their homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone was driving either North or South on Cordon road near Sunnyview at 7:20pm on Friday the 29th of March, 2002 and witnessed this event, please contact either Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle at 206-722-3000, the Oregon UFO Research Hotline at 503-463-1467, or the Salem Police Department.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OUFOR would like to thank the Salem Police Department as well as Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle for passing on this sighting to us for investigation and for his continued cooperation in helping get to the bottom of UFO sightings Nationwide. You can hear Peter speak of other cases as he appears monthly on the Jeff Rense radio show.

Observed bright light traveling roughly northwest to northeast from our location (approximately 36.317N, 119.204W).  Light was about 30 degrees above the horizon.  The light was traveling very fast.  The light faded in and out similar to an Iridium satellite, but much faster and not as high in elevation.  Also, we have never seen an Iridium traveling in this direction.  When the light faded, there were no marker lights visible.  It was very dim when it faded, but still barely visible.  Before we went out to stargaze, I printed out a list of satellites from the Heavens Above website.  Using the flashlight, I looked on the list for something of a similar brightness, time and direction.  The brightness was matched for ISS, but it was in the south.  The next would have been the Shenzhou III, but we saw it several minutes later; the altitude was much higher (59 degrees) compared to the earlier light.  The light appeared to be at an elevation similar to a jet, but did not make any sound.  We are close to several flight paths, primarily Fresno (FAT) and Lemoore Naval Air Station.  After the light disappeared, I looked around for any planes; saw what appeared to be a jet to the northwest that was at a much higher elevation and farther away and I could hear jet noise.  We are familiar with the local air traffic, satellites and meteors; this did not appear to be any of those.  Weather was clear, temperature probably close to 70 degrees or a little above.  No breeze noted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are always grateful to receive such an excellent report, as this one appears to us to be.  PD))<n>

This event was witnessed by my sixteen year old son and my 14 year old daughter as well. I am a retired police officer who is not given to flights of fancy, so it is with careful thought that I bring this event to your attention. We were traveling west on Colorado 36, approximately four miles west of Last Chance, Co. when my son first noticed the object to the north of the hiway above a pasture. At first I thought it must be an aircraft either enroute to or departing Denver International Airport, approximately seventy miles to the west of our position. However, as I began to watch the object I could tell that it was not moving and that the distance between  it and my vehicle was closing as I approached it. In about five minutes I was parallel to the object which was over a pasture approximately three hundred yards from the hiway. I stopped the car on the shoulder of the road to get a better look at the object, still thinking that there was an explanation such as weather balloon, helicopter, etc. It soon became apparent to me that it was not a balloon, as it was absolutely unmoving in a breeze that would have easily moved an inflated object (10 to 15 m.p.h. out of the northeast). It also was not a rotor craft. The object appeared to be slightly oval shape, with a &#34;dull&#34; metallic look to it. I turned the engine of the car off and there was absolutley no sound from the object. This is a very sparse farming and ranching community with very little traffic of noise pollution of any kind. The slight wind was in the direction to have brought any sound toward my vehicle. The object appeared to be 25 to 30 feet in diameter and close to 10 feet thick at it&#39;s midsection. There were cattle grazing in the pasture, not directly under the object, but only 100 yards or so to the east. They seemed to be completly unaware of it&#39;s presence. It was dusk and getting darker as we ! watched the object, still trying to decide what it might be. Another vehicle approached from the east and slowed as it passed us, an elderly couple who were obviously looking at the same thing we were. The vehicle declined to stop, but rather accelerated and proceeded west. My daughter began to get a little upset and asked if we could leave. I could tell she was frightened and when I looked to the back seat, she was looking away, choosing not to even look at it anymore. As I told her we were leaving, the object illuminated, again without a sound. I don&#39;t mean some lights came on around the perimiter or flood lights. I mean the entire object itself &#34;glowed&#34; an orange-red color. Even though there was no sound that I could hear, when the object lit up, the cattle suddenly bolted, all at once, in different directions. I&#39;ve seen cattle shy from noise or threat before and they all turn  to run from the percieved threat. These cattle were running into each other like they had no idea which way to go. At this point, I became concerned for our safety. I don&#39;t know why, the vehicle never moved or did anything of a threatening nature, I simply was afraid for my children and myself. The vehicle started without hesitation and I left heading west again towards Denver. My daughter was now crying and my son&#39;s initial excitement had also been replaced with a quiet uneasiness. I continued to watch the object as best I could as we left, but it was dark enough now to make it hard to see. The illumination had only lasted for maybe 2 or 3 seconds. My son caugh the last glimpse of the object as we crested a hill. It appeared to be in the same place as it had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After talking with my wife and a few close friends, I decided to keep quiet about the sighting. I now regret that decision because it may have ben easier to find out who else migh have seen this if I had come forward earlier. In my profession people tend to discredit these types of subjects, as well as the individual making the report. If you have recieved any information regarding the incident my children an I had that evening, would you please advise me?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found him to be serious-minded and credible.

Then it came back in a different part a in a blink of an eye. it also had little red a blue lights on the sky.  but im sure it wasnt a plane or hellicopter because it was so high up with such a huge size for the altitude.<n>

At first I thought it was an aircraft but realized it was moving much too fast.  It moved from South to North.  I had an unobstructed view of the sky.  The light suddenly appeared and traveled downward at about a 30 degree angle to the horizontal until it disappeared at my horizon line but in front of the backdrop of the Sierra&#39;s.  It traveled in a straight line.  There were no red/green/white marker lights to be seen.  Had it been a meteor, it appeared to be headed for Auburn.  As I drove through the area, there was no emergency vehicle activity to be seen.  There are no airports in the area that could accomidate a plane that was this fast.  There was no &#34;tail&#34; indicating atmospheric ablating of material as should be seen from a meteor this low in the atmosphere.  After returning home at 19:20 I checked off my back deck for any signs of fire or other activity.  There were none.  From my back deck I can see about 50,000 acres of the Sierra Foothills along with the entire North Sacramento Valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an engineer, amateur radio operator and pilot.<n>

I had just come home from work.  I just stepped out of my car when I saw it just below and to the right of the moon.  It was traveling very quickily, with no sound, in a westerly direction.   My first impression was that this was a piece of space junk re-entering the atmosphere.  However it was by far the largest object that I have ever seen of this type, meaning such as meteors.  It appeared to be about one twentieth the size of the full moon and brighter.  The leading edge seemed to be a greenish color.  I had limited view of the object due to my house.<n>

We live on a river bank and the object was flying quite high.  Aircraft come in all the time as we are quite close to the airport.  The ufo wasn&#39;t going in the normal directions every single other plane does.  It was going in either a North or North East direction and was very very fast!  I tried my best to reason out what this thing exactly was.  I checked for reflections in the window, and there wasn&#39;t any lightening.  The craft didn&#39;t appear all of the time, but it looked like a strobe light moving across the sky.  The strobing pattern was sequenced, so that rules out any natural occurances in nature.  The light itself was white.  Its flight path was perfectly straight, but accelerated upward at times.  (Also, it went behind some buildings)  The flight path was very linear!  The very next day my father head a ufo report on the radio, but this one was in Phoenix, described the exact same way as my sighting.<n>

As we were pulling into our driveway, I noticed a low flying object which I assumed was an aeroplane. I remarked that it was flying quite low.  I pointed it out to my husband and as we both took more notice of it, we realised it was not an aeroplane, but was a single cone shaped object with bright red and yellow flasing lights around the base.  It was moving quite fast and then stopped and hovered in the sky.  It then disappeared out of view behind houses in the distance.  I ran down the road to see if I could find it again but it had gone.  It was a very clear starry night with a full bright moon.  This is the first time we have reported an unusual sighting such as this but felt we wanted to share our experience in case anyone else saw it too.<n>

As I looked up at the contrail from my outdoor work,  I noticed  a very bright object off to the right of the contrail at a due South location about 35 degrees up.  I could see that it was a solid white object gleaming in the bright sunlight.  It was not moving and was at very high altititude.  It varied slightly in its brilliance, as if wobbling slightly toward a duller surface.  I pointed it out to a co-worker who looked at it briefly.  I watched it off an on for 5 minutes.  Then it began to move slowly in a flat trajectory and after travelling the length of a finger held out faded away.  So it could not have been Venus and seems it could not have been a balloon as it remained steady for 5 minutes before leaving slowly. A brief sound of motors could be heard somewhat like a jet helicopter just before its movement but I can&#39;t be sure it came from that object.  I sure wanted binoculars at that point but only had a keen naked eye observation.  At times the edge of the extreme object seemed to have a slight reddish glow.<n>

I walked off the porch to get a better look because it was traveling so fast, which seemed strange.  It seemed to be two or three miles to the west, and still heading west very quickly.  Then it appeared to stop completely.  A couple of seconds later it very quickly accelerated upward and to the north, and was gone.<n>

This was about 8:47.  When I continued to look at it, it changed shapes again and I little kind of another alien ship came out of the bigger alien ship.  They were, what it looked like to me firing at each other.  I say this because they continued to shoot beams at each other.  My kids were frightfully scared because they saw the beams hit the ground and they thought they were going to get hit.   These six minutes seemed to last a life time.  They seemed like they were there for more like thirty minutes.  After they were done fighting they crashed into each other and as they fell from the sky the alien ships seemed to disintegrate into thin air.As the alien ships were falling from the air they made a distinct high pitch ringing noise that was one of the loudest sounds I have ever heard in my life.  After this was all over I looked up into the sky, it was very dark outside.  When this ended it was about 8:53.  There was a kind of streak that was looked to be left from the descending alien ships.  It almost looked like a river of dust into the sky that seemed to have evaporated into the atmosphere.<n>

It finally dipped below the treeline out of sight.  My elevation was approximately 420 ft above sea level, and the hills occluding the object were higher elevation than myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its movement was odd--varying in direction and speed.

This ocurred before 2002,but do not know exactly. I live about 10-15 miles south of the Colorado Springs Airport,and Peterson AFB. As I watched airplanes flying south towards me,I noticed a large balloon like object that was silver/black in color. It was very large,and seemed not to move up,but over time became lower in horizon,as it seemed to move north.As I was watching this I looked to the northwest and saw a dark object that at first thought was a B-2 Stealth bomber,but I noticed that this chevron had no broken lines as does the B-2.At arms length it was about 2 inches and the balloon shape was also about 2 inches yet balloon was further north.Planes still were taking off and none of them were as large.The airline&#39;rs were closer to me than the balloon was.The chevron looked as tho it was going to land,but I lost sight of it,as I returned my focus on the balloon object.As I watched I seemed to have just turned and walked back into my house.Also as I was watching I called a friend and was relaying what I was seeing on their answer machine.I had enough time to take pictures,but,the thought of doing so never came to mind,even tho I was looking through binoc. as well as visual.The approx. measurements were by naked eye. I heard of a sighting of a sphere shape object around Denver where the sphere followed cars. Tho photo taken by witness was smaller than what I had seen,but color was much the same as well as shape. I haved lived here for about 19 years and have seen more than my share of sightings,where it is almost a common thing. Daylight stars,stars disapering,formations of objects.And many things that are of question. None of things seen are military craft known to public.Colorado Springs is a very heavy packed with military. Norad,Air Force Academy,Peterson AFB. Fort Carson. My location is something I enjoy. I live close to Fort Carson and have an eye level view of Norad.I can see up to the the Academy. Glad I found your site,now I can rest cause I got this off my chest. A thought I had on day of sighting of balloon/chevron I thouht many people would see these as it was early and peolpe going to work.No news on it.The photo of the object in Denver was about same day as mine,I think Mufon of Colorado has the photo.Keep looking up,an around for it will keep you wondering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

But I just read one or two events at www.nuforc.org/ that talk about going up in the sky so I&#39;ll repeat what happened to me here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a strange night a strange weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at a busy event and I was being attacked psychically by a &#34;friend&#34; while at this event.  There&#39;s a lot of detail around that but it just distorts the event of going into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday night was very strange.  The strangest night of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my hotel room with a magazine, painting my nails, watching tv, listening to the radio and smoking a cigarette.  Unwinding after a day of being a vendor to a large crowd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A small form about the size of the &#34;friend&#34; I was meeting at this event appeared in my room.  It stood at the left foot of the bed.  It was invisible but I could see it somehow - the outline of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t afraid.  I was passive.  A correct reaction would be to get the blankety-blank thing out of my room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instead I kept on doing what I was doing, sometimes looking over at the thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to bed with that thing still standing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was aware that it was creepy to go to sleep with that thing watching me. But that&#39;s what I did.  I went to sleep.  Immediately.  But  I really wasn&#39;t sleeping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right away, I was with my &#34;friend&#34; in a cave with a fire. That &#34;friend&#34; was doing something with the fire, it was somehow negative to me.  I didn&#39;t really know why I was down there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something intervened.  I flew into the clouds in the thunderstorm right above this hotel i was staying at.  I remember passing through.  And there was an allowance to let me through the thunderstorm. It was their given protection to let me through.  I remember seeing the whirling clouds up close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I hurled out to space.  Sometimes we were in a spaceship, sometimes not.  They really didn&#39;t let me see them.  I was aware that one was male and one was female.  There were more at times.  We were inside the spaceship looking out or actually out in whatever environment we were in.  It was all very natural, very comfortable.  I loved them, they loved me.  it&#39;s like we knew each other all my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not my grandparents come to meet me.  They were something else from up there, way up there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They took me all over the place.  It was fun and marvelous.  I let myself forget alot because it was too much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember going to this giant, golden lit building.  It was huge.  It was like giants lived there.  I was facing a giant door.  I looked left and right down these giant empty hallways.  I was unafraid.  They were with me.

I understood that if i prayed, i could get through the giant doors I was standing in front of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i closed my eyes and prayed.  i prayed so hard i put myself in a trance.  i became a white light radiating love energy.  there was another white light with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i stayed in this state of being in a trance and being a white light for both nights - friday and saturday - all night in my &#34;sleep&#34;.    They brought me up there so I would be safe from the attack happening to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was weird waking up each morning.  i would wake directly from being a white light.  as soon as i woke up, i was wide awake and i would think &#34;how can i be this wide awake since I&#39;ve just been up all night?&#34;  on sunday night in my hotel room, i was afraid to sleep because i didn&#39;t understand what had happened the two nights before.  i understood that with my &#34;friend&#34; gone, i was safe.  but still i refused to sleep and finally slept at daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i had a difficult reaction from the attack and from what i seen out there when i was up in the universe.  i had more than panoramic vision, it was like all around my head vision at certain points.  i couldn&#39;t look at the sky for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i was constantly dreaming about the sky.  one time i dreamt i was showing the sky my artwork.  i was in utter blackness in deep space.  they really liked my artwork.  it  didn&#39;t feel like a dream, it is a memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> then i realized i was putting my self in a trance in my sleep as i had the sensation of rocking back and forth in spirit form.  praying and rocking can induce trance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> they let me know when they are overhead.  i get a really strong sensation from them. it&#39;s really nice.  they really like me.  one time, something came really strong but i told them i was afraid so they stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it really changed me, this experience.  i am alot more psychic, i always have been but now i tend to have psychic experiences with others more often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> someone seen me walking, running around while my body slept (at the same time, i was dreaming i was doing exactly what they seen me doing),  i seen a ufo with my dad a few years later, me and my dog seen a small lighted circle in the yard last year, we also heard a dog bark in the small room we were in where there was no other dog and then this year in may i seen a big green line in the sky created by something traveling north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.

Object was in the north/ northeast direction at app. 50 degrees off the horizon. After app. 5 minutes of viewing time, the object moved east and was out of sight.

At first, it was silver, but a few seconds later, it was creamish colored and kinda blurry around it.  Then the jet stream disappeared and the object floated and then floated back across the sky to my left.  I was watching it for about five minutes because I was late for meeting with my mother and I was able to take three pictures of it, but they are not developed yet.  There was also an airplane (100% sure) in the sky way above it also.<n>

There was also a large blinking light in the center that was much brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it was, and don&#39;t even know if it was a &#34;real UFO,&#34; though it is certainly unidentified to me. Doesn&#39;t make sense to me that a UFO would have blinking light in the center. Also, since it was night, I am not certain whether it was a smaller object closer by, or a huge object at a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If other people near Nashville have reported a similar thing, then my report would further support theirs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear ((deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for the excellent report!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what the object you witnessed could have been.

And I know it was not any celestial body or aurora borealis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not stop the vehicle and look...I was looking through the windshield, but the windshield was not obscuring or altering my view. I was not looking through a crack or dirty area. Moreover, as I passed, I got the same view of the object through my driver&#39;s side window as through the windshield. I tried to turn around, but I was on the interstate and couldn&#39;t turn around for like five or ten miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feel free to post my sighting. The University of Tennesee has a Space Institute somewhere near there, so who knows, maybe it was an experimental aircraft. There were other people driving on the interstate that evening, I was hoping there had been other reports, and that someone would have more visual detail on the thing than I did.

The strangest part about this was the fact that the toghether formed this----------------------&gt;(  _  _  ),parallel line on a perfect diagonal. while they are in formation 30 seconds goes by and then these lines desintagrate back into orange lights and continue on their paths without colliding, though getting EXTREMELY close to hitting each other.

When me, my friend, mother, and girlfriend were on the way back from picking up my girlfriend.  My mother and I noticed a small white/yellow, tear drop shaped object turned on its side. At first it was thought to be an air plain.  As we continued back to my house we noticed that the same object was moving and then it would stop in mid-air.  It would move and hover for a few seconds then move agian.  We considered it a helicopter until we turned the car around to take a better look it as it darted away faster.  We decided to follow the object and as we moved closer the object darted even faster.  Then the object darted off passing over a forest area, beyond the Hamilton escarpment.  Then the object was now out of eye sight.  We got out of the car to see if we could find where it had gone, but we had no luck.  This all occured within 10 minutes and by this time we started to drive home and noticed a helicopter with blinking red(front) and blue(back) lights.  We belived it was a police helicopter when we saw it heading toward where we last saw the object dart from our sight.<n>

As we were driving home 2 distinct flying objects crossed the highway at a very low altitide.  The radiant light from each object was such that a definite shape could not be made out.  I estimate the altitude from the bottom of the light source to the ground was no more that 500 feet.  The criss crossed the road 3 times before shooting straight up and out of site.  Aprox 1 min later they returned flying straing along the road behind us, over flying my vehicle with NO sound and once agin criss crossing the road several times before leaving the area.  I do not know honestly if they were terrestial objects or what.

(I am unsure of exact date, time, and duration.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband &amp; I heard the following, on the police scanner we have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Officers from the &#34;Sherman Police Department&#34; (Sherman, TX.) were dispatched to a neighborhood, because their were sightings of something &#34;strange&#34; in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One officer said, &#34;Does this sound for real?&#34; Someone (I think the dispatcher) said, &#34;That neighborhood is a very good neighborhood.  Those people wouldn&#39;t be calling if there wasn&#39;t something there.&#34;  (She said it was the &#34;(?something) HILLS&#34; addition.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard the responses of the officers as they arrived. They were VERY excited and a female officer said, &#34;My GOD !!! What IS that thing.  I have never seen anything like this before in my life. It&#39;s moving just above the power lines.&#34;  The officers were then talking back and forth (I guess to the dispatcher.)  Then, a man came on and said in a very quick, firm voice, &#34;Cease talking NOW!!!!!!&#34; Everything went quiet.  (We think they may have gone to a different frequency or something, so they couldn&#39;t be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> `````````` Shortly after filing the above report, I remembered that the name of the addition that the police dispatcher stated over the police scanner was:  a word that was a &#34;directional&#34; name.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i.e., the first word, before HILLS addition&#34; was (either, Western, Northern, Southern, Eastern)  There is a &#34;WESTERN HILLS addition&#34; in Sherman.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (As far as I am aware, and have been able to find, there is NO, Northern Hills addition, Southern Hills addition, or Eastern Hills addition.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And, being a local (I live in Denison, which is right next to Sherman.  I was born and raised in Denison, and I am (about) 55 years old.  So in other words, I have been a local for a very long time and I am very familiar with the street names and addition (subdivision) names, of Sherman, as well.)  I am quite certain that the name the police stated was: &#34;WESTERN HILLS addition&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (It is also worth noting that, she said: &#34;That is a very nice neighborhood.&#34;)  &#34;WESTERN HILLS addition&#34;, (which is, west, of downtown) is the &#34;newer&#34; addition, in Sherman.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (The other areas in Sherman, areas in the north, south, east , these areas are close to the downtown area, and they are the &#34;older&#34; part of Sherman.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (That is where the &#34;older&#34; homes are.)  &#34;WESTERN HILLS addition&#34; (The homes are newer in that area, and, having gone down some of the roads in that area before, I am aware that some of the paved streets in that housing addition, are &#34;hilly&#34;.)  I am quite certain (actually, very certain), that the sighting(s) occurred at the  &#34;WESTERN HILLS addition&#34;  (The reason I did not catch the &#34;first&#34; word she stated is:  I was not expecting to hear a report regarding, &#34;something &#34;strange&#34; in the air being seen by people living in the neighborhood.&#34;  (Had I known, that was what I was &#34;about&#34; to hear, I&#39;m sure I would have paid more attention to what the &#34;first&#34; word was, that the police dispatcher stated.)  But I did recall, that the first word she called the subdivision was, the same word as a, &#34;directional&#34; name.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (western, or northern, or eastern, or southern)  As far as I am aware, there isn&#39;t even another addition(subdivision) in Sherman, that even has word, &#34;HILLS&#34; in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Except for: &#34;WESTERN HILLS addition&#34;  1. I know for a fact that the police dispatcher stated, &#34;(something) HILLS addition&#34;  2. I later recalled that the first word she stated was, the same as a &#34;directional&#34; name.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (So, was either: Western, Eastern, Southern, Northern)  (I have never heard of a eastern hills addition, southern hills addition, northern hills addition, in Sherman.)  But I have heard of (and am familiar where the area is), of: &#34;WESTERN HILLS addition&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. Police dispatcher stated: That the &#34;(something) HILLS addition&#34;,  &#34;is a nice neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Those people wouldn&#39;t be saying there was something there, if there wasn&#39;t.&#34;  &#34;WESTERN HILLS addition&#34;, are newer built homes (than in the other areas of Sherman, the older parts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eastern, northern, southern parts of the city.)  Everything points to: Where the sighting(s) occurred at was:  &#34;WESTERN HILLS addition&#34;  (Like I said, I am familiar with the different parts of Sherman.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what the houses look like in that area, but to give you an estimate of what the houses go for over there, on a realty site, it lists some for 173,000; 200,000(something); etc.)  It is a, &#34;nice neighborhood&#34; (phrase the police dispatcher used, in her statements over the police radio.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The object was traveling at high speed from the south heading north then made a sharp turn upward and disappeared (yikes). The way it disappeared was really the strange part it was like the thing hit hyper drive, traveled what looked like a  short distance upward (not 90 deg more like 75deg) and it was gone.<n>

These objects were very bright, and would flicker like a candle from very bright to going completely out.  The objects would once again appear in another ( fairly close) area, in a different pattern.  At one time ,there were four objects lined evenly spaced in a horizontal pattern.  Later, it looked as though (to me) that 3 of the objects were close together (3 orbs in a packed triangle pattern) and that is when I saw them the brightest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ( myself, staff members/various guests) have seen these lights for the past couple of weeks, mostly in the same area...from behind squaw peak/west.  There are at least two, but sometimes more.  They seem amber in color, and once they light up..they do not move until they fade out and then they reappear. They are VERY bright in contast to the plethera of air traffic that we see going into sky harbor and Scottsdale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, one night last week, an employee, myself, and a couple of guests saw a red orb move across the sky as though on a wave, like a boat would move on a lake, gently rocking up and down.  It came from the south west, cut in front of us about 5 miles, and went behind the Mcdowell mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up on line the phoenix ufo sight ( I can&#39;t remember the name ) and sent a letter to Jeff Rense...Rense.com to see if anyone else is seeing these lights. I am just interested in what they could be. I KNOW that alot of people see them because guest ask me about them and point them out to me.  ( Seen between 7:30 and 11:00) and I did not see any tonight 3/22/02.<n>

It appeared to be a sphere, that was switching from a silver to dark green color, and once in awhile reddish.  A co-worker then spotted several others.  The main one headed west, then back east.  All of them appeared to hover in place for several seconds, Then went up through the clouds out of sight.  They moved in very straight lines.<n>

We were traveling East on the 10 (San Bernardino) freeway.  The large triangular lights themselves formed a large triangular pattern.  They were very bright and quite large.  They were not planes and the sun was up already.  I remarked about how odd the sighting was.  She confirmed how strange it was. We both travel to Ontario airport often and had never seen anything like this. After about 7 or 8 minutes we exited the freeway into the airport and I ran to catch my plane.<n>

The object was flying very fast. Much faster than any plane at this altitude and it didn&#39;t make any sound at all. I guess the object was about 500 hundred feet above ground level. Although I saw it just for about 2 sec. I can tell for sure that I have never seen such a thing before in my life. I am absolutely sure that it was not a airplane, altough there is much air traffic in this area. The object had a similar shape like a comet when entering the atmosphere, but it flew too low and it was too big to be considered as a comet.<n>

The other two people present had not seen it as their backs were turned away from the object.  The intensly bright green-white object flew at a slight arc from the North to the South and faded as if going into a cloud or fog bank (we&#39;re on the California coast).  The object left a slight trail similar to one you might see during a meteor shower.  The object was much too large to be an airplane light or distant falling star.  The object was about the same size of a streetlight at night that would be about two city blocks away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The green and white colors blended together yet were intensely bright.  Imagine, if you will, an electric lettuce leaf - that kind of blended coloring.  The green coloring was brightest toward the outside of the object (outlined).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed of the object was very fast, much too fast for an airplane.  My friend immediately mentioned the &#34;lack of sound&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coincidentally (?), an earthquake occurred three hours later with the epicenter being here in Pacifica, California.<n>

When my partnber awoke I got out of bed to take a look outside but by then the noise had diminshed considerable and no signb of it.<n>

I have seen falling stars before - i spent 4 hours watching the leonids last year, but  never did i see something that looked this big and was this sharp.  it was just so uncharacteristic, it&#39;s visual appearance was like a flare, but there was no way it could have been one the way it moved.  It appeared in the southeastern sky from our position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates a date in 2001, but we believe he meant 2002, based on our telephone conversation with him.

They were constantly changing colors and &#34;jumping&#34; around in the sky and making a low droning saoud suckh as that of a muffles vacuum cleaner.Attempting to catch thes objects, were what appeared to be millitary style fighting jets. The objects flashed colors such as green, yellow, red, and blue. When we all stopped riding in circles so did the objects in the sky. After about 20 seconds the spheres turned a crimson red color and then jetted away at an incredible speed. The bjects left a trail that was visible for about 2 minutes. These trails had the shine of somthing that had a color of mother of pearl. And then it was gone.

We stepped out of the car and heard this noise that was like a plane and a helicopter at the same time.we lookeed up and saw an odd light formation (three white lights formed in a triangle and a darker red one in the center)and, assuming it was a weird new plane went one.  On our way up to my front porch my friend stopped me and we both looked up to see the &#34;plane&#34; go straight up in the air, rotate in the circle using the red light as the axis.  Then it zoomed across the sky way faster than any plane or helicopter could go and slowed down as it went across the moon.  It slowed down enough for us to make out its shape wich was a triangle with the white lights in each corner and the red in the dead center.  I&#39;ve heard of similar events happening in belgium but this is still really weird and I&#39;m still pretty freaked outâ€¦<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Regrettably, the witness remains totally anonymous, and does not indicate the city in Texas where the alleged sighting took place.

I work near this valet associate. We speak every day as I make office transactions. I encouraged him to get a video camera because he&#39;s outside all day and would catch something on video in the clear daytime sky. Yes he got something on tape. I viewed it and made copies. He said that he was just looking around the blue sky and boom there was a giant cylinder tube like object. It appeared greenish, then completely white. He focused on the daytime moon and panned over to the object. He said the object was small and stretched out like a giant straw. The object moved slowly changing shape and position. It later faded. As he shot the footage, he date and time stamped it. I have copies.<n>

He caught a cylinder shaped tube like object hight in the sky. The object made turns and emiied some kind of green energy or color on half of it. The object was completely white in color.

3/18/02 03:00|Edison|NJ|Flash||In mid night, flashing big yellow white lights soared past my window  but then my neighbor claims to have seen it too.|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44608.html|79|ndxe200203| In mid night, flashing big yellow white lights soared past my window  but then my neighbor claims to have seen it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was late at night perhaps in the morning around 3 am, when all of a sudden I started to feel a little light headed and distracted. I woke up from a deep sleep and saw that my sister was still sleeping pretty comfortably besides me. Like always my window blades were open and I remember that I could see the townhouses that were across my street very clearly. Then all of a sudden a flash of light, as big as my window, maybe a little smaller was right outside of it. It was so bright and I started to try to tell my older sister but she was still in a deep sleep. The lights were so bright and white and yellow. I went running up to my big window, not knowing wether my eyes played a trick on me or it was for real. By the time I was up to my window, the flash of lights or the oval or disk or whatever it was, was gone. I think it was in a disk or oval formation. The scary part of this event was that the next morning when I was heading to my bustop for school, my nieghbor, who usually walks with me to the bustop, said that when she was getting a glass of water in the middle of the night, she noticed wierd lights through her skylight window, and then she went and opened her front door and she saw a disk shaped object or something, then it dissapeared. She claimed that to me without me even mentioning the story to her before she told me. So the question is, is this a coincidence of both of us having a dream,but then how do you describe my nieghbor telling the same story I witnessed or did we both witness it for real???<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Having just crossed San Jose city limits to the South (the area that is still undeveloped, just hills and fields along the 101), I saw a flash in the sky that caught my attention, proceeding from the West (to the left of the highway) to the east (to the right of the highway) ahead of me. It was like a shooting star, but much longer and lower than other meteros I have seen, which generally flash for a second high in the sky and then are gone. This one seemed low, like a plane approaching landing, and lasted maybe 10 seconds total, leaving a luminous trail as it went (again, like a shooting star, but lasting much longer). It was gone without any sound, or explosion. I found myself cringing as it passed, it had seemed so low I thought it might hit the hills near the freeway.<n>

Since we were looking through our car windshield, our angular vision to altitude was restricted to aproximately 45Â°.  It&#39;s path appeared near horizontal with only a slight decrease in altitude.  The fireball first appeared almost white and as it streaked lower into the atmosphere, it&#39;s color quickly became more greenish in color.  It appeared to &#34;burn out&#34; over Seattle.  I noticed a very faint smoke trail behind it as it streaked across the sky.  It&#39;s altitude in appearance when it burned out was equal to that of incoming aircraft to SEATAC.  Fortunately no aircraft were in it&#39;s vicinity when it burned out.  The apparent size of the fireball was approximately 1/8 that of a full moon or more specifically about double that of the brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere, which is Sirius.<n>

This is my 2nd sighting.  I was driving north on 15th N.E. and 175th St.  I was stopped at the light on 175th St.  I very quickly observed in the sky directly in front of me an elliptical shaped, very bright object that went from one point downward at about a 40 degree angle and then out of sight.  I first thought it was a meteor but it seemed to be very bright and it wasn&#39;t very dark out yet. It went down from the right to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is correct in her description of events.  Many other reports for the fireball seen on this St. Patrick&#39;s Day.

Sky was cloudy and it was snowing off and on. The light remained in a fixed position for approximately 10-15 mins and then slowly began to drift in a northly direction. The brightness of the light remained the same throughout the sighting until it just vanished. It must be noted that the drift was at a extreme slow pace. I was a law enforcement officer for 14 years and for the past 10 years have been a boiler plant operator and work shifts, which has afforded me the opportunity to observe the night sky at all different times of the night. In my company at the time of the sighting was a federal law enforcement officer and both of us agree that it was to cloudy to be a star. It must be noted that Walla Walla is a small community and although there are occasions for airplane traffic in this area, there were no scheduled flights for this time of night.<n>

She said it was too high off the road to be headlights and too low to be an aircraft.  As I was the passenger I took a look behind the van and observed this egg shaped light that wasn&#39;t bright like headlights and not glowing either.  The object appeared about a mile behind our van and hovering something like 40&#39; (?) above the roadway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it behind us for what seemed like a couple of minutes.  I cannot report what happend next.  The trip seemed to simply &#34;resume&#34; and neither of us spoke about the object again.  Upon our return home we noticed the clock - we were about an hour and 15 to 20 minutes later than we should have been - having made the trip many times, we know exactly how long it takes.  We wondered about the object and its relationship to the missing time, but dismissed the entire event and went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;re reporting this now because we&#39;d like to simply forget that night; but you can&#39;t forget something you can&#39;t remember?  What we do know is that since that evening, when we pass that exact area late on a Sunday night conversation ends and we both get quiet.  Its an odd feeling to sense something happened but the harder you try to remember the more something inside insists you don&#39;t???  Anything beyond this right now would be simple speculation.  We&#39;ve never believed in this stuff, although we&#39;ve thought that UFO&#39;s were likely and had to be something - but this event remains and continues to bother us both.  Wish we could tell you why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain of the date.  The witness indicates a date in 1902, which is not his intention, we suspect.  PD))<n>

After watching it a few seconds, I noticed another similar object trailing it. The second object began behaving erratically, (closing in, moving next to, dropping back). I noticed a commercial airliner on it&#39;s normal flight path moving south. These two objects appeared as if they were moving towards the airliner. Then they suddenly banked hard to the northwest changed direction suddenly and where back in front of the plane at a higher elevation. Then I called to my girlfriend to come see, just as she was getting there, multiple objects started appearing. When we lost track of them we suddenly noticed more than 20. They seemed to form a vertical circle or ball, then moved into a formation and proceeded south along the coast. During the formation or ball we called our neighbors out to see. They witnessed this as well as the formation which moved to the south. The whole event lasted approximately 45 seconds to one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 45 minutes later I spotted about 15 of these objects in a semi-circlar formation moving north. This time I called my girlfriend and 13 year old daughter who did not witness the first event to come see. We watched them for approximately 15 seconds move to the northwest and disappear rapidly. This time they appeared to be lower and further inland, which put them almost directly over-head. This formation  passed over without a sound.<n>

We were sitting in a room in my house where the ceiling is completely made of glass windows, so we could see the night sky from inside. We were talking when all of a sudden we heard an incredibly loud roaring/shrieking sound, and as it grew louder, a &#34;V&#34; shaped craft, with lights lining its border, zipped right over the house! The sound grew quiet just in time for another one, followed soon after by another one. These 3 UFOs all flew over within one minute of each other. They all were black, quick, and had dotted lights along the edges of their &#34;V&#34; shape. We both told ourselves that the 1st one was an airplane, but by the time the 3rd one came around, it was quite obvious that these were UFOs. They took only about 20 seconds to cross from east to west over the sky.<n>

As I was concenrating on a small cloud an object suddenly &#34;shot&#34; out of it traveling on a northern heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;craft&#34; or thing was roughly teardrop shape. It made no noise,(aircraft I have view from this apparent distance can usually be heard,). The craft had a steady speed and I estimate it&#39;s speed, (from my experience is Close Air Support practice while serving in the Marine elite ANGLICO unit), to be in the vicinity of 800 to 1200 miles an hour. It moved much faster than any airliner I have ever seen from that distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object itself was translucent and had a pinkish center and ruby &#34;outer skin&#34;. It also had greyish black spots inside it&#39;s &#34;skin&#34; that seemed to move as it flew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object left a light contrail that was smooth and even. The contrail quickly disipated behind the &#34;craft&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the object with my eye until it reach a larger group of clouds. As it approached the larger group of clouds the crispness of it&#39;s edges began to break up in my vision and soon I lost sight of it completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the sense that this was something organic and alive. I can speculate that this was some sort of &#34;plasma&#34; creature that traditional science hasn&#39;t discovered.<n>

No moon. Horizontal distance to object about 250-300 feet. Vertical distance from ground about 50 feet. Estimated size of object was about 15 feet (diameter). Shape was like oval but hard to detect exactly as was so bright. Object was shining brite white color light, brighter than moon normally. The light beam was seen from the object straight down toward ground. Object did not move or it moved straight away from us so that movement was not seen. Object was seen about 40 seconds from first detecting. After that light beam disappeared, the light emitted by the object started to get less bright and after about 30 seconds there was no object anymore but instead the small light emitting cloud which was spreading as a function of time and after 1 more minute was hard to see anymore. The whole process was taken to video tape by my 15 years old son.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We would very much like to view the alleged video footage, but the witness elects to remain anonymous, and provides no contact information.

Maybe a little to the right.  At first we assumed it was a star but not until it started to appear brighter and brighter.  Then it casted a beam (like a huge spotlight) at first straight ahead then it slowly beamed downward.  As the light slowly disappeared what seemed to be clouds started taking shape.  The light was completely gone and the clouds started to fade very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I had pulled over hoping someone had witnessed what we just saw unfortunately we were the only ones on the road.  We were hoping someone other than in our vicinity had witnessed this event.  We had never seen anything like it before. I mean it couldn&#39;t have been an aircraft of any kind much less a missil.  What kind of aircraft or missile would make a very bright light?

We saw it come from behind a mountain, and it flew upwards in a straight line. It got very bright and there was an oval halo around it, kind of a vapor trail. We thought it was either a rocket or a flare, but we couldn&#39;t see any defining characteristics. It was just a very bright light. It stayed bright as it ascended, and then it disappeared. As the sun was below the horizon, the sky wasn&#39;t very bright, but the smoke trail glowed for a really long time after the light vanished. It could have been anything, there are military installations around there somewhere, so it could have been a plane or missle. But, it also could have been Alien Grays. Who knows? There were three of us in the car. We all saw it. We are all in our early 20&#39;s and pretty cynical, but it freaked us all out.<n>

It had what looked like fog all around it with a light aiming toward the ground.  Suddenly it looked like it was getting covered with a big cloud of fog, then the fog began to clear and the light was completely gone.  The light didn&#39;t go off in any direction.  It seemed to vaporize.  Then the fog cloud disappeared.  If there was any sound we were too far away to hear it.<n>

For anyone who might live in Lehi and know where I was talking about, I made a right hand turn after crossing the tracks, not a left.  Here is my description again...<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was traveling west on a county road in SW Lehi, Utah, I had just crossed over some railroad tracks and turned right when I noticed this rather large, illuminated object that seemed to be hovering just over the rooftops and it was covered with lights with no true shape to it.  If I had to guestimate how many lights there were, I would say approximately 15-20.  And mixed in with the white lights were about 2-3 red ones, which were around the perimeter of the craft.  I was about 1/4 mile away from it and I would say it was traveling at a rate of about 25-30 mph because I pursued it, but it was staying the same distance from my car.  As it moved through the air, it left a rather thick, white trail which looked like either smoke, exhaust or steam.  It also seemed to rotate as it moved and the lights kept changing in brightness and position.  It made no noise either.  As a matter of fact, there were many other cars in pursuit of this thing as it made its way west.  Some cars had stopped where people had gotten out to watch it, while others stayed in their cars and pursued it (like me) for about 1-2 miles.  However, after about 10 minutes, it dipped behind a large home and suddenly just vanished without a trace.  It was truly one of the most amazing things I had ever witnessed.  I had no explanation for what I saw.  It was my second UFO experience actually because I had seen this same aircraft before a few weeks earlier, only it was a very brief sighting (maybe 10-20 seconds).  I should have called the local police to report an unidentified flying object, but didn&#39;t.  I was also amazed when no one else reported it, considering the number of people on the backroad who either got out of their cars to gaze at this thing or follow it.  Both times, I saw this thing coming home from work around 7:00 PM, and so it was dusk and rather difficult to make out its shape since it was getting dark.<n>

We were on the interstate and several cars were slamming on their brakes and swerving, obviously they were seeing what we were seeing.  As the sun continued to set and into the darkness we could see 5-9 lights that looked like they may be planets in a line above the horizon and below the cloud thing that would be in a straight line and then move to a triangular shape and back to a line.  We kept driving for a good hour and could see this phenomenon the whole way to the hoover dam.  It was obviously many miles away on the horizon but it didn&#39;t disappear until we got into the mountains around Hoover Dam.....Very strange...Don&#39;t know if anyone else has reported it but we would like to know what it was we saw that night!!!! I was with my mother.  Nobody believes us!<n>

I was driving home from work at about 6:30pm, heading south on San Thomas Expressway, when I noticed a thin white contrail in the south-bay sky (probably just over Los Gatos, CA). It was no ordinary contrail. First, it did not dissipate for over half an hour or longer. But most important, it was not in a straight line, but rather in extremely tight loops, zig-zags, and sharp angles. It looked like random scribbles in the sky. There&#39;s no way a conventional aircraft could produce this, and yet it was definitely artificial, and appeared to be at low altitude, I&#39;d guess less than 4000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am definitely not the only person to observe this phenomena. It was plainly visible in the sky, and must have been observed by atleast everyone heading south on San Thomas with me. I&#39;d love to hear from anyone in the south bay area who witnessed its formation.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello, I am a recent engineering graduate from USC. I  live near University of Southern California (USC).  I  witnessed a very strange object today on the skies of Los Angeles on the west horizon. It was a very bright object, a intensely and brightly glowing object, moving at nearly at the speed of fast low flying airplane. It was moving in an zig zag pattern and left a long trail(zig zag). This object suddenly disappeared in a fraction of second as if it dissolved into skies. This event took place, I mean I saw it at 6.25 pm 15th March 2002 for nearly 30 sec,it may have been visible for more time. I am sure it was not a air plane, or a missile or weather balloon or meteor, because all of this make a straight smoke trail and this object made zigzag trail. Other thing  which suggested that it was an unusual object was the way this object disappeared in a fraction of second. The trails of this object could be seen clearly till 6.55 pm, till it became too dark. This object was moving from North- north-west towards south and the trail could be seen starting from same directions. Other details: 1: Though it is difficult for me to tell you the exact altitude but I can explain you in relative terms. The point at which the object vanished from the skies (6.25PM), I could see the moon nearby rising at the same point (6.40PM).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Assuming that the object was directly above the sea shore, which is around 11miles straight from the place where I live and applying Pythagoras theorem the distance above the earth comes out to be 8.4 miles taking 35 degree angle and 6.9 miles above the  earth taking the angle as 30 degree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2: Taking West as the horizon the Angle of inclination of the object must be around 35 degrees at the point where it diminished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3: I was just adjacent to University of Southern California from where I graduated, at the gate  of my house. (Latitude = 34.020N Longitude = 118.29W approx.) I believe that the object must be above the pacific ocean or could be within the coast, but for sure not too much within the coast at the time it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4: At the time when I saw this object I was coming from the University, walking, after playing tennis there and when I saw this happen I was just infront of my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5: I didn&#39;t hear any kind of sound coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6: The color of the object was like very bright halogen lamp of some 10,000 Watts seen from a distance of 20 meter (bright yellow), and in the same way it illuminated the large part of the surface surrounding it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7: Yes there was one of my friend who witnessed the with me the things they happened.<n>

Over the mountains on the west side of town there was a like a lightning bolt shaped crack in the sky with light shining through.  There was a spot of light- for lack of a better word- that was flying around with a light that was shining down from it. It definitely wasn&#39;t a plane, helicopter or anything else. It was just a piece of light. After watching this for about 30seconds the light broke into 4 peices and then each of the 4 pieces broke into millions of pieces and then they all just evaporated into thin air.  We had to pull up to the drive through window at this point and our view of the mountains was blocked by the UMC quick care.  After we had received our order we looked back at the sky and the crack was gone. I know that this sounds crazy but we are not crazy in the head. My sister is in the service and I attend college and have a full time job as a vet tech. I&#39;m glad that she was there with me and saw the whole thing so at least we each have someone who believes us. I don&#39;t know if this has any relevance, but today happens to be the dark of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of the missile launch out of Vandenberg AFB.  PD))<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange jet-trail-like thing sighted over mountains<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 6:00 PM, I called my friend to let her know that I was probably going to be late to her house (I was supposed to come over). However, while I was on the phone, my friend was talking and talking about some strange thing in the sky, that she couldn&#39;t exactly describe very well. I wasn&#39;t so terrified of it, because I wasn&#39;t a believer at the time, and I&#39;m still sort of doubting the existence of aliens. Well, my friend was telling of an object that zoomed into the air from the mountains, zig-zagged, and finally disappeared, leaving a very prominent trail. As my friend said, there was a red circle surrounding it, but she wasn&#39;t able to describe the circle very well (like whether the circle appeared when the light disappeared, or how big the circle was...etc), so I&#39;m doubting the existence of the red circle in the event. Well, while I was still talking to her on the phone, actually on my cell phone and she on her cordless phone (while she was outside checking out the strange light), our connection began to get more and more static. After a few minutes, Bridget had an idea that she would go and get her dad&#39;s digital camera and take a few pictures. This was when the light had disappeared suddenly into the mountains. By this time, it was approx. 6:20. Bridget took the pictures, and after coming over, I was able to see them. When I got to Bridget&#39;s house, the jet-trail was still very prominent. The trail just stayed in the air, without leaving until about thirty more minutes later. Also, at the points where the trail began to turn to make the trail a zig-zaggy form, there were bright lights. The top of the trail was already beginning to drift right, because of the wind. My friend and I decided to look at the pictures then. All the pictures that Bridget took of the UFO contained orbs. Bridget took a picture of me then, to check whether the camera lens were dirty or not, and the picture of me came out perfectly fine, and without orbs. After thinking and thinking about this event, I knew that the UFO had b! een in t he Earth&#39;s atmosphere, because the wind could blow the jet trail away. The jet trail was vapor, I think, because after thirty more minutes (6:40 PM), the trail had faded. Also, before taking the pictures, when there was still some sunlight left in the sky, my friend and I could see a small rainbow, probably from the sun shining through the prism. I highly doubt this is any UFO event, because we do have a air base near by, and they were probably doing some experiments/tests/launching missiles. But the occurrence just seemed so unnatural, because of it&#39;s zig-zag shape and the bright lights at each point, and how the light just disappeared. Another thing I&#39;d like to point out is that my friend, who witnessed the whole thing, saw the light coming from somewhere behind the mountain, meaning it was probably under 2000 feet. Either the UFO landed, or the people at the air base were doing some experiments. Another thing, although this might be totally off subject (but I did hear orbs may have relation to dead people or angels), my friend&#39;s friend was shot in the chest, and found on March 14, 2002. My friend found this out March 15, 2002, so perhaps the orbs were intended for my friend (does that make sense?). I just wanted to clear the situation up, so maybe you can help me determine whether the object was an UFO or not one. Thank you very much!<n>

I happened to look up upon hearing the sound of a jet.  The sky was partly cloudy but very clear.  The jet was a fighter with an over all triangular shape but definitely man made like the ones that patrolled New York after 911.  It was a rare site but not so unusual that I was anything more than fascinated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved due west and just before going out of site veered slightly north.  The aircraft was perhaps 3000 to 4000 feet up just below most of the clouds.   I watched it until it disappeared behind a cloud somewhat west of straight overhead.  I continued watching hoping to catch another glimce.  I could hear the aircraft with the appropriate delay the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While still looking I noticed another craft of a very different shape apparently following the jet.  Its relationship to the jet was such that it could very easily have been in the jet&#39;s blind spot. It seemed to be lower in the sky and traveling as if to remain in the jet&#39;s blind spot as the jet turned north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was silent.  I remember listening carefully for the delayed sound.  It was roughly oblong and changed shape to nearly circular and back to oblong.  I presumed this was due to a changing attitude from my point of view.  It had the same dark metallic coloring of the jet. It&#39;s movements were more exaggerated as if cutting a wider arc to maintain in the same relative position to the jet. It also disappeared in the clouds but below the cloud the jet disappeared behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I had had the presents of mind to record the time and date and any other details noticed at the time.

During the trip I was casually observing the scenery, not really looking for anything. A twin-engined airplane appeared from the east, and I obseved it to try to determine its manufacturer. While observing the airplane another movement in the sky caught my attention. At first I did the proverbial doubletake. I witnessed two orb-like objects coming from the southwest, from what I could determine to be an extremely high altitude. They were flying in a single file formation, and I could not accurately determine the spacing as I was not certain of the altitude of the two objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued on a northesterly course until they were just past the zenith, at which point they veered suddenly to the west and disappeared in a matter of seconds over the horizon in that direction.

It was clear daylight with a few clouds broken up across the sky. The object was spherical in shape and moved slowly across the sky. It didn&#39;t leave any trail behind it and we watched it while we were in traffic on a slip road. It went behind one of the few clouds in the sky and we waited for it to emerge from the other side of the cloud. All the time we were watching (about 10 min)we couldn&#39;t understand why it hadn&#39;t emerged since the clouds weren&#39;t moving much and a plane would have continued on a path and emerged from the other side of the cloud.<n>

It hovered silently underneath a cloud and then moved slowly Westerly for maybe 10 km and then again remained stationary.  Clearly there was no rotor blades and no noise(helicopters are very noisy even at a distance).  It appeared to turn from shiny silver to black (maybe because of the effect of the clouds).  I was so shocked I ran inside to telephone some sort of authority . I got hold of the Australian Aviation Authority and they said I should file a UFO sighting but didnt know who with.

The temperature was a cool 61 degrees F. There was a possible light wind out of the due south, but I did not check this out with the National Weather Department. The stars were yet faintly seen at this point in time and in location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sight was drawn to the obvious huge light in the low sky (about 35 degrees from the horizon), which was just short of being the size of the full moon-or-if one were to place a U.S. nickel coin in their out-stretched hand (arm&#39;s length) for size comparison: the full moon is this size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I state that my sight was &#39;drawn&#39; to this object, &#39;compelled&#39; to look, also comes to mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a soft, white light-not glaring, nor hard to look at-seen in the due north-northwest (330 degrees [NNW] on a compass bearing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My driving speed was within limits at about 55 mph. As I drove on northward on highway 174 towards my friend&#39;s house in Joshua, I noticed that this huge light was not getting larger-or smaller-as at first-I thought it to have been a low flying private airplane of some sort (Note: commercial jet airliners would not be found in this part of the sky-as they are always heading north of Cleburne to the west of town-then they bank to the east towards the Dallas/Fort Worth airport, and if they are departing D/FW airport and heading south towards Austin or Houston: they fly to the far east of Cleburne-but in either case: they never fly directly over Cleburne).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I realized that this huge light could not have been an airplane-as it was devoid of &#39;belly lights&#39; and &#39;wing-tip&#39; lights; the softly glowing light blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove on-now out of the city limits-driving up the bridge (over-pass) that crosses over the railroad tracks (Cleburne is a &#39;hub&#39; for the railroads) at about 50 feet above the ground-but high enough to see clearly-suddenly, there appeared &#39;colored&#39; lights all about the object-so many-that it took my breath away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having been a Veteran of the war in Vietnam-and having also worked my first job back from the war at Delta Airlines: I certainly know the placement of &#39;ID&#39; lights on airplanes, helicopters and all &#39;known&#39; earthly aircraft. These lights were nothing at all like standard aircraft lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were just too many of them of too many different colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove on as the mileage grew in approaching this object, which was heading in my direction (its path would have been to the due south) just to my left, or to the west of me. It was huge. I compared it immediately to the Super Dome in New Orleans, or about 400 to 500 feet across (or roughly,166 yards) and about 200 to 300 feet in height, based upon the placement of these mentioned outwardly seen lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for these &#39;lights&#39;: there were three (3) small blinking lights on top at &#39;dead center,&#39; which were, from top to bottom, red, soft yellow and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All were blinking in an odd pattern of off and on, very swiftly. They were evenly stacked atop of each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below these &#39;center&#39; lights: the area underneath was completely dark to my vision, yet obviously, solid in nature, since the lights were certainly &#39;fixed.&#39; Outwardly from the &#39;center&#39; to either &#39;end&#39;: the distance was amazing at several hundred feet. I judged the distance between this object and me to have been about two (2) miles. The lights at either &#39;end&#39; were solid, softly lit and multi-colored-yet larger in size than the &#39;center top&#39; lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some were blinking-some were not. They were placed in a very odd fashion with no reasoning-as they were staggered in placement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were about 4 to 5 lights at either &#39;end&#39; of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the &#39;bottom side&#39;: these lights were the oddest, as otherwise, &#39;belly lights&#39; of normally &#39;known&#39; aircraft have a single red blinking light-with white and either red or blue &#39;wing&#39; lights found latterly. These &#39;bottom&#39; lights were strung out all along the bottom, making, again; no known pattern or reasoning to their placement. They, too, were multi-colored and were all of the same &#39;brightness,&#39; which was not so bright as to have been difficult to look at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached it--and it was approaching me; I decided to pull over to the shoulder of the road and to stop, which I did. By now, the huge object was almost even with my car to my left, or, I was looking to the western sky. It was now completely obvious that this object was no more than 1, 000 feet off of the ground-and VERY huge! I turned off the car engine and stuck my head out of the driver&#39;s side window-to listen for any noise, which may have been emitting from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were NO SOUNDS whatsoever. The huge object was traveling so slowly, that if it had of been a &#39;known&#39; aircraft: it would have fallen from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched in pure and total amazement, as the object just glided by me-within one (1) mile from my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was speechless-within the quiet of my car and on this part of the country highway that I know so well. This was just outside of the city limits where there are only a few farm houses spread out in the area-with patches of remote woods to my left and right sides as well as to the front, or north of where I was. (See &#39;Drawing&#39; of the object attached).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The huge object glided on by not making a sound-not making an effort to turn, climb, ascend nor descend, as I watched it and etched the size and its likely shape within my awe-struck mind. Regrettably, I had no camcorder, nor still picture camera to record this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued on its course to the due south-and drifted further away. It was still within my sight as I started the engine of the car-and drove away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very calm, having seen, witnessed and videotaped UFOs several times in my past life-proving ALL to have been &#39;unknown&#39; aircraft--beyond a shadow of a doubt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For more information on me and these former sightings, please see: http://jasonleigh.org for the Reports and documents of proof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I affirm that the above details of this amazing &#39;sighting&#39; of a huge UFO on Thursday evening, March 14, 2002, is a true accounting-to the best of my ability.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jason Leigh<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Mr. Jason Leigh, from Cleburne, TX, for submitting the report.

3/14/02 19:00|Flagstaff (north of)|AZ|Light|1 minute|Light beam in twilight sky|5/14/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22674.html|123|ndxe200203| Light beam in twilight sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of March 14, 2002, I was returning from a day at the Grand Canyon National Park and was driving south on Highway 89 heading back toward Flagstaff, Arizona.  I was somewhere between Gray Mountain and the Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, when I witnessed a very strange light to my right in the dusk sky that looked like some sort of flying aircraft, but I couldn&#39;t really see anything of the craft except an very bright light being emitted from its underside, down in a beam like pattern for perhaps 100 feet, although it is very difficult to judge distances in the sky.  It was not completely dark yet, but the light was certainly bright enough to stand out much more than any faint stars in the distance.  I would estimate the object to be a few thousand feet high, and to the south of the object a mountain peak in the distance gave some sense of depth and height perception.  I was driving about 80 miles per hour and the area is quite flat as you head back to Flagstaff, and I studied the object for about 20 seconds, while trying to determine whether it was a plane or some sort of hovering helicopter.  I thought perhaps the craft was heading back to the Grand Canyon Airport, but it didn&#39;t seem to be moving at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the horizon, out where the Grand Canyon airport could be, maybe 60-80 miles away, I could see a blinking light that most definitely an airplane off in the distance.  It occurred to me that as I looked at this craft, it looked surprisingly enough just like a &#34;flying saucer&#34; would if it were hovering and just emitting a large beam of light from its underside.  The beam spread out from the bottom of the object in a solid ray pattern, and I realized that I should take a picture of it with my digital camera.  As I began to slow down the car, which took about 20 seconds, there were some trees on the side of the highway that kept interrupting my view of the craft slightly.  As I was pulling past the sparsely populated stand of trees I could see that the light was beginning to rise slightly in the sky and a cloudy material was beginning to surround it.  In less that 10 seconds, the light rose probably several hundred feet, and as it did the cloudiness, or smoke, or whatever enveloped it.  Before I even got my camara turned on, it just disappeared in the smoke, the light was gone, and I couldn&#39;t see anything else in the twilight, except still the blinking light of an airplane very far in the distance on the horizon.  I sat there mesmerized for a couple of minutes, trying desperately to see something else, but could see nothing, and then I was trying to determine if the cloudiness around the ship was really clouds or not.  There were a few clouds in the distance, but none at all in that area of the sky.  While I watched, the foggy sort of cloudiness eventually dissepated, within about five minutes it was gone and the area where the craft had been was clear and open sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very dissapointed that I didn&#39;t get a picture of it, I&#39;m not really sure what I saw, but it was definitely not any sort of flying object I&#39;d ever seen.  I told my fiancee Lorie about it that night, and she didn&#39;t really know what to think about it.  I have been very hesitant to submit this report, and was actually waiting for a while to see if anyone else reported seeing the object on the same night.  I felt that I should at least give an account of what I saw in case anyone else witnessed it.  I have no explanation for how it vanished, and I admit that it sounds very skeptical that it disappeared before I could even get a picture of it, but as God is my witness, this is a true account of my experience on that night.  I am a chiropractor in Ontario, Canada, and was actually on a trip to look at offices for sale because I will be relocating to the western United States this year.  I had taken a day off to go to the Grand Canyon and was returning from my sightseeing day there when I witnessed this unidentified flying object.  I will not forget what I saw and it was unlike anything I expect to witness again.<n>

It was heading due north above us on highway 400. the object was a bright white light and traveling horizonally northward with the earth.From the time of sighting overhead it was gone over the horrizon within 2 to 3 seconds. this was with a wide open sky. no clouds in front of us and stars in the sky. whatever we say we saw it at the same time and before we could say &#34;what was that &#34; it was over the horizon. There are no aircraft or even comets that I have heard of like this. I have seen fighter jets going as fast as they could go before and you could still follow them for a while. there was also no sonic boom or anything. I can not figure out what this object was. I used to work at the airport and have never seen anything like this before.<n>

I would have thought it was a helicopter as well except that it made no sound and the light from what would be a spotlight was more of a greenish color than white. It continued its&#39; descent until it was about at the roofline of the house behind us on Cherrywood and it appeared to be dull grayish in color and the shape of a football with the ends &#34;mashed&#34; in. It hovered for what seemed like around 10 more minutes and then it tilted and shot awy at a speed I have not seen any helicopter fly at before. I am hoping to find out if anyone else may have seen or reported anything that eve. as this is my first visit to this website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

After about 30 mins of watching this strobing light more lights were seen in the sky. At first, 2 lights were seen moving in the same direction but not in close proximity. After about 15 mins we saw more lights in the sky moving in different directions in an area of about 100 miles. These lights were observed first from the naked eye and then with binoculars and a telescope. The lights both on the ground, that kept getting brighter and moving around, and the ones in the sky, had a honey-combed design inside of them. the lights in the sky moved around the area for about 2 hrs. The lights on the ground kept getting brighter until it finally reflected on the walls of the cabin we were in. In the morning, the light on the ground was still there, but much dimmer. It was only strobing a slight bit but was still too far away for us to track. There were no houses, roads, boats or any other form of civilization nearby and these lights have never been seen in this spot by anyone else in the past 3 years.<n>

The light was the source and became incredibly bright as the vapor continued to grow and expand from the light in a perfect triange.  I can&#39;t estimate the distance to the object, but 50 miles might be a close guesstimate.  The light continued to get brighter and continued to gain in size while emitting this gas vapor - the light then travelled in a vertical direction gaining speed at an incredible rate, the light seemed to veer upward and vaporize while the gas vapor triangular cloud remained, much like a contrail.  The vapor disapated at a slow rate, but much faster that the evaporation of a contrail...more like dry ice vapor.  Within a few minutes of disapearance of the light, the vapor vanished.

We, both my wife and I, have seen these objects before, however this experience was a bit different.  The objects would light up with an orange glow.  I ran inside grabbed my telescope and noticed (through the telescope) that the objects were alternating in color from red, orange, green, then white.  At first I thought I was possibly looking at a streetlight, however, these objects were at a high altitude and I realized that the lights were alternating at a very fast rate.  These objects would appear in the vicinity (looked like) just past the Estrella Mountains and towards the city of Gila Bend.  This area is a Restricted Zone for all aircraft, except to military; Restricted Zone&#39;s R-2031E &amp; R-2035 approx. 4 1/2 - 5 Nautical Miles at 220 degrees.  Neighbors told me that the light I, and my wife, had witnessed were &#34;Flares&#34;, however how can a flare sit in one spot for minutes at a time?  I was also told, possibly, these &#34;lights&#34; were from the military aircraft doing maneuvers with the &#34;After-burners&#34; on???  The thought had crossed my mind but again, how is it possible to see an after-burner for minutes at a time, not moving???  Another noticeable feature was the &#34;objects would light up and disappear in the same spot each and every time.  One object was approx., just past the mountains SW and 2 other object appeared to the west approx. 30 or so miles away.  I ask myself these questions, yet, unable to clarify and answer.  I though I would share this info with you and to see if anyone else have seen these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n>

It was very bright, and naturally, my curiousity got the best of me. I sat there for about 20-30 seconds watching this thing. It started stationary, and after about 3 seconds, I visually lined it up with a tree to track it&#39;s movement, in which there was none that I could notice. It then swiftly moved the right, and then stopped again. 6 aircraft, couldn&#39;t tell if they were helicopters of planes due to distance, appeared. The helicopters appeared to have police type flashing lights on them someplace. Every aircraft had these lights except the craft in question. The craft was very bright, and appeard to change shape and color. It went from a light white, to a dark orange, and the back again. It was after sunset, so it wasn&#39;t a reflection on the craft that accounted for the light. I went home to get my digital camera, came back, and the craft was gone, but the helicopters stayed there for about 2 minutes more, and then flew away in formation.<n>

The object was bigger than a small aircraft which fly over regularly. it was moving in a straight line and finally moved off into the distance where we could not see it any more.<n>

I got pretty scared at that time because I was alone. I looked around me and saw an object glowing behind some trees about 150 - 200 feet away. I was scared stiff. The object was glowing with a bright green aura, and it was somewhat translucent. Suddenly, the object started lifting into the air: first slowly, then suddenly it zoomed up into the sky with such speed that it seemed like it teleported into the sky. (Maybe it did) By then, it was just another bright shape in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

3/10/02 02:00|Chesapeake|VA|Other|10 Minutes Tops|From a Senior Correctional Officers eyes, what I've seen one night at work!|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48924.html|151|ndxe200203| From a Senior Correctional Officers eyes, what I&#39;ve seen one night at work!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working one night at Indian Creek Correctional Center in Chesapeake, Va.  I was a Correctional Officer on duty, roving the outer perimeter that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was an air field near-by, where the military practice there training.  I do recall the military operating that evening, before I seen the bright lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 1:30 a.m. when the military completed there training operations.  It remained silent that night, after the jet noise had stopped.  It was approximately 2:00 a.m. when I seen these bright lights hovering in mid-air, over a group of trees, near a open field adjacent from the compound.  The lights went from a dim sparkling light, to a bright strobe light.  The colors around the object where like the marvelous colors of a rainbow, but prettier.  In the center of the object was a white/bright blue light, almost like a welders arc.  These lights where changing colors rapidly!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first reaction when I seen these bright lights, I took it as if it was just a military airplane at first. I said to my self, &#34;Wait a minute, that can&#39;t be an military aircraft because it is not moving at all!&#34;  So I immediately stopped roving, to make sure if what I saw in the sky was still a military jet.  To my knowledge, it did not appear to me as an airplane.  The cluster of lights where hovering in mid-air over the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately put my truck in park, I took out my binoculars so I could get a better view of this object hovering amongst the trees.  As I proceed to look through my binoculars, there was an aura around the floating light.  I got on my radio, and asked the officer in the watch tower to step out onto the catwalk to confirm what I saw.  We both came to the conclusion, that it was not a military aicraft, so it had to have been something else.  The lights remained in the sky for about ten minutes or so, then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I&#39;ve seen something like this. I&#39;ve seen green lights from the sky.  It started in 1997 and it still goes on now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (green lights 1) The first time, was when I drove across the Campostella Bridge one night heading into Norfolk, Va. and out of no where this green flash of light lit up the night sky like it was daytime. It knocked out some power in the area. I thought it was just a flash of lightning, but there was no thunder following the powerful flash. I remember the clouds where really low that night, and the rain was misty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (green lights 2) The second time, was when I went to visit my mother in Virginia Beach. The time was 8:00 p.m. it was cloudy that night as well. I remeber that it was raining that night, the rain was misty and the wind was blowing kind-of  mild. I was getting out of my car about to knock on the door, then out of no where this green light flashed for 2-3 seconds over my mothers house. I felt as if the flash of light had frozen me where I  stood and this warm sensation just went through my body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister said she seen the same light one night, she asked me what it was.  I couldn&#39;t give her a answer, but I got a good Idea what it may be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was returning from some late night shopping at the local Wal-Mart and noticed these objects in the distance moving around the sky rather erratically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got closer to home I realized these objects were moving in my direction so when I got home I ran inside and grabbed my digital camera. When I ran back outside the objects were nearly overhead. I snapped only one picture before they sped out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There&#39;s really not much more to add.  I only got to see them up close for a very short period of time.  I don&#39;t know if anyone else saw them at the wee hours of the morning when this happened, but it sure had all the dogs in the neighborhood barking for awhile!  I just wish I had been able to get more than one picture.  I just got the digital camera a few days ago and am not real familar with it yet.&#34;<n>

The conditions, clear blue sky, the sun was rising over the mountains to our east, no noticeable wind.  No other aircraft in sight.  Merril Field is to the west and the area I saw the craft is usally the glide path for small aircraft to land.  At first I thought it was ballons, because it appeared light was being reflected in various colors.  But I begin to notice it was not ascending but moving toward us.  It was dark, black in color.  It was a very slow moving craft, north to south.  The craft appeared to travel from the south end of Elmendorf AFB.  As it passed over head it appeared to be traigular on the bottom but in a pyramid type structure.  The contour reminded me of a F-117 stealth fighter.    I honestly cannot remember the sequence, but I remember 2-3 red lights, then green lights.  I remember a white light but again cannot remember the sequence.  It passed over us and continued on a southernly course along the mountains.  I would guess the altitude of less than 4,000.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness implies a date in 2003.  We have changed the date above.  PD))<n>

We started to slow down to get a better look as we came just under the ball we quickly realized that it was only a about a hundred feet in the air.  The craft then split into two parts.  As we drove under the craft its stayed right above us as if it was following us.  My friend took one of the high beam spot lights and flashed at it a few times.  The craft got brighter and scared us all.  Just then it took off very fast.<n>

I was down by the pier and saw a Big transport plane coming across the coast close to the shore line.  I put my camera in 5 picture per second and took some photos of the transport.  NO other planes were in site.  When I got home and looked at these pictures, another OBJECT appeared in two frames.  It couldn&#39;t have been a bird since the plane was so big and the OBJECT was almost the same and following the transport pland.  At the time, I saw nothing else in the sky except the transport plane. No other sound.  It was a clear day and I have the pictures I would like you to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photos.  The &#34;transport&#34; is a C-130, presumably on approach, since its landing gear and flaps are deployed.  The object looks like a bird, perhaps an osprey.  PD))<n>

There was a Cloud Bank, just North and West of the Airport, highlighted by the morning Sun in Dark and White Clouds. I could easily see Jets taking off from the Airport and was able to judge this object as just a few miles further North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to describe this is: A SMALL WHITE, but nonreflecting DOT. Moving East to West. I caught it as it went in front (towards me) of a Cloud that was Dark. It was moving at a pretty good rate, but I know that even if it was a small plane like a Piper or Cessna, or a Traffic Reporting Plane, I would be able to make out more than a small WHITE DOT. (Kind of like WHITE OUT before it dries and has a Shine to it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went into the Cloud Bank, and though on it&#39;s visible trajectery, it should have reappeared in the Break between the Clouds, it did not. I have lived and worked within a few miles of Sky Harbor Int. Airport for nearly 18 yrs. And this was the stangest thing I&#39;ve seen.<n>

It didn&#39;t have a tail like a meteor, and it was a pure white color.  No orange or red color like you might see with a meteor.  The object &#34;burned-out&#34; approximately 15 degrees above the horizon.  I could not determine if the object was near or far from my position.<n>

Before last night I had never seen anything unusual. Last night, however, as I laid down in bed, I looked out the window and saw a light flash once up in the sky. Nothing unusual there, except for the fact that less than a second later it flashed again at a distance that I would estimate to be at least 500 meters (1,600ft)from the first point. I jumped out of bed immediately to watch it, thinking that it could have been a supersonic jet, but, to my amazement it flashed again, now much farther away from the second point and not in a direct trajectory line. It flashed several more times, zigzagging in the sky, until it finally vanished behind some trees on top of a hill near the horizon. I kept looking out the window for about five more minutes to see if it would come back, but it didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound associated with the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if there are any more reports of sightings similar the one I witnessed last night.

During this time, another orb entered the atmosphere at a very fast rate of speed then dissapeared. (I did&#39;nt get that on tape) The final ufo was moving very fast across the sky. It was silver and apeared to change shapes. It finally made a 90 degree turn down and dissapeared. This was amazing.<n>

A fast-blinking, red light not much below the big dipper caught my attention. At first I assumed it was just a planet, but as I watched it the light would disappear for a second or two and then reappear in another place in the sky, though not far from where it disappeared. Also, two distinctly different lights, each an off-white with a faint, bluish tint would randomly streak past the red light from different positions in the sky as though trying to catch it, each leaving a faint haze behind it which dissipated quickly soon after. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, so I called to my wife to come downstairs and outside to look at what I was seeing. Using telephone lines and the big dipper as guides I showed her where to look in the sky, and to my amazement she began to describe exactly what I was seeing! I went inside to get my video camera, but the lights in the sky were not very bright and are consequently not visible on the video tape. I watched for a total of approximately 10 minutes before the lights stopped all together. My wife and I are not sure of what we saw, but we do know that we did not see a planet, a meteor, an airplane or any other &#34;normal&#34; aircraft. No other object which either of us has ever seen in our lifetimes has been capable of moving in any way even remotely resembling that of the objects we saw tonight. I hope someone, somewhere, also saw this and successfully captured it on video tape...<n>

The object slowly floated up in a northern direction but generally remained over the refinery and south El Segundo, California.

I watched it for approximately 5 mins. and noticed it seemed to be floating, swaying on occasion very silightly. Then I had my spouse come outside to look as well. We watched it hoover off in the distance, in the same general vicinty, moving left and right, in circles, etc. But not in an exagerated manner. It would leave brief and light tracers behind it when it moved. I couldn&#39;t see the shape, as it was very dark and it was in the distant sky. It was slightly brighter than the brightest star with a red twinkle that seemed to move to different locations around the white light. There was a haze around it, a glow, like stars have. We watched it together for almost an hour or so, then it started to move up, right and away and faded away gradually. Until it looked like just another faint star and then disappeared completely.<n>

I was walking my dog at that time when she started barking insanely.  then she ran away from me as if she was scared.  This was pretty suprising because my dog is a part Doberman and part pit bull. i didn&#39;t think anything would scare her.  About 10 seconds after she left, a saw strange lights that started to get bigger and bigger. And then, i saw a really nice, sleek, blue-silvery ship.  At first i thought it was a plane, but it turned out that it wasn&#39;t.  I came to that conclusion because no ship on earth,  I think, can be able to vanish into thin air, which it did about 2 minutes after i spotted the ship.<n>

It archived at:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.extranettv.com/shows/cc/sts.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted NASA and I got this email reply:<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Thanks for your question. The capcom was talking to STS-109 Commander Scott Altman about ice on the engine bell housing. Sometimes it becomes dislodged and floats off, glittering and creating little prisms of light. This would not affect the mission in any way except if the ice began to impact objects in the payload bay with some velocity. With the Hubble Space Telescope berthed there now, that could cause problems. Fortunately, that didn&#39;t happen in this case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best wishes, Terry McDonald NASA-JSC Web Team Human Space Flight Web http://spaceflight.nasa.gov&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Jim Hickman, of &#34;the Hickman Radio Report,&#34; for submitting this report.

The living area wall is made up of 4 glass sliders. Directly ahead in the west I saw a cigar shaped light. It hovered over an island in Quahog Bay. The stabilizer on our binoculars needed batteries, so the lights appeared to be &#34;dancing&#34; or &#34;jumping&#34;. I particularly noticed the red and orange lights. The object rose slightly and I thought it was coming closer, so I woke my husband. When he got to the living area it started to go down and disappeared behind the trees on the island. A few minutes previous to this I heard a vibrating or pulsating sound outside. It was fairly loud, so much so that I began to wonder if it was something in the house. Then it slowly faded. I spotted the object a minute or two after that.<n>

It looked like a triangle comprised of 4 rows of lights, two pairs of red lights on the inside and two blue lights on the outsides. As we were driving away we looked back and noticed that it was almost just hanging in the air, not moving, then it turned itself around and began going the other direction, but by this time we had already driven to far to notice anything else.<n>
3/1/02 18:00|Edmonds|WA|Light|30 minutes|Bright plasma looking light over the Olympic Mountains|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22080.html|190|ndxe200203| Bright plasma looking light over the Olympic Mountains<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were watching a beautiful northwest sunset when she noticed a very odd contrail streaking very quickly from west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She pointed out the contrail to me, she called it a &#39;pearl necklace&#39; trail.  As we watched, we suddenly noticed a very bright light to the far southwest of our location, high above the Olympic mountains. (We were on the third floor of our home which has a wide, open view of the Olympics and Puget Sound)   The daylight was still very bright as the sun had just slipped behind the mountain range.  We watched the light for several minutes as the aircraft we were watching passed out of sight.  The light didn&#39;t move.  We found it odd that it was so bright.  My wife grabbed a pair of binoculars that we always keep nearby for watching eagles around our house.  We observed the light for about ten more minutes throught the binoculars.  The light was very bright and about 4 times the size of Venus.  I decided to look at the object through the 675 power telescope we also keep handy.  Through the telescope, the object appeared very large and high above the mountains.  It was a bright red glow that had yellow and orange colors running through it almost as if it were liquid.  Surrounding the object was a ring of bright blue and green light that also appeared liquid as it changed colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object suddenly began to move slowly to the west southwest.  It moved about equal to one inch per minute at arm&#39;s length.  The object them made a course change to the due south and sped up.  It then slowed once again and turned toward the west where it slipped out of sight behind the mountains.  From the perspective we had, the object had to be very far away and very large and metallic.<n>
3/1/02 17:00|New Orleans|LA|Sphere||I saw a small white sphere cross the sky in  a straight line|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31095.html|191|ndxe200203| I saw a small white sphere cross the sky in  a straight line<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t say this is the most interesting UFO sighting in history, but I still can&#39;t identify the little fella, so here it is: My friend and I were walking down Maple Street in New Orleans one overcast afternoon (it was more than a year ago and I can&#39;t remember the month at all, really). I looked up, probably to check for rain, and saw a white-looking sphere gliding overhead. I thought it was a balloon, or given the nasty weather, a weather balloon, but it was hard to get any sense of distance or scale; the sky was perfectly gray and overcast, and there was no noise. I called my friend&#39;s attention to it, and we may have asked a passer by for an opinion (I don&#39;t remember). Anyway, although I initially maintained it was a balloon, it flew in a perfectly straight line at a constant speed, all the way across the sky, which I wouldn&#39;t expect from something traveling on air currents. I&#39;m an engineer with lots of fluid dynamics experience, and I&#39;ve seen balloons get carried away in wind. If this sphere was entrained in an air current... well, I haven&#39;t seen anything like it. Eventually it disappeared over the horizon; not knowing how high it was, I can&#39;t estimate the speed, but it must have been fairly quick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sadly, there&#39;s no abduction to report. If my friend and I were late to where we were going, it was our own fault, as usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We looked up into the sky and saw this odd, fireball-like object. It was stationary and made no sound whatsoever. We turned around and suddenly it was gone. We continued to look up into the sky and suddenly, it returned. After another minute or two, it suddenly re-appeared. Approxamatly 30 seconds later, the light dissapated into nothing. I am usually not a skeptic of stuff like this, but this really freaked me out. I just decided to add it to the database here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We usually are at least slightly skeptical about some of the reports submitted by school-age youth.  However, in this instance, it occurs to us that the witnesses may have observed the launching of the Space Shuttle at 0622 hrs. on this date.  PD))<n>
3/1/02 06:15|Naples|FL|Triangle|3 Minutes|Black Triangle, clearly seen slowly moving over Alligator Alley March 1st  6:15AM|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22086.html|194|ndxe200203| Black Triangle, clearly seen slowly moving over Alligator Alley March 1st  6:15AM<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling south on Interstate 75, 11 miles south of Naples, Florida on Friday morning, March 1, 2002. I was listening to AM 610 WIOD and preparing to pull over, to watch the space shuttle launce at 6:22 am, on it&#39;s mission to upgrade the Hubble telescope. The sky was quite overcast, and the sun was just beginning to light up the clouds, although it had not yet risen. I noticed an object in the sky to my front left. It had 3 tiny white lights. As it came closer, at a very slow pace, I was able to make out the shape very distinctly as a triangle. It was flying low, well below the clouds, and the afore mentioned lights were at each apex. It was totally black, and the lights did not illuminate any portion of the craft. When I realized what I was looking at, I pulled over to the side of the road, and shut off the engine to listen as it passed. It was traveling west-northwest and passed by over a period of approx 3 minutes. I was sitting in the van I was driving with the window down, engine off, and I could not hear any sound at all. The traffic in that area was very light, and I actually cannot remember if another vehicle passed by me during this time or not. I turned the ignition to aux to have the radio come back on, to know when the shuttle was launching, and looked back and the object was simply gone. I got out of the van, and looked around the sky, but there was nothing. There were no contrails in the sky as well. I might note also that I travel this area twice a week, and very rarely see any conventional aircraft at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shuttle launch was not visible due to the clouds. As a side note, before I left on this trip, I set the digital clock on the radio to sync with my local radio station from Tampa (970 WFLA) and after this event, the van clock was two minutes slow. The reason I set the clock, was the van had had a starter replaced the previous day, and the clock was hours off. When I got back to the Tampa listening area Tuesday evening, the clock was still 2 minutes slow.<n>

I saw a white light flickering and getting stronger.  the object was on the horizon close to the coliseum.  The light started to change to a very bright green and began to get brighter.  It suddenly shot up into the stars faster than i have ever seen anything move.  there was no trail of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Anyways the lights moved from on side of the sky to the middle in a flash, then they all moved in different directions but stayed close like in a cluster, then they disapeered , it was amazing!! and true!!<n>
3/1/02 00:30|Keller|TX|Unknown|3-5 minutes|They looked like 4 arched windows of white light that faded into the night.|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22175.html|197|ndxe200203| They looked like 4 arched windows of white light that faded into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first 2 bright lights were observed side by side in the east sky, a third appeared next to the first 2, they were in a straight line side by side, a fourth appeared, only it gave the impression that it was dropped down from the other 3 in a row. At times it gave the effect of a light reflecting on the clouds around it. Each 3 of the lights blinked off and on very slowly though not in any sequence. The sky was so cloudy that stars and airplane lights were not visible. The lights were caught on video tape, when my son tried to zoom in on the lights, they looked like arched windows of white light that faded. After approximately 3-5 minutes they went out one by one till they were gone. The lights never moved in any direction and there was no sound of aircraft.<n>
