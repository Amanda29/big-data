I was traveling alone in a huge 26&#39; Ryder Rental Truck while towing my 1985 Cavelier on a tow dolly behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading North out of Elizabethtown, KY but was still well South of Lousville, KY on I-65. I saw a State Park sign coming up so I decided to pull over at that exit and just sleep on the shoulder on the side of the road near the highway so I could get an early start with out getting lost in the morning, plus I was not very acclimated with the procedures needed to back this monster mobile up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway I merged into the exit lane and turned right onto this road (name forgotten).  I proceeded probably a mile or more down this road so I was far enough away to not hear the noise of the occaisonal semi going up the hills on the Interstate.  I pulled off on the right shoulder, went over a hill and stopped near the bottom of the grade.  I engaged the emergency brake and cut the truck motor.  I was smoking a cig and just getting ready lay down on the bench seat and try to get a couple hours sleep before continuing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I noticed that the interior of the cab was gradually getting lighter.  Mind you, I am out in the middle of nowhere parked by the exterior boundaries of a state park.  Of course I figured it was a car or vehicle of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Damn if wasn&#39;t a vehicle of some kind!  The interior of the truck cab continued to get brighter seeming from behind, but I could not see a vehicle on the road behind me.  The lights go so bright it was kind of freaking me out a little.  I looked out the passenger window and could see some kind of multi-colored lights on what appeared to be some type of flying saucer. I could not see the whole thing, but it was slowing moving over a hill south of me with an approach that seemed to be coming towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not take this suspense.  This was a moment when I realized that whatever this was, it was a lot more powerful than I was.  I got out of the truck and stood between the truck and trailer watching this thing approach me.  I made such an effort to hear something as it came closer but I heard not a sound.  Not a single sound.  No wildlife, no bugs, no flying saucer.  But I could see it!  It was not shing a light on me as it was just illuminating the darkness.  It continued to move slowly never varying its speed.  The object appeared to be huge.  My perception was that it was roughly 200 feet across.  I walked to the back of the trailer giving up my false refuge because I really couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued north and went over the next hill seemingly to flew just over the tree tops.  When the lights faded I got back in the truck ane locked the doors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I played the radio for about 5 minutes to help myself calm down.  I decided I really was exhausted even though I had just witnessed an amazing thing.  I turned off the radio, double checked the door locks, and fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning about 4:30 I woke up and thought about what I saw.  I actually tried to rationalize that I did not see what I thought I did. I went to start the truck, and the battery was dead.  Last night I only ran the radio for about 5 minutes before I turned it off.  As luck would have it.  I had parked on a slight incline so I release the emergecy brake, put it in neutral and we started rolling downhill.  I pushed in the clutch, put it in 1st and popped the Clutch.  She started right up.  Just coincidence I thought.  I found the entrance to the park further down the road on the right and made a wide U-turn to go back towards I-65 North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hours Later I picked up a station from LIMA Ohio that said there had been multiple UFO sightings the night before.  They even gave out a phone number to call if you had seen it. It was probably just their number they were giving out and not an official number, but I was just excited that somebody had seen something last evening and they were describing similar sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know these areas are 250 miles apart, but it seemed to give my version credability again.  I know it was a UFO because I could not IDENTIFY if. Nor have I seen anything like it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told this story a lot at first, but based on the looks people give you, I very rarely tell it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

My grandmother and I lived in a house with a large grassy lot between us and the corner of our street.  I awoke one morning and went outside to play.  As I usually did.  A large circle, open in the middle, appeared to be burned into the grass.  There were three evenly spaced indentations around the circle.  Shortly thereafter, several men in military uniforms came and took pictures, measurements, and soil samples.  My sister, who is 13 years older than I, also remembers this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1987, in route from Harrison, Arkansas to Springfield, Missouri, at dusk, my daughter and I saw a beam of light come from the bottom of a large dark unknown type of aircraft.  The light swung from left to right over the ground..  Although we were not close to another vehicle, there was other traffic on the highway and we all slowed down presumably to observe this odd thing coming toward the highway about 50-75 feet above the ground.  It crossed the highway maybe 100 feet ahead of us. It circled and started back toward us.  It passed directly overhead and I leaned out of the passenger window to see if I could see what it was.  There were designs or writing on the bottom but I could not tell what they were. It flew silently overhead and we continued on our way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In approximately March of 1988, my daughter and I were driving south from Harrison, Arkansas to Jasper, Arkansas.  It was night and the sky was black.  No stars were visible.  We had experiences that night that I hesitate to mention because it is so hard to believe.  If we had not had the experiences we had, I, myself, would not have believed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 4, 2005 I was sitting with my friend in her front yard watching the fireworks display.  To our left, about 40 orange glowing craft silently floated by about 50 feet off the ground. We all stopped and watched until they disappeared.  About two minutes later a huge orange glowing craft came by.  There was no sound.  They definitely were not fireworks.  A few minutes after the large craft passed, we heard chopper blades and helicopters so black we could hardly see them came from the direction from which the crafts had come and went in the direction they had gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continue to experience unusual events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/30/88 11:00|Saline Valley|CA|Sphere|continuous|group of objects|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78281.html|4|ndxe198806| group of objects<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened a long time ago but I wanted to get it reported just &#39;because&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the desert wilderness of Saline Valley, just west of Death Valley. Daytime, sunny, high billowy clouds. It was a beautiful day. I was looking out with binoculars as we were nearer the rim than the lower parts of the valley so visibility was very far.  It is not unusual to see military jets in this place, even flying very low to the ground and in pairs doing dogfights.  Saline Valley is not that far north of China Lake Naval Weapons Test Center.  This time there were a handful of jets flying just at the top of the clouds, which were about 20,000-23,000 feet.  What made them stand out was the sun&#39;s reflection off their surface that looked like polished aluminum, very shiny.  It looked like they were doing dogfights, running in tight circles chasing each other while others were on the perimeter.  I stood still for quite a while watching through 7x35 binoculars nearly straight overhead as it was a really good display.  What really grabbed me was the tight circles they were fly! ing and the short distances they went before coming about and chasing the others.  I watched for a very long time before it occurred to me that these &#34;jets&#34; had no wings. (there was also no visible propulsion exhaust).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The really fascinating part of all this is how my brain categorized what I was seeing. For quite a while it didn&#39;t occur to me &#34;ufo&#34;. My head was saying &#34;fighter jets&#34;. But the conflict was how they were flying. They seemed to be maneuvering like they were on the end of a string being waved around and that&#39;s why the circles they were flying were so tight and sharp. No jets in this world can pull the tight turns that I was seeing. The physics just don&#39;t support jets doing those kinds of turns. And they weren&#39;t going fast like jets would streak through the sky. They were dancing, playing with each other almost like fish would do in water, darting back and forth. They were staying in one little area of the sky. My brain was just this side of &#34;what the hell....&#34;. There were little chunks of logic missing in my observation. The thought &#34;how can they be doing that without wings&#34; stayed just outside my consciousness thoughts. I&#39;ve seen fighters and they just can&#39;t fly like that and they certainly can&#39;t fly like that with no wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no internet back then in the 80s. It wasn&#39;t until I saw quite a few videos on youtube that it dawned on me these were the same type of shiny roundish vehicles doing seemingly impossible maneuvers. I was USAF 40 yrs ago and I lived very near AF Plant 42 and Edwards so I&#39;ve seen a lot of aircraft.  What I saw that day were not aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/30/88 03:00|Pittsburgh|PA|Triangle|not sure|Enormous black triangle, southeast of Pittsburgh, 1987/88. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87402.html|6|ndxe198806| Enormous black triangle, southeast of Pittsburgh, 1987/88.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello.  I have shared this story with a very few individuals, close friends who can be trusted.  I have also, more recently, shared it online, in emails to a few individuals, in hopes of getting some kind of (hopefully positive) feedback, possibly opening a dialogue with someone who has had a similar experience, but as yet to date, feedback has been minimal, and no dialogue.  I am certain there are others who have had similar experiences, but don’t know how to go about finding them.  At any rate, here goes:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back in about 1987 or 1988, I was staying at a friend’s house.  I was doing some work on their farm, southeast of Pittsburgh, PA.  I was sleeping on the couch, when I had a &#34;dream&#34; that was not a dream.  Let me elaborate:  I was startled awake somehow, and had the instantaneous impulse to get up and run outside, onto the porch.  When I did, I saw an enormous black triangle hovering above, and slightly to the right (South) of the house.  There were no discernible lights, as I recall, but there seemed to be dome-like shapes along the bottom of the thing.  (craft? Ship?)  I don’t know how long I stared at it, but I became aware that it appeared to be sucking up trees from the ground and levitating them up into it somehow.  I started crying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly there was a blonde female there with me, about 5’ 4&#34; tall, straight blonde hair, like in the &#34;Swedish Bikini Team&#34; commercials, dressed in either black or dark blue close fitting flight suit type uniform.  I don’t recall any kind of emblems or markings on the uniform.  { I will note here that at that time I had not heard of the Billy Meier case.  I have only learned of it recently.}  I did not, far as I remember, actually see her descend from the vehicle, she was just kind of suddenly there on the porch with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately felt reassurance, and an overwhelming sense of peace and calm.  She told me that everything would be alright, that they were going to put the trees back when they were done, that everything would be as it had been before, and that there would be no sign that anything had happened.  I looked into her eyes, (deep blue or maybe green, like a lake) and I instantly felt as though we had known each other for a very long time, maybe forever.  I knew her name then, though I don’t know it now.  She put her hand on my shoulder, and, &#34;Bam.&#34;  I was waking up on the couch again, startled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up and ran outside, fully expecting to see a black triangle, but there was nothing in the sky except stars.  I stood there dumbfounded, thinking it must’ve been a dream, but it was no dream.  I know it wasn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if she wiped my memory, and maybe it didn’t fully erase, (?) or if maybe I was allowed to remember only certain parts of the experience, or if I was supposed to believe that it was “just a dream.&#34;  I really wish that she would return again, the connection I felt was so profoundly deep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will add that the area where the farm was is not far from a high-security government installation, the US Bureau Of Mines, which I don’t believe for a minute is actually a coal mine.  They have 12’, double-row, barbed wire fences surrounding the place, which were in place as long ago as the early 1980s, long before the heightened state of security in the post 9/11 era.  I had a friend who used to work there as a janitor.  A few of us decided to go and see him one day, there was a sliding gate which was open, and on a whim we just decided to drive in and see if we could find him.  Within about a minute, we were being closely followed by a dark blue Chevy Caprice Classic.  We kept on driving.  Then a white Chevy Caprice Classic pulled out in front of us, cutting us off.  Three men wearing black suits, black ties, and black sunglasses approached the car, and demanded identification.  One of them said, “State your business here.”  We told them we were looking for our friend.! He said, “This is a restricted area.  You have no business here.  Turn your vehicle around and leave immediately.”  Needless to say, we were scared shitless.  We were teenagers out for a ride on an otherwise uneventful day.  We turned around, with the blue car now in front of us, and the white car following us closely.  They followed us like that after we got back on the main road, for about a mile or so.  It was very weird.  Were they the infamous “men in black?” And, if so, why were they there?  Why would they need such a high level of security at a “coal mine” anyway?  I knew from then on that there was something not right about that place, it gave me the creeps, and I always tried to avoid it if possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident took place earlier than the other one, approximately 1985 or so.  There have been other strange occurrences throughout my life, but these two stand out in my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My ex wife, some friends, and I were laying on a trampoline in a yard, stargazing.  We all remarked about this bright red dot, wondering if it was Mars, or what, when all of a sudden, it just shot off to the north northeast, zip!  We all said “Whoa, what the hell was that?!”  This was just after the time of the Hale-Bopp Comet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have more, but I will wait for a reply on this first.  Namaste.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My ethnicity is Native American/Celtic/Anglo-Saxon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My religion is Pagan, though I was raised Methodist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently in my mid forties, at the time of the first incident listed, I was in my twenties, at the time of the second incident I was a teenager, at the time of the third incident I was around thirty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The memory of the first incident, though incomplete, is extremely vivid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have strange, &#34;Post Apocalyptic&#34; dreams sometimes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a strong fear of &#34;Greys&#34;, the pictures people draw give me the willies, yet I have no memory of ever seeing one up close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if I believe Billy Meier or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if I really believe everything that Bill Cooper wrote in &#34;Pale Horse,&#34; but a lot of it makes sense.  I know the US government lies.  They cannot be trusted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that something is going to happen on 21, December of this year, 2012, I just don’t know exactly what.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was common for us to finish our work midnight or later, then hang around in the parking lot for some time chatting afterwards.  Due to the type of work we were doing, it was only breaks and non-work time that would provide us a chance to talk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, after mid-night, we must have stood around talking for nearly 45-60 minutes.  The entire time it looked as if there was a light cloud cover over head and behind the clouds were single lights that slowly came on and then faded off.  It seemed to cover the whole sky directly over head and had been going on when we got out there and continued on when we all left. We all saw it.  Commented on it.  Wondered what it was. But never once...at least not until the next day... did any of us think of it in terms of &amp;quot;UFO&#39;s&amp;quot;.  Then of course, it was a done deal and no one knew what else to do with the information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Story 2: I worked at this site for about 11 years.   Every night at break, 8-8:30PM, I would walk the perimeter of the business park, since we did a lot of sitting for the job.  Another night...and I wish I could remember how much later it was, as it could have been months or years...I just don&#39;t know.... I was out walking and looked to the western sky, it must have been close to summer as the sky was still a little lit up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was similar to the earlier light(s), except the was only one cloud in the sky and as I watched it, it looked to have a light behind it.  Like someone was holding a giant flashlight behind a cloud. The odder part was, as I watched, the cloud began to shrink and the light faded with it until the sky was clear of any cloud, or light in about 5 minutes or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a co-worker, who was off that night, who I mentioned this to the next day when we were together.  She had been out walking with her husband and said she saw the same thing around the same time...however, she saw it in the northwestern sky, not the western sky,  like I had.  And she lived further north of where we worked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of us had any of the classic symptoms, like lost time or lost memory.  Never saw any craft or movements, other than the fading on and off of the lights both times.  Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t seen anything like that since.  Yet, I have heard of folks who say they see lights over the White Tank Mountains to the west of the valley all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

6/30/88|CHENNAI CITY (MADRAS) (India)||Oval||Dear all,      05.04.02 On a pleasant evening it was still sun|4/8/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22442.html|9|ndxe198806| Dear all,<n> <n><n> <n><n> 05.04.02   On a pleasant evening it was still sunny, the sun was on its way to say goodbye for the day - it was during the end of summer - (CHENNAI, a Sea port city, in the South of INDIA , usually enjoys  SUMMER and PEAK SUMMER.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rainy season is during monsoon around oct /nov.) My first sighting was certainly not during the rainy season.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a bachelor then and as usual I entered my hostel room and opened all the windows and went on to remove my shoes and all most at once the windows slammed crazily with a sudden gust of wind and simultaneously it became dark , I came on to the balcony and scanned the sky and to my surprise the sky which was so clear hardly 5 min before had turned into inky blue, but only to a limited area .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Above the dark clouds I saw a flash of red light and thought that it was an aircraft perhaps going to land. Then all of a sudden I noticed that the moving light was not flickering and that it had already come to a stand still . My mind was trying to figure out &#39;is that a chopper, no chance if it was one then the sound of the chopping blades should be audible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ( from the time of the sudden slamming of the window my mind was strangely working on the UFO lines) Then I saw that the RED light had changed to ORANGE and as well grew larger in diameter - I should say it was almost having a sharp oval shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the colors began to change in waves of pink,yellow,orange,red....  it appeared that it was emerging from the bottom of the craft , perhaps from a single light point having the characteristics of changing its color like a chameleon. The light flowed from that point and simultaneously increased the sharp oval diameter and as well as the luminosity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew that I need a witness now and therefore dashed to the next room and found one of the inmates and forced him out to have a look at  the unbelievable phenomenon. He gaped at it for a while and then asked me what it was and went on to say whether it is a plane or a helicopter. I asked him to observe as keen as possible with out diverting the concentration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the craft began to HOVER  so very slowly and majestically with all its splendor and glory circling elliptically and moving in our direction and stopped again , then after a moment it started to move fast in a straight line parallel to the Earth&#39;s surface maintaining the height perhaps around the height of a 6 to10 story building (we were on the 2nd floor)    .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light  which  was so wide spread , shrunk back to its point of origin , the mid point of the bottom of the craft and then it zipped into nothingness perhaps changed into another dimension????? CHAPTER  : II The story of this sighting went around and finally surfaced a couple of days later when there was a gathering of the hostel mates around 10 pm and the location was an open balcony on the II floor of the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire group which was all set to make fun of me on the subject of UFO , began to do so by countering every detail which I was providing them,emphasizing that what I saw, (which was as well witnessed by the next  room mate ) was an UFO and not an imagination. Even the witness kept tight lipped during the entire course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And as the commotion got heated up,  I said that someday I will show them what I had seen and that could happen even today , saying so I look up into the sky, My God , I saw the craft circling almost above us, the sky was so clear and almost above that UFO was the bright full moon , it was like a heavenly spotlight focusing on the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What more do I need , it was My turn to bully them and asked them what on earth they were seeing , each one began saying that it was an airplane, a helicopter etc but then finally they realized that what so ever they were seeing was unexplainable .An UFO???? CHAPTER III There after for over a period of more than an year and a half , I used to see the UFO frequenting the Chennai sky (Madras sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> During most of my sightings,  I observed that the UFOs would be coming from the  direction of the airport towards the sea coast,  to be more specific that was the landing route of most of the aircraft .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of the time these UFOs were moving very lazily stopping here and there and when once they reach the coast line they would fly parallel to the coast towards the nearby rocket launching station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On two occasion I saw the UFO chasing an aircraft almost zipping from far behind and on reaching the top of the aircraft  it used cut down the speed almost at once effortlessly and then travel along with the speed of the air craft .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Am sure that these UFOs will be seen everyday in the Chennai skys, but when I realized that I was going nowhere by simply observing them, I gave up sky watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Am willing to answer any specific questions on the above sightings which could help the science of UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will have the witness attempt to establish the precise date of the incident.

There were no other external features, so if it was a stealth plane, then it was cloaked in invisibility.  As soon as I saw the object it began moving from SE to NW at impossible speed. It went from east to west within 2 seconds, starting at an altitude about a half mile and crashing into the earth on the west side of town. I was sure it crashed near Denny&#39;s on Solano Ave. It made absoutely no sound. I have been observing UFOs since 1966 and have seen several, one 20-30 feet above me. That&#39;s another story.<n>

I reminded them that a blimp would not be that low and we would hear a helicopter.  There was no noise and the lights seemed to rotate around the vessel as there was a small gap that kept reappearing at regular intervals.  Within a few minutes the item moved vertically and quickly away.  We wanted to tell someone but figured no one would believe us.  I keep looking ever since for more evidence.

I was looking down at a massive cloud above which looked like at least one hundred or more towers of different shapes and sizes.  The actual craft was hidden under the cloud, but from my perspective it had to be the size of a small city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the flight was so early in the morning most of the passengers on the flight had their shade down and were sleeping. I woke up my husband and he saw it, and I can&#39;t imagine that the pilots hadn&#39;t see it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting was aprox 10-15 minutes into the flight so I can&#39;t be sure exactly where we were, but I know that the sighting was very close to the time when the pilot announced that we were at our cruising altitude.<n>

Read description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 3:00 am, I awoke and walked in the dark to the front room which has a turret shape to it, with near floor to ceiling windows.  As I walked to just in front of the small desk that sits directly in the center of the 3 windows, for I was concentrating on the center window and was going to look out to the yard and street, as I had done before, hoping to see deer passing.  However, as I stopped just in front of the desk in the dark, to my immediate right and just over my 3 car garage was a huge round dull silver saucer shaped craft.  It was no more than 30 feet off the ground and engulfed the rooftop of the garage, with about another 10 feet sticking out beyond the roof.  I could see most of the craft and its underbelly very clearly.  The underbelly had sectioned bars that radiated the underside much like you would section out a pie.  Between the sections and on the edges of the &#34;slices&#34; or between the bars, were round white soft lights.  The ! lights were not illuminating toward the ground as a spotlight would.   I stood there studying the craft in utter amazement and wanted to not take my eyes off it or call out to the others sleeping in the house for I knew this was a fleeting moment and wanted to take in exactly what I was seeing.  I then saw it start to very slowly move from above the garage to just over the turret that I was standing in.  As it moved I leaned to the far right window to watch it go overhead.  All the curtains were open, as they always are, but as it went over the turret section of the house, I could no longer see it.  With my peripheral  vision, I tried to watch all windows to see any movement, but that was all I saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife, quite naturally, was awakened by my cries and frantically asked what was wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After calming down and bringing my heart rate down I told her that I had had a nightmare that seemed so real to me even after waking that I was shivering with fear.  It was a dream about a close encounter with a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I go much further, let me tell you about myself.  I am a former United States Marine Corps aviator.  I flew as a ((deleted--senior crew member)) on KC-130 aircraft for ((deleted--approximately 10)) years.  I have an IQ that has been tested to be over 160, am well educated, well traveled and very well respected by my peers.  I am currently working as a field operations officer for a large multi-national, multi-billion dollar corporation and hold a great deal of responsibility in my position.  I am a practical, straightforward individual, known for my calm, reasoned, common sense approach to problem solving and crisis management.  I have an extensive knowledge of both military and civilian aircraft, their characteristics, abilities as well as appearance and am a licensed A&amp;P aircraft mechanic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back to my story...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dream I had just had was of me driving in a car which I recognized as a late 80&#39;s model Chevy Berretta.  In the car with me were 3 others, a female in the front passenger seat and a male-female couple in the back seat with the male behind myself.  As I recounted the dream to my wife we both assumed that the car in question was that of a friend of ours, ((name deleted)).  We both commented it strange that I would dream of driving her car as ((name deleted)) would never in a million years let anyone drive her beloved car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also seemed strange to me that I did not recognize either of the females in the car as being ((name deleted)), or as my wife for that matter, but yet I felt some connection to the woman in the passenger seat.  I also felt as though we were driving home from the movies though it was more a feeling than any part of the dream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the dream unfolded we were driving along a stretch of road which crossed under another hi-way, like an interstate.  After passing the interstate we approached a rise in the road.  From beyond the crest in the road there was a bright light as though a truck with its headlights on bright was approaching.  As we continued driving up the rise the light became intensely bright, so white it was tinged with blue and blocked out our vision of the surroundings, yet did not hurt the eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we crested the rise I was able to see a short valley that the road descended down into.  At the bottom of this depression there were two glowing objects.  Each was approximately 50 feet in height, cylindrical in shape with flared out conical bases.  (Very similar to the game pieces in the old game SORRY.)   The objects were sitting on either side of the road and were the source of the light, though no &#34;lights&#34; themselves could be seen.  It was as if the entire object was glowing with this intense blue-white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was able to shake myself from the sight of these objects I could feel that I was no longer driving the car, we were being drawn towards them as though caught in the sci-fi classic &#34;tractor beam&#34;.  At this point I, along with my companions in the vehicle, began to scream.  It was at this point the dream ended and I awoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (FYI: I have had goose bumps the entire time I wrote this.  I am hesitant to think about the dream very often these days.)  I had the dream only once.  I would sometimes think about it and try to place where the dream took place.  At this point it did not bother me much to think about the dream.  It was kind of a mind exercise to figure out where it had taken place.  The overwhelming feeling that I was driving ((name deleted)) Beretta home from the movies led me to believe that the dream took place in the suburbs of Chicago where I live and I imagined several likely locations, though none exactly matched the dream.  The fact that the car had a light color interior in the dream, and that ((name deleted)) car had a dark interior was another part of the dream which I could not rationalize. Over time I began to let the dream fade I rarely thought of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two years or so after having the dream I was in a conversation with some people talking about cars.  We were talking about the first car we ever owned and it was then that it hit me like a ton of bricks.  In the summer of 1988 I had left active duty in the USMC to go back to college and had bought a red 1988 Chevy Beretta with a light sand colored interior.  The car in the dream was mine.  Suddenly it all came back to me in a flash.  From that moment on the memory of the dream has never failed to bring on goose bumps, and occasional tears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The girl in the front seat was my girlfriend at the time, the man in the back seat her brother, and the other woman his girlfriend.  I was living in North Freedom, Wisconsin that summer of 1988 after taking a summer job in the area.  The four of us had gone to the movies at a drive-in early that evening in Madison and had returned home late.  We stopped in Wisconsin Dells and had gone skinny-dipping in the river at a place known as &#34;Bare-Assed Beach&#34;.  After getting in the car we drove back towards Baraboo to drop the three of them off before I drove on to North Freedom.  The next morning I remember waking in my bed with no recollection of the drive from the Dells back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After my revelation I was able to place the hi-way we crossed under as I-94, though I do not know if it was the US Rte. 12 underpass or one of the ones west of there, but that is definitely the rough location of my encounter.  I have long since lost contact with my companions that night and have no idea if any of them have ever had similar dreams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I have stated I only had the dream once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several years later however, in the late 1990&#39;s I had a second dream more terrifying than the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time it all made sense from the start.  The dream took place in &#34;downtown&#34; North Freedom.  (I say downtown in quotes because it is such a small town, population 600, there is little else but a few lonely brick storefronts.)  The dream took place at night.  I was returning home from Baraboo in my 1988 Beretta and had arrived in North Freedom.  Being late at night the gas station was closed and there was nowhere to get a soda other than the Coke machine outside of one of the buildings downtown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got out of my car with the change for the machine in hand, I looked up into the cloudless sky and saw the millions of twinkling stars.  I just stood there and stared for a long while at them.  I had some training in celestial navigation and was trying to pick out the major constellations, planets and stars.  My stargazing over I then started walking across the main intersection in the center of town towards the pop machine.  As I walked I felt a slight tug at my jacket.  Then another tug.  Suddenly I felt myself being pulled upwards off my feet, into the air by collar of my jacket, my arms pinioned by the sleeves.  As I began to rise at a faster and faster rate I looked up again, but this time saw no stars.  Instead I saw large black circular object blocking the sky from my sight as it hovered overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I again screamed and awoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess I should also state that being a former Marine I do not scare easily and have never screamed that I can recall in my entire life.  Whether or not these are just dreams or actual encounters I do not know for sure, but I will say this, I have NEVER, EVER had such realistic dreams.  To this day I can see and feel every aspect of the dream; the colors, the smells, the fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the witness for taking the time to submit such an interesting report.

To avoid turnpike traffic (the road was off of Flanders Netcong Road) anyway about half way home The cigarette lighter in Eric’s car began to smoke terribly (now the weird part is that his dad unplugged it to keep him from smoking in his car ~~ I know  but it is true he is a Preachers son) Then a few seconds later the car died ~ we rolled off the road in a turn around spot I grabbed a rag and pulled the lighter works out of the car and thru it into a puddle on the side Of the road ~ it was so hot steam came off of it. And while we were looking at the lighter in the puddle Going what the hell just happened ~~ Eric grabbed me and dude look , look look ~~ I kinda paniced at first because here we are 2 West Virginia boys in the middle of no where on the side of the road at night ~ this is a movie right? So I turn and look up and bam ~ there it was just hovering over the tree line Which if anyone knows the area knows &#34;Pines&#34; between 40 to 80 feet tall ~~ medium growth ~ I look straight ahead and there is a wooden fence and a huge field with several cows kinda huddled real close together and next to the fence line. I run over to the fence and stand on the first rung and begin looking at the craft which is enormous I mean 4 football fields or more ~ so big you couldn’t see the end or the beginning or the sides ~~ it just covered the entire field!!! We just kept looking at each other going this isn’t happening!! The thing was just hovering it had several lights not flashing but not so bright as to Cast any kind of shadow or anything and it was so dark ~ there are no kinds lights out there ~ at all I mean really pitch black ~ the lights I’ll never forget they were red white and a few where kinda like glowing not really any kinda positive color just hot or heat looking if that makes sense ~~ Eric says it was triangle shape but me being the more level headed of the two in stressful situations I believe it was square but in the night sky and as big as it was who knows? All I know is that the damn thing was big and I was scared for the first time in my life ~~ I’ve gone 200mph on a motorcycle and jumped outta planes seen two of my kids be born even had a toe to toe with a real Hell’s Angel . But I’ve never seen anything like this ~ nor Have I ever spoken of this to anyone else other than Eric ~ and I don’t think he has either ~ I’M A PROFESSIONAL AT WHAT I DO NOW some years later and this is something I’ve never gotten over ~ anyway ~ the thing start to move north west by my best guess because we followed it after it moved away the car started right back up and we rode back to the RT. 206N then onto 613 then onto 667 ~~ were we lost it ~~ it crossed the main highway several times and I kept saying to ERIC man doesn’t anybody else see this freaking thing?? It was so damn big!! We weren’t drinking  anything stronger than Gatorade and were weren’t doing drugs ~ really wasn’t our thing ~ just heading home after shooting some hoops with some friends ~~ I think for me there is more to the story than what I have spoke of because of something that happened as a child to me ~ but I won’t go into that ~ just know that I’m a realist who believes in the here and now ~~ and this thing haunts me everyday!!  I&#39;m only doing this becuase of a show I saw last night about the NYC area UFO Hunters  ~ ~ and some of the things they showed looked like this and man it was weird first time in years it really really hit me ~~ I gotta speak up ~<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

(There was no visible beam of light or energy).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object descended at a 90 degree perpendicular angle over Granite Mountain in eastern San Diego County, and then made a slow calculated inclination to the west between North Peak Mountain and Pine Hills, and then disappeared into an early summer cloud bank.

It was irregular shaped, Not smooth or like pictures I observed in the past. If it were, I could explain it better,but it was so different I have trouble describing it better. The object did not show any lights,although it was clearly visable.It seemed to create a visable illumination that did nor radiate away from itself.It did no glow,but the material composition made it clearly visable.It was not metallic.More like semi gloss smooth(not the shape) graphite.It seemed to be made in layers.Small flat sections wit larger sections above and then smaller sections above. about four levels I cant give you its size,or altitude.Perhaps 500 feet above the tree tops. It was large no noise and did not move.From its altitude(a guess and in realation to the size of the trees, I would guess it was 75 t0 100 ft. long.Iwent and got my wife son, and three neighbors to observe the phenomenom. we were astonished. It was in a residential district not well lit.The area was in a small area of L.A. near Glendale Ca. The object just seemed to dissapear all at once. not speed away. Just became gone. I called griffith park observitory but they had no inquiries. I just let it go. It was so strangely shaped with nolight radiating from it I t was hard explain. The reason I have not reported before is because I had no other proof of the sighting than us six people.I had been inL.A. for years,and was used to the goodyear blimps helicopters etc. This thing made no noise or movement and it vanished.The Shape and composition are unlike any Ihave heard about before.Any reports like mine? How could six people in los Angerles see the object so clearly and it dissapears without any hoop La from neighbors, or the media?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was driving home from work in the late &#39;80s.  I think it may have been 1988, possibly 1 or 2am.  There were a row of huge lights, I think I remember them to be vertically oval.  I was on Rt 6&amp;209 going toward NY.  The lights were in the sky connecting each side of a valley in the mountain, on the other side of Rt. 84.  This would be approximately across from where Walmart or Kmart now are.  I could see the sky above and below the lights.  I never stopped the car.  I remember thinking to myself that I didn&#39;t remember houses there.  The next day, I saw that there weren&#39;t.  There is no other explanation other than there being a UFO floating in the sky.  I would love to hear if anyone else remembers seeing anything there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I truely do not remember...in fact I barely remember this experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out in my grandmother&#39;s yard (she owned an acre of land at the time) and as i was playing i froze. there was a paralyzing sound all around me. It was like a throbbing hum and it felt like it was rubbing against my eardrums. I didn&#39;t move, all i could hear was the this one noise. I really don&#39;t know how to describe it, it was as if i were caught in a wall of sound. the noise soon passed and everything was back to normal. I told some of my family later on but no one really believed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In wilmington illinois where this happened, there is an old army arsonal. I have no idea what happened that day.<n>

It was around 10:30pm when my mother, brother and I had just gotten home from an event. We lived on a horse shoe street which was somewhat surrounded by tall trees (50 feet plus). We had just pulled in the drive way and as we were getting out of the car my mother says &#34;What is that?&#34; and as plain as day hovering about these tall trees was a U.F.O. My brother says that’s a flying saucer. There is no doubt to what we are seeing. This is visible no more than 200 feet away. This saucer length had to be at least 6-8 maybe more diesels long all lined up together. I was amazed at what I was seeing. I just could not believe my own eyes. This saucer hovered over these trees for 5-10min. It had several white lights around the outer part. After 5-10min it began to rise slowly and I mean slowly and with in a few seconds it took off at an angle leaving just a tracer of its path and it was gone. I can close my eyes today and see it all over. I will NEVER forget. I look to the sky all the time hoping to see one again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I myself have experience what I believe was an alien encounter. I believe this occurred after the sighting not sure of the date/time but there was light outside. I was sitting in my bed reading a book and my back is to the bed room entrance. So, I’m reading and I feel 3 taps on my left shoulder and mentally I’m assuming it’s my brother and as I turn and look over my shoulder I see a white figure with an oval shaped head and black oval eyes and I freaked out . I jumped up and ran out of my house. I’ve seen this figure described on television by other people whom have claimed of seeing aliens but some people say its grey or some color but what I saw was white. It freaks me out to even think about it. I believe there are chosen people to see the things we see and I feel bad for the people that will never truly believe and know that we are not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I am certain it was not a dream.  I woke up at 3 am for no apparent reason.  I was compelled to go over to my window and open the window shades in my bedroom that sits on the second story and faces south east.  When I opened up the window shade I began fixating on a brighter than usual star in the clear night sky.  A moment later the &#34;star&#34; light began to move at a moderate pace toward my position. I began to get a little anxious as this was happening.  The circular light kept on getting brighter and larger as it approached.  At this point I was beginning to freak out.  The circular light was then about 500 feet from my window and was incredibly bright and large in shape.  My guess is that it was 100 feet wide by 100 feet tall maybe.  The object at this point was about a 20 feet above me in height. What I remember is that it was taking up most of my field of vision.  At this point I slammed the window shade and ran quickly into my parents room to wake them up.  We went back to the window, my dad did I was too afraid and there was nothing there.  Now this sounds like a bad dream, but I know it was real.  I have had bad dreams though they take place in my bed not standing at a window.  My sister too this day remembers this night as well, as the night her brother claimes to have seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing this now because I recently watched a televsion show about the Highland, IL lights that brought me back to my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Maybe 1987 or 88.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live very close to Lake Erie.  I can see it from my house. My dad and sister both witnessed 2 lights in the sky. both hovering over the Lake.  The number of witnesses would be 3.  You could say 4 because it was a neighbor lady who called us up to asked us if we saw what she was seeing.  She has since passed away.  She lived right on the lake. We lived right across the street. The Street is called Lake shore blvd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked across the street while my dad stayed on our porch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They stayed in one spot for a long time. Sometimes they would appear to get closer. I remember being ready to run if it got to close..lol.  While one stayed still the other one started moving way over us.  My dad watched it as it passed over him. completely silent.  At this time it was pretty high up there. I don&#39;t know if I can give you an accurate measurement.  It went up into the sky completely vanishing out of site.  The other light. My memory has faded some on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it to disappeared somewhere over the lake.  I think our sighting might of been in the summer. I&#39;m Most certian they were NOT helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said.  They were both completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found a story UFO story online that happened in 1988 which could be related to what I saw because its close to the same year.

The only way I can remember my abductions are the dreams (or awake memories) that I am left with. I was about five, and the dreams lasted for 1-2 months. I drempt them in strictly black and white and a disturbing double vision. Besides that, I can remember being in a dim room laying paralyzed on a table. I tried to move my head to see something but was unable to. My eyes were able to move, but not my head. I can&#39;t remember any feeling in my body, so I don&#39;t know if I had clothes on or if I was laying on a metal table. I assume it was metal. I saw two of everything so my vision was very poor. I felt a presence so I continued to un-strain my eyes and lift my head, but I was unable to. I remember a celing probably 6-8 feet above me and a wall about 9 feet to my left. It was plain and didn&#39;t look like sheetrock. I tried so hard to look around but my vision was limited. These dreams lasted over a period of 1-2 months, from what I can remember just about every night. I have read information on characteristics of abductees and the majority are true with me. There&#39;s a friendly ghost in my house, I&#39;ve experianced several missing times occations, etc. I really think something&#39;s happening, like I&#39;m picked for a duty and I need help figuring out what that duty is.<n>

I parked my car in front of my parent&#39;s house in NE Albuquerque and got out when I spotted a spherical object with different colored lights flashing randomly.  It appeared to be about 50&#39; in diameter and moving from east to west approximately 300&#39; above the ground.  I&#39;m a pilot and am pretty good at identifying aircraft, altitudes and distances.  The object was moving slowly, maybe 40mph, and was silent.  My first thought was this was a weather balloon and someone had rigged it with Christmas tree lights and a battery as a hoax.  I couldn&#39;t tell if the orb was tumbling randomly or if the lights just made it appear so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object had gone about 2 miles west of me it shot north (maybe 15 miles?) and immediately west and upward until it disappeared in the distance.  It did this in less than a second or two and made the 90 turn from north to west without slowing or arcing.  This was NOT a weather balloon nor am I aware of any aircraft that can move that quickly or perform an immediate change in direction like I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stunned in amazement at what I&#39;d just seen.  I saw a man and a woman who were at a park about 4 houses up the street and asked them if they saw it.  They said they did and asked me what it was.  I asked them if they saw it shoot north and west and they had.  I wish now that I had talked with them more to compare our observations regarding size, shape, distance and speed.<n>

You could see it&#39;s reflection in the water below. It had multi colored lights evenly distributed around its surface. Similar to what a globe would look like if you put a light at each intersection of a lat and long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was spinning, but not an any axis - more like a tumble in many different directions - the lights made it easy to see the tumbling effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After hovering there for about a minute, it sped south down the coast toward Daytona and over the horizon. It was over the horizon and out of site within 10 seconds and moving at a high rate of speed.

As we moved closer to the object we could not believe what we were seeing, I immediatlly asked my cousin and sister &#34;are you guys seeing what I&#39;m seeing&#34; just to make sure I wasn&#39;t going crazy. They both were so shocked all they could do was nod their heads. We then passed directly under this object, and by now I have my head out of the window like a dog looking straight up at it this THING.  Because it was at night I couldn&#39;t tell what color it was but you could make out the shape of the object which was round and huge. Once we passed under it, I noticed it had 3 sets of lights in the shape of a circle, One set was clear, the other set was like some weired pinkish-red and the other was like a blue-green color. I also noticed as I had my head out of the window that I didn&#39;t hear a sound nor feel any wind blowing us. As we past beneath it to the other side, I took my head out of the window to look out of the back window and the object was gone, no where to be seen. I knew that was odd because we were on top of a hill and were able to see for miles and miles around, but the object had disappeared. I asked my cousin to turn around, his exact words were &#34;h_ _ l no, are you insane&#34;. We went on to our destination and have never discussed what we seen since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

First and only UFO experience for all of us.  I stepped out of the house for an after dinner walk.  It was a clear calm evening around dusk.  As I was waiting for my girlfriend and friend, I noticed a light in the far distance just above the treeline to the south, which would be the Gulf of Mexico.  It struck me as odd that there were no blinking lights like you see on planes.  So I kept an eye on it as we walked and mentioned it to my companions.  It came closer and closer.  By the time we had walked about a hundred yards it was passing directly overhead.  It was silent.  It was circular shaped with about 7 lights evenly spaced around the perimeter.  As it passed over, it was traveling west to east and the lights changed color from blue to green (or vice versa).  It was hard to tell how high up it was and how big it was because I have no frame of reference for such an object; however, I suspect that it wa! s very high and immense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Impossible for me to determine its size since it blocked out any reference points I could have used. If forced to guess, i would say it was at least 60 feet long by 20 feet or so high shaped like a submarine. This means there was a distinct center high point but then again the black of the object left me with that impression.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object just appeared with no sound of any kind and or movement of leaves tree branches etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event takes palce on or about early June 1988. My grilfriend at the time and I were just returning from a restaurant at between 7: and 8. We were on the back prch of the house about to enter when we heard the rough missing sound of an air plane engine. As if the plane had no noise abatement of any kind and flying as the sound provoked low to the ground. We stepped back from the roof line to see what it may be, discovering it was an old rotary engine plane flying approx 200 feet. The palne was very close to us approx half a block to our true north as we were facing true east. The plane was flying directly west into the sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our eyes followed the plane thinking the noise may represent engine trouble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the plane passed us heading west and we are now looking more at the rear of the plane we noticed we couldn&#39;t see or next door neighbors house to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We couldn&#39;t see the street lights to ur south or the hospital to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In our way was a large long and high black something blocking out that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept our eyes on the object leaving the back porch to approach it from our back yard. As we aproached my girlfriend and I didn&#39;t speak not a word. We both waled toward the object geting within 15 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once my eyes and mind hooked up -- I realized this was anything but normal and I became uneasy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked off to my right or west to see the old plane beginning to bank south accross the then sunset. I looked back at te object noticing there was a lght fore, aft and mid not blinding by any means but present. I don&#39;t know if it was steady or blinking too difficult to know under the stress and confusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now here is the good part that can not be comprehended, I don&#39;t care who you are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved directly west at a speed undefined, faster than the fasted movement I can imagine. so fast It is undescribable. All I could see was a trail the lghts made going for miles to the west in an instant. Just as suddenly, i could see the street lghts, hospital, neighbors house ... The other most amazing aspect of the event is there was no sound or air movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How could a large object move an incredible speed without creating a vacuum or noise only 15 feet away from me? As best I could see and it was only the trailing lights as if a picture was taken with time photography leaving the lens open. The object flew under the old plane as it continued to bank to the south and east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediatly after my senses returned I asked my girlfriend what was that all about and she remained stunned ans silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we both came to or thought we had our facilties back we went into the house to write down what we thought happened without sharing a single word other than lets write down what we saw and compare notes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both saw the same thing and the essence of our vision is the speed at which the object moved. the blackness of theobject so we couldn&#39;t truly see its shape or size and we felt we were being looked at closely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the end of the story: We thought about calling our local airport sure the old plane was returning to it flying by site with what light was left. We talked ourselves out of it not wanting to draw any attention to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day was a Saturday. We were washing our cars in the back yard listening to a local station on the radio. There was a break in by the announcer saying a sheriff or policeman was chasing a ufo near blue earth minnesota. the anouncer had the sheriff or policeman on line saying he would spped towrds the object getting within a block or two when the object would speed off at 90 degress at phonominal speed for a few miles and stop again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten minutes the activity of the law man stopped and the station went back to normal broadcasting and not another word was said of the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You coulod verify the incident by calling Blue earth police it was very near to that farming comunity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally-- one night in the early fall and it was pitch dark out. A group of us were returning from a another night at a restaurant -- no drinking-- at or about 8;00 when we noticed a huge explosion like lobe orange in color from the ground to about 100 feet by 100 feet and a true half circle. We had met at the restaurant so we were in idividual cars all returning home as neighbors. The area is in the country between two small towns some 15 miles apart. One is Cleveland MN and the direction of the orange lobes was toward Madison Lake MN. Every 3 to 4 minutes there would be another huge orange lobe coming from the ground and moving awa from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to follow the orage lobes like bomb blasts for the next 15 miles but couldn&#39;t keep up. As we traveled the 15 miles we could see the orange blasts from the road going into the horizon. I believe i was travelling south but not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was single orange blast with no sound nothin like lightning more like a half sphere shape associtaed with a bomb blast. all of the neighbors saw it and wondered again what in the hades did we just see.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/1/88 19:00|North East Orlando (near Altamonte Springs)|FL|Disk|5 to 10 minutes|My dad and I were traveling on I - 4 heading towards Deltona (Where my parents live) when I heard a whistleing noise that was increasin|10/19/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/010/S10137.html|43|ndxe198806| My dad and I were traveling on I - 4 heading towards Deltona (Where my parents live) when I heard a whistleing noise that was increasing. I looked out the passenger side of the car and saw a saucer shaped U.F.O. flying past the car heading towards the ground. My dad, who was driving, said &#34;look at that&#34;. I turned to see hom looking out the top of the windshield of the car and I looked up.  There was another U.F.O. flying over the top of the car, heading towards the ground and over the highway.  I remember him saying &#34;There&#39;s no engine noise&#34;.  The U.F.O.&#39;s were a bright, but not blinding, white light.  The one that flew over the car, I could see the underside, which was dark.  But I could see rounded shaped objects, about 3 or 4. Perhaps lights enclosers?  The U.F.O.&#39;s then both flew towards the Highway meeting near the ground. Then they BOTH WENT STRAIGHT UP INTO THE DARK SKY, SIDE BY SIDE. They seperated once they got very high into the sky.  One went over to the left and the other went towards the right..  There they sat still, real high in the sky.  The one on the left, I was able to watch a while, was blinking on and off it&#39;s light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The U.F.O.&#39;s were saucer shaped, and they were of a white light. They whistled when they were traveling at a great speed.  It sounded like the front window vent opened of a truck or like the window vents of the older cars of the sixty&#39;s.  The whistleing became louder as they went past us.  The light coming off the U.F.O.&#39;s was bright, but NOT a blinding light.  I was amazed, to say the least.  My dad to this day will NOT talk about it. The U.F.O. that went over the car was round and dark when I looked up, but as it came down in front of the car, I was able to then see the sides of it. It also was a white lighted, and saucer shaped.   The two U.F.O.&#39;s then met each other, VERY close to the Highway, in front of us, ABOUT (Approx.) 200 hundred yards, then they shot STRAIGHT UP, side by side, into the sky.  They seperated, once they got very high into the night sky.  The one on our left, went to the left and the one on our right went towards the right.  I sat there watching the one on the right out the right side of the car for as long as I could see it.  It moved around a bit, from side to side, then it sat still.  It looked like a star at that point.  It was blinking on and off it&#39;s light.  We were traveling on I-4, heading East towards Deltona, where my parents live.  We were out side city limits of Altamonte Springs, Florida.  I want to say around Lake Mary, Florida when we saw them.  I have read many books of U.F.O.&#39;s since then.  My father still will not talk about it when ever I bring it up, which is very frustrating for me.  The U.F.O.&#39;s were Approx. 40 feet in Diameter. I was absolutly amazed when they shot straight up.  Nothing happened to the car while we observed this.  There were other cars on the Highway, besides us.  The cars that were heading West, on the other side, looked like they slowed down a bit when the U.F.O.&#39;s were coming down in front of us.  I talked to a Mr. ((name deleted)) about my story once, back in about 1994.  He claimed that he was a U.F.O. researcher and he knew people that seriously researched U.F.O.&#39;s.  I felt really good telling him about it.! I wasn&#39; t met with &#34;yeah right&#34; sort of thing that most people react to.  I have NOT told any one else about it exept my husband and of course my mom upon arriving to my parents house.  I know that my dad has not told anyone.  I have only gotten him to say that he saw &#34;Something&#34;.  I am now 42 years old. I was 31 years old when we saw the U.F.O.&#39;s in the Fall of 1988.  My dad is now in his 70&#39;s.  I only want to be contacted through my E-mail address, or by my house mail. I do not think my husband would like for me to be doing this.  I did not even tell him about my meeting with Mr. ((name deleted)).  I wish not to be contacted by my telephone.<n>

Not knowing what he was talking about, I  looked over. Hovering off the ground, about 20 ft., was a red transparent ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it seemed like time stood still as we past the object. Both of us turned our heads  as we went past. I was&#39;nt driving so I looked out the back window until I lost sight  of it. I was stunned! We said nothing for the next couple minutes. When we approached  Santa Rosa [about 5 miles down hwy 12] at the intersection of hwy 12 and Stony point  rd. there was the object in front of us. I&#39;m still not sure if it was the same one  or a second one. The only thing said was by my cousin.

We slept in hammocks tied to small trees with few leaves present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around one in the morning, the little town close to where we were turned off the electric power.  So we were in the dark except for a bright moon up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five minutes after the town went dark this object flew overhead heading north.  It was the size of VW bug, round, shiny white as a the most perfect brightest mirror you have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around the white mirror there was a solid green light all around the object.  The object flew silently over the river heading towards the ocean. If I had a bow and arrow I could have hit it. The light was so bright that I could see everything around me almost like it was daylight, except that all was green.  I asked my father :&#34;Did you see that?&#34;  He said : &#34;Yes.&#34;  My father&#39;s friend was asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later I asked him about the object and he denied having seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to be an astronomer when I was a kid so I am familiar with meteors and astronomical objects.

My eyes opened about 4:00 AM, judging from the constellations overhead.  I looked directly above me, and was caught off guard by a very slow moving satellite in orbit exactly overhead.  It was pretty faint.  I was barely able to detect its movement except that I watched it for over a minute, and I could see that it had slowly moved against the backdrop of stars, making its way southward.  Then, without warning, the satellite took a sharp 90 degree turn and accelerated to an incredible amount of speed in a westward direction.  Within a fraction of a second it was gone.  From what I remember I only saw it for a few moon lengths after it had taken the right turn before it was gone from view.  I was in my early teens at the time.  I refused to believe I had seen something extra terrestrial since I was a big science buff, and had always observed the scientific consen! sus refute UFO&#39;s as having been extra terrestrial spacecraft.  For over 20 years I didn&#39;t even think about what I saw until I began hearing the myriad of other UFO recounts that described lights taking sudden right degree turns like the one I saw.  It&#39;s still hard for me to accept that what I saw was extra terrestrial, but whatever I saw it seemed to violate the laws of physics, at least in terms of propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Before I cold take a breath, the UFO skimmed along the top of the tree lined Road.  It made NO sound what so ever. My heart jumped, and I jammed my breaks on.  It seemed to travel in a perfectly straight line over the tree tops.  I could ot determine how high the object was.

We were amazed by what we saw, a  Large round bright firey object in the western night sky. The object had no tail,made no sound  but was travelling in downward motion, very slowly..it illuminated the whole area in which we live. We decided to pursue this abject, i was exceeding the speed limit by some margin, when out of nowhere, 3 police cars without there lights flashing speed right past us(I assume in pursuit of the same object). Not one didn,t even bother stopping me to issue a speeding ticket....as this happened my friend  yelled out &#34;it,s gone&#34;.. it just dissapeared...I thought it might have crashed.....it was still up there when it just dissapeared....he replied.. The next day we listened to the radio for news on last nights incident even bought the newspapers for the next few days,...not one single mention....We couldn,t believe it, how something so big and bright could go unreported.....to this day we are still very confused on what we saw<n>

We were at the overlook and what is nicknamed &#34;lovers Leep&#34; awaiting a chance to glimpse the Moonbow under the full moon when we noticed the extremely huge object that covered so much of an area it was unbelievable. It was monstrously large in size, The night skies where so bright with the moon we could view every inch of this thing that was presented to us. It was coming in at treetop level from the other side of the river toward Somerset and barely or slowly moving and made no sound at all. Needless to say we where stunned and stood there looking at this thing until it came to a complete stop over the center of the river and still due to its size and us kind of being in a valley we could not see the whole thing at once and it was right there, Right in our face and larger than any object that we have seen in our lives. The only way to describe it is just like the saucer that you would have seen in the movie &#34;V&#34; With the exception of the lights in the bottom.  But I am not embarrassed to say when it stop and we where underneath this thing that had rows of lights from big to small encircling each but not bright though just enough to light up the area around them where you could see the surface of the material this thing was made out of.  I yelled for everyone to run and we ran without stopping back to our vehicle, which in itself is a good distance. Once we started, believe me we where so scared that we did not even look back and was very happy to see our vehicle. We sat there in the car for a while and waited for people to be scrambling every where, We knew someone had to see this thing due to its size, We knew that hundreds had to view it because it was so big. But that never happened and after about 30 minutes a Park Ranger was making his rounds through the parking lot in his vehicle and being as excited as we where we ran him down and asked! if he h ad seen it. And this was after we informed him that we had not been drinking. He said no he had not seen it and immediately started telling us about a ghost that he has seen on the bridge that is located above the falls and I knew at that time that we where in the middle of a wasted conversation.  That has been many years ago and I never thought about putting it on the web until now when I was searching to see if there were any other sightings around that time. This could have even been 1989 but I am about positive it was 88. And believe me people this was nothing man made and it still scares me to this day thinking back on it with my friend that saw it with me as it did my X she never did like thinking about it. What I would like to know is they’re anyone else around that area that may have seen this thing on that night?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was late spring or early summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was somewhat overcast yet still bright.  My then-boyfriend and I were traveling to Big Bend, TX for a camping trip.  We were on the road from El Paso, and we were just outside of Valentine, TX when this happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was at the wheel and I noticed a jet flying in the distance above, moving left to right as we looked through the front windshield.  The jet was black.  It was close enough to see that it was a jet, but not so close that we could see any logos or other colors that may have been on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A beam of darkness shone out from the front end of the jet.  The beam was perfectly straight; it looked like it was coming out of the very tip of the nose of the jet.  It was just like a beam from a flashlight except that it was a beam of darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend saw it too and we talked about it for several minutes while it was in view.  We wondered if a &#34;flashdark&#34; had been invented that would project darkness into a lighted space in the same way that flashlights project light into darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw your March report from the family in IL that saw the same thing, I decided to make this report.
