6/7/45 07:00|Winston-Salem|NC|Disk|seconds|I always thought this sighting should be on an official list, now, 60 yrs. later, it is.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45782.html|2|ndxe194506| I always thought this sighting should be on an official list, now, 60 yrs. later, it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you are keeping records of post-war sightings, here&#39;s one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a brief encounter, that left a lasting impression.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was silent, hovering, greyish metal and disk shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the disk shape, picture a hat with a low rounded crown, where a hat band would normally be there was a row of windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a sense that someone was inside  but it was not distinct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother is the person who saw it. She was waiting for the bus in the early morning, happened to look up, was stunned to see this thing hovering over the top of a flat roofed building (Sears Roebuck) across the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She didn&#39;t want to take her eyes off it, but wanting someone else to see it, she turned to get their attention, in that instant of turning away, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location where this happened was very near the main part of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was, if memory serves, a Union Carbine/Western Electric plant about a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their business may have been defense work &lt;--not sure about that, but certainly not aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was appx. 1945. It remained a vivid memory until she died in 1983.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She drew sketches of it, and I grew up hearing the story many times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was not a hokus-pokus sort by any means.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I clicked onto this website from a connecting news report today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is good to know of a place to record such events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Imagine how horrible it would be to have such an experience and have no one to tell who understood that these things do happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Doss,was mustered out of the Air Force and trains to home were scarce.  In his free 2 weeks before leaving California,he chose to visit Salinas AFB.  After visiting friends there he accidentally wandered into a resticted area.  In a large hangar,labelled &#34;Top Secret&#39;,he observed and examined 3 flying discs.  All had USAF markings,and tripod landing gear.  No obvious method of propulsion could be found.  He was arrested ,interrogated and forced to sign a secrecy agreement.Some of this was done at pistol point.  He deeply resented being treated that way by his government. He told me of this incident before he died in 1990.He said,  &#34;There arent aliens flying those UFOs.....they are ours&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The object pulled up alongside of our B-17and appeared to just observe us. One of our gunners ran a string of 50cal bullets down the length of the object,but we didn&#39;t see any effect on the craft. Therupon the object left our vicinity, rapidly. We had departed England for the run at about 0800 Many other crews sighted these objects during WW11<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
