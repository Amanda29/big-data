When the clock read 11:59 I was getting ready for the 10 second countdown when I heard a sound like a computer starting up except it was much louder. I looked up and saw 6 tear droped objects shaped like a triangle the lead one was the biggest it was a red glowing color. The other five were smaller and were a yellow glowing color. They were flying to the south-east.They started circling in the air on top of me. I told my friend and they looked and asked what is that? When my friends started the ten second countdown I looked away. When I looked up the shapes were gone. I work at a plane muesem thirty minutes away from my house. I have never seen anything like those things before. I was wondering if anyone else has ever seen anything like that before.<n>

The area is very rural so there is no background lighting from any populated area.  The house where we were is situated on top of a hill facing east-southeast.  Directly across the highway from the house is a field that had recently been clear-cut.   The house is about 1/8 mile from the highway.  Anyway, the night was clear and we were all getting ready to party.  I can attest that the friend I arrived with and myself had not had any alcohol yet.  I can&#39;t speak for the others.  We were all out in the yard just off the front porch.  I turned away from the porch and looked across the highway, as I guess others did at that time, since we all chorused in on a &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; comment at about that same time.  What I observed was a pink, amorphous object perhaps 1 mile away, directly over the aforementioned field.  I guess at that distance it was about the size of a nickel held at arm&#39;s length.  By this time everyone had looked, but I guess we were all pretty much speechless.  The center of the object appeared to change color slightly, maybe going into an orangish color.  The shape of the object had been shifting continously and at no time had taken on a &#34;normal&#34; shape.  It moved towards the south very slowly on level, then took about a 35 degree or so downward turn. It continued down for what I guess would be 25 yards or so, then came to a stop directly above a small stand of trees that had not been cut.  After a few seconds, the object began to descend downwards, still very slowly, and went behind the stand of trees, I assume to land, and we lost sight of it.  The object had no lights but rather the entire thing glowed with the pinkish light.  It could be called a neon pink probably, as it was pretty intense.  The idea of investigating came up, but was quickly voted down due to mass cowardice(myself included I must admit).  I&#39;ve heard a lot of stories and seen a lot of strange things around there, but that one took the cake! Anyway, we were all there for at least an hour afterwards, I personally watched the area very closely, but did not see the object again.  My friend and I discussed it later and agreed that it was unlike anything we had seen.  I&#39;ve also ready several reports on here and haven&#39;t read of anything like it.  Maybe it was swamp gas, but we don&#39;t think so.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Population of the island was about 1000 people and is a very quite island. No artificial light was observed. We were sitting facing East. The object flew in a North to South direction. At first thought it was a comet. Then realized it was traveling more like a satelite. Path was parallel to the earth at 10,000 feet. I am a pilot and feel the altitude was accurate and the speed was in excess 800 knots. No flashing anti collision lights, just a bright glow with a yellowish color. A slight trail was evident. Absolutley no sound was heard. We watched the object pass behind a cloud and reappear which gave me the impression that it was fairly close to us and not in the outer atmosphere. The clouds were scattered at 3000 feet.<n>

I was facing north, stand at the back of my van. I looked up at the sky to see the stars. The  moon was full and to my right at a 2 O&#39;clock position. I did a double take, some the stars seem to be moving. I heald onto the van door and leaned back so I could look directly over head. There was about 24 points of light, the same as a star moving east to west directly over head. There were no flashing light on white light. They were in no pattern. They were speratic in the sky. They were moving at the same speed. Seemed to faster than a airplan. It no more than 5 min. or less to cross the sky.<n>

A highly brilliant white/blue light appeared south of our position. It was at least 25,000 ft or more above ground when first spotted it dropped several thousand feet dimmened then brightened again then dimmened to a pinpoint light before dissapearing. Most remarkable thing was it&#39;s almost total verticle descent. It was not a reentry pattern nor was there a tail as in comet or meteor. The light was the size of a dime as viewed from our location and more than ten times brighter than any landing lights i&#39;ve ever seen. My background- 22yr retired USAF veteren with more than 10 years experience as a special fuels handler with various black project programs. I know the light configs of almost every military and comercial aircraft including one&#39;s the general public has&#39;nt even been made aware of. this object defies any flight pattern i&#39;ve ever seen and i&#39;ve seen some strange ones. will try to send map<n>

That’s when the government began looking for another stratigic area to continue working and developing these top secret and UFO related projects, a place where the media and ufoligist couldn&#39;t get close to or wouldn&#39;t be able to find or have any access to any information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After looking and searching very hard for an area in the US, the government finally decided on the small island of Vieques ( a sister Island of Puerto rico) This island is located on the east side of Puerto rico and it was part of the Roosevelt Rhodes military base in PR. Part of the island was used for fighter jet target practice, a firing range for aircrafts. Roosevelt base in the town of Ceiba was one of the largest navy installations of the US. This was the place where the government decided to continue their most important and top secret projects from area 51. Here at Ceiba is where the largest and most secretive aircraft carriers and submarines were based.  Know in order for the government, to continue working these projects and kept secret.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These would be conducted from one of the aircraft carriers, at about 10 to 15 miles out to sea. This is how they would keep all the information from top secret UFO and other highly secret projects away from the press and anyone interested on the government activities.  This lasted for about 10 years before the citizens of Puerto Rico and Vieques realized that something was really going on, other than the actual military training that the government was allowed to conduct according to the agreement for using the island of Vieques for training.  A large number of fishermen began reporting sighting out at sea and around an aircraft carrier.  When more of the press began to look into the matter, the government also began to cover most of what was going on, specially the sightings or anything that was related to the UFO phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many reports where made at the base in Ceiba but nothing was ever mention or little was done to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while a conflict between the local residents of Vieques and the military began to escalate.  No one really understand how this all began.  Some say the government posing as local residents started instigating in order to create a situation where the public would be held responsible for misinforming the press about what ever the government was actually doing on the island of Vieques and out at sea. Many sightings were reported and many civilians came forward with information and actual data on the activities that were being conducted from these aircraft carriers out at sea.  No one seems to know where or who has the information and the reports made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve tried to locate anything related to this but; all I find is that there was a political conflict and that most of the military base personnel had to move from Vieques.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well if anyone has information please set it free.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It seemed to cover a lot of distance in a matter of just a couple of seconds coming to a complete halt. The object appeared to be several thousand feet in the air probably somewhere over the Deleware Bay and it dropped at an alarming rate coming to a complete stop in mid-air. It then changed directions moving from left to right or from south to north at the same rate of speed again halting in mid-air. The first object then disappeared. I was driving my car down Oyster Rd. in CMCH at the time and hit the breaks to get a better look at these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently, I would guess about 14 months ago, I saw the same style of object behave in that same manner again over the Del.

It didnt look like a star or aircraft, it was yellow in color. I told my wife to get the cam corder. The object started to desend rapidly. It leveled off after a few seconds. My wife recorded the object for aprox 15 to 20 sec. then the battery went dead she changed the battery and the object was gone or out of sight. when we played the tape back there was a black rectangle inside the light as if it was part of it. Thinking it could have been an anomily in the camera, I took and shot video of the moon and a star. The rectangle never showed up in the moon or star. With the camera zoomed in the object was about the size of the moon. With the naked eye it looked like the size of an airplane about 5 to 10 miles away.<n>

Hovered over ocean,motionless suspended for approx.1 min. Low humming - like a transformer then propulsion sound like a jet - moved slowly north towards Wrightsville Beach - I was close and saw details - definetly not of this world; reported to Air Natl Guard - they laughed at me. (I would have laughed too, but I&#39;m not laughing now)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My business had been hurt by hurricane Fran so I was forced to take a second job at night watching condos on the beach.  The island was basically deserted and I would spend all night just sitting watching the stars and listening to the radio.  I was listening to the Peach Bowl and looked up and noticed a star that looked weird - different.  All of the sudden it began to move violently from side to side and the next thing I know it was about 1/4 mile from the shoreline and about 300 feet in the air.  It looked like a boomerang but it also had hight - somewhat like a cone but not symetrical both ways.  I got out of the truck and went down to the water ( I honestly thought that I had to be hallucinating ).  It hovered there and there was an electical sound; like when you turn on the toy train but not enough to make the train move.  I swear this thing didn&#39;t move in any direction for about 1 minute.  Then there was a sound like a jet - but not a roar like a jet - more like when the blower goes on from the heater in the house.  It moved slowly northward maintaining its distance from the coast.  It wasn&#39;t in a hurry and obviously didn&#39;t seem to mind if anyone saw it.  The island was mostly evacuated due to the hurricanes aftermath.  All I can think of is that it was surveying hurricane damage??  There is an Air Natl Guard base directly accross the street from where this happened.  I was so shook up by this that I drove there the next day and reported the incident to the commanding officer.  He told me he believed me, but I think he was just humoring me.  Anyway - I saw what I saw and I will never doubt again other accounts of sightings.  What I saw is absolutely not possible with our technology - either we have some unbelievable technology that we don&#39;t know about or I saw something from another world.  By the way .... it was concave on the back.<n>

There were shrimp boats on the horizon that identified where the sea ended and the night sky began. It was obvious that this craft was in the air.

I have seen many shooting stars, and this didn&#39;t look anything like a shooting star. This is the second green fireball I have seen falling. The last was in the first week of Nov. 98 and that sighting lasted for only a second. That fireball was clearly visible about 30 degrees above the horizon and large enough to see it&#39;s head and tail destinctively. Interestingly the tail flared out and was wider farther from the head of the fireball and much thiner near the head. However the last green fireball which I saw on the Dec. 28, 1998 could not be made out clearly because of a dark rainy sky. But I could see a large glowing green light falling in or just behind the clouds above and in front of me as I drove west on 50 outside of Orlando. The fireball *seemed* to have fallen well into the lower parts of the atmosphere when it terminated. Unfortuneatly I have no way of estimating how quickly it was moving or how far away it really was. It just seemed close. Compared to a shooting star it moved very slowly. And seemed to just be falling. After about 3 seconds it terminated with a brilliant flash which lit up the clouds in a white light. Though the fireball itself was green.<n>

While watching the dogs outside I noticed a very bright light that seemed to be coming towards my home from about 10 to 15 miles away. I thought nothing of it until it started drifting slowly up then down then around but generally in the same spot. It began quickly flashing orange lights then dimmed into the darkness but quickly lit up again w/a bright white light. It continued w/this flashing pattern for the duration of the event. It never got any closer or further away until about 6 a.m. then it slowly lowered below the treeline out of sight. I woke my husband after watching it for the 1st min. or so. He was intregued enough to watch the entire event. The event occured in the western sky at varying distances above the neighborhood treeline. We couldn&#39;t detect a shape for sure. Only flashing lights that seemed to surround the object.<n>

It was a clear night, just a couple days after Christmas and the area we were in was located around forest preserves and low lighting.  We looked up towards the north end of the sky because there were several lights in the distance.  Everyone kept saying they were planes but then quickly dismissed that idea when the lights began to change from white to blue to red in very short bursts, so fast that the colrs seemed to blend togather.  These lights were stationary in their positions.  There were five of them: three formed a perfect triangle and the other two just stayed outside of the triangle.  They never moved for five minutes and then all of a sudden one would disappear completely and reappear on the other side of the triangle.  This pattern repeated itself several times, but the triangle always stayed constant and the lights kept flickering colors.  We didn&#39;t stay outside long because we had to work and also because no one belived it could be a UFO, may be just something that was ahappening over Lake Michigan with helicopters or something.  Helicopters don&#39;t flass several colors at an amazing speed, stay stationary for a while and disappear completely and reappear.<n>

Christchurch, New Zealand. I love astronomy and often have a good look at the Stars on a clear night. I&#39;m not a fanatic about religion or UFO&#39;s and never thought I&#39;d see anything like it. My girlfriend witnessed it briefly, after I woke her up quickly. There I was lying in bed at 4:30am awake, but feeling content. As usual spotting a satellite here and there in the sky. Sometimes looking out the window behind my pillow, sometimes not. -------------------------------------------------- Then I saw a flash of bright white light. as bright as one of the brightest stars. Although, it was more like a pulse. There was no sound. It seemed very high up. But it moved really fast ! 3 pulses, each 2 seconds apart, while moving fast in a straight direction. Then a pause of about 3-4 seconds and two more bright white pulses going in a slightly different direction. ====================================================== Not a satellite... Satellites move much slower, and reflect constant orange light. And move in a straight line. Not a plane... No sound at all, moving too fast, and no red or green tail lights, wing lights or head lights etc. It was traveling almost at the speed of a meteorite or object (like a falling star) entering the atmosphere. Traveling from one side of my large window view to the other, in the space of 10 - 11 seconds. But, it was a pulse like a spot light, quickly pulsing in different directions. Not a window reflection... There was nothing electrical plugged in or switched on in our bedroom. I could almost see it when it wasn&#39;t &#34;pulsing&#34;. Black and much larger than any satelite I&#39;ve ever seen. I yelled at ((Name deleted)) to wake up, not taking my eye off the sighting. she woke up in time to see the last pulse. She said &#34;wow a bright flash ! &#34; ==================================================== That&#39;s all. I felt like running outside, but I was stuck staring in the direction of the last visible pulse. Talked with ((Name deleted)) about it for 20 - 30 minutes. Then she fell asleep about 45 minutes before I did. I have no conclusions. Just, that it was the most unusual thing I&#39;ve ever seen in 20 - 23 years of night sky watching. And happened exactly like I say here. Faithfully. ((Name deleted)).     ( age 33 ) P.S.  this is true. I would never ever make up a story like this. ( unless someone was going to give me a million dollars :) Sorry.... bad joke.  ( the &#34;million dollar&#34; part )<n>

One blueish light in the center, one &#34;pearl&#34; colored light at each end. No lights were flashing but pulsed?.  I thought it was an airplane but when the plane listed to the right, it went left and when it listed to the left, it went right, the opposite of what a plane would do.  It moved to to the left behind a church and some trees and that was the last I saw of it.  I was approximately 300 yards away from it. It appeared to be no more than 50-75 feet in the air! Very curious!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Added to the above information: It was dusk, very slight star sightings.  The sun was setting behind me.  Object appeared to be over farmland.  Object color was black.  Due to the distance, no sounds were heard.  Once it went out of my line of sight (behind the church I was parked next to), I got out of my vehicle and walked towards the back of the church to see it and it was no longer visible.<n>

(prior to this I observed 1 target in the same direction of travel 15 minutes prior, this must been a lead craft) they appeared to be square shaped with a orange white glow, like when the sun goes down,they appeared to be turning in a clockwise direction. As they continued North Bound they disappeared. I lost sight of them. The location of the sighting was in the backyard of my house. I have never seen this type of craft before. These targets were moving at est. 300 kts, I estimate the altitude at 18000-20000&#39;  this whole ordeal lasted apx. 30 seconds<n>

It was a very clear night, we observed it for approx. 15 min. The craft itself was oval, and it had a dome that was lit up.  It was dark in color, dark grey or black.  The lights around the dome were yellow. Also there was heat vapors rising from one end of the craft.  After 15 min. it vanished.<n>

Further observations concluded no lights or becons, no sound and a slow movement from East to West. As it moved further away, it appeared to be somewhat of a triangular shape with two lights that looked like a type of propulsion system on the back, but the actual shape was hard to be determined, it looked triangular like I said, but cannot be positive of that.  Appeared to be about 10,000-15,000 feet with absoulutely no sound.  It was a dull yellow color that was headed towards populated areas such as Youngstown and Cleveland.  I have taken several astronomy classes in college and my father who wittnessed it also flew for a major airline for 30 years, and he said he had no idea what it was.<n>

The rate of speed was quite fast compared to the jets in the sky and the altitude appeared to be approximately 2000 ft.  I it dissappeard over a small mt. range to the west.  No sound as we were in the car.  The size approximately 4 times the size of a jet at that altitude, although it seemed lower and appeared to be decending slightly.

There was no trail of color or anything behind this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were traveling home from Salt Lake county to Utah county on 12-25-98 as I was watching the incoming planes from the south enroute to Salt Lake city airport I saw a round (Full moon shaped) blueish-green glowing object streak across the top of us headed west south west.  It dissappeared over a small mt. range east of Tooele Army Depot.  The duration was only 3-4 seconds, not sound was heard.  My husband didn&#39;t see it as he was driving and watching traffic.  The size appeared to be approx. 4 times that of a jet at that altitude.  It was lower than the clouds and the jets.  It crossed right in front of 1 jet, but lower and seemed to be decending as it went by.  This was the first time I have ever witnessed anything unexplained in the skies.  There seemed to be a aura or haze around this object. There were not blinking lights or other lights on it.  It was just one big glowing sphere.  Thats all.<n>

We are Americans, and decided to see Scotland before our tour was up.  I enjoy History and decided to include a visit to Hadrian&#39;s wall during the trip.  We saw the wall in the last bit of daylight and left as the sky got dark.  We headed east on the B6318 to get back to the A68.  We descended into a heavy fog as the road declined, this is common in England.  While between the Vercovicium Roman Fort and Walwick a very bright light shined on us.  I was driving and at first thought it was a truck with it&#39;s brights on.  My friends and I realized the light was about 40 degrees high in the air behind us.  I slowed the vehicle to 25 mph or so, and rolled the windows down.  Their was no sound.  My friends panicked, but I kept calm and started to look for details, it was difficult as I was driving in the fog.  The light was beaming through the sunroof of the little italian car we had.  The second we ascended out of the fog; the light disappeared we slowed further to identify anything but nothing was in the sky.  I have no idea what it was that followed us for at least 3 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were leaving Kansas City to go to the north.  (it occurred 15 miles south of KCI airport).  As I was the passenger, I looked to the north and saw, against a solidly cloudy sky, what looked like a large dark boomerang.  I cannot really determine the size, as it was not close to any terrestrial objects near the horizon.  It was totally by itself in the sky.  As we were south of the airport, I have often seen airplanes, so I did a doubletake, thinking &#34;that&#39;s not an airplane.&#34; I observed it for 2 or 3 minutes without telling my husband, and then told him.  In that time it moved very slowly to the northwest. Upon my telling my husband about this, he found a place to pull the car over and looked.  We rolled down the window and listened.  We heard nothing.  We watched it together for 2 or 3 minutes, and it gradually disappeared. I am a science teacher, with a masters in education.  My husband is a professional artist with a bachelors degree.  We are both amateur astronomers with the local astronomy club and have spent  much time beneath the night sky, neither ever observing anything that we could not explain.<n>

My girlfriend was leaving my house and I walked her outside to her car. All of a sudden, we both saw a cylinder - shaped object about 50 feet off of the ground and about 300 yards away.  It was transparent , bit inside of the see-thru object were lights flashing-green, red blue, yellow, and white lights. We both saw this object as soon as we walked outside.  While we were stunned staring at it, my dog started barking at it and running thru the field toward it. As soon as my dog got near it, it stated moving away at incredible speeds, so fast that it took about five seconds for it to fly out of sight.  We live in a very small community, and people will not believe us. They will all think we are crazy, so we never told anyone. My mother told me she had a similar sighting in the same area when she was in high schooll<n>

I was watching the stars as it was a very clear night at that time. I was looking at the moon which was about three fourths full, and also seeing some aircraft in the distance. I believe i was facing south east or east looking at the stars just below the moon when an object went from my right to the left, at level flight, no noise whatsoever, no lights of any kind traveling  above the speed of sound at a very low altitude ( a few hundred feet) above the trees in a residential area. I believe the ONLY reason I saw it, was because the moon was almost full and the object passed brtween me and the moon, the angle of the moon caused a reflection to shine off of the skin of the object. Same reflection as polished metal. The object left no trail to be seen (such as a shooting star) I&#39;ve seen shooting stars and all types of aircraft and this WAS NOT either one of them.<n>

This was a family restaurant where no liquor is served.  Just a regular night out with family members in their 40&#39;s &amp; 50&#39;s and a couple of kids.   I went out to the parking lot to get some family photos I left in the car, when I looked next to me I saw a couple &amp; another woman, not with the couple, looking up in awe &amp; when I looked up I saw a round red pulsating ball just hovering right above us (wouldn&#39;t move, like it was watching us) facing north, s. of Miami intl airport close to our home in Coral Gables. It looked alive, like a red plasma of sort - no other colors, no tails &amp; no sound. It was about 2000 feet up in the air &amp; it was big &amp; beautiful red blob. It was about 4 full moons in size. I was in total awe &amp; wanted my husband to see this so I ran inside the restaurant to get him &amp; he sensed my desperation &amp; came right out(took about 2 seconds)&amp; the red ball was moving west (towards the everglades) becoming smaller &amp; smaller until it was the size of a little red pinhead &amp; it disappeared west somewhere.  Well, I&#39;m glad I had my husband witness this with me so he didn&#39;t think I was crazy. We were sort of in shock and casually walked inside,remained silent &amp; didn&#39;t say anything for fear of the family thinking we were nuts.  We have kept this to ourselves for about 5 yrs. We just hope that the other 3 unknown people in that parking lot that night will come out &amp; say something about this spectacular event that has changed the way we view life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I used a fence with a sign in the foreground, with rapid shots, to show movement.  I contacted my brother also, and another neighbor to watch.  I saw a pattern in their movement in an area I am very familiar with, so I was able to track them all the way to my house.  The main colors were two clear (blueish) lights, one in lower left and one in upper right that would flash, then immediately many red lights would flash.  Object could travel any direction, and disappear and reappear at will, but did keep somewhat of a pattern. Always a &#34;lookout&#34; craft before the others would move from one location to another.  I have photos from two sides of the crafts at one point, and they seemed to travel counter clockwise, beginning in the west from my standpoint. I marked all my locations.  The objects did not go away, I simply got exhausted chasing them, sometimes traveling well in excess of 80mph.  Please contact me for more info, I am very thorough.  Almost forgot, before I walked outside at the lakehouse, I heard a large, loud aircraft I figured was a DC-10, but didn&#39;t get sight of it.  Objects also flew very near GA Power Plant! Hammond, and less than half the height of the flashing smokestack, as well as Inland Container Co.  One object emmited a beam clearly in the sky, which was very short, and a beam appeared to have been on the ground once, but no object was in sight.<n>

It was moving in a straight line.It was oval shaped with a dull white color. I did not see any protruding features like wings or tail. Due to its small size it was hard to tell how far it was. I feel it was close to a 1/2 mile ahead. Size comparison to birds [ducks or seagulls] in the vincinity but closer was that of the torso of a large bird at 3 to 400 yards without a head or wings.

I came to the stop light behind three or four cars at the Broadway intersection. At this location the street is on a decline. Basically the terrain here is part of the Platte river basin.It was a clear,cold morning with the Rocky mountains visible in the distance.My office is just 2 miles further west on Evans street.I work for the State of Colorado At A Rehabilitation center for the blind.I am in my 17th year at this job.I am college educated and have never seen anything like this in my 52 years. I&#39;ve had been out of town until today [12/24]so I am, only at this time doing this report. This gave me a lot of time to think about this sighting and to evaluate what I actually saw. What I saw was this: While coming to a halt at the intersection on icy pavement, I looked to the area just past the intersection, I was slightly higher at this spot as the street was on a decline with several cars ahead of me. We were all waiting for the light to change. This afforded me a view of the viaduct ahead that goes over the Platte River. This viaduct is about a 1/4 mile past Broadway. A few large trees line the river bank on the left. I think they are cottonwoods at about 40 feet in height. That puts the trees  to the south side of my west bound route on Evans Street.The sky was clear with a plume of smoke coming off a power plant to the southwest area beyond these trees. As I looked up I was watching 2 or 3 large birds flying around the trees and the river.I then saw the object come into my line of sight from the right heading from north to south,southwest. I fixxed my eyes on the object because of its speed and course. It past by a bird headed in the same direction at a higher altitude and it was moving!!!. The bird it past is what I compared it to in size. The object was farther away and above some power lines as well. The power lines were closer in, but I can go back and visualize the position of the object above the power lines. I watched it for 5 or 6 seconds until it went behind the trees to the south and traffic started to move again. I moved with traffic across Broadway and up on the viaduct past the trees to see if I could see it again. The object was gone. I beleive the sighting was 5 or6 seconds in duration because I later later recreated its velocity with my finger and move my finger as the object moved and counted the seconds. I know this object did not belong over populated Denver at its altitude and speed. It moved in a straight line with maybe a slight incline to the south southwest direction. The object appeared to be between me and the powerplant to the southwest. The speed I estimate would be comprable to a military jet at 3 or 400 miles per hour. The OBject was not a plane.<n>

It was back in December 1998.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from business training in Dallas.  I was between Cincinnati and Cleveland on the interstate driving north.  It was dawn and I had been driving since the previous afternoon so I was pretty tired to say the least.  It was a clear morning and the sky was  just turning blue.  There were very few cars on the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled down the window to get some cold air on my face to wake me up.  I leaned my head out and after a few seconds I tilted my head back to get some wind on my neck.  At about a 75 to 80 degree angle  above me a pewter colored sphere just dropped into my view way up at the edge of the atmosphere.  It paused for a split second then zipped toward the west so fast that my eyes didn’t even try to follow it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A second later another one dropped into view and followed the first one, then a third and then a forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rapidly braked and pulled onto the shoulder without taking my eyes off of the spot where they had appeared.  I got out and watched for several minutes but nothing else happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I say sphere, I could only see the bottom of the….what ever they were so from my perspective I could almost imagine them as being a ball shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved so fast to the west that getting a profile perspective as they moved off was impossible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

While in a very dark section of roadway, the hood of my pickup truck started to glow gold (brown truck), suddenly above, suddenly above my truck I saw a glowing green object heading NNW, at a medium speed, slower than a meteorite but faster than a jet. It continued in this direction for about 10 seconds, when it suddenly turned left, not a curved left, a sharp angle left, and disappeared over the horizon. It was cloudy, so when I arrived at my destination ten minutes later, I turned on the weather channel to note the cloud level at 10,000 feet. It was definitly below the clouds.<n>

It was night time, probably around 8pm, and I saw a triangular object hovering in the sky. I remember there being 3 red lights, one at each point of the triangle, and it may have had a light in the center but I cannot remember. It was hovering in the sky, barely moving, and it must have been relatively low because it appeared fairly large. Then about 8 seconds after I spotted the object, it shot off into the sky with a flash of light and disappeared. It made a sort of zig-zag maneuver, in the shape of an &#34;S&#34; or a &#34;Z&#34;, as it flew away.  It was moving so quickly that it was gone within a second and all I could see was a faint light trail.  I have always been a skeptic so I immediately began scanning the area for any kind of tower or aircraft that could explain what I saw but there was nothing in the area. This sighting was over 10 years ago and I beli! eve it was around Christmas time but I can&#39;t remember the actual date. I am 25 years old and a member of the US Armed Forces. I consider myself a very rational person but I cannot explain what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It appeared for approximately 3 seconds.  At first I thought it was some sort of firework, but, it was too large and it did not burst as most fireworks do.  It had a tail that made it appear as one would think a comet would appear, but then it went out of view.<n>

It was late at night and i had just left a truck stop where i had a cup of coffee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 100 yards off the road to my left there was what appeared to be an accident where someone had rolled over out in the field. There was what appeared to be emergency vehicles there with what looked like a floodlight on the vehicle.  I didn&#39;t stop because there was no need to with what seemed to be emergency vehicles attending. Actually the whole scene seemed surreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i continued down the two lane highway, I remember listening to Art Bell on coast to coast radio and there was a show on that was sort of a take off on that 1948 radio show with Orson Welles and &#34;War of the Worlds&#34;. I remember that on the show, there were alien spacecraft landing around the United States. I remember being momentarily sort of alarmed as i was listening to the broadcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of minutes later, I noticed a light ahead of me shining down on the road and coming towards me.  I assumed that the light was from a medivac helicopter going to the rollover accident to evacuate injured people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light shining down on the road approached and flew over my vehicle I noticed that there was no noise coming from the object which was at a very low altitude (i&#39;d guess no more than 100 ft or so).  I remember how strange it was that a helicopter could be flying that low and make no noticeable noise.  I remember looking in my rear view mirror and saying to myself, what the &#34;F&#34; was that thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically,  I forgot about the whole incident until a couple of years ago when I was talking to my son about UFO&#39;s while we were having dinner at an Applebee&#39;s Restaurant.  Suddenly I just remembered the incident.... as if it was a dream though, and not something that actually took place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He talked to a friend of his who said that I probably had been abducted by a ufo and that they planted the false memories of the accident and the coast to coast show to mask the incident to me. Personally, i don&#39;t really know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing still seems pretty surreal as if it happened but it didn&#39;t happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I saw a bright light, bluish in tone and told my boyfriend to look. It proceeded to come closer. We were going 75 mph and pulled off the Freeway to see this object. Other vehicles were pulling off the road. We heard no noise, it was as big as a football field. It had a dome center. It was oval with a bright blue light emitting from the edges. Bright enough to see the ground beneath it when it tilted. It was hovering , then some guy pulled up behind us w/ broken English saying his lights went out, then he saw the craft and we took off. But It was still there when we drove away and could see it from many miles away.<n>

The object was moving MUCH faster than a satalite.  The object then appeared to gain altitude and gradualy faded from sight.  A meteor was dismissed due to the fact it was moving too slow, had no trail, and it gained altitude and disappeared.<n>

We had just backed out of his driveway when we noticed what appeared to be a red circle in the eastern sky.  Just about a second or two after we spotted it, it streaked off to the south or southeast.  We aren&#39;t quit sure if it changed to an oval shape before it took off or if it just appeared that way to us because it was moving so fast.  It all happened so quick it&#39;s very hard to tell.<n>

I look to the east and saw a green ball of light flash on in the sky. I saw a video of a green fire ball on TV a few months ago and this was the same thing. Right above the tree top I saw the green ball of light &#34;come on&#34; and for a split second I could clearly see an aircraft either producing or behind the ball of light. It slowly went down behind the tree top and disappeared. About a minute later I saw it come up from behind the trees. It did not &#34;come on&#34; this time it was already on. It stayed above the tree top for a few seconds then went back down. I then saw a flash of red light from the same direction. At that time my break was over so that was all I observed, but I clearly an aircraft behind the ball of light. The ball of light was the same color as the green light from a &#34;red light&#34; it looked like an artificial light not a &#34;fire ball&#34;. This incident was observed from Thomas and 33rd Avenue.<n>

I didn&#39;t stop to help because there was enough activity by the scene.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe ten minutes later I witnessed what I thought was a helicopter coming down the highway towards me, shining a light down onto the roadway.  I thought it was a medivac unit going to evacuate accident victims.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the low flying craft approached and went over and past my car, it made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember looking into my rear view mirror and saying out loud, &#34;why didn&#39;t that thing make any noise, what the heck is that thing.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly, I forgot about the incident until at least 6 years later. Somehow the memory came back to me during a discussion about ufo&#39;s with my son.  It&#39;s sort of like remembering a dream and not remembering something that actually took place.<n>

I observed two objects in the western sky emitting different color light flashes.  These objects were stationery, then began movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking to the western sky, I thought I saw a red flash.  I kept looking and saw two objects, both stationery, emitting blue flashes and occasionally a red flash.  I kept watching and noticed some movement in a back and forth direction, first to the east, and then back to the west.  After further observation,  I saw some very erratic movement by these two objects.  The object on the left moved in a southerly direction and then an easterly direction.  The object on the right moved first  northerly, and then began a circular motion.  During this circular motion it would make occasional very fast darts to the east and then back. These objects were very high in the sky.  The one on the left was as bright as a star, the one on the right somewhat dimmer.  These objects were way to high to be any kind of helicopter or other aircraft that I am familiar with.  After 50 minutes of watching this, i saw some kind of green flash of light go across the sky, much lower than these two objects.  At that point, I went inside my house.  I went back outside 12 minutes later, and the objects were no longer there. I am a 39 year old male.  I have a BBA in management and have worked for the same company in sales for 16 years. I have never seen anything before I believed to be a UFO and frankly did not believe in them.  Tonight I witnessed something that I can not explain.  Again, these objects were not any kind of commercial aircraft.  I do not believe any kind of military aircraft could make these erratic maneuvers.<n>

One below the belt of orion and the other to my right which appeared to be a planet. Then I saw a metallic craft pass across the sky right infront of me without any sort of illumination. I coudn&#39;t quite see an exact formation, but I did notice the head of the craft was rounded but the rest just seemed to blend into the sky. This craft disappeared within 6 seconds and the other two lights remained in their position of the constellation without further movement.<n>

There were white blinking lights, they were unevenly spaced on the craft. We both exclaimed, &#34;Pull over&#34;, which we did. We got out and looked up at the saucer, but it was not making any sound at all. It must have been the size of a football field, but not a sound. It moved rather slowly over the trees and disappeared from our view. It was hard to tell exactly what shape it was or exactly how large it was, but it was definitely nothing we could explain. There are no airports or military areas anywhere near Boca Grande. We knew we had seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The others did not move a great deal. Other aircraft, with normal lights on wings and underbelly could be seen in the sky. The white strobe was brilliant; definitely not an aircraft I am familiar with. I used binoculars to get a better look. The craft seemed to be a dull white color, similar in shape to a flying wing (large and rounded in the front and narrowing to a thin edge towards the back). It was north of town, then moved to the southeast, near the area of the Capital City Airport in New Cumberland.<n>

Place thumbs together. Align right edge of right hand to East. Object appeared at a point overhead of the left edge of the two hands. Center the two hands on the new, ENE-ish point, and with the wrists at eye level, the meteor/space debris/ appeared to fall in a path that would trace a line roughly across the fingertips, from center of the two hands to the left, and down the left side of the left hand to a level near the (5th distal metacarpal). There it burned out. No trails, flashing, voluntary movement, colors, or showering particles. The sky was dark and very clear in that direction. The actual time of event is approximate. All other details are correct. I am offering this as a sober accounting of facts just in case of such a need.<n>

I would estimate it&#39;s distance at 1/2 mile away and disapeared approximately 75-100 ft from the ground. We observed the object turn, &#34;White&#34; and then appeared to have a tail for about 1 second before it disapeared. The object&#39;s size could be compared to a dime held at arm&#39;s length.

I was working and I glanced up in conversation. Through the window (a large window with black plastic divisions) I saw what I at first thought was a momentary flash in my field of vision but it remained in my view and I saw something of a very thin white oval, almost a line of white, streaking very quickly across the sky. It was very small, I could have covered it with the tip of my fingernail. It was out of view within a second. I ran outside to get a better look at it but it had disappeared.<n>

Suddenly a cloud appeared very dence about the size of a football field. it was at 11 o:clock to my position range was about 5 mile. I thought how strange only one small cloud in all this sky. As i drove i watched it evaporate, disapere. A few moments passed and suddenly it was back. It was now about 10 o:clock to my position and again it evaporated. It&#39;s position seemned to remain the same. Then it reapeared a third time very dense at first and now at 9 o:clock and only a half mile away. The temperature was about 29F. dry cold air no jet condedsate trails. Could a hot moist enviroment ben generated as a dementional or time craft or crafts stopped for a few seconds to get a bearing on where they were at ? I am making no clame. It&#39;s just something to think about.<n>

The yard faces east and we are located on the Los Angeles/Orange County border just a few miles west of the 57 Freeway. I was looking up at the sky enjoying how clear it was and how many stars I could see... As I looked towards the Big Dipper, just below the last star of of &#34;handle&#34; and falling at a 45 degree angle towards the middle star of the handle, I saw what appeared to be a regular &#34;shooting star&#34; but rather than the whitish appearance I have usually seen, this was a brilliant blue/green color. It was also at least 2 to 3 times bigger and brighter than the brightest stars, yet it seemed pretty &#34;normal&#34; till that point. Then rather than burn out or fade out, it seemed to explode out and for a brief moment get even larger. My first thought was, &#34;It must have entered the atmosphere there.&#34; But what struck me as strange was that the center appeared &#34;darker&#34; than the sky at the moment of &#34;explosion&#34; and this darker area grew larger as the brilliance around it spread out. As the light around the dark hole began to fade, I thought that was the end of it. But then I saw the strangest streak of light, same color as the fireball, begin at appoximately the same place where the fireball first appeared and following the same path. What was strange was that the streak of light did not &#34;behave&#34; as others I have seen. First, it seemed to be separate and distinct from the fireball that preceeded it instead of the tail of the fireball. Second, rather than have the tail end begin to fade as the front end moves, this streak maintained its brilliance until the front end reached the &#34;dark hole&#34; that was still faintly visible. (If I hold my hand out and use my fingers to measure how long the streak appeared, it was two and a half to three inches long.) Then, even stranger, rather than fade away, it appeared to remain stationary for a moment before it ap! peared to accelerate and dissapear INTO this dark hole. Again, it did not dissapear as I have seen before, with the tail end fading first but rather the front end fading at the location of the &#34;hole&#34; and the rest of the streak following. I have never seen anything quite like this before, nor have I ever seen anything that out of the usual. I am 45 yrs old, married to the same man for almost 20 years, have 2 teenage sons. Although I am a full time mom, prior to my having children, I was trained as a professional proof-reader and worked for several years at this for Los Angeles County. So I am used to noticing what is &#34;wrong&#34; or out of the ordinary. This was certainly &#34;out of the ordinary&#34;.<n>

They were in a ununiformed formation, &amp; all had massive comet-like tails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 12/16/98 2 friends and I were fishing on Long Key, Florida.  We were fishing from a bayside dock, and at approx. 11:30pm we witnessed a phenomenal event.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw the sky light up, when I turned my head I thought I was seeing things.  I immediately got my friends attention and we all stared in amazement.  There seemed to be approx. 12 objects moving from the southwest (Keywest area) towards the northeast.  Each one of the objects had a comet-like trail behind them, this trail made them all seem to blend together into one bright blob.  They were in a disorganized formation and they moved at a constant and straight forward path.  They looked to be a yellowish-white coloration similar to that of a bright star.  They took up a very large portion of the sky.  We watched them for approx. 30 seconds.  We first saw them half-way through the sky and watched them fade out over the horizon.  Each of the objects appeared to be round or comet like in shape.  From our vantage point they seemed to be much larger than stars, planes or even the Hailey&#39;s Comet. Considering that only a few hours earlier we started bombing Irag, our first thought was that it was a large group of missiles.  They moved much slower than a shooting star or meteor, however, they moved faster than a typical airplane or helicopter.  After witnessing the event the three of us starting driving home.  We saw a car stopped on the side of the road about a 1/4 of a mile from where we witnessed the event.  We stopped to ask if they needed help.  They said that they were fine, and asked us if we had seen the lights in the sky.  We were thrilled that someone else had seen the lights.  As we were talking about the lights, their road-side assistance pulled up.  The driver of the road-side assistance was estatic, he too saw the lights.  The driver told us he watched the lights for over a minute (from one side of the sky to the other).  As we were driving home we wondered how many others had seen this event tonight.<n>

It appeared to be some kind of glowing fireball against the night sky.  It left no trails.  It appeared to have arms radiating from its center to other spherical shapes much like a &#34;jack&#34; (like ball and jack kids game piece).  I watched the object extiguish its glow.  For a couple seconds after that I could see the &#34;jack&#34; shape against the night sky.  It looked metallic.  I was driving south on hwy 99 near the California Avenue exit in Bakersfield, CA.  I watched the object as I exited the freeway and had enough time to pull over and get out of the car to observe.  Approximately two minutes had passed since I had made eye contact with the object.  The skies were clear.  I am a college graduate. I work as a commercial producer at a radio station.<n>

Novice amateur astronomer.  Have seen few very strange things in the sky but always keep an eye out. Driving north on Indiana Highway 10 into Demotte, Indiana, stopped at a stopsign, I observed a glowing green teardrop-shaped &#34;meteor&#34; or &#34;fireball&#34; for approximately five seconds. Light snow had fallen a few hours earlier and the sky was still mostly cloudy. The glowing object appeared below the cloud layer a degree or two west of north and, falling at approximately 30-40 degrees from vertical towards the west, fell slowly for about 5 seconds and disappeared in place, not fully obscured at any time. There is a line of telephone poles 10&#39;-12&#39; to my left.  Three strands of tinsel are strung tightly between the poles with, perhaps, a 2&#34;-3&#34; sag at the center.  Three strands of tinsel approx 18&#34; apart from each other, the highest strand at about 13&#39; from the ground and horizontal.  The object fell below the level of the highest strand and disappeared before it&#39;s short tail was bisected lengthwise by the middle strand, from my perspective at about 4 feet off the level ground (in my car). The complete length of the object, from the perspective, was about a third the distance between the strands of tinsel. I expected the object to hit the ground;  it did not.  It did not change direction, velocity, intensity color, shape or size.  The core glowed more brightly than the glowing &#34;aura&#34; and tail.  There was no trail. The color was like the green of a night vision scope.<n>

The object rapidly decended from a approx 8000 ft to below the treetops in a perfect (not parabalic) line 45 degrees downward, appearing to head NE.  The object maintained its albeit small (point of light) shape for the duration of observation.  The light was white, it had no visible tail, no sparks, suggesting it wasn&#39;t a meteor.  Distance to object is uncertain due to small size of light.<n>

At approximately 19:40CST, witness #1 and witness #2 were traveling in a vehicle together when the object was again seem southbound over the southwest part of Lubbock.  The object slowed, hovered, and then accelerated to the south, making a low sweeping turn to the east, completing the 180 degree turn to the north and sped out of sight.  When the witnesses pulled off the street to look at the object, they heard it making a pulsing humming sound.  The radio in their automobile was tuned to an FM station.  Something else came over the radio at a louder volume.  Mixed in with the FM broadcast was a louder voice speaking in English.  It seemed to be one side of a two-way conversation, not unlike a telephone call.  The object was very dark or black.  Witness #1 is very familiar with civil and military aircraft and stated that he had never seen anything like this before.

I do not know the shape of the object but only the shape the lights formed - either a square or triangle. Sorry but I simply can&#39;t remember if it was three or four red lights. I think it was four red lights in a square shape. Also I am not sure of the date.  I know it was either 12/15 or 12/16 between the hours of 11pm and 12pm.  If I had to pick a date I would say 12/15. What I did not forget however is how fast it appeared to be moving across the sky.  I would say about 20 times faster than a plane at that distance.

The back window of our car had busted out previously, and it was snowing outside, and we all had our coats on with hoods up because it was so cold. I was talking to my older son, and suddenly my middle son yelled out &#34;Mama!&#34; and interrupted me. I looked in the rearview mirror to see what he wanted that was so important as to interrupt me, and all of my children were looking up through the empty back window, with shock on their faces. I looked up through the front window, and as close to us, as if it were only three stories above, sat a Hugh dark, saucer shaped, solid object. It had no sound what so ever, and hovered or sat in the sky right above us. I stopped the car, and we all got out. This saucer like object had beautiful flowing lights all around the mid section of it, and was as big as a base ball diamond. We were on Beltline Rd, near the Naval Air Station. We stood there for a few moment! s, and suddenly the craft shot off in the direction of Arlington from us to the right. It went so fast, and made no sound, that I have never seen even a jet move so fast. I called the police station when we got home to report it, and the officer said they had no reports of any sightings, and that I could call the Naval Air Station and inquire. I called the Navy Base, and the person on the phone assured me that they had no reports of any thing like we had witnessed. It has been many years sense that day, but none of us have ever forgotten it, and it burns in my memory as if it were today. I was NOT a believer in such things before this day, but am now! I saw what I saw, and no one can ever take that from me. We didn&#39;t talk about it to too many people because back then, no one would have listened, even the police officer laughed at me. I have been in the US Navy myself and know the Need to Know is keep from the public from our government.

This ligths are rotating in group around a center in one direction for nearly 180 degrees than stop for a half second an turn back. This repeats while the groupt slow moves toward north. The formation has a round corner. There was at least 9 ligths in the group. They have a low intentsity and a nearly round form with some structures. The turning cycle was very exact. This means they turn, stop and turn in other direction very exact. The sky was cloudy an for my meaning they where above the clouds. I have never seen such lights before, i´m not a UFO-Believer and was in military service (close air defense) in from 1989-1990. There are no craft i know, that´s looks similiar.

We thought they were satellites until they made course changes, one first, then the other following.  We had the impression one was trying to evade the other ?? Suddenly, the light on the right sent a tremdously bright beam of light toward the other, an instant later it was returned.  This continued for the entire time we watched before they went out of sight across the horizon.  NOTE:  In the time we lived in that area, there were NUMEROUS unexplained sightings (1997-1999).  None were &#34;up close and personal&#34;, always at a distance.  There seems to be a unusual interest in that area ?  We realize this report and the other submitted, mean very little in of themselves.  However, we had no means or method to report them at the time (we just found your web site, new computer....).  The bottom line of all of this is simply, there seems to be inordinate activity in the area, certainly by military aircraft, and by unidentifed lights as well.  For what it&#39;s worth...<n>

I then realized this was something I had never encountered before, all my life I have had paranormal experiences that I couldn&#39;t explain, but thius was the first sighting of a craft like this one. I lost sight of it above the cab of my truck as I passed it. I thought of pulling off the side of the road to take a closer look, but fear took over as the thought came to me that if Icould see them,then they could see me. as I drove toward town, going down hill now, I glanced at my rearview mirrow and saw it still sitting in the same place. If any of the cars going uphill noticed the craft, I saw no brakelights come on, if they had stopped then I would have too. or if someone else had been with me I might have pulled over, but being alone I wasn&#39;t taking any chances. I must say&#39; that I never thought u.f.o,s really existed that couldn&#39;t be explained, but I now know that they exist. I can&#39;t say whether it was something our government has that they&#39;re not disclosing to us, but I must say that I would have not been able to have comprehended that something the size of this craft could just sit there wthout making a sound or! movemen t that I could detect. and let me add that this was a bright night, as I could see there was nothing under this craft holding it up, thats when I realized what I was seeing.Thank you for reading this, keep an open mind to the fact that many things exist in our universe that cannot be explained by rational minds, I feel that I have been blessed by getting a peek.<n>

It looked like an equilateral triangle. The middle of the triangle had  no lights and was dark because the time was about 9 o&#39;clock at night (or thereabouts). It was mid-December of 1998, approximately. There was no noise whatsoever as it passed over my home at an extremely low rate of speed while heading directly west. The Lehigh Valley International Airport is nearby so I am aware of the various shapes of aircraft lights at night and this object did not fit the light patterns that are  known to me. Also, airplanes make noise. This thing did not make any sound at all. I just told a few friends, some of whom said they had heard  similar stories from others.<n>

I stopped my car and started my videocamera,and filmed it hovering there. I zoomed in as tight as I could, then panned back, and as after I did, I saw a black streak shoot up out of the lake, there was just enough twilight left to see it against the sky. It shot up like a bullet. It happened in an instant, but I remember thinking that someone must be shooting something at this craft. But as it reached the altitude of the first craft it began to light up, and suddenly it was a second brilliantly lit craft hovering in the sky, about one hundred yards to the right of the first craft and a little bit higher. I was really shocked, it happened so quickly, I&#39;ve never seen anything move like that, in less than one second it went from the water to hovering in a fixed position in the sky. I kept the camera fixed on the two craft as I undid my seatbelt and got out of the car,and they hovered there for several more minutes. Then the first craft seemed to change, it turned into what appeared to be a flat triangle, which began to pulse and fly slowly past the second object, then slowly looped back around again, remaining nearby the second craft. Conventional airplanes began approaching the second craft, also flying closeby to it.                                       The second craft (the one that shot up into the sky) remained hovering for several more minutes, at times motionless, then drifting slowly slowly one way, then heading back in the other direction towards the southern end of the lake. It started to move more quickly,heading across my field of visio! n so I was seeing the side of the craft. If it were an airplane or helicopter I&#39;d have seen the tail lights, strobing lights, or individual lights, but this craft remained a single, large, solid warm light. The southern end of Saratoga Lake is ringed by a heavily wooded hillside, and the craft was travelling just at the hill&#39;s treeline in a bobbing up-and-down sort of motion, dipping below the treeline, then floating back up from behind the hill&#39;s dark pine trees, eventually going down like a setting sun behind the trees.       I do have this incident on videotape.<n>

They separate back into pair and single.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three craft, which I first thought to be satellites, forming a close encounter over the Sacramento/Marysville area - 50 miles to the South.  As I watched it was apparent that two of these craft were flying together as a pair up from the south, and a third craft was approaching the encounter area from the West.  Clear skies, some very high clouds, good lighting, about a half hour after sunset. The craft pair was arranged so the larger of the two was always to the left of the smaller.  All three craft went through continual complex fast changing lighting arrays.  Their lights weren&#39;t synchronized.  Quite bright, brilliant colors, or a brite white light disc.  Sometimes the lights would double or form arrays of four, all flashing differently, sometimes with different intensities. This didn&#39;t appear to be the light signature of the satellites which are visible here every clear evening, and their movements implied airplane, but on an out of atmosphere scale, which meant that the lights in their fantastic array were very brilliant. The smaller craft almost always was two tightly bound points of scintillating lights.  Often times there were four.  Only rarely did it become a single point of light.  There did not seem to be an structure associated with the light arrays, yet they maintained an integral formation as if there were a structure.  It appeared several times that it was presenting a changing profile to the viewer as it moved around, that perhaps a cause of the observed relative movements of the lights. As they converged the solo craft from the west executed a turn to the north and began flying with the two coming from the south.  I then thought I was watching airplanes, but there never was a sound, and the scale of movement was wrong for an airplane.  The solo craft cruises around the pair who turn to the east.  There is movement between the pair, but it is subtle and their overall position remains exactly the same to this observer _througout_ their entire flight!  The solo light is, what one could almost call, animated, especially as the scale of this encounter became apparent.  The solo craft flew north above a cirrus changing vectors a few degress several times, at one point appearing to reverse course as it circled back over an area - they were complex very large scale manuevers in a patch of sky the size of my hand at arms length - never leaving a contrail or noise.  As it did these high speed manuevers, it reached its highest point as it turned westward at about 10:30 as my arm would point to it.  As it slowly went into the west glow I could see that it was still manuevering but it was so far away that distance only indicated that this light or group of lights was not an airplane and was way off planet as compared to the usual couple of dozen satellite crossings.  Eventually this brilliant cluster of glittering jewels was lost in the evening glow. As I caught up with the pair they had traveled across the sky in an enormous turn from the east to north over in the Reno area. That city is almost exactly East from this observer.  They traveled north 15-20 degrees then I saw that they were just slowly getting closer together in appearance which meant that they were now traveling to the Northeast and they maintained that till they faded into the night sky a hands width above the horizon.  At their highest in the East they seemed at about 10:00 in the sky as pointed to by my arm.  There was never a sound. The scale of these executed movements would seem to require high altitudes.  This was a very grand encounter, very majestic, and it would seem, when postulating actual physical craft, quite an extraordinary expression of speed and power. During this 20 minute dance the land and sky were very quiet.  No jets and no local noise at all, it was quiet.  Any sounds caused by these craft would have been audible, if they had been aircraft, as exampled by similarly placed jet flybys. This happened at 5:10 to 5:30 pm Pacific Standard Time on 15 December 1998.<n>

The sphere had a warm orange glow,the light it gave off was like a flare or sparkler,with tiny sparks of red,yellow,orange,even green and blue.It wasn&#39;t lit from external lights,it was lit from within and its entire surface glowed.Its color changed from yellow to green to red to white to blue,changing colors constantly and almost instantly.It was spinning rapidly,not east/west like a globe,but in a south/north spin.As it spun it revealed strange repeating designs,dark bands,question marks,star patterns and squiggles,,particularly interesting is a trident-like design,and the patterns change colors as well. I pulled over,put my car into park,turned on my camcorder and began filming.It started floating to the south away from me soon after I started filming,but I captured it for over a minute, and the features I describe are clear.Freeze-frame shows how quickly and how certainly remarkable designs and patterns cover this craft.<n>

I had been out hunting from a tree stand on my in-law&#39;s private land, which is several hundred acres within the Holly Ridge swamplands, off of highway 210. My tree stand was about 75 to 100 feet high with a clear view in all directions. The entire time I observed numerous commerical or military aircraft flying at high altitudes (out of hearing range), leaving the usual contrails over the entire sky (there is a military base about an hour from my position). I thought nothing of it at the time, other than I had never seen so many contrails in that area before. At approximately 11:00 am, I descended from my tree stand and started walking back to my truck, which is about a 20 minute walk. At one point I heard a jet flying high above me, and I looked up to see a small, white jet moving north-west and leaving a contrail. A bright metallic object then caught my eye, which was close to where the jet had just passed, except it seemed a much lower altitude than the jet itself. The chrome object was stationary, was directly above me, and made no noise and left no contrail, which is probably why it had caught my attention considering everything else I was seeing left a trail of some sort. It seemed like the shape of an egg or sphere. I stood there staring at it for about a minute, when it then proceeded to move slowly in the opposite direction from where the jet was heading. I had to back up a bit to continue watching as it was disappearing behind some trees. After another minute or two of observation, the object simply vanished. I watched for several more minutes and did not see it again. I then proceeded to my truck and drove home. The following may or may not be related to my sighting, but it is certainly worth mentioning. As my hunt was unsuccessful, the next day I returned to the same location. This time it was a cloudy, wet day. At approximately 9:00am, I heard several jet engines approaching from behind my position in the tree stand. Keep in mind that my stand is very high, as I am sitting above the tops of most of the other trees in my vision. I looked to my left and observed two military F16 or F15 (?) class fighter jets flying at a low altitude. As they passed, I picked up my binoculars and viewed them for a closer look. They were moving at a very rapid speed and quite low to the ground, and I think they were using their afterburners, as I could see the flame emitting from the engines. As they passed my position, they seemed to slow down and the afterburners were shut off. A short moment later they began maneuvering back into my direction, this time seemingly heading right for me, at a much slower speed. I was awestruck when they headed right for me at an incredibly low altitude. As they approached my position, the noise from the jet engines was almost painfully loud. One of the jets broke left and the other right from where I was sitting. They literally buzzed my tree stand from both sides, so close that I could easily see the pilots in the aircraft. They must have been no more than 75 yards on either side of me and just a little bit above the tree tops. The one on my right banked as it passed me, showing me a clear view of the plane&#39;s underbelly. When I first described this incident to me family, I remember mentioning that they were so close that I could see the bolts holding the jet together. After they buzzed me they turned around again and proceeded in the direction they were originally heading before they decided to freak the hell out of me. Shortly thereafter I got back to my truck and went home. I believe that was the last time I hunted on that land since it was the end of the season, and have since moved out of the a! rea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

At that point the object was moving up/down and side to side for a distance of approximately 1-2 miles at each movement. My wife, son and daughter witnessed this with amazement for a period of about 10 minutes. Commercial traffic could be seen passing in close proximity of this object, however the object made no effort to &#34;track&#34; with the plane. I could clearly see that this object was moving by triangulating it with nearby stars in it&#39;s proximity. The object became stationary and was observed for approximately 30 more minutes noticably not maintaining horizontal alignment with nearby stars verifying it wasn&#39;t a star decending on horizon. The object seemed to pulse orange to white at higher intensities from time to time at intervals of approximately 5-10 seconds. Then suddenly the object disappeared as if to &#34;wink out&#34;.

An unusual large black cloud had been exahausted from engines (and twirled by the aircrafts prop wash) and continued as a trail of black smoke was following the copter (traveling south slightly east of hartsfield airport).  Thinking that the aircraft was in trouble I has some interest in watching it.  The sun was coming up and illuminated both the copter and exhaust trail.  I then noticed a small (egg) object at what appeared to be a very high altitude (1:00 very high). I thought it was probably a jet flying directly over Atlanta and catching the sun, but it was unusual because it did not have the usual contrail and was traveling south very fast (same direction as aircraft but at what appeared to be a much higher altitude). The object was reflecting the sun like a mirror.  The object disappeared for a second and then reappeared (or I saw a second similar object) traveling east (12:00 high) at a high rate of speed.  The object zoomed east and out of sight in less than a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time is an estimate +- a few minutes.  Sunrise was just starting.  Objects appeared to be very very high.

I saw an object come into view at my right through the top center of my windshield travelling approximately the same direction as me but faster. It dissappeared behind hills or trees on the right side of the road. It was visible for less than one second. It appeared round, but this was difficult to judge. It very dim, not much brighter than the night sky. I saw no running lights. When I reached my destination I tried to simulate what I saw by reflecting light from my flashlight in my windshield. I wasn&#39;t able to do this without also creating other bright spots inside the passenger compartment which I would have noticed.<n>

I believe they are NOT alien but definitely secret UFO&#39;s being possibly tested.  I truly expected them to crash due to speed but nothing. Just disappeared behind mtns. and never flew back up from behind mtn.  It seems inconceivable that they landed at this speed.   See below for details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I discussed with my husband as this was nothing I&#39;d ever seen and believe possibly others have seen the same and not know what they are.  I do NOT believe they are alien craft despite how they flew and looked.  If I had a ruler in front of me, each craft was over an inch long+ in the sky that many miles away.  They were flying nose to tail, one slightly above the other, but again, ruler in front of my eyes, about 1/16&#34; apart.  Both were bright silver metalic, no visible wings, tails or other flying parts.  Both were blinking at the top, a single white flashing light, rapid pulsatings.  They were not truly saucer shaped nor cigar shaped, but more like a flatter saucer shape, rounded at the top, flat bottom and elongated on each end but not pointed as a plane appears in the sky. Their speed was incredible, as fast as jets, and too fast for such a desent.  They were both coming from directly north, but far higher up to a lower southern spot behind the mountain range before the Cascades.  It reminded me of how the Blue Angels fly to perform stunts, but this was NOT what they appeared to be doing.  It was not a stunt flight. They appeared to be landing OR going right into the earth. When I discussed this with my husband last night, he advised me that I might be right that it was something secret we were testing, as he believed there was an old military base over behind Issaquah somewhere near that mountain range, that Boeing used to test military planes they build. I then discussed this today with a friend at Microsoft over lunch, and he asked if I&#39;d contacted you yet.  I told him since he supported my thoughts this was &#34;ours&#34;, I would send you this information tonight after work. He also mentioned that he&#39;d seen another green ball of light and we began to wonder if all these sitings were corrolated and not alien, but just our own government&#39;s secret projects.  Remembering an incident in the CA desert in Aug. &#39;79 near Boran, which later was exactly like the &#34;Harrier&#34; we saw (but without wings) at SeaFair, I realized that we had the technology of hover craft, rapid speeds, and wingless flights without it being a helicopter.  Because of so many sightings up here, and elsewhere, the more we report the unknown as precisely as we can, the closer we will all get to truth.  This technology could well have come from alien technology long ago, but it does not mean what I observed was alien, despite its appearance. I am in the hopes someone else has reported this same incident or a like one which you can compare the data with and see if there is a possible connection.   You&#39;d phoned me back when my husband &amp; I observed a bright orangish light near the I-405 near SR520, after we reported it, as being observed by others as well as a military helicopter watching it, too for some time period.  And it disappeared very rapidly.  It, too could have been observed by the military to see how it performed, a test, and if it caused folks to be alarmed.  I am seriously beginning to wonder about all the UFOs I&#39;ve seen over the many decades and why I see them, over others.  Possibly because I do love this world so much and love to look at it and the magnificient sky.  I find it refreshing for my soul, but it is why I believe that I see more than others do.   It is a daily ritual to stop and look over at the Cascades to view these majestic mountains through the seasons. So, it did not surprise me that I &#39;happened&#39; to see something that did not belong in the sky at that moment.  Had I not been refreshing my soul, it would not be reported now.  I wouldn&#39;t have seen it.  Maybe the desire of humanity is now stepping more as I learned to step, and maybe this is why sightings are being reported in more numbers.  Who knows!<n>

It was very weird to see.  It started out like a small flash then as the flash stretched out downward a fire ball was forming.  I&#39;d say it looked like 400-600 feet up when we noticed it and appeared to be about 3/4 of a mile away. It feel very slow in comparison to a meteor and appeared to look like an airplane falling out of the sky and burning, it fell that slow. It was close enough that I could see the &#34;boiling&#34; of the &#34;flames&#34; off of the fireball.  We tried to gauge the distance and size in comparisons to cars or trucks on the highway as we continued to work.  It was much bigger then a semi truck coming at you at around 3/4 mile away.  It was similar to a meteor color of white with a blueish tenge to it.<n>

The 5 lights on the other hand were a little out of focus and not the same color as the stars.  Being color blind I&#39;m not sure exactly what color they were. Perhaps bluish.  I scanned the sky for about an hour afterwards and saw intense meteor activity, none of which was remotely similiar to the 5 objects I saw either in speed, color or trajectory.  I now believe.<n>

As we were returning home, we both the brightest flash of white/blue color light that we have ever saw.  The shape of the object we could not see, but there were not houses, or lights of any type to make a mistake of.  We saw the object light up, zigged in the sky super fast, then shot straight down.  The object did hit the ground.  The ligh was white, until it shot stright down (blue light then)  It seemed to, I guess burn up.. as the object was going down, and changed to the blue color it faded out, or burned up.

I looked up as I usually do to observe the stars and a green shooting star appeared right above me. Not so unusual. Then I saw another and another and another. They were coming from all directions. West to east. north to south, south to north, east to west. I had never seen so many in one sitting in my entire life. Not even during the Leonoid shower of a few weeks ago. Colors ranged from green to white. I guess I saw at least one a minute sometimes two or three. A couple directly above left a trail that I could make out against the dark sky. After a while I came back in and after 15 minutes went out again and counted 11 more in about 20 minutes. I went back out at about 1:30 am 12/14/98 and didn&#39;t see any in five minutes so I came back in. Were we supposed to have a meteor shower last night? If not it was very unusual, but it was the most spectacular show I have seen in my entire life.

The sky was becoming light but the sun had not risen yet.  As I came over the top of a ridge I saw an extremely bright light in the sky ahead of me that appeared to be moving down towards the horizon in a gradual, steady motion and also appeared to be shimmering or pulsating.  Being somewhat of a skeptic I attributed the movement I perceived to the fact that I was coming over the top of a ridge and going back down the other side and I attributed the shimmering aspect the the crisp cold air.  As I came across the next ridge the object now was in full view and stayed in the same position for the next several minutes.  It really grabbed my attention because it was at least three to four times brighter than a star.  I thought several times that it was possibly a planet in the morning sky buy it was extremely bright, a white/silver color. I continued to observe the object for several minutes while it appeared to be stationary.  There was no movement and as the morning light increased there was no change in the brightness of the object.  I stopped at the QT quick mart at the intersection of Hwy 94 and O&#39;Fallon Rd to grab a soda and a bag of pretzels.  As I stepped out of my car I gazed at the object for a period to try to ascertain exactly what it might be, it was extremely bright, still about three to four times brighter than the brightest star I have observed and in the western morning sky all by itself.  I quickly ran in to get what I needed, I would guess it took me a total of 45 seconds to one minute because I knew exactly what I wanted and I was the only customer in the store.  When I stepped out of the store the first thing I did was look up where the object had been to look at it again and it was gone!  This was obviously not a plane or a star.<n>

We may err in our preliminary assessment in this case, but the unusually long duration time (75 minutes) makes the case seem more like a &#34;twinkling star&#34; case, of which we receive MANY.  We apologize to the witness if our assessment is incorrect.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> I first spotted two objects west of my position.  They were 1000 feet above ground level in the night sky.  One was greenish blue and another was reddish yellow.  I took 15 pictures of objects of which I do not yet know the quality.  I followed objects for 10 miles to see if they would appear closer to me.  They did and as I continued I spotted a third object which was much closer.  It had a circle of white lights with a red light circling the object and constant.  Lights were not blinking like a plain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just walked my girlfriend to her car. I came back up to my 3rd story apartment, got a glass of water and glanced out the window.  West of my building I noticed an object with greenish blue lights.  I thought at first it was just a satelite or plain.  But as I continued to look at it I noticed the object changing color within seconds -  going from blue to green to blue to white.  The lights appeared to have a circular sequence around the object and as they made one complete cycle around the object they would then change color.  I continued to monitor the object through two large branches on a tree outside my window which extends to the top of our apartment complex.  I used the branches as limits to see if the object would move above or below a branch.  It did as if it was bouncing around in the sky.  Then I noticed a flash of light north of the object I was observing.  A second object appeared.  This object appeared to be higher up and was reddish yellow in color.  I could see a haze around this object and it appeared to be farther away or just smaller.  I then was convinced that something strange was up. So, I grabbed a camera (disposable from a wedding I attended) and ran outside.  I wanted to see if the images would appear closer to me if I drove west.  As I went 1 mile west of my complex I pulled into a parking lot where a man was laying dirt.  I got out and asked him if he thought those two objects looked strange.  He was startled but admitted that the blue green object did seem rather strange.  So, I got back into the car and drove 40 MPH down a suburb street that connected several counties of St.Louis.  The road went directly west towards the objects.  The reddish object seemed to be leading me.  In fact it gradually moved directly in front of me and as I slowed down it almost seemed like it would slow down.  So then I would speed up and it would seem farther away.  I felt like it knew I was following it.  Meanwhile the greenish blue object remained on the left of the road and was still twice! as low to the ground as the reddish object.  After 10 miles on the same road heading west towards the objects there was no doubt in my mind that the objects were unidentifiable and moved very freely unlike a plain or a baloon of any kind I had ever seen.  I was running out of road after 10 miles and decided to pull over into a neighborhood street to take pictures of the object.  The lights in the area I was now in were more scarce then where I started following the objects.  As I got my camera out and closed my door, I turned to see a object flying maybe 500 feet off the ground and maybe .25 miles away from me.  The object was so low that it&#39;s image was constricted when it passed behind the houses I was standing in front of.  I quickly snapped off two pictures of this object and ran back to my car to follow it as I had lost sight of it behind more houses.  When I pulled back out to the main street I could not see the object.  Also, I noticed that the reddish yellow object was no longer high in the sky.  In fact I couldn&#39;t find it.  Therefore, the object that was low to the ground could have been a totally different object or the object I followed earlier.  This object that I flashed two pictures of was oval in shape it was circled in bright white lights and had several red lights on its front ( I think it was the front because of the direction it was heading which was north of me).  It did not make a single sound and when it flew it seemed to float move effortlessly.  Also, it&#39;s flight pattern was very irratic as it decended and ascended several times within 10 seconds I had a good look of it.  Finally, the object was not moving fast at all.  In fact it seemed to be slow which may have been what caused it to look like it was floating. After getting back in my car to follow the object I realized that the greenish blue object was no longer west of me but was now east of me and still on my left side.  I raced towards a local highschool parking lot in order to park my car and get away from the trees.  I was able to get a fairly good look of the sky.  I waited for 10 minutes and did not see the object that had previously flown close to me.  So, I continued to watch the blue green object which seemed to be stationary in the same position I described earlier.  Then, out of know where I noticed this object moving at the same speed fly from behind my position - yet not directly over me towards the blue green object.  In fact, the blue green object seemed 500 hundred feet above it.  The object continued but again was low enough that objects such as houses and trees seemed to restrict my view.  I got in my car and drove back on the same street following the blue green object. It seemed to be moving higher away yet I kept a clear visiual of it. At this moment, I was 5 miles away from my complex and the sun was coming up directly in front of me.  The stars were no longer visible nor were the satelites.  Yet, I could still see the blue green object.  I drove back to my apartment and looked up to find nothing left in the sky. I am currently working as a engineering consultant with a focus on pneumatic fluid power.  Our company is familiy owned and distributes a full line of pneumatic automation equipment.  We work with plants and OEM&#39;s throughout the Missouri, Illinois area.  I have a BA in finance and economics.  I graduated from a top private university.  I have a series 7 and I have complete certification as a fluid power specialist.  In addition, I volunteer for the Lukemia Society of America and I am a practicing Catholic.  I believe the experience that happened to me was a coincidence.  If I hadn&#39;t glanced out my window at that time I believe that I never would have witnessed the occurence - so no I dont think they were looking for me or that I have ever been abducted.  I am not into Star Trek and Science was my least favorite subject in school. I believe what I saw were UFO&#39;s.  However, whether they have aliens on them I don&#39;t know.  What I do believe is that whatever I witnessed seemed to tempt me to chase after it.  It was a strange sensation, kind of like I was spying on them - I don&#39;t know.<n>

I was surprised to see the below-described meteor shower (of Dec. 13, 1998) because it was not announced on the news but was more visable for me than the highly-talked about Nov. 16 meteor shower.  In fact, I never saw ANY meteors during the November meteor shower, but I saw 5 on December 13.  It all began at 1:55 am when I woke up from sleep and was laying there looking out the window.  I saw a bright, very large &#34;shooting star,&#34;  it was about 5 or 6 times larger than a shooting star and way brighter than the brightest star in the sky.  The color was different than the rest of the stars too.  It was the same color as the moon when it is full and bright.  A few seconds later I saw a &#34;typical&#34; shooting go by just east of the path of the meteor.  A few minutes later I saw a second meteor shooting through the sky and another shooting star a few minutes later.  At this time I phoned the UFO Reporting Center because I thought it was unusual to see 2 meteors and 2 shooting stars in such a short time.  Then I went back to sleep and woke up again at 3:00 am.  I no sooner looked out the window and I saw yet another meteor go shooting by in the sky.  This really got my interest, so I decided to sit up and count how many I saw.  I grabbed a tablet and made a column for &#34;shooting stars&#34; and one for &#34;meteors.&#34;  Within an hour (3 am to 4 am) I saw 3 more meteors and 4 more shooting stars for a total of 5 meteors and 6 shooting stars.  I just think it is curious that the public was never told about THIS meteor shower and it was much more spectacular than the one in November that all the news stations covered.  The stars and meteors were all traveling from north/east to south/west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Sightings correspond to Geminid Meteor Shower.))<n>

I looked up and thought it was a planet which was near the moon at the time except this object was coming straight down and getting very bright.  It was a whitish color with a blue tint. It appeared rounded on the bottom and distorted from the intense light around the top.  The object stopped at an altitude 1500-2000 feet, (I guess). As the object seem to hover the light began to stabilize and slowly decreased in intensity as it settle into what looked like a star.  At this point it moved off to the southwest. I lost sight of it as it moved behind the trees. I am not sure but after it moved away as a star in appearance it may have just vanished.  Not sure because I was looking through the trees at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whitish ball blue tint.  Very intense but did not appear to cast any light on tree&#39;s. It did reflect off my glasses. That&#39;s what caught my attention to it. Two other hunter within 100 yards saw nothing. They had more obstructions around them. The bottom was rounded. This I could tell by the glow of the light. The top was hard to make out due to sparkling light and had no definite shape. The object dropped very fast. When it came to a stop it was very sudden, it was immediate. It hovered for about 4-5 seconds. The light was jumping outward like sheets waving in the wind. Then the light appeared to pull back into itself until it looked like a star.  A very small blue/white star which then slowly moved away and I am not sure but i think it just vanished. I felt like this object was very close. When I first looked up and saw this thing falling I felt like it was going to come down on the deer lease I was on.  I would have thought it was something reentering the atmosphere, satillite etc. but it would not stop and move off in a level flight after coming straight down. I saw something very simular to this a couple of years ago while sitting on my inlaws back poch in the Dallas Tx. area.  There was 4 of us who saw it. I am an electronic Technician, 45 years old.

Date: 18/01/02 To: ufosightings@hotmail.com In december 98 my girlfriend and I witnessed something high in the sky at night. At around that time a sighting was published in the local paper by a security guard. He worked at the marble works in Bovey Tracey Devon England he discribed a massive flying wing. It would be nice to talk to him as I was in Ashburton not many miles away and my girlfriend and I saw what I too would describe as a flying wing. It travelled at the same speed as a satelight i had just pointed out to my partner.  the UFO was as described illuminated on the edge with four large lights underneath. Bearing in mind a satelght travels at 18 thousand miles an hour I was amazed to find when the satelght came over again SO DID THE UFO. If it was at the same height then not only would it be travelling the same speed but would have been the size of a city! The second sighting which is more strange was about six months ago. Three of us witnessed what looked like an L shaped building about four storeys high and three times as long again iluminated on all edges flying slowly and about 100 feet up a witness who was underside described a triangle with three white lights and pipes joining the lights at the rear as it flew past. Over the heads of police women who did not notice what was happening above them, I can only say they were balconies and luminous what looked like butterfly wings pulsing with light. similar to things in a film called the abyss. a low humming noise was the only sound this was the size of a jumbo but block shaped no wings and hardly any sound. I need to see someone and explain in detail, can you help? The sky news item which came out only once at eight in the morning on the eve of elections stated. That all the chiefs of staff in America had admitted that all stories about UFO&#39;s were true and that they had even built a craft of thier own using alien technology that could travel at the speed of light! the item appeared only once at eight in the morning. WHY ONLY ONCE sky repeat everything but never that news item ask them wh! y?<n>

Upon viewing (for 4 minutes), irratic movement and red and blue lights persuaded viewers (I and my wife) that this was not an airplane or a celestial body.  I (a 36 year old software industry professional) watched for 40 minutes while my wife (a 31 year old at-home mom) watched for 10 minutes and was drawn away by our 2-year old&#39;s waking from sleep.  During my viewing, I contacted the local (1 mile away) air force base (a satellite tracking station) and asked whether they could view it, either by sight or by radar.  The individual who answered indicated that they had no radar for that purpose but agreed to go out an view it himself.  After a follow-up call, he indicated that he did believe he saw these.  I contacted the local airport&#39;s sherriff&#39;s office to ask them to call the tower to see if they could view this craft.  No follow up with the airport.  I also contacted an airforce base some 60 miles south but the tower could not view it. The shape was difficult to acertain..it simply looked star-like. During the last ten minutes of viewing, the object moved off to the right. Having contacted the UFO Center, it was suggested that I get a tripod and film it.  After 5 minutes search, I found and set up the tripod but by the time I returned, the object had moved off.<n>

A bright red ball that illuminated the sky a little and drifted down over the bay.  I was playing a joke on my sister and her friends to try and scare them.   We had an awning that would roll down to protect the glass door.  It was rolled down and I was going to beat on it to scare them in the living room.  I first noticed what looked like a plane&#39;s headlamp coming at me, but that was normal because I live near the airport.  So I started pushing on the awning a little to see if anyone would notice when I realized it was getting brighter outside.  I look back at where I saw the plane and there was a bright red ball in the sky slowly sinking over the bay.  It seemed so close that I was too scared to run 10 ft to the garage door!  I beat on the awning like crazy until one of the people there opened it and saw the object before it went behind the trees.  10 minutes later there was a huge thuderstorm that spawned severe thunderstorm warnings.  It was really strange. I&#39;ve never really put much confidence in the whole extra-terrestrial thing but I know I saw something that night and struck me as very strange that other people here reported similar sightings.  Many people here I know have said at some point or another they have seen something wierd in the sky, mainly at night.  Not all are valid obviously, but many people in the Pensacola, Gulf Breeze, Navarre and Pensacola Beach area seem to have seen a red firey looking object moving around the bay or gulf.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 6:27 this evening, as I sat studying in my room, I glanced out my window and noticed an unusually bright light moving rapidly across the sky, heading north west. Thinking it might be something unusual, such as a satellite, meteor, or maybe the space shuttle, I went outside for a better look. I followed it closely as it moved the night sky. It made no sound, had no flashing running lights of any sort, and appeared to be at a very high altitude. I was about to go in, thinking it was probably a satellite, when it began to fire what I can only describe as missiles or rockets! I could not believe my eyes! This thing let loose seven bright projectiles which traveled away from it and down, leaving a bright tracer. There was a pause between each one. Certain it was not a meteor breaking up, I phoned the coast guard, local air traffic control tower, and the local paper, but no one else had reported a similar sighting.  I have never seen anything like this before, and would like to know if anyone else on the West coast witnessed this. Strange<n>

The events that transpired that night I have only ever shared with my wife; who the other Marine has shared it with I do not know, but we never spoke of the incident or reported out of fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been in several combat situations, but this was the most terrifying moment in my life.  I reluctantly share it now as I have tried to never think of it after I made it through that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on duty that night at the main armory for that area of base.  We had been on this post quite a lot and had become familiar with the surroundings inside and out.  We were locked into the perimeter after the last Marine that worked in the armory left, as we were every night.  We had no key for obvious security reasons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the first to see it.  It crested a hill approximately eight hundred meters to the east of the armory.  I thought it strange but we were on a military base so it could be anything.  As the object moved closer I realized that it was something I was unfamiliar with and not another marine or piece of equipment.  My gut was that something was very wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this moment I called the other Marine over to see what he thought.  We radioed in to the guard HQ but could not adequately describe whatever it was and they felt it to be no threat so the response team was not sent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It approached at a slow enough rate of speed that we were coming up with all kinds of explanations from hummers to snipers but as it got to within a hundred yards we realized that we were in trouble.  The trip from the top of the hill took approximately eight to ten minutes to this point.  We immediately locked and loaded and took defensive positions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not like anything I have ever seen so to compare it to anything would be pointless but I will do my best to describe it.  It was a sphere, a ball of glowing blue light.  It was not bright, it did not shine.  The best way to describe it is that it was a fluorescent blue ball of light that could move.  The glow of the light was slightly more intense in the center, but I would not say that it was the source.  It was translucent and I could see no object or anything that would lead me to believe that it was solid in anyway but it had a definite shape.  It was positioned about 15 feet above the ground and was about three to four feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if it actually got smaller as it approached because it looked larger when it was further out.  There was no sound coming from the object.  It stopped above the front gate guard shack for a few seconds and then proceeded toward the armory.  At this point I almost fired on the object but fear of what it might be and what might happen, and the thought that I was going crazy, made me wait.  From my observation I really don’t believe there was anything a bullet could have harmed.  Have no doubt that had it come closer to me I would have fired anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued toward the armory until it came to a point above the center and then began to move downward.  I could not see the object actually enter the armory as the perimeter fence prevented us from moving back that far, however we knew it was in the armory because the inside of the armory began to glow the same blue color.  At this point we tried multiple times to raise someone on the radio but all attempts failed, not due to equipment malfunction, but because the ((deleted)) on the other end fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glow coming out of the window on the front door seemed to get brighter and darker, so I assume it was in motion inside the armory.  Three and a half hours after I first saw the object it raised up outside the armory and continued directly upward at a much faster speed than it approached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited for a brief while and decided together not to tell anyone as we wanted to avoid the repercussions that sharing this story with anyone, especially our chain of command, would bring.  We did watch in fear as the first armory Marine showed up at 0500 and walked inside, as we had not told him what had happened.  Nothing seemed to be out of place or harmed so we kept quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have shared this full story as I have only told my wife that I saw something while guarding an armory that scared the shit out of me.  I can only imagine that what ever it was was checking out the weapons inside as there were thousands of them and many different types.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No harm came to me or my fellow Marine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I AM POSITIVE beyond a shadow of a doubt that this was not gas, a light trick or some kind of light coming from Venus.  Believe me when I tell you I wish it was.  I was not amazed.  I was locked in a very secure fence with something that I did not feel I could protect myself from and I had no idea what it was.  I was petrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Hard to judge size and speed because of distance (about 100-150 miles south of Humboldt County California) but very massive size moving at a high speed judging from distance. Sighted near horizon just above tree line south. Looked like a planet or very large star (about 8 stars together) at first but with binoculars sighted a tear drop shape(&#34;U&#34;) with hole in center descending at the speed that of a jet plane would in the distance or even faster. Before sighting, there were 5 jet planes going towards the location where the object was descending which directed my attention to that area. There were 2 more jets following the other five after I sighted the object (7 jets all together going on same route towards object within 10 min.) Object disappeared behind tree line and so did 5 jets except for the 2 which were still visible but then dissapeared behind tree line also. The sun was not quite over the hills yet, but the 7 jet streams were all pink and the sky was very clear with no clouds. The temperature was about 45 degrees F. outside. The moon was in its last quarter stage but nowhere close to the horizon. I was wide awake and had been up for about an hour and had a very restful sleep. Five minutes after the object disappeared, 2 jets were still visible and I had to leave for a class at 08:00. I am a Senior at Humboldt State University majoring in art. I was born in Texas and served in the U.S. army for 5 years. I am married, 30 years old, caucasion, 130 lbs. and very skeptical of everything. I am well educated in many areas and self-taught in many subjects. I have never seen anything like this before but heard many things about this subject and always found the stories hard to believe. What I saw was unbelievable, but it was real.  Please contact me if possible at lrm5@axe.humboldt.edu if you have any other info! rmation about this sighting or others like it. Thankyou.

Well, it had started moving slowly toward me and when it passed over head I saw that there was a red light on it and I could hear it but it was a very low sound.  Not something that a plane would make I don&#39;t think.  So it might be my eyes deceiving me or it was indeed an unidentified flying object.<n>

Because I knew they were not suposed to  be there.So I figured they were just planes and went back to star gazing. A minute later, I would guess,I looked over the house and saw  one of the objects coming over the house, at a slow rate of speed. I had my telescope fixed on the Pleiades, I noticed the object was passing across the path of the Pleiades. Then I grabbed my 10x50 binoculars to get a better look at the object, once I got them up to my eyes I saw that there were three bright gold colored lights with one red slow flashing light in the center. As it continued moving slowly from the northeast to the southwest with the binoculrs I could clearly see it was triangular in shape,there were no stars visible through the objet.I took the binoculars away from my eyes again and I saw going in the same direction three other objects, only these I could distinctly tell were either planes or jets. Then I looked back in the direction of the triangular object and it was not to be seen anywhere. I have no idea what happened to it, it was just gone. I have never saw anything like this, I see planes and jets everyday and this was not what I witnessed tonight. As for the second object I mentioned I never saw it again, it never came over the house like the other, it must have took off in a different direction.All I can say is that what ever it was gave me a strange feeling and it was not a Airplane or a jet.<n>

I told him I was it, ( the one looking after HBCC UFO). He started to tell me about a strange sighting he had back in 1998 when hauling logs out of the Morice Lake area which is approximately 80 kilometers southwest from Houston, B.C. I asked him if he could call me when the man found a little time. He did indeed call a couple of days later and told me what he saw that early winter morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness was driving along the Morice West Road and just came over the top of a hill. Looking straight ahead of him he saw what he described as aircraft landing lights which were sitting on the ground. The lights were extremely bright and white. There was no flashing nor did the light move. Whatever it was, it was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He also said there was no one logging in that area at that time. He also told me that a road which did lead into the area was blocked by a huge bank of snow and the road itself was covered with approximately four feet of snow. The driver said he was really curious to know what he&#39;d seen. The logger would have liked to have stopped but seeing the roads were icy and extremely slippery, a 70 ton load, plus other logging trucks coming behind him a kilometer away he thought it best to just keep going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness got on his radio and asked the drivers behind him if anyone was doing any forestry work where he saw the light. Everyone called back telling him there was nothing in the area. (It would be doubtful that it would have been a helicopter at that time of the morning). Also I asked if it could have been a snowmobile and he told me no. There were no signs of anyone going in along the snow covered road and that was the only access to the area where the light was. He told me all areas around where the light was sitting was dense forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As some of the truck operators drove up over the hill they too were able to see the light and found it very unusual. It was a clear cold night and the northern lights were dancing across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

At one point during the space walk the robotic arm or some other part of the shuttle was in the center of the screen.  This separated the screen into black (outer space) areas on the right side of the screen and a black (outer space) area on the left side of the screen.  In the black area (outer space) on the left side of the screen, I saw a small white circle move quickly from right to left.  It seemed to appear out of nowhere; maybe it was just entering the light of the sun-I don&#39;t know.  It lasted about 1 second.  Immediately thereafter the view on television switched from the camera to the prepared graphics, and some astronaut guy started babbling.  I could still hear the audio of the astronauts, but I don&#39;t think that they saw this thing.  They were still talking about their work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a perfect circle; white in color.

The object hovered in this spot for about 5 minutes.

The topic was local politics, when a man called in &amp; said &#34;Hey, there&#39;s a UFO out here! It&#39;s hovering over the water, there&#39;s all these lights..&#34; The show host cut him off saying &#34;does it say &#39;friends of Art Bell on it?&#39;&#34;  The man says &#34;Huh? I&#39;m just past McQue Creek going to Girdwood, there&#39;s a UFO, I don&#39;t believe this...&#34;  The host cut him off agian, making another crack about Art &amp; disconnected him.  I left for work at this time, leaving Peters Creek heading southbound on Glenn Highway towards Anchorage.  As soon as I hit the highway my attention was drawn toward a very bright light, about the size of Venus (Venus was clearly visible to my left).  It was still for about 1 min then began to move slowly to the right (west).  At the same time I noticed 3 &#34;red flashes&#34; moving towards the UFO.  The red flashes were in a V shape the point closest to the UFO. The flashes came from the left (east), from Anchorage, while the UFO moved towards Elmendorf AFB.  The UFO accelerated swiftly, faster than the average aircraft, but not fast enough to leave tracers.  I easily left the flashes behind, then blinked out.  The flashes, now seemingly directly over the AFB, appeared to hover.  I got the impression the flashes were some kind of helicopters.  All this occured during a period of about 3 min.  I had been watching this while driving in the snow at 60 mph, almost going in the ditch several times.  After the UFO blinked out I intended to hurry to the next overpass &amp; stop, to watch in safety.  Glancing to my left (east) to merge, I saw the/another UFO, very near to Venus.  Looking forward again I saw the red flashes heading towards it.  At this point I decided to just pull over, &amp; noticed another car on the shoulder w/a man leaning out the open window watching the UFO.  By the time I had pulled over the UFO was gone, I didn&#39;t see what happened to it.  The man smiled at me &amp; shrugged, &amp; drove off.  I proce! eded to work.  I happen to work at Anchorage Int&#39;l Airport, so I am familiar w/conventional a/c.  By the way, there is absolutely no way the Girdwood UFO could be seen in Anchorage, it is too far away.<n>

It was shooting straight down and disappeared in less than a 1/2 second at approx. 15 degrees above the horizon.  I was heading due west (270 degrees magnetic) and the object was observed approximately 290 degrees bearing from my position.  It&#39;s size was approximately 1/4 to 1/5 the apparent diameter of the moon. I am fairly certain of the date, but it might have been 1 week earlier (11/29/98) at the same time.  I was driving the same route both weeks and I can&#39;pinpoint which Sunday night it was observed.  I am certain of the time, however.<n>

This object caught my attention immediately, because an airplane wouldn&#39;t be flying that close near a residential area.I found a parking spot 150 yards up the road, and got out to observe the object. It was only one pale red light that maybe twice faded to a dim and then returned to it&#39;s original brightness. There was a telephone pole right next to the object, so my girlfriend &amp; I could actually observe the object&#39;s ascent to approx. 1500 feet. As it ascended, it swayed very slighty to one side &amp; back to the other. It reminded me  of a Chinese Lantern, as it was a pale red color and the swaying it did. It proceded to move towards our direction after about 10 minutes of ascending. It was NOT an airplane or any conventional aircraft I have ever seen in a night-time setting. The light made no noise. The evening was calm &amp; crystal clear that night. As it proceded towards us, I became a little nervous, and watched it move to the south-east (in our direction), so I decided I had seen enough (40* F outside), but when I looked back in the object&#39;s general direction 5 minutes later, it was gone. This was my first sighting that I can recall in my life. There were no reports in the paper or on the radio the following day.<n>

It seemed very large to be a firework, and it stood still such a short time and then raced towards the ground. No explosion was heard as fireworks often give. A pretty bad forework would it have been that glowed for such a short time. The light of the sphere was very bright and very large and clearly bluish/greenish, so a star is absolutely out of the question. A falling particle from space? No, it suddenly appeared on one spot and stood still there for appr half of a second. Observer one (me): 23 year old medicine student. Observer two: 48 year old MD.

It was heade North in the sky north of Phoenix, after the trail had ended I thought the object had burnned up in the atmosphere, but I kept looking in the area where the trail ended. Then a short distance where the trail had ended I seen a object going straight down. As it came closer to the outer perimeter of north phoenix I could see a object shaped like a socket, round with something on the bottom. There was also several compartments on the object that was gliding through the sky no sound or spinning, just moving straight south. Then it moved over the mountains and disapeared.<n>

It had no running lights but a few dim lights along the leading edge. It was more delta shaped as opposed to a triangle. No noise, no running lights and fast for its size. It was real big. I first thought it was a commercial craft in trouble. But I heard nothing so far in local news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out smoking during the Dish feed of X files. I normally scan horizon for air craft since we are close to the air port. The cloud cover was broken and at medium height. There was a wind and sure was cold. It had snowed that morning. I looked to the east where normally lights from the mountain can be seen and aircraft turn for one of the approaches to Las Vegas. This craft was moving below cloud cover at this point and upon clearing the mountain made a immediate bank to the left which is south. This got my attention. It has big and I could not have missed it. There were lights on the leading edge but not running lights. These were dim like seeing interior house lights at a distance. The lights of the city reflected off the bottom of the craft. It was big and it was moving fast. I called to my wife who was in the kitchen to come out and see this. There are a few houses blocking the view in that direction so we waited for it to come out. It appeared to have gained altitude and was right below the clouds now and dimly the outline could be seen. The outline was white like a cloud moving fast or like a high speed aircraft which causes condensation when cutting through the air doing abrupt manuvers. The craft continued to the south and west then went out of sight. I am surprised that no one else saw it since it did not appear on the tv or news.<n>

Object resembled  typical comet with rounded head and long vaporous trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I finally had our first UFO experience while visiting relatives in Phoenix last weekend. The event happened about 6:15 PM just at dusk as we turned off I-17 and drove west on Happy Valley Road on the extreme northern edge of Phoenix.   The sky was partially overcast but clear to the west. I first spotted what I thought was a comet just above one of the local mesas.  I don&#39;t know its name, but it forms the northern rim of the little valley just north of Thunderbird Park. The object had a rounded head similar to photos of comets and as it rose from behind the mesa its &#34;tail&#34; also appeared.  The tail flaired out slightly as a comet might and even appeared to have a stream of particles &#34;glittering&#34; inside it. Being just at dusk, it was difficult to judge size and distance, but from where the object disappeared into the cloud (lighting it brightly as it passed through) it&#39;d guess it was between 10-20 miles away.  From our perspective the object was about the size of my thumb extended at arms length. It took about a minute to reach what I&#39;d guess is an altitude of 8-10,000 feet before disappearing into the cloud.  It ascended at about a 70 degree angle.  It appeared a  whitish blue color to me and was brightest at the &#34;head.&#34; I cannot explain what it is we saw.  I have a  knowledge of astronomy, spent 9 years in the airline business, hold a private pilot license, and regard myself as a rational man.  This didn&#39;t resemble a rocket trail or anything else with which I am familiar.<n>

The object looked as if it were decending from a long way out (very long contrail) and as it approached to about 90 degrees overhead the familiar offing of bright &#34;sparking&#34; which might normally be viewed coming from the nose of a missile or Space Shuttle upon re-entry into the high atmosphere.  When the contrail hit 90 degrees, it vanished indicating that any object (unseen) might have entered or exited friction points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time the contrail was being observed, a Boeing 747 was in a landing patern bound for Los Angeles Airport.  This aircraft was flying at a ruduced speed at about 12,000 feet along the same direction nearly crossing the path of the higher contrail.  The object creating the contrail was clearly moving at four to five times the speed as the 747 from our vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC:  Sighting occurred at the time of an airlaunch of a Pegasus missile from an aircraft located approximately 70 miles to the southwest of Monterey, CA.))<n>

As I walked toward the apartment I saw this bright light coming from ABOVE TOWARD THE GROUND. This event took place South-West (correction) from MY location in the North-Eastern Buckhead area which is about 6 miles north-north-east of downtown Atlanta. LIGHT &amp; SOUND: The object was glowing red, and as it streaked toward the ground the tail seemed to ignite. The colors of the tail that followed were bright neon blue at its core, and toward the yellow and red spectrum closer to the edges of the fire/&#34;explosion&#34;. The tail seemed to ignite after the object had passed through the same space, and remained glowing in the sky for about 1 to 1.5 seconds after the main object crashed all the way toward the ground. The object itself was glowing bright red. I estimate the brightness to be one large sized unit of exploding fireworks. Maybe even somewhat brighter. I heard no sound (contrary to what others witnessed two days later Sunday night with another fireball). There was no streetnoise otherwise in the area. SIZE: The size of the red glowing object was no larger than 1/16 of a full moon, and the streak was approx. 12 inches in length from the edge of my hand when outstreched in front of me.((Name deleted))<n>

I looked up and noticed a very distinct formation of lights about the size, shape, and brilliance of  stars travelling down the sky, staying in exactly the same formation. They were not moving as slowly as an airplane nor as quickly as a shooting star -- somewhere in between, but again, they looked as far away as the stars did so they must have been going relatively very quickly. I saw them for about 15 seconds, when they started getting dimmer  (as if travelling away from the earth) and then  disappeared from view. The formation looked something like this: ..     ... .  ...      ..      .. .             ...

At approximately 11:30 pm, I turned right onto my street, heading south toward my house.  Just after going through the stop sign at the next intersection. I saw three large, bright, round headlights very low in the sky ahead of me.  Two were very bright, white.  The third, in between the white ones and slightly lower, was bright red.  All three were at least three times the size of a standard car headlight.  Two smaller white lights were to the rear.  In spite of the glowing brightness of the lights, the street was not brightly illuminated, considering that the lights appeared to be  just above the tree tops.  From my vantage point, they were behind and slightly to the left of the next intersection. I slowed down, turned off the radio and stopped the car, for the briefest moment, in order to have a better look at what was happening since I was heading in their direction.  Instantly,I realized that the lights weren&#39;t moving, there was no engine noise, the pattern of lights was not like an airplane and there were no blinking lights such as an airplane would have,  plus it was much too close to the ground-maybe 150 feet or so up.  This was something different. Since I had stopped just short of the driveway of the house before mine, my next thought was to hit the Genie button and head for my garage.  As I accelerated and drove toward my driveway, in the direction of the lights, I saw that the lights were moving toward me; very slowly and noiselessly, staying at the same height and now parallel to the road.  At this point I was very anxious to get into the garage.  As I turned left into my driveway, I saw that the garage door had not opened so I pressed the Genie button again and paused at the bottom of the drive in order to make sure that the door was opening. (My driveway is gravel, on an uphill slope. I can&#39;t stop halfway up because the wheels spin in the gravel and the car can&#39;t safely make it inside without swerving.)  I looked up to the right and saw that the lights were slowly approaching where I was stopped.  They were so close that I could see the under-belly of a triangular, wedge-shaped craft, somewhat like a Stealth Bomber.  It was a clear, windless night and the shape was a black sillouette against the night sky, but there was no noise.  At that point, the craft was at the far corner of my front yard, up above (approx.150 ft +-) the telephone pole which is about 80 ft from my driveway. I stepped on the accelerator and drove into the garage with just enough clearance to get under the door, which was still rising.  Immediately,  I hit the Genie button and remained rivited to my seat until the door closed. It was then I realized that the engine was still running.  Next, I shut off the engine, ran into the house, shut off the alarm, waited a moment so I could reset it and immediately ran to the nearest window.  The craft was gone.  For the next few minutes I ran around the darkened house looking through various windows but the only other thing I saw was a shooting light over Lake Washington at about Laurelhurst. I called the friend I had just dropped off before heading home.  And then by 11:49, I had called you to report what I had seen. For the record: There were no other cars driving on the street.  There is no through access from my street so there is very little traffic.  I have never seen a &#34;UFO&#34; before.  My friend and I were coming home from the Symphony, after which we had stopped at Barnes &amp; Noble and Starbucks to get  lattes.<n>
12/3/98 23:30|Kirkland|WA|Triangle|1minute +|I saw a wedged shaped craft with very bright lights, approx. 150 feet above the street near my home on December 3,1998 at 11:30 pm.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05001.html|179|ndxe199812| On Thursday night, December 3, 1998, I was driving alone toward my home.  At approximately 11:30 pm, I turned right onto Slater Street, South, from Ohde Ave., heading south toward my house.  Just after going through the stop sign at the intersection of Kirkland Ave. and Slater St. S., I saw three large, bright, round headlights very low in the sky ahead of me.  Two were very bright, white.  The third, in between the white ones and slightly lower, was bright red.  All three were at least three times the size of a standard car headlight.  Two smaller white lights were to the rear.  In spite of the glowing brightness of the lights, the street was not brightly illuminated, considering that the lights appeared to be  just above the tree tops.  From my vantage point, they were behind and slightly to the left of the next intersection. I slowed down, turned off the radio and stopped the car, for the briefest moment, in order to have a better look at what was happening since I was heading in their direction.  Instantly,I realized that the lights weren&#39;t moving, there was no engine noise, the pattern of lights was not like an airplane and there were no blinking lights such as an airplane would have,  plus it was much too close to the ground-maybe 150 feet or so up.  This was something different. Since I had stopped just short of the driveway of the house before mine, my next thought was to hit the Genie button and head for my garage.  As I accelerated and drove toward my driveway, in the direction of the lights, I saw that the lights were moving toward me; very slowly and noiselessly, staying at the same height and now parallel to the road.  At this point I was very anxious to get into the garage.  As I turned left into my driveway, I saw that the garage door had not opened so I pressed the Genie button again and paused at the bottom of the drive in order to make sure that the door was opening. (My driveway is gravel, on an uphill slope. I can&#39;t stop halfway up because the wheels spin in the gravel and the car can&#39;t safely make it inside without swerving.)  I looked up to the right and saw that the lights were slowly approaching where I was stopped.  They were so close that I could see the under-belly of a triangular, wedge-shaped craft, somewhat like a Stealth Bomber.  It was a clear, windless night and the shape was a black sillouette against the night sky, but there was no noise.  At that point, the craft was at the far corner of my front yard, up above (approx.150 ft +-) the telephone pole which is about 80 ft from my driveway. I stepped on the accelerator and drove into the garage with just enough clearance to get under the door, which was still rising.  Immediately,  I hit the Genie button and remained rivited to my seat until the door closed. It was then I realized that the engine was still running.  Next, I shut off the engine, ran into the house, shut off the alarm, waited a moment so I could reset it and immediately ran to the nearest window.  The craft was gone.  For the next few minutes I ran around the darkened house looking through various windows but the only other thing I saw was a shooting light over Lake Washington at about Laurelhurst.

She called me out to see what appeared to be grand opening spot lights but there was no beam from the ground and no such local event. My granddaughter and I came out and the 3 of us thought it looked like a spinning disc that may have been up to a mile wide above the thin cloud cover. There appeared to be 4 individual lights evenly spaced that were moving in a circular pattern one time around then moved toward the center and appeared to cross over each other then back out to the perimeter and circled around again in a repeating pattern. We watched for about 5 minutes then went back inside.When my daughter checked again around 8:30pm they were gone. Had it been a grand opening it would have been still going on. We were not going to report this, but I recieved an E-mail from caus.org about Dec.7 or 8 in which a very similar sighting occured in S.Carolina on Dec.5. I found it strange that we witnessed what seem to be the exact same thing 2 days earlier.<n>

Left my office at 6:15 pm, located behind (east of) Wolf Rd. in Albany.  Immediately noticed lights in the sky which I first thought were search lights.  There were four oval, translucent, white shapes, flying very rapidly in a circle, evenly spaced from each other.  After several seconds, they flew together into a single oval shape in the center of the circle, for about three seconds, then the four separate objects flew back out and into the same circular pattern. I watched this same pattern of circling, coming together, and separating repeat probably a dozen times.  The timing seemed consistent and precise. When I drove out to Wolf Rd., where the street lighting, neon, etc. is very bright, the lights were not visible from there. The objects were strikingly low to the ground, and over an empty field between the office complex where I work and the Wolf Rd. Shoppers Park strip mall.  This location is very close to the Albany Airport, just southeast of it, and is on a flight pattern.  The next day, I stood in the same spot in the parking lot and watched a plane coming in over this same area; the distance of this plane from the ground seemed to be about the same as the objects.  These lights had to have been seen from the Airport control tower.  If there is a known explanation, they should have it, and I sure would like to know what it is.  (I didn&#39;t attempt to call the airport or notify anyone officially.) I work as an information systems director, am college educated, was not particularly interested in or opinionated about UFOs before this first and only possible sighting that I had.<n>

It was hovering at an angle. I say hovering cause it moved like that, not like it was something flying in a straight line like an airplane. It hovered for a few seconds and then disappeared. It reappeared 3 more times in completely different spots in the sky, but in the same area. I was driving at the time watching this happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving out to my brother&#39;s Hockey Game to give him an envelope he forgot at home. I was getting off of the 270east freeway exit ramp at Easton and was watching an airplane (commercial, passenger jet) The sun was setting so I watched the sunset and there were white jet trails in the sky. There is an airport East of there so the Commercial Jet, was just at an upwards climb, and low in the sky. Out by the closest white jet stream, actually below it to the right, was a round/saucer shaped object that was hovering in the sky at an angle. It reflected the sunlight underneath it and was dark on top. It hovered for a few seconds, but long enough that I got a good look at it. I kept looking and it reappeared in a different spot to the right and above where it was before in the sky. It acted the same way and disappeared again. It was definitely the same object. It reappeared a third time below the second spot and to the right sort of making a triangle of appearances. It acted the same way again and disappeared, and I had to turn the corner. It didnt act the exact same way each time, but hovered and was at a slant. I parked at the Easton Ice Rink where my brother plays hockey and went inside to give him his envelope. I went back outside and watched the sky for a few minutes. I didnt see the object again. I drove down the bottom of the hill and across to a newly built parking lot  and turned around and watched the sky for a moment. The two jet trails were still visible, well obviously because there were jets attached ot the trails. I was about to drive away, and saw the object again. There was a black helicopter flying above a neighborhood near there, and the object was farther out in the sky about the same distance it was before, and acted in the same manner and finally disappeared. It was probably not as far away as the jet trails in the sky, but it was close enough I could see it clearly. I had to get back to my store, so I after it disappeared the fourth time, I didnt see it for a few minutes, I left and drove back. This might have been one of the same objects or four different ones, but they were all the same, all four times. My opinion is it was one object. I happened to not see it outside of the car, only when I was inside the car. But, it was definitely, something in the sky and not something like a reflection in my windshield. The car was not moving when I saw it the fourth time. I am 21 years old, and I run my own business in Westerville, Ohio. Which is where I drove from this day. I have seen many documented videos on recent UFO and/or flying saucer footage, and I didnt think I would ever see something to look and act quite that close to what I have witnessed on those documents. I would have never even noticed it if I hadnt been watching the airplanes, and the sunset like I was.<n>

Mom and I went outside to get a closer look.  When we stepped outside it was directly over our yard.  The ufo was on a NE to SW path. It seemed to hover just above the trees moving very slowly and silently.  It appeared to be of a squished Christmas tree shape. There were many lights which were placed haphazardly upon it.  Mother and I differ on the bottom of the ufo.  She didn&#39;t see a &#34;stump&#34; on the bottom, but I did.  So, I saw small red lights in a single, horizontal row around the &#34;stump.&#34;  (The third witness saw the ufo the same as I did.)

The first time (on the 20th of November 98) a 12 year old kid &amp; his friend videofilmed it, and it was shown on both Swedish &amp; Danish TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event took place in my hometown, Malmoe Sweden on the 1st of December 1998. I was on my way to a friend and the time was 15:50. I sat down in my car and as I drove out of our driveway I saw something strange in the sky wich I have never seen before, so I stopped and got out of the car. There wasn´t a cloud in the sky so it was hard NOT TO SEE!!! There were 3 cigar shaped &#34;fire-tails&#34; moving slowly and for all that I could hear, silently across the sky above Malmoe. Travelling slowly and tilting to the side, travelling across &#34;oresund&#34; (the sea between Sweden &amp; Denmark) and then vanishing from my sight above Copenhagen, Denmark after approximatly 20 minutes. The distance between me &amp; the UFO´s Was at the closest, 3km. They travelled in a pack of 3, but there was approximatly a couple of 100 meters between them at all times. As this was wintertime the sun was descending at this time, and the sky was coulored red &amp; orange as usual, but these three objects had a different &#34;fire&#34; coulor wich stood out in the sky. This event took place near 2 major airports. Usually there are lot´s of air traffic around and above Malmoe/Copenhagen, but during this event there were no airplanes in the air as far as I could see. On the sighting on the 20th of November 1998, the TV-station contacted the airport &amp; the police, and neighter of them could explain the sighting. I ordered and recived a copy of the TV-intervju with the video of the event on the 20th of Nov, after my own sighting and its great fotage.

They were black with no lights or markings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking my morning walk around the hiking trails on my property on the morning of Tuesday, Dec. 1, 1998. It was 7:10am. (07:10) As I was approaching a clearing near the treeline I heard a familiar sound that I have heard several times of birds swooping down making only the sound of air passing their wings. The sun was just starting to peek over the hills behind me. It had not yet shined on Mt. Konocti directly across the lake from where I was waiting for what I expected to see, birds. Instead of birds, I saw four objects flying in close formation. They were black in color. They had no visable lights or markings. I have to guess their size to be approx. six feet across the wings and equal in length. The fuselage was round and pointed at both ends. The wings were narrow in relationship the the fuselage, located in the center and were pointed at the ends. The wing span was maybe just a little wider than the length of the fuselage. I heard the swooshing sound about two or three seconds before seeing the objects. They seemed to have flown down the ravine that I had just walked down and was flying just above the tree tops. Immediately after first seeing them, they leveled out and flew in a straight line out over the lake toward Mt. Konocti. Buckingham Peninsula extends out into the lake at the base of the mountain. They flew to where the peninsula is, then the one on the left made a smooth turn to the left. The other three wobbled just a bit as if they were not aware that they were to turn left, then they too turned. They flew in front of the mountain where it was still dark. Because of the darkness they blended in with the mountain and I lost sight of them. I waited to see if they would reappear in the light of the sky to the left of the mountain, but they did not reappear. From the time I first heard the familiar sound to when they flew out of sight, was about 6 seconds. They flew in a southwesterly direction before they made their turn. At that point, they were flying south across the face of the mountain.<n>
