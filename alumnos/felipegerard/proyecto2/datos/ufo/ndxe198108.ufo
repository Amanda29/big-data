It seemed to be very distorted and was wabbling very bad. It seemed to change shapes for a few seconds(10 or 20)untill it turned into a UFO.It was a disk that then started our way. It flew right over us at least 30ft. from us. It was so close that i could have hit it with a rock! Anyway it was going a couple of miles an hour only as it passed! It was close enough to see detail. It had grooves on the bottom 2 closer to eachother twords the out side and the third groove more twords the center. As it was going by the dome on the top of the ufo would open from the center outward! When it would close i couldn&#39;t see a seem.But when it was open there was a red light coming from it. This light seemed to be coming from behind a red diamond shape pattern.The dome doors would open periaudicly It seemed that since we could see the red diamond shape pattern that the dome wasn&#39;t spinning yet the rest of the disk was.Anyway it wasa great sighting and i&#39;ve been looking ever since.Till the sighting i submitted today over Ridgecrest Ca.    17 years later!<n>

He had a farm in the countryside of upstate NY near Saratoga. I usually wake up to go the bathroom every night. I was sleeping in the same bed as my cousin ((name deleted)). there was a window right beside the bed. I woke up this night at 3:00 am and glanced out the second story window. What I saw has since changed my life. IT was football saucer in shape with round circular lights going through the middle of the Craft. The craft was glowing white and the circular lights in the middle were red. It was huge and probably about the size of a 747. It was probably about 300 feet over a field from the house. I stood there for about 3 minutes looking at the UFO. I ((deleted)). I finally woke my cousin ((name deleted)) up and he saw it also. when he saw it from a sitting position on the bed he just froze. I believe he was in shock. We both looked at for it for another 30 seconds and we screamed out to my uncle ((name deleted)) and his Dad. After we screamed out the UFO tuned all green and slowly moved around the side of the house. Then my uncle ((name deleted)) came into the room. he yelled at us and told us to go back to bed. After he left I changed my pajamas and looked out he side window to see nothing. The next day we went to the local city library and I looked at a UFO book and saw the exact same UFO. I have since watched a UFO program on TV and I heard someone describing the exact same UFO colors and everything.<n>

With that occurrence my friends and I felt very uneasy and decided to depart.  I returned on other occasions to witness other equally unexplainable lights, which moved in and out of the water.  Following those sightings, I began to send Morris Code messages from the shoreline using my car headlights.  Messages such as: God is Love.  I sent the simple messages over the water for several nights; when a response was sent in Morris Code by way of a red light, which moved between two white lights moving in unison near the horizon.  The response message was:  God is.  Within several nights of that response,  I was given the opportunity to see the UFO aircraft that generated the &#34;lights&#34; on two occasions.  One following night, I parked my car on a beach access ramp facing the ocean and using my headlights, I sent my God is love message out over the water.  Shortly, thereafter, four lights arranged in a blue-green-blue-green pattern appeared on the horizon. I stepped out of the car to get a better look and the lights began to move very quickly toward the beach where I was standing.  The lights reached the waters edge at the beach and stopped.  The UFOs traveled from the horizon to the shore in less than 30 seconds!  At that point I observed that the aircraft were about the size of 737&#39;s and their shapes were elliptical and solid bl! ack with a one blue and one green light positioned on the outer edge.  Their appearance was difficult to see except when heat lightening flashed in the sky behind them.  The UFOs did not remain for long but this time more slowly returned to their position on the horizon.  The second sighting occurred several nights later and further north of Jax Beach in an area of the beach where houses or apartments were not constructed at the time.  Again, I used my headlights to send the Morris Code message &#34;God Is&#34; over the water.  Again lights appeared on the horizon and moved more slowly over the water until they were about 150 feet from the shore.  That time I counted six UFOs that appeared as before.  I walked down to the shore and waited for something to happen; however, I do not remember anything else occurring, except that they seemed to loose interest in me and slowly drifted out of sight over the horizon.<n>
8/15/81 23:00|Cambridge|OH|Unknown|20 minutes|Multiple objects of differing size and possible jet intervention seen in late evening sky over rural area of Ohio, early 1980's.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66428.html|7|ndxe198108| Multiple objects of differing size and possible jet intervention seen in late evening sky over rural area of Ohio, early 1980&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going to bed late one evening and I noticed some lights in the distance through my bedroom window. My room was on the north side of the building and the window is a north facing window. The area where I lived was 2 miles north of town. Pop. 12,000 in the town, 40,000 in whole the county. As I approached the window to see what they were, I observed over 10 small lights which alternately flashed blue, green, and reddish orange. They all seemed to be moving in a hap-hazard manner. I then noticed further up in the sky a much larger elongated craft, this object had the same color lights around it with the exclution of of the reddish-orange. I noticed a steady white light on the bottom of craft off to one end. This white light was not flashing but appeared to be from an internal light source. The distance from my location seemed to be at least a half mile at other end of a valley. The larger object was stationary throughout the sighting till the very end. I aproximate the size to be at least 200 to 300 feet long and 75-100 feet accross. The smaller lights may have been 10-15 feet across. Upon seeing this i called my mother who was in her room adjancet to mine. She looked out her window and observed the same scene. The smaller objects began to move up to the larger craft and back down below the horizon. After 20-30 seconds i spotted the objects rising back to larger craft. After 8 to 9 minutes of this action, I heard a loud roaring sound. We noticed 2 objects heading toward the larger craft but they were different from the others. As soon as i noticed them the smaller objects started to disappear inside the larger craft. The larger craft began to move away from the approaching objects, slowly at first, then at a great speed till it disappeared from view. The approaching objects gave off a loud roaring sound that gave me to believe they were some type of jets. The pursuing objects suddenly had 2 large bright orangish white lights at rear, (I assumed afterburners). The large craft well out ! accelera ted the pursuing objects as they approached the area it occupied. After this sighting, my mother was quite un-nerved and had to sit down for 45 minutes to calm down. Side note: in the area it is very rural and only a few families lived in the area below the where the craft were spotted. Also the closest airbase is at least 80 miles to the west in Columbus, Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/15/81 22:00|Huntington Beach|CA|Triangle|10 minutes|Large craft , triangle shaped,very bright white lights/prism , forward/backward/90deg turns/hoovered ,at night over a city|4/1/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17022.html|8|ndxe198108| ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Large craft , triangle shaped,very bright white lights/prism , forward/backward/90deg turns/hoovered ,at night over a city<n> <n><n> <n><n> This forum is a good thing, at last I can tell my story and see if any one else has a theory on what I saw; I would like to tell of the two U.F.O. sighting that I had several years ago in the southern California area. As any one who has ever seen a U.F.O. can relate, I had kind of an empty feeling after my sightings. I could not tell you for sure what I had seen, only that it was truly an object that was flying and unidentifiable. The experience has never been explained to my saisfaction. The first time I saw something was in about 1979-80 the time was (pretty late I&#39;d say 10pm) in Huntington Beach Calif. A group of friends and I had just come out of my parents second floor apartment, my buddy Brad saw it first; he had looked up to see the incessantly bothersome Police Helicopter that circles Orange County. This helicopter has a spotlight that it shines on criminals and the like, any way it tends to get a person&#39;s attention. We saw Brad looking up so we looked up, behind the copter, much higher in the sky was a grouping of bright white lights they were so white bright they were emitting a prism effect. They were in a triangular grouping not a formation, it seemed like one craft.  There were very high clouds that night and the light for this craft was reflecting off the clouds. We all were looking up at this thing as it stood still in the sky! Then we called my folks out of the house and even the neighbor came out see what was going on. So it was not just me, there was 7 people that witnessed this craft. Now the weird part; this thing started moving across the sky very slow, then it would stop. We realized the police officers in the copter might also have been seeing this. They were trying to get the spot light to shine up, I do not think the spot light was meant to go up. However, they were trying to do it. This thing started moving again then made ninety degree turns! It even went backwards once. We got a good look for almost 10 minutes. The lights were intense, it was nothing natural, and it was not a jet. The light sparkled all colors, a very beautiful site. Then it started moving one direction a little quicker, and then it accelerated across the sky so fast it vanished, this really happened! Right over the city yet, not out in the desert like you think. We talked about it over the years, we were no dummies it was not a plane or a Vandenberg launch (seen many of those) this was a craft, truly a Unidenfied Flying Object. I saw a second one years latter, but I got to go the wife is calling, Now that I know this site is here I will tell of that experience another time. Any Ideas, or theories I really can&#39;t swallow the space craft thing. But?!?<n>

After my wife and I got in the car and started the deisel engine we heard a strange sound coming from a valley behind my brothers house.  The sound was a revolving deep vibrating hum with various digital tones.  This humming got so close we could feel this sound on our skin (kind of like standing in front of a loud speaker).  By that time we were both standing outside the car with the engine turned off.  We could not see anything in the black sky, we only heard and felt this vibrating hum with digital tones.  After a minute or two it slowly drifted back down into the valley until we could no longer hear it.  We ran back to my brothers house to ask them if they had heard anything which they didn&#39;t because of a window air conditioning unit running and making plenty of noise.  We then called the Rolla/Vichy air port (only three miles north) to inquire about anything in our area on their radar which there wasn&#39;t.  My brother&#39;s house is in a very small comunity of not more than 100 people.  His closest neighbor was 3/4 miles away.<n>

It was the night of the eclipse; also Seattle was having its air show. My daughter was at another camp playing cards and I had taken my three sons to a neighbor’s camp to watch the eclipse. When it was finished we headed back to go to bed. As we came under the trees at our camp sight we heard a strange rotary sound as though rock was being ground in a circular Mattoon upon stone. As the noise came closer it slowed in the cycles of the sound. It stopped directly above our camp and a white light, brighter then I have ever seen made a pillar of light down into the camp. The boys who were about eight ten and eleven began to scream in a horrified whale as I tried to run out to the creek so I could see the UFO. No mom they screeched at me as I tried to escape then and run to the river. They clung to me so horrified that I could only comfort them and tell them it was all right. Then the thing began to grind faster and faster and even faster as the light moved away from us. Finally it sounded like a great whirring insect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friends of ours were coming home up the mountain. As they pulled in and the boys ran to them they informed us they had just seen an orange ball of lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one in the camp area, and it was full had seen or heard anything and there seamed to be a laps of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day I went into the small town to get groceries. I heard several people discussing the UFO they had seen the previous night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two years later as I told my story around the campfire at our camp at Sultan Basin a fellow camper ask me if this had happened in Aug. I said it had and he proceeded to tell me of the experience he had had that same night. He said he had seen it and that it was large and disk shaped and had shined a light down into his camp. He said he had shot at it before it took off and disappeared into an orange ball and faded out of sight, He said it whirred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following year my daughter saw a disk shaped object hovering above the horizen. She ran home afraid. She was seventeen at that ime and her friend also saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the years we camped at that same spot. At night you could hear a whirring sound like mashinery comming from a distance. There were many sightings throughout those years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/15/81 07:00|Jensen|UT|Cylinder|6 min.|I saw something in the Utah sky in 1981.  It's a relief to tell someone!|7/29/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76854.html|12|ndxe198108| I saw something in the Utah sky in 1981. It&#39;s a relief to tell someone!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello, I know you have a lot of pranks and false reports that are turned into you all the time.  I worked for the Utah power and light company out of Salt Lake Utah around 1981-82 time frame and I was on a small crew near Jensen, Utah, erecting power line towers.  We had just finished one of the towers at around 6:00 pm and began loading all of the equipment into the trucks getting ready to end the shift and go back to the warehouse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the guys spoke up and said look at that!  The object looked like a silver cigar holder and I would say it was approx. 40-60 ft. long, and approx. 10-15 ft. wide, and rounded at both ends, with a gold light on the front and a blue light in the middle.  I also estimate that the object was about a mile away from us at the time we first saw it.  As best as I can remember it had no signs of trailing gas and was silent.  We saw it coming from the northern horizon and it only took probably 10 seconds to go out of sight in the southwestern horizon.  I know that it was not a satellite, jet, or anything I have ever seen before, it was in our inner atmosphere, in other words it was very close to us.  My opinion the SR-71 Blackbird or the X-15 wouldn’t have had a chance.  I have been seeing a lot of reports on the net and on TV about sightings lately and am very reluctant to let anyone know about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event happened years ago and it is as though it happened a few minutes ago.  It has been bothering me for a long time and I am just now getting the courage to tell someone, it is a relief!  I mentioned this to my wife once and she said, are you sure you weren’t smoking pot, drinking or something?  I replied to her that all that I was doing was drinking a jug of iced tea I had in my lunch.   She didn’t take me serious at the time but she has since then changed her mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work for a government defense contractor now and am aware of the many false reports that people make and some that are very real.  I know what I saw was real and in my knowledge of air travel and planes, jets, drones and similar aircraft, we have nothing! like what I saw.  This was in the 1981-82 time frame.  I hope if the government does have craft such as this that they let everyone know about it soon to stop all the speculation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do believe in our lord Jesus and hope all of this comes to light soon, for every one&#39;s sake.<n>

Then the five lights made a perfect triangle and continued across the sky in this formation for three to five minutes. At this time I went inside to get my mother to see what was happening. After She came outside and I pointed out where they were in the sky, the lights started to fly around again in no specific pattern. The five lights then flew into a single light, turned red and flew directly east, making a 90 degree turn straight out over Lake Michigan with such a speed as to leave a streak in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was a full grown man at the time. I had a wife named ((name deleted)) and 2 kids, ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted)). This is all I know. I went up into a space craft. Two beings greeted me with open arms. They showed me secrets of the world such as cold fusion, splitting the atom, and the advancement of computers. They were not threatening in any way and actually tried to comfort me. They put peaceful thoughts in my head. They also showed me what would happen if we did not stop nuclear weapons. I was feeling very sad at that time. I then blacked out or something. Only to find myself as a new born baby. I can remember being born. I know it sounds crazy but it is very true. I just recently explained my birth to my mother who was dumfounded and speechless. I have always had the feeling that I am supposed to find my original self and I have been searching ever since. I have since been contacted by the beings 3 times since my birth. They have contacted me twice in dreams and once in the night as I was driving down a deserted highway. Everytime they just show me the horrors of nuclear war. The horrors are trememndous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not post all reports of alleged abduction/interaction, but we have elected to do so in this case.

I was active duty military and was stationed in Korea at the time.  My unit was out on a training excersise with our helicopters situated in a valley.  At 0630 I was standing in line to recieve breakfast and looked over into the valley.  I saw a cone shaped flying object move up the valley.  It had circling lights around it that were mult-colored and rotating in opposite directions.  It had no propellers, or rotor blades or any external engines that I could see.  It was also quite soundless and moved as if it was on a string being pulled through the valley.  That particular morning it was very foggy but as the craft approached the fog parted and the craft moved through our area.  Myself and one other person saw this UFO and he looked right at me and told me to keep my mouth shut and never mention a word about what we just saw.  Being in the military and having someone that outranks me to tell me to keep my mouth shut was to me an order.  I kept my mouth shut, but was amazed that I actually saw what I believe to be a UFO.  Again, this vehicle made no noises, no sense of motion except for it&#39;s flight and was NOT a military reconnisance aircraft.  I know the difference, believe me.<n>

I was at a summer camp (camp ST. Malo) at the time. I was on a campout overnight. This was something they did for the kids who stayed two weeks in order for the new kids to check in and old ones out. It was an optional trip. After dinner and campfire, we went to the tents. I was restless for some reason. We were all in two-man tents. I&#39;m not sure if it was just a dream, but I remember noticing a very bright light outside the tent. I tried with all my might to wake up my sleeping companion. His eyes sprang open ,but they were motionless. I mean they stared straight out, as in death. I then heard the zipper of my tent open. I had thought at first it was one of the campers with us, but it waved at me and I felt motionless. I felt no fear. I remember that it must have been approx. 3.5-4 feet tall and a very almond colored skin. It had two large bug like-eyes and no trace of nose. I could detect an indention were it&#39;s mouth should have been. I heard something in my head. Not a voice, but more like an emotion. As if by autopilot, I was motioned outside the tent by hand. I was surrounded by white light. I felt a pinch in my arm. And I faintly remember an emotion I was unfamilar with at the time. As though I was geneticly diferent somehow than everyone else and needed special watch.The rest I remember is being carried and set down where I was sleep (my tent).The next morning I only remembered being set down. I am now 31 going on 32 and have tried to peice this together. I do have a mark on my left arm I cannot explain or remember otherwize. I also now live in Alaska and I have reason to believe I was abducted again in the Wasilla area, although I have no rememberence of it. I have begun to itch in that area of my arm about a year go. The summer of 1999, I was working late hours in Big Lake at the local ((deleted)), and speculate it could have happened then. Most of what I have reported has been deeply buried in dreams and has gradully resurfaced ov! er the y ears. I did report something to the camp authorities the next day, but I don&#39;t rember what I reported and I do know that I wasn&#39;t the only one who reported anything.<n>

We had dragged two lawn chairs out into the area and were laying in the field enjoying the summer weather.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting there talking when all of a sudden I noticed something coming towards us in the distance.  At first, it appeared to be a plane, but as it got closer, it was clear that it was shaped like a circle and had lights of different colors around the bottom.  It was completely silent and seemed low to the ground, not as high as an airplace.  It blocked out the stars as it passed very slowly directly above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend freaked out and began shooting at the object with his pellet gun.  Seriously.  He was an unusual fellow.  I told him to put it away, because they may take it as a threat, so he stopped and we watched it continue over the woods to our north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course, this is something I will never forget and I remember it like it was yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

8/1/81 20:00|Stockton|CA|Rectangle|30 minutes|Change from a rectangle to a old screaming 707 airliner balactica|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89943.html|21|ndxe198108| change from a rectangle to a old screaming 707 airliner balactica<n> <n><n> <n><n> June 22, 2012 In the summer of august 1981, my wife and son were traveling in the area of Stockton airport Stockton California. When we saw a bright light to the east above the horizon about 15 deg the size of the light was twice that of a landing light of a common commercial airliner.  It was about 70 miles away from us.  I worked for a major airline at the time. So I know what a large transporter would look like. So I deceited to park at the end of the run way and watch a touch and go of aircraft because pilots from major airlines use Stockton airport to training.  Anyhow as the craft approached the control area I figured that the aircraft would do a regular base and final approach,  and touch and go but what happen was this.  The craft was at the same height as the control tower and it looked like the ship was going to crash into the control tower and went on the other side of the tower and across the small aircraft hangars still heading west. As its approached us about 5 cars were a! t the end of the runway and we all got out of our cars and I saw the rectangle black metallic, with lights flashing all around it ufo approach us all going across the highway airport boulevard at 25 feet off the ground moving at a speed of 3 miles per hour. Very very slow its length of a football field, height 40 feet, width 75 feet. As it slowly move in front of all of us there was port holes of 3 where you can see being inside that resembled tall thin looking figures looking at us.  I had a strong flash light and I shined the light into the port hole and gave a delta sign with my light.  As the ship was in front of us a old type of Buick 1951 sedan black car approached the ship with a person inside it drivers side with looked like a man in black and he didn’t even see the ship.  He was gone after that.   We watch the ship make a long round approach into the delta for about 10 minutes.  After that I went to the control tower and reported a ufo as I was doing this other peo! ple were calling up the tower and reporting the same thing.  I! asked t he tower if any aircrafts had come into this area in the last 10-15 minutes and they said no aircraft came through at all.  It is impossible for the tower not to see the large spot light 70 miles away and than the tower high craft passing behind the tower.  After that we left the area a headed south on hwy 99 towards modest California and there we saw the bright light again. It had made a large circle around the the Stockton , Manteca, lathrope.   I saw it coming very fast and low maybe 30 feet .  I went under the over pass of Manteca 99 hwy and saw the ship change shape from a rectangle to a old 707 aircraft and screaming very low and very old looking battle ship.  We were shocked in its new appearance.  After that I went home and call blue book and reported it.  Many years later mufon people wanted to hear our story and put my wife and I under hipnotics because my wife said she saw  the ship at Stockton airport went on top of her and I saw it to the side.   That the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It went directly over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had posted this at another site previously so this is an copy of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the summer of 1981 I believe. Carnes, MS.(35 miles SW of Hattiesburg) About 8pm. My wife and I were walking around outside and talking. It was a clear cloudless night so I was looking at the stars. As we turned to go in I noticed it. It was coming from a West-North Westerly direction. It was moving at approximately 10-15 mph and maybe 10-15 ft above the pines. It was a 3 sided and I think a little longer than wide ( my wife says diamond shaped) with white lights spaced around the sides. Maybe 6 lights per side. Of course I was excited to see this and was making funny comments about being &#34;beamed up&#34; but my wife was terrified so I took her in and calmed her. As quickly as I could I went to the front door and looked in the direction the object should have gone. Seeing nothing I turned to go in and saw it (actually another like it) going back in the direction it had come but it was 1/4 mile north of where it should have been. As it went out of sight I turned to go in again and realized why it wasnt where I expected it to be. There was another (or the original) moving in a Northerly direction about 1/4 mile south-east of me. Just then it makes a turn (more like a stop and turn) back to the same direction it had come from in the beginning; about a 20 degree turn. As it turned the light at the front of the object got brighter, just as a flashlight seems to brighten as it sweeps past your face. This time I stayed outside and watched it, over my wifes objections. It went directly over my home, just above the tree tops, 10-15 mph and at no time did I hear any noise from it. Since it did go directly over my home I was able to estimate it to be about 60-70 ft wide and maybe 80-100 ft long. As close as it was, I could still not make out any other features. Except for the lights, it blended in with the darkness because of its color. It continued at the same speed and altitude till out of sight. I don&#39;t know what it was but I do know it wasn&#39;t a blimp or weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was on an overnight stay at Lake Travis just outside of Austin, Texas, with 3 other friends. I couldn&#39;t sleep for gazing at all the stars. They were beautiful as always. Sometime after midnight, I spotted lights flashing in a circular motion of red and green. They appeared to be about the distance of todays satellite&#39;s, in the sky just overhead of me. This was a popular campsite and probably 20 - 30 people were scattered over the entire campsite. I was camping on the East side of Lake Travis. I became fixed on the site immediately. After 1-2 minutes, they completed another circle and shot off out in to space in a straight line formation. As if to follow one another. The speed was incredible. So fast I lost them quickly as they left a short streak of light behind them as they disappeared in the night, some 30-45 seconds more. I woke my 3 friends with a start! Trying quietly and calmly to explain what I&#39;d seen. This took another 2-2.1/2 minutes. Suddenly, 2 Air Force Jets came flying very low and very fast over the campsite and woke up everyone there. They were extremely loud! We all held our ears for they were low. They flew up and towards the direction of the lights I had just seen going S-SW of the Lake. Everyone there witnessed the Jets. I had no interest in UFO&#39;s at the time, but I felt I had seen what the Jets were after. It was only years later when television began showing a number of shows about UFO&#39;s that I became curious about what I saw that night back in the summer of 81&#39;. Most sightings are near Air Force Bases or so I&#39;ve heard. Also, that military air vehicles are present at the time of other sightings. My best friend of 13 years at the time, (now 27 years) knew I wasn&#39;t joking about what I&#39;d seen, however, my other two friends weren&#39;t sure. Everyone knew about the Jets, though. I&#39;ve been looking up ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was August, and hot enough that my friend and I were camping on the sand in sleeping bags, with no tent.  I awoke around 2 and sat up in my bag.  Directly across the river above a hill was a yellow-orange spherical object.  It appeared to be lit from within.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object hovered perfectly still, making no sound whatsoever.  It was the kind of night that was so clear and quiet you could hear a camper 100 feet from you clear his throat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s difficult to gauge the size of the object, but it appeared to be about 20 to 25 feet in diameter.  I awakened my friend when the object began to move.  My friend only witnessed the object in motion; it is unfortunate that I did not waken him sooner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not appear to accelerate.  What I mean is, it went from a dead standstill to a fast pace, apparently instantly.  It was as if I were watching a computerized dot on a screen in animation.  The speed of the object was probably somewhere around 4 or 500 miles per hour.  It flew overhead, off to our right side, and out of sight in a matter of 5 or 6 seconds.  Again there was absolutely no sound, not even a whisper from the thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never reported this sighting, although it happened nearly thirty years ago.  Today I am a schoolteacher, and my friend is a principal.  We are both in our mid-fifties.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
