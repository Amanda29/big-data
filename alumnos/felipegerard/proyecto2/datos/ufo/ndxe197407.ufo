7/30/74 14:00|Windsor (Canada)|ON|Unknown|20 minutes|possible abduction case. Giant 3 foot high spides in my friends back yard|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13130.html|1|ndxe197407| possible abduction case. Giant 3 foot high spides in my friends back yard<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not necisarly a UFO report but I know that something VERY strang happened in this experience and I have a feeling that Me, my brother and my 2 friends were abducted back when I was the age of 5 and 10. I don&#39;t know if your interested in this stroy but I am trying to tell as many people about this because I KNOW that there is something happened on that day. I don&#39;t expect a responce from you or anything but maybe this can help some people. I don&#39;t know exactly when this happened but sometime between that age of 5 and 10 (I am 30 now) Me, my brother and my 2 friends were sitting in the back yard of the friends house on their swingset. Behind thier house is a small field with a path that ran behind the houses all the way down the street and into the park at the end. After the field was a 4 foot wire fence seperaing the houses from the raliway property. After the fence is a small hill built as a noise protection from the traintracks. It was sometime in the summer I dont&#39; know the day or the month but it was about mid afternoon.  The 4 of us were on my friends swingset just talking and goofing around when along the path in back of the yard came a kid our age. To this day I can swear that I knew who this person was and we all knew him at the time of this story but I canot remember his name or who he was. He came up to us and asked us if we wanted to see some giant spiders. Being kids of course we all did so we followed this kid down the path almost all the way to the park. About 2 or 3 houses before the park he stopped in the path and pointed to the 4 foot wire fence. there on the fence was a GIANT spider. At least I remember it being a spider but the thing is it only had 4 legs that I can remember. And when I say GIANT spider I mean this thing was almost the size of the whole fence!!! So it had to be at LEAST 3&#39; tall. Now you may think I&#39;m crazy or I&#39;m making this up but I remember that spider clear as day and I&#39;ll remember it till the day I die. It was colored yellow and black  sort of tiger stipped. It had a big body. The legs of this thing were very long. All four of them. Probably about 18&#34; to 24&#34; long each and they were skinny. I do not remember any joints in the legs though. Now you can say someone was probably playing a joke but the year was approximatley 1974 so I doubt you could find anything this realistic looking to play a joke with and not only that I remember one of the spiders moving. Very slowly. That&#39;s about all I remember about the insident. I don&#39;t remember going home that day and I don&#39;t remember ever seeing that kid again, ever. But that&#39;s not all. I don&#39;t think any of us talked about this insident for a while to each other or to anyone else but when we did start telling people about this Me and my brothers friend always remembered the spiders being 3&#39; tall but my brother and my friend always remembered the spiders being maybe 4 or 5 inches tall (a big spider but not GIANT spiders) I think this disagreement is what caused us to stop talking about this insident altogether. But I still remember certain times growing up when I&#39;d see a big spider (there are yellow and black big spiders in my town and they are big), I&#39;d always say, that&#39;s nothing ( size wise) and I&#39;d remember the GIANT spiders. Now years later I started rembering this insident again and I asked my brother about it but he doesn&#39;t remember anything about this not even seeing smaller spiders. That&#39;s about all for now. I hope this fits into yoru criteria somehow and you can take the time to examine this insident. I thank you for your time and understanding.  ((name deleted))<n>

I was maybe 15 and 16 years old. A different friend saw it each year as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and a friend were hired to guard/watch the art festival tents for approx. 1 week, nights. We laid on the ground as this was the best position to look for possible intruders feet. Though there was some ambiant light, in the shadow of the tents we could still see the black night sky and stars well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An object that looked exactly the same, same size and glow of an Earth based satellite came into view at a slow rate of speed. There was no sound. It stopped, sped up, zig zagg&#39;d, loop de loop&#39;d, went strait, at varying  rates of speed, stopped short. Sometimes it covered from one side of the whole sky and beyond to the other in a split second. Most of the time it moved at an unearthly speed, I&#39;m guessingat least 20 times what a modern fighter jet would do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it left for good, it accelerated in a strait line with building speed, compounding, at a rate that is indescribable and definitely not of our capibilities, strait out into space(as opposed to over the trees) It got noticeably smaller and was gone in parts of a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t remember for sure if it left a trail or not as I have seen many Meteorites leave glowing Green etc. trails. My feeling is it did leave a trail but just on its final exit...it was long ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

They were afraid to drive the rest of the way home alone, so I followed them in my car. When we reached their home and looked to the east, we saw three objects hovering above a field behind our grandmother&#39;s home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were in a triangle formation, with two on top and one on the bottom. We sat on my cousin&#39;s porch and watched them for a few hours. During that time, every so often they would swap positions, reversing the triangle. They had mainly white lights, but those changed periodically to orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I left, one of them broke away and stayed parallel to my car the entire length of the road (about a mile). I turned right, and it did the same. It remained beside me, just above the trees, until I met a car a half a mile later. Then it did a 180-degree turn and followed that car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousins said the other two left in the same direction I drove a few minutes after my departure. We never saw them again, but there were other reported sightings in our area that summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Above the square of Hagerstown was a craft that seemed to be about a football field long, and was hovering silently. My wife and I just kept looking at it without even saying anything for awhile. It had different colored lights slowly revolving around it&#39;s perimeter. We couldn&#39;t believe the size of it, plus the fact of no noise. Then we began to talk about it, watching it slowly begin to move to the west.All at once it sped up to an incredible speed and vanished. I went to the apt. and called Hagerstown Airport and asked if they picked up anything on radar,and they said no. We have kept quiet about this forever. Now we aren&#39;t exactly positive of the exact date that summer, since it has been such a long time, but we will remember this the rest of our lives. The reason I am doing this now is, we are wondering if anyone other than us had seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were collecting wood for our campfire when we noticed a very bright steady orange light moving from the zenith toward Jay&#39;s Peak, which was east of our location.  It made no sound and did not deviate from its course.  We followed the object until it became obscure on the horizon, when we noticed another, identical orange UFO on the same path and at the same speed as the first. It, too, eventually vanished on the eastern horizon after being observed for approximately one minute.  The next day, I reported this sighting to the Enosburg Falls, Vermont police department.  The other children claimed that the objects emitted many different colors, which I duly reported, but the only color I personally remember was a steady, unwavering orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

RE: Football sized saucer over Hagerstown, MD in summer of 1974<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was cleaning up the remains of an outside dinner I saw this craft that was HUGE, to a little kid, just hovering silently. My view of the craft was slightly obstructed by the house but I clearly remember it had different colored lights (red, blue, yellow) slowly revolving around its perimeter. I don&#39;t remember how long it stayed but I remember just staring at it for what seemed a long time and then it just sped away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always wondered what it was and for the longest time just assumed it was something that was associated with the county fair.

They had no markings, perfectly metallic with a parting line on the center circumference, purplish color on the bottom and silver on the top, about the length of a 727.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We quickly ruled out earthly origin.  They stopped above the platform, then without turning, went southeast about 1/4 mile, hovered, reversed and came back to a stationary position above the platform.   During this time, Navy frogmen in wetsuits were attempting to enter a rubber raft at the base of the platform but after seeing the craft, they climbed back up the ladder of the platform and re-entered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In about two seconds, the craft &#39;bulleted&#39; away at about a 45 degree angle back toward the same southerly approach direction and were invisible.   A few seconds later, two phantom jets, apparently from Tyndal AFB in Panama City, roared at about 100&#39; over our boat and &#34;chased&#34; the craft at the direction and angle of ascent as the craft had departed.  The impression I had was of a puppy trying to catch a speeding car.  I had recently been discharged as an ROTC Army Officer and my brother from the Coast Guard.  If I&#39;d had my recently purchased SLR camera with its 210mm telephoto lens, given that most of the time we were 300-400&#39; from these craft, there would be little doubt today of the existence of UFO&#39;s.

I do not wish to mention which company or location for obvious reasons but all information can be verified by numerous witnesses that my statements are true and accurate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:30pm in the summer of 1973 myself and two other friends had just parked my car in a large field to have a few beers and talk and just basically enjoy the pleasant summer evening. There was a full moon that night and it seemed to be bigger and brighter than I had ever seen. The moon was so bright that even though we were parked in the middle of a large field where there were no lights anywhere for perhaps a mile or more, we could see well enough to read by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While passing out our first beers to my buddies I happened to notice an object in the night sky which I estimated to be at an altitude of between 2500 and 3500 ft.  I thought that I had seen the object move in a triangular pattern at such a speed that I was not sure if I had actually been correct in my initial observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Without mentioning what I thought I had seen to the other two people who were present with me, I continued to keep my eyes on the object.  After about fifteen or twenty seconds it did it again. After seeing this happen a second time, I pointed the object out to the others and asked them to keep their eyes on it.  They both laughed and started joking about how it was probably a flying saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because none of us had ever before seen anything of the sort and didn&#39;t actually believe the stories of such reports, I suggested that it might be a new military heliocopter or something of the sort because it did not appear to have a comparable lighting arrangement to anything that I had seen before.  As the three of us kept our collective eyes on the object the craft made similar movements to the first that I had witnessed by myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing the speed at which this craft moved and the sharp angles at which it changed direction in mid flight, the two others who were with me became very excited and immediately decided that it was indeed a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the three of us had witnessed seeing the same such movements of the object, I decided to move my car so that my headlights would be pointing directly at it. I did not turn the headlights on until I was sure that they were pointing directly at the object after which, I began to flash them on and off and from high to low beam in a fashion similar to the old light signaling technics used by the navy. After flashing my lights in this fashion for about fifteen seconds or so, I turned them off and waited to see what would happen. At first I did not think that anything would come of it but, after about twenty or so seconds, we all noticed that the object had stopped flashing in the mannor that it had been and that instead it now appeared as a white light which remained on and didnot flash at all. As we continued to watch this object we noticed that it now appeared to be getting bigger and within a few more seconds it became obvious that it was heading in our direction at a fair rate of speed. The object had dropped in altitude and was now comming in just over tree top level. As the object moved closer to us it turned off it&#39;s lights or light and as it came within the last quarter mile or so it passed directly in front of the full moon which showed a very precise silouette of what was indeed a saucer shaped craft. The moonlight was being refracted off of the craft and it was now very clear that the craft was polished silver in color. As we continued to observe this craft during the last one hundred yards or so of it&#39;s approach, one of my friends became so terrified by the sight that he wet his pants and began to panic. This person is a large man and usually afraid of nothing. The friend of mine who became terrified was attempting to hide himself behind the back seat of my car and screaming that we were all going to die and that they were going to take us and disect us. As I stood there and watched this craft, it came directly over our heads at approximately 100 to 120 feet at which time it stopped moving and just hovered in mid air. There was no sound emitted from the craft at all and there was no wind being generated such as would be from a turbine or rotor blades. The craft was so close and the light from the moon was so bright that I could make out certain details of the saucer which struck me as interesting such as, rivots along where the apparent metal panels or sections of the craft were fitted together. I could also see that the lights which were around the entire outer edge of the craft rectangular shaped and were raised somewhat from the rest of the saucers surface area perhaps as much as two inches. The lights or light covers appeared to be somewhat opaque or semi-transparent and appeared to be fairly thick.  The closest thing that I have seen to describe this craft would be the saucer that was shown on the beginning of the old TV serial called THE INVADERS which was aired back around 1969 or 1970.  The saucer continued to hover directly over head for approximately 30 seconds and then shot off towards the west so fast that all I could see was a red trail leading to where it now hovered somewhere near HWY 5 which is also in burnsville, MN.  As we continued to watch the saucer dropped down below the tree line for about another 30 seconds and then lifted up to it&#39;s original altitude of about 100 to 120 feet. It then hovered for about 15 seconds in a stationary position after which it shined what appeared to be a red lazer beam aimed at an approximate 45 degree angle into space for about 2 to 3 seconds before taking off at the same extreme rate of speed previously witnessed. As it exited our atmosphere,it followed the same precise angle and direction as the red lazer that it had projected into space. About five minutes after the exit of this craft from our atmosphere, the other two friends who were with me said they saw what they described as a giant meteor or comet shooting directly in front of the moon. I did not see this other object but did make a note of the time. When I looked at my watch it was now 11:55pm. I cannot explain the missing time. Since this experience I have discovered many new technologies and have had many experiences which have opened my eyes to what actually happened that night. I cannot get into the details at this point and it would take volumes to tell it all. Also, the truth is now out there and it will soon be widely known to the rest of the world no matter what happens to me. I have given the description of this particular event simply because it is past time to bring this subject into the light of truth. Also, there is now to much that is becomming common knowledge for my past to continue to be a threat to the extent that it has for the last thirty years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My friends, when hearing my story, were somewhat incredulous but knowing that my brother and I are of very serious character, they find it very hard to believe that we are making up a story.  Needless to say, my parents believe us wholeheartedly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A summer evening, either 1974 or 1975, a friend called me to pick her up from the mall since her brother had neglected to do so.  My mother asked my younger brother (either 9 or 10 years old at the time) to accompany me.  As I drove on Ford Avenue (Woodbridge, NJ), over the NJ Turnpike bridge, my brother motioned to the sky and asked me to look at what he had spotted.  I was in awe when I saw a very large disk surrounded by a series of round white lights all along its perimeter.  It was quietly hovering -- not a sound was heard from the sky.  It looked like there was also a dim blue light emanating from it -- as if it were at the tip of an antenna -- this light was very hard to see so I can&#39;t attest that it was anywhere associated with an antenna, or exactly where it might have been located.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object hovered, it amazingly began rotating vertically on its axis, then it became horizontal once again and dashed away behind a set of trees directly in front of our line of vision -- that&#39;s when my brother and I lost visual contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry that I did not look at the object more intently -- I was driving, and when I slowed down to take a good look at it, the drivers behind me began feeverishly beeping their horns.  I may have missed seeing the object altogether if my brother hadn&#39;t spotted it.  I surmise the other drivers did not see it -- they wouldn&#39;t be in such a rush to drive along if they had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll never forget the sense of wonder and fright (I was trembling slightly) at witnessing such an object.  My brother and I had not ever been interested in UFOs nor did any reading on the subject -- we were not in the least bit biased and prone to interpreting unusual sights to be UFOs -- needless to say the sighting spurred our interest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got back from the mall (without my friend who finally had gotten picked up by her brother), my brother and I related the story to 2 little girls in the neighborhood -- they had seen exactly the same thing!!  Thank you for the opportunity to finally share our story after so many, many years.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We still remeber it as if it was yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Adam Dolge, of the Exeter News-Letter, for writing the article, which appears here.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO sighting in Exeter - again  By Adam Dolge adolge@seacoastonline.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> EXETER - There was something odd in the sky last week, something that caused a Navy veteran with 10,000 hours of flight experience to have his own close encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The former flight engineer, who wished to be identified only as &#34;David,&#34; said of the experience, &#34;this was like nothing I’ve ever seen before.&#34;  What the retired Navy chief petty officer said he saw last Wednesday could only be classified as a UFO, an unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright and sunny afternoon, about 3:15 p.m., and David was outside preparing his lawnmower. He had filled the mower with gas, checked the oil, and took a sip from a glass of water he had poured. When he tilted his head back to get the final sip, through the bottom of the glass he saw a large cigar-shaped object hovering in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> David said windows were equally spaced around the object, however he didn’t see anyone or anything inside. The size of the object was enormous. By comparison, he said, consider what an ultralight plane would look like next to a Boeing 747. He said it was about the size of two USS Nimitz aircraft carriers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance, through his empty glass of water he thought it could have been the Hood blimp. &#34;But, the instant I put my glass down, I said, ‘that’s not a blimp.’&#34;  The object moved from west to east, very slowly for something that size, he said. His initial instinct was that the object was moving at about 100 knots, but something that big shouldn’t be able to stay in the air if it’s going that slow, he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object began changing colors from a bright silver to an orange-ish red. A strange cloud of red and orange flames began surrounding the object, and before he knew it the object stretched out like a rubber band. It grew to about twice its original size, and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire incident lasted about 10 minutes, he recalled Monday morning, but he is unaware of the specific time because, &#34;it felt like time stopped.&#34;  He went into his house and first thought to call the police. He decided not to because he didn’t think they’d take him seriously. So he went on the Internet and searched for &#34;report UFO,&#34; and found the Web site for the Seattle-based National UFO Reporting Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport, director of the UFO reporting center, said David’s report was astonishing because of his history with flight. &#34;I have no question on his reliability.&#34;  He said he gets several accounts each year, but this one stood out. The report was well written and scientific, Davenport said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;In my view, that’s one of the cardinal rules of an account,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The center was founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert Gribble. The center’s Web site, www.nuforc.org, has a large list of UFO sightings. According to the site, the center’s primary function is to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have witnessed possible UFOs. David’s report, which will soon be on the Web site, will be among dozens of documented sightings to be formally reported to the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not the first time  The Exeter area is no stranger to UFO sightings. In 1965, two Exeter police officers and hitchhiker Norman Muscarello, who was with them, gained national attention after seeing a UFO hovering over Route 101 in Kensington. The sighting was documented in a book called &#34;The Incident at Exeter.&#34;  And then there was the incident involving Barney and Betty Hill, a husband and wife from Portsmouth who claimed to have been abducted by aliens. The couple was driving from a vacation in Canada in 1961 when they saw a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved directly over their car, and before they knew it they grew drowsy. They later claimed to have been abducted by aliens and gave identical accounts while they were hypnotized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But for this recent sighting, David said he believes that there is life beyond Earth. He said the galaxy is so enormous, it’s hard to believe humans are the only intelligent life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;To the point of not being obnoxious, it’d be egocentric to think there is no other life out there.&#34;  Print this Story      Email this Article  Back to the Exeter News-Letter  Exeter News-Letter Home Delivery Best Offer    Seacoast Online is owned and operated by Seacoast Media Group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Copyright © 2005 Seacoast Online.

Our home was located several miles outside of Scottsville, Kentucky in a location named Petroleum near the Tennessee border.  We lived on a hilltop,  and could always clearly see anything up in the sky.  I remember the following unusual incident clearly.  One particular night we were all in our living room watching television, and it was around 11:00 PM.  My Dad decided to go out into the back yard to check on our well pump that we were having problems with.  The night was dark and clear, and no stars were visable at all.  Dad went out the back door and all was quiet for a while.  All of a sudden Dad came practically running back into the living room and told us to come outside and see &#34;this&#34;.  He said, &#34;Get out here because you have got to see this&#34;.  My Dad was a U.S. Army veteran, and I thought nothing could scare him - but &#34;this&#34; did.  We could see the scared look on his face, and we wondered what &#34;this&#34; was.  We all hurriedly went out the back door to the yard.  Dad then told us to look up in the sky, and what we saw was truly amazing to say the least.  Directly up in the northern sky was a very large glowing white cross.  Trust me, there was absolutely no mistake about it - it WAS a CROSS, and it was glowing really bright with sort of a halo around it.  The cross was clearly visable.  The whole thing was solid white.  The object remained stationary and never moved at all.  As I recall our neighbors heard us and came outside to see it for themselves.  We were all just staring at this large white cross that we all could clearly see.  We stayed outside for thirty minutes or longer just staring at this beautiful white cross.  Later on we heard on our local regional news about many other people who had also seen this enigmatic cross object.  It was reported as an &#34;unidentified sky object&#34;.  Why didn&#39;t they say it was a c! ross?  W ere they afraid of something?  I always wondered.  My family and I are honest people and don&#39;t make up tales.  This story is one-hundred percent true as I have told it.  I know that we all saw something amazing that we were intended to see in my opinion.  Somehow I felt blessed to have seen this.  People may think that I am crazy or made this story up, but I did neither one.  What we saw that night back in 1976 was something somehow beyond our comprehension to understand.  As I have gotten older I now realize that their are things that are really seen or observed everywhere that people cannot understand - such as UFOs.  This is one such case, and if it was a UFO then it was quite real.  I just felt that now was the right time to share my unusual story with others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you, and keep up the good and important work. ---- ((initials deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The window was on the north s|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04144.html|18|ndxe197407| It was about 1AM-2AM in the morning, while watching TV, a bright object though our window caught my eye.  The window was on the north side of the house.  It was decending at approximately 45 degrees angle east to west, it was huge and around the circumference was seeming low flames with a fiery trail.  It reminded me of the huge special effects of the meteor that carried the space craft in the original &#34;War  of the Worlds&#34; movie.  It was eerie looking,  I was so excited I shouted for my wife to come a see.  By the time she awoke and got to the window it passed from sight.  I called the Ft. Lauderdale International Airport Control Tower and asked if they saw the object.  The person that answered said &#34;No&#34;.  I the called Channel 7 news room and a guy answered, I told him what I saw, he replied that he had not heard of anything.  I asked him if he did would he call me back and I gave him my telephone number.  I thought he was just humoring me when he said he would, but when the phone rang about 15 minutes later it was this fellow at the TV station telling me that the report was coming over the AP wire and that the object had been spotted as far north as Gainsville. He asked me to descibe what I saw again, I did, he thanked me and we hung up.  I could hardly sleep and stayed up most of the night.  The next day I was impatiently waiting for the news reports to come out about the sighting, but I personally never heard anything about it. Someone said something about a falling satelite or some other nonsense. That vision will never leave me.  This evening I discovered your Reporting center and curiosity drove me to find the report which had to be one in the sighting.  I was stunned to finally see a report by someone else that seemingly corroborates what I saw.  That report was posted 6/2/98 and the location was Hamton, Virginia Beach Amusment Park, VA. The report by a photgrapher. I&#39;ve waited 28 years to tell this, boy it feels good! Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Round meteor with flame and trail,  decending as if it were a controlled decent.  The color was Orange/red and bright.  It did not move like a falling star or a burning up satellite or a meteor burning up in our atmosphere.  It was too huge and too controlled.<n>

This was when you can still see the stars in the S.W. burbs of Chicago. I can&#39;t remember the exact date or year. I was 6, 7, or 8 years old. It was hot out so it was in the summer and it was pretty dark out by 21:00 hrs. We were all facing N. and looking straight up. Out of the corner of my eye I seen a flash or streak of light come in from my left. Immediately I thought it was a meteor because of the speed and distance it was in the sky. Then the really amazing part was when it changed directions twice without slowing down and zipped away just as fast as it arrived. My Father didn&#39;t see it and my Brother said He did but I don&#39;t remember exactly what He said at the time. There was no dout that thing was not from this planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The details again: Streak of light from S.W. to N.E. Very high altitude,upper atmosphere at least. Zig Zag pattern at the tail end of streak. destinct triangular shape at each point it changed direction (reminded me of the little ship in the video game &#34;Asteroids&#34; by Atari.) The speed of the thing was what you would expect a meteor to be travaling at. The size was about the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length. With the altitude it was at it must have been very large if it were at ground level. It was just an outline of a triangle really, I don&#39;t know if it had its own light source or it was glowing due to the speed and the atmosphere itself, but all three sides were very distinct as it changed directions both times. First and only sighting so far but it was the real thing so i&#39;m very satisfied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

For some reason I looked out the window on the driver&#39;s side and saw a large rounded disk hovering in the sky at an altitude of about 500 feet.  It must have had a diameter of at least 50 feet. It had flashing, sychronized &#34;chasing&#34; colored lights going around its diameter.  I couldn&#39;t tell the color of the &#34;craft&#34; as it was dark, but it appeared a dark silver. It just quietly hovered still in the sky and I thought at first it must be some novel attraction of the theme park, but I didn&#39;t understand how it could just hover with no propellers or wings.  A couple of times it moved very quickly sideways.  My husband didn&#39;t see it and the kids were asleep in the back.  It happened almost 30 years ago, but I will never forget it.  I expected to hear something on the news about it, but never did.  I wondered if I was the only one who saw it.  I am sorry I had no camera with me because no one believes it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

That&#39;s when my friend and I freaked out.  Being 18 and dumb still didn&#39;t explain the speed of travel and then stopping and then turning 45 degrees and going out of site. The 0ther similar story I read from gentlemen was from chicago which is north of us here in Ottawa.  Best way to explain is a meteor that stopped.

They were in a strange uneven formation. Somewhat like a checkmark. They were slowly moving to the right then reversed and went back to the left. Then made a few more quick zig zags that weren&#39;t quite 180&#39;s. Then finally shot out of sight to my top right, all while staying in this uneven formation. At that young age I realized that movement wasn&#39;t natural. Around the year 1997 while watch a UFO show on TV, I saw a very similar formation if not the same, I believe it was footage from Mexico.

I was about 12 years old riding a minibike on a gravel road when an object caught my eye moving in the sky. This is a rural area, so there are not too many aircraft to be seen. The object I saw was a tapered curved cylindrical object with a sphere on the narrow end. The object appeared to be metallic. I immediately stopped the minike and shut off the engine to observe the craft move to the west in a slow but steady manner and without making a sound. The distance and size of the object were hard to determine, but I&#39;d guess it was at 3 to 5 thousand feet and approximately 50 feet long. I immediately rushed home approx a quarter mile and tried to locate the object with a telescope but it already disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

As there are many beaches up North and it was not a holiday season, we were the only ones on the beach that day.  We laid out our towels to sunbath for awhile and when I laid down, I looked up to the sky to the left and I saw what I thought was a plane with the sun reflecting off it and paid no attention.  Approximately 10mins later I looked up again and it was still there and being a little bit surprised, I told my then partner and we both watched it and it did not move!  I started to get nervous and said to him that I was scared and that we should go, but my partner said not to be silly and that it was too far away and it couldn’t harm us.  I then said well it can’t be of this world and perhaps they were watching us and I wanted to leave, but he said for us just to watch it and see what happens, so we did even though I was scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watch this ship that I originally thought was a plane for approx. one hour and then it just shot off to the right and into the distance at incredible speed and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say that it was cigar shape, only because it was a fair distance away and at first I thought it was a plane, all I can say for sure is that it was long and silver and stayed in the one spot for a least an hour that we were there, so it could have been there for some time before we arrived and when it disappeared, it shot off at incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought after all these years that I should tell someone, because at the time we didn’t know who to report it to and thought that we would be ridiculed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was in the 7th grade at the time and delivering the morning paper, walking south/southwest. A streak of color in the sky caught my attention. I looked up and saw what appeared to be a multi colored fireball that had a long tail, moving at a high rate of speed, in a northwest to southeast direction.It didnt seem to be too high in the sky. I watched it for a few seconds before a house blocked my view. I quickly moved to the side of the house so I can continue wathing it, thinking if it were a meteor i would see it crash. But when I did it was gone. The fireball was the size of a quarter held at arms length, and there were no sounds heard at the time.<n>

My job was to be the ships eye&#39;s ( very boring really )I had just pored myself a cup of coffee and lite a cigarette and picked up a pair of binoculars as I headed out on to the deck of the bridge, I walked to the edge of the bridge and looked over the 4&#39; steel railing down towards the flight deck all was quiet, no movement. then I thought to myself boy I can see all the way down to the bow of the ship ! sure is bright out tonight, I turned and looked up to see a 3/4 moon...nice nite! I leaned against the railing and set my coffee down and begain to scan the horizion from port to starboard, ( no waves, just flat smooth water as far as the eye can see) At that elevation of almost 180&#39; off the water viewing distance is about 20 miles on a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I look from starboard back to port along the horizion line, out I would have to guess at about 8 miles was what looked like the reflection of the moon on the water but it looked kinda funny, so i pick up the binoculars and focused in on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> what I saw was what appeared to be a bright light but under the water! I then walked over to the ships squak box(inter ship radio)hit the switch, leaned in and said ..Con sigs ! a second later a voice cracked back Con I, I said Con I have a contact baring 210 off the port beam, can you confirm ? The voice said stand by sigs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> sigs..Con ! I said Sigs I Sigs we have negative sonar contact ..do you have visual? my reply was afirmitive Con I have visual! The reply was stand-by Sigs ! I turned picked up my coffee and heard footsteps behind me from the ladder leading up from the bridge. Within 10 minutes, I had the captian,the XO, the flight boss and what had to be 8 or 10 officers from IOIC ( ships Intel.) All on my bridge. For the next 20 minutes we all watched as this thing moved back and forth across the bow of the ship at what had to be from 60 up to over 100 miles an hour cutting a zig zag pattern back and forth in front of the ship all this under water! at one point it stopped directly in our path and allowed us to come within about 4 miles of it. Suddenly it pulled away like we were parked and disapeared into the depths. Standing in the background behind all these officers I kinda felt out of place, so I retreated to the signal shack sat down at the desk and begain to fill out my log on the preseding events. Just as I was finishing up my report,a Lt.stepped into the doorway of the compartment and said the XO would like to see you.. and bring your log ! As I followed him down the ladder I was thinking I&#39;m in trouble for something! He opened the door to the captains quarters and in the room were no less then 6 officers. The look on there faces was not good. The first to speak was a comander I did not recognize. his words seemed funny to me in the context of what had just happened. He said ...What do you think you saw this evening ? my responce was..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no Idea sir ! He said.. Well these events are currently under investigation by the navy and you are hear-by ordered not to speak of these events to anyone, not to your section chief, your division leaders not even to your buddies.. do you understand ? I said what events sir ?.... He looked at me with a very serious look and said ..very well you may leave your log on the desk on the way out, your dismissed I said.. yes sir! turned and stepped out into the hallway as the door closed behind me. I took two or three steps stopped and put my back to the wall and just slid to the deck. A Lt. stepped out of the room and I jumped to attention and stood there in front of him, he said all inquiries concerning your log are to be fowarded to the XO&#39;s office , Is that understood ! Yes Sir<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  We have spoken with the witness, and he seems to us to be quite credible.

The two youngest (born 1972 and 1973) were still in cribs and sharing the same room on the second floor of our old farmhouse, only a few miles outside the town of Marion.  This is big farm country, and our house was surrounded by very large fields of wheat.  Late one evening during the week (my husband worked 2nd shift and was not home yet), I tiptoed into the darkened room to check on them as they slept.  The curtains were open, and my eye was caught by light or movement through the window.  I knelt by the window ledge and watched colored spheres of light (predominately red, some blue, some yellow) swoop and circle over the field.  It was summer, and the windows were open because we did not have air conditioning. I tried to tell myself it was fireworks as it was somewhere around July 4th, but there was no sound and the lights did not resemble any fireworks I have ever seen.  Gradually, the lights disappeared, though none of them shot away rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had one other experience, though I no longer recall if it was the same year.  We were travelling near our home in our van and were passing over an overpass across State Route 23 when a bright blue light suddenly flashed on the passenger side of the vehicle.  We thought at the time that it could have come from a helicopter or plane, though we did not see or hear anything in the sky.  Years later, when I mentioned this to my family, I was startled to learn they had no memory of it, but I am sure it was not a dream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

The harbor reflected the light of the city&#39;s buildings and visibility was very clear. We were close to, but past, Logan airport.  I happened to look up in the sky and was really surprised to see a large object I would estimate at approximately 60-80 feet in circumference with a band of large square light panels undulating around its perimeter. Their circulation was in a wave like motion. I watched it as I also scanned the water for any impediments in it. I tried to figure out what the object was. I determined it was unlikely to be advertising as there was no message. The colors in the squares were yellow, red, blue, green.  I wondered whether it was something being held aloft by a helicopter as the object was not fast moving (about 20 miles per hour)but their was no noise associated with the object. I commented to my guests, &#34;Look at that, I will bet that is in the paper tomorrow.&#34; They looked at the object without comment because they could not figure out what it was. I had recently soloed as a pilot. I had attended the 82nd Airborne Division Intelligence course. I spent 13 consecutive nights in combat watching the night sky in Korea. I had never seen anything the like of what I saw those many years later.

Then we saw a craft moving slowly, almost hovering, low, above the MO.river area, tipping on it&#39;s side and forward while still moving in the same path. We lost it behind the trees until it flew almost overhead at treetop level still about a block away. We were becoming very exited and agitated, and the animals were acting strangely. Dogs running down the middle of the street, crickets became silent, and a K-9 Police unit roared down our 30 m.p.h. street at over 100 m.p.h. towards police headquarters. We decided to go to Lewis and Clark Monument Park up in the hills north of town which took us through Lakeview Park north of Co. Bluffs,in order to get a better view of the area skies.My girlfriend was driving as I was watching the skies. As we were driving through the park I spotted the craft coming towards us very low and slow. We became very scared as it seemed to see us and know that we were seeing it. It caught up with us as we approached the tennis court parking area and I told my girlfriend of this. For some reason she pulled the car over and stopped. When she saw it we both got out and ran barefoot about 50 yards to a train tressle which we momentarily hid under. I don&#39;t know what possessed us to come out from underneath it to look, but we did. There it was, hovering over the large cottonwood tree that is still there today. It was shaped like a hockey puck and about 100 ft. in diameter. Its edges were covered with large rectangular lights flashing in a clockwise direction as viewed from the ground. They were taller than wide and as a light would flash then dim the next light would flash and then dim, etc.,yet by the time it would dim the lights would go full circle around the craft. It was almost as if the light was streaking around the machine, yet you could see the delineations between the lights. We were frozen with awe and fear when the craft dipped and one of its red lights went out and it shined some sort of beam at us. I just recall that I think our hair was standing on end. The next thing either of us can recall was that it was daylight and we werein the car driving towards Lewis and Clark Monument, our original destination. I make no claims of abduction or anything extraordinary, other than we were obviously missing time and my girlfriend who had never taken birth control in 4 years became pregnant the next time we were together and went on to have 4 children altogether.<n>

In the summer of 1974 around July 4th, I went with a college friend to visit his parents in Lexington , Mississippi. One of his cousins and her friend from the L.A. area of California had also come in for the visit. They were returning to California on a late night flight out of the Jackson airport, so my friend and I drove them to the Jackson airport. After we dropped them off at the terminal, we headed back to Lexington. There was a road that ran adjacent to the Jackson airport that lead to the highway back to Lexington, and we were driving on this road. Far ahead, just above treetop level, there were three very bright lights that were positioned like landing lights on a commercial jet. The two outer lights were like the ones on a jet&#39;s wings, and the center at a slighty higher position, like the nose landing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We friend and I both observed the lights because of their brightness. I said they must be landing lights. We continued driving down this road and became even more curious because the lights hadn&#39;t moved at all. That ruled out their being on a jet so my friend said they must be on the sides and top of a large water tower. We came to a stop sign and needed to turn left. The lights were directly in front of us, maybe 50-100 feet above the treetops, in this heavily wooded area. There were no street lights or buildings around and it was very quiet. We had the windows rolled down in the car and the radio was not turned on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there looking at the lights wondering what they could be. They were so bright that you couldn&#39;t see what was behind them or what they were connected to, much like when you approach a parked car in a dark area and it has its headlights on. You can&#39;t see the car at all, only the bright headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend was driving and went ahead to make the left turn. The road we were turning onto was a four lane, divided road with a dirt and grass median between the lanes. He pulled across the two lanes that were headed in the opposite direction, across the median area, and then turned left onto the shoulder of the lanes we needed to use. He then stopped the car with the foot brake and sat there withthe engine idling. Now the lights were on my left, as passenger in the car. I stared out the window at them and started to become a little frightened because this was unlike anything I&#39;d ever seen. After a short time, my friend took his foot off the brake and started idling slowly down the shoulder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we had rolled only 5-10 feet, the lights suddenly rotated towards us to stay pointed directly at the side of the car, but slightly behind the car. After the rotation, they started moving beside the car, at the same speed we were going, and maintaining the position slighly behind. As soon as the rotation occurred and the lights were moving along with the car, I went into a heart pounding panic. I was so afraid of what might happen next, because the object behind the lights was big -- maybe 80 feet from the left most light to the right most. And the silence, precision and complete lack of vibration in its movement was unlike anything I had ever seen. I urged my friend to step on the gas and get the hell away, but he hesitated as he craned his neck to look out of the passenger side window. After what seemed like an eternity, he pulled onto the main part of the road and accelerated. As soon as he accelerated, the lights stopped moving, but they slowly rotated to always point directly at the car. I had my head out the passenger window so I could watch it carefully because I was so terrified it would follow us. After we had gone about 500 feet down the road, the lights started moving across the road, always staying rotated to aim at us. The movement was slow, precise and vibration free. When they reached the stand of trees on the opposite side of the road from where we had begun our acceleration, they went down smoothly and disappeared into the trees. At this point, of course, I got a little courage back and urged my friend to turn around and go back to see if we could see anything. He agreed, but we had to drive further until we got to a crossover the median. We then turned and headed back. I watched the area like a hawk during the entire time, but never saw anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got back to the median crossover that we had used originally after the stop sign, we stopped on the shoulder before turing around. I peered into the trees but saw nothing. So we turned around at the crossover and headed back toward Lexington. I watched out the back of the car until we got back to Lexington but saw nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my frind nor myself had anything to drink and didn&#39;t use any drugs. We were completely clear headed and lucid when all this occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We realized we were on the wrong street and turned around in a parking lot of a apt. complex. The driveway we were pulling out of was directly across the street from a place called Ralphs funeral home. We were looking west. As we started to pull out we looked directly in front of us and above the funeral home was an oval shaped craft. it was hovering about 5 feet, over the funeral home.I seem to remember it making a very soft humming noise. It had very small colored lights under it. It was moving extremely slowly. I remember thinking if I got out of the car I could walk under it at the same speed it was moving. It was about one and a half times the size of the building aproximately 70 or 80 feet in length.I was absolutely not a hot air ballon or blimp. I asked her if she saw it. She said yes. We sat for about a minute and then she got panacky and speed away. We went back I got my mom and I made her take me back. There of course was not trace of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But within the same month my father spotted something in the sky outside of our front door while entering the house. He actually called everyone out to see. It was a small light like a star in the distance I cannot say exactly how high but it was at about a 40 degree angle from the ground. It was moving very slowly up. not straight up but again at about a 40 to 45 degree angle. It then shot out a tail of light like a rocket would, it did this about 3 times, and disappeared. we were looking at it facing west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It seem to move quite slowly and we both stood in silence as we watched it, then all of a sudden it just stopped and it shot this beam of light straight up into the sky as though it was searching for something above it, the light moved back and forth straight above it.  At this point we began to scream at the same time as we tore down the stairs at the same time running into our parents bedroom sreaming for our father, we ran to our parent side of their bed as they were reading.  Our hands shaking  and not sure if we should cry or scream more, we all, the whole family ran outdoors to see but it was gone.

This is not a hoax, yet may be easily explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event took place in Western Kentucky some time in approximately 1974.  My friends and I were walking to a camping sight at night.  We were in a large open field, approx 30 acres.  We had a good view of a clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One friend says: &#34;look at that!&#34;  In the sky was an orange light that looked like an ember from a fire.  Its movement also resembled an ember rising up off of a fire.  We looked around 360 degrees and saw no fire anywhere.  We watched this ‘ember’ fly across the sky, rising and falling and looping around until it had flown out of sight behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observations:  It looked and moved like a glowing ember off of a fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not close to the ground and appeared to be extremely high in the sky, or even in space.  We really couldn’t tell for sure what its altitude was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its color and brightness didn’t appear to change, though it did have tiny sparks flying off it, as if  wind was blowing on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though we live in the quite countryside, we could hear no sound coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was driving westbound on Mishawaka Ave, crossing the St. Joseph River.  To my north, I noticed a craft, flying low, traveling to the northwest.  I turned my car north onto the first road west of the bridge, turned off the car, and rolled down the windows...I wathched this circular craft drift over the river, just above the trees.  It had yellow and white lights blinking around the outer circumference, there were NO sounds from the craft.  I watched it until it went out of sight.  When I completed my delivery, I went back to the shop and told everyone!!  They wanted to know if I saw any Purple People!!  Today, I live in Miami, Florida.  I am the Natural Areas Manager for the county and have a BS degree in Biology.  I&#39;m not a kook, this really happened.  My family knows, I just thought it should be recorded by you guys for posterity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Truely, ((name and address deleted))<n>

It was the size of a big watermelon and shiny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were still looking at it when from zero forward speed, took off with no sound and in a blink of an eye went eastward leaving a long comtrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard a loud exclamation and there was a soccer game and almost 100 people watching the game and they saw the craft very close to them and they saw it move to the location where we first saw it.  They told us that it was flying in between the soccer field and the mountains at about 500 feet off the ground!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been flying since 1973 and never seen anything like it!<n>

In the sky she should me a strange light shining through the clouds that looked like a reflector telescope, with a dark rounded off square with a dark line going toward one edge. The light was stationary as long as I was looking. I watched it as best as I could on my way to school on the buss. This happened in the summer at the begining of the school year, either in 1974 or in 1975. I think Skylab was orbiting back then.<n>
