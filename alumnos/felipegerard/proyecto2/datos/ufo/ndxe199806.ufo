I had two long windows that reached almost from ceiling to floor and I was enjoying the Los Angeles downtown lights. My apartment was on the seventh floor  I became aware of a lighted object that did not seem to be moving.  It may have been disc shaped, but I could only see lights.  At first I thought it was coming directly toward or going directly away from me, but it did not change size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the eerie feeling that it was aware of my watching it which caused me to feel apprehensive.  Then after about 20 minutes it started moving very fast to my right (south) and up.  I watched it disappear in about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/30/98 21:30|Brooklyn|MI|Oval|15 minutes|Round probe which appeared to be emiting sparks.|9/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113439.html|2|ndxe199806| Round probe which appeared to be emiting sparks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday (September 9, 2014) I was watching a bunch of UFO shows on direct TV and they mentioned your organization.  Up to this point I did not know there was a place to report UFO sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I lived in Manitou Beach, Michigan between June 1998 and July 2002.  I believe it was the fall of 1998 when I had an experience with an unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove from my house on Devils Lake Hwy to Brooklyn, Michigan, in the evening to pick up some Chinese food for supper.  Returning home, I drove south out of Brooklyn and drove down Brooklyn Rd., which runs next to MIS (Michigan International Speedway).  When I arrived at the corner of Brooklyn Road and US12 I saw an object in the night sky which appeared to be approximately above Round Lake Highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled off the road at the corner and sat in my car watching the object.  The object appeared to be the size of a basketball, it changed colors from yellow, to orange, to blue on the perimeter and appeared to be emitting sparks.  The object moved extremely slow and ran parallel to US 12, moving from the west to the east, and the object was approximately 100 feet above the tree line.  I watched this object for approximately 15 minutes and it maintained the same height, never changing its altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I served in the United States Navy and US Army National Guard.  The object had characteristics of a flare with some notable differences.  Flares do not maintain their altitude and fall to the ground diagonally unless there is a strong wind - and there was no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought about a meteor but the item moved much to slow.  I tried to put a rational explanation as to what I was seeing in the night sky but came up empty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I had worked for the Michigan Department of Corrections in Parole/Probation for over 10 years, and believe I’m a confident observer.  I watched the item from the time it was over Round Lake Highway until it had moved on its easterly course until it had probable passed over M50, at which time I decided to head for home, but the object continued on an easterly course at the same height and continued to follow US 12.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The though crossed my mind that I was witnessing an Unidentified Flying Object, which alarmed me to some degree, but I thought the item was small to be a flying saucer and, unless they have a shrink ray, there would be no way for the object to abduct me or beam me aboard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought the object might be a probe, but the only significant land mark in the area is Michigan International Speedway.  I should also note there are no military installations in the area and there was no events taking place at Michigan International Speedway, so there was no reasons for a flare to be in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m extremely confident that what I saw was not a flare of any type and that’s why I’m writing to you to report an unidentified flying object.  If we had cell phones with cameras back then, I would have loved to have taken a photograph of the object because it was really interesting.  This is the first time I’ve told anyone of the incident with the exception of my wife and kids.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout the shows that I watched I did not see any reports of UFO’s matching the description of the item that I saw but found the vast array and variety of spacecraft reported which makes me wonder if we’re not being visited by various entities, and then that brings up the logical question - why?  DNA samples, intelligence gathering, mapping, scientific studies by entities visiting our planet lead me to the question of intention.  While I was in the National Guard I served as an intelligence analyst for awhile and it was my job to evaluate potential threats and create counter measures.  Time after time I have seen on the shows about UFO’s visiting earth where the spacecraft have been around military installations and other vital infrastructure around the world.  Often we hear a comparison between technological differences and how earthlings are new to the cosmic scope and how entities visiting earth are so much more advanced - but then there are reports of so many cra! shed space ships.  Even in our infancy we have gps, collision alarms for aircraft (and cars now), and a host of other technological devices - so it seems rational to believe any advanced entity would also have these items so I’m not sure why there would be so many crashed spaceships.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In closing:  I believe in what I see with my own eyes.  I cannot put a rational explanation to what I saw (which does not mean there is not a rational explanation).  Even if I had not experienced an unidentified flying object I believe there is life beyond earth just as a matter of chance - as a gambler you play the odds and if you look into the heavens you would have to be ignorant to believe we are alone.  I think it is shameful UFO sighting are not taken seriously by governments around the world because as an intelligence analyst you need data in order to reach conclusions and to come up with logical responses.  I graduated from Western Michigan University with a double major - Criminal Justice/Sociology, which means I like to collect evidence, look at it and draw my own conclusions.  I also like to study people and societies and cannot help but wonder why some societies seem to have more experiences with other entities then others and wonder what significance this ph! enomenon has in the larger picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thank you for your time and attention.<n>

On closer examination, the object was either revolving with a single light or there was a row of lights flashing in sequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving north on rt 5 in Waldorf, on the left, I noticed out of the coner of my eye a single light that caught my attention.  I started to slow down and noticed that there appeared to be more lights that were flashing in sequence from right to left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked closer at it and could only see half of what to appeared to be round. I saw also a faint u-shaped bottom to a solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I looked more closly at the object the lights sped up the sequence in which they had started with.  The lights had sped up so much that it became one continuous blur of lights, all lights were bright white.  The number of lights I saw was 6.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After what seemed to be a lifetime, but was only about a minute, this object was gone.  No sign of anything ever being there, nothing.  I didn&#39;t hear anything nor did I see anything that might have been there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At arm&#39;s length the object was about 2 inches and about at angle of 11 o&#39;clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a white female,age 22, 2 years college, and am working in retail right now.<n>

It came out of the eastern sky, flying about as low as an airplane, but it didn&#39;t have wings.  It did not have a tail, and it was very fat. I ran in to get the video camera, and began taking footage.  It looked somewhat smaller, and went behind a cloud, then shot straight up.  Some of the video footage shows it kind of flatening out and disappearing, then coming back to the cigar shape. I am 43 years old.  My daughter is 8.  We are homeschooling Christians who value truth and honesty.<n>

It was black and moving at around 80-90mph. I observed no lights or sound. It was decending at a slow rate. wind was from south west, but object moved more in west east to NNE in movement. Was not civilian aircraft. Connected Black balls 3 with rods or antennae projecting. Similar to sighting in 97 from Ringold Ga. Rome Ga is due south and west of Ringold.

I needed to run an errand so, as I was leaving, I stopped to ask the roofer if he needed anything before I left. It was early afternoon during the summer.  There were no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood in the driveway looking up at the roofing contractor, I saw a featureless metallic silver cylinder with rounded ends glide by overhead.  There were no wings, windows, lights or visible seams. There was no trail or exhaust.  It moved in a straight path at a constant rate of speed and was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The roofing contractor was on the roof looking down at me so did not see it.  To this day I don’t know why I didn’t point and ask, &#34;What the heck is that?&#34; to the roofing contractor, but for some reason I just watched it glide by overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

6/30/98 10:00|Commerce Township|MI|Changing|Six hours|Followed by men in black cars and suits.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51333.html|7|ndxe199806| Followed by men in black cars and suits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this day in 1998 I awoke with racing thoughts, mostly concerning the condition of earth and Man&#39;s need for change, as these thoughts continued i became very aggitated and filled with nervous energy. To counter-act this energy i felt compelled even urged to go for a walk. I feel it is important to mention that i am well educated family person and,untill this day, had always been of very sound mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I made my way through my rural suburban nieghborhood, these thoughts moved on to how a man might need to find a means for living outside the human body, cryogenics, etc.. Then as if suddenly I had an image of a large park that was five miles from my home and got an overwhelming urge/belief that if I were to go there I would be visited by extra terrestrial beings. By this time I was so worked-up, I felt that i would definately need to walk there, just to have good nerves and a level head. So I began the long walk, this is when things took a full 360.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not even a block from my neighborhood I began to feel as though I were being followed, I looked over my shoulder to notice a black suv about 200ft behind me moving slowly. I immediately felt an overwhelming to evade this vehicle, so I then ran through the yards of the houses nearest to me to get to the next street over, and there i found another black suv. This time I made sure to look at the occupants and they were two men dressed in black siuts both wearing sunglasses.  At this point I have become so nervous that I decide to change course to a different park where I knew I would find some familliar faces, taking only routs through woods and yards so as to avoid being followed by the vehicles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I arrived at the park I began to describe the vehicles and the men to my friends; and as the last words came out, yet another suv fitting the description pulled into the park. My four or five friends then believed what I had told them, and one friend and I decided to go to a nearby payphone to call another friend to make sense of the situation. Now we took the direct rout through the trees knowing that the suv in the park could&#39;nt follow us there qiuckly. As we emerged from the trees we began to run across the road to the phone, when seemingly out of nowhere, another black tinted suv with two men in suits had to come to a screaching and swerving stop to avoid hitting us. We both had believed the road to be clear and were startled. So we began waving our arms and yelling at the driver of the truck, who was now only a few feet from us, yet he and the passenger coldy looked forward and drove away as if we were&#39;nt even there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> for the next few hours my friend and I went from street to street attempting to evade the black suvs and sedans, who were everywhere we went. My friend eventualy decided I was in some kind of trouble and left me to deal with it on my own, even though I was clearly very distressed. I stayed in the woods for a while fighting the urge I had to make my way to the park I had orriginally set out for, for fear of these men in black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, around 1700, I decided to attempt the journey again. At this poit I was very exhausted, so much so, that passing car&#39;s exhaust seemed to be stealing my breath. There were no more black vehicles, yet I was now fighting the exhaustion. As I made my way up a paarticularly steep hill, I smelled the fresh air that sprinklers give off in a small subdivision I was passing and decided to head toward the good air instead of the park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was found by a family friend about 1830 completely confused and exhausted, who returned me home. I needed more than a week of bedrest and relaxation to even begin to feel normal again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is my belief that these men in black coerced me mentally so as to make sure I did not get to that park that day. This is the second day of my life that i have spoken of this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There in the eastren sky over Canada, their was three lights which apeared to be toghter, that formed a trangle. within only a few seconds its lights decreased in intensity and faded into the intensity of a normal star.  Then faded completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it came back never geting as bright as the frist time I seen it, but was brighter than any star in the sky. It contined to do this over and over until it tolaly faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Flaw in date.  There is no June 31st.  We have amended the date above.

As I drove up the street towards my driveway I noticed  2 &#34;lights&#34; about halfway up the east-southeast sky (they were located near the brightest early morning star), they were about twice the size of an average star (each light) and were very close together.  They were stationary for a few seconds, then dropped down maybe 10 degrees and then straight up and disappeared into the sky.  This all happened in a time span of less than 5 seconds.  I pulled into my driveway and jumped out but could not see any indications of where the lights went.  These lights moved very quickly and smoothly.<n>

Mentioned on local news as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching Larry King this evening I decided to reflect on a UFO sighting that I had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While traveling on a major road in Port Saint Lucie I and other people in the vicinity spotted un identified flying objects above a line of trees on the eastern side of the road. The other cars slowed down as did I. The incident was actually reported briefly on the 11:00 PM local news that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would need to look for the exact date but it was in the 1997-1999 range. It was a Saturday. I can find the exact date because my husband had a golf tournament that day. We have some dated souvenirs from the event. At the BBQ after the tournament I shared what I had seen with some close friends. Later that evening the news cast mentioned it. They had had some calls and therefore asked various military and weather experts about activity in the area. No valid earthling events had been occurring that match what people had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The road is adjacent to Port Saint Lucie Blvd. It runs into the turn pike entrance. It is a north /south roadway connecting Port Saint Lucie Blvd to another major roadway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling with my four children. My children saw the objects also but were rather young at the time and more interested in their play toys than what Mom was seeing or saying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were disc like in shape. They hovered above the tree line. As fast as I saw them, was as fast as they left. To the best of my recollection there were two to three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As other people that have seen UFOs can probably attest to, by the time I processed what I was seeing they were gone. The string of cars on the road all slowed down to get a closer look at what we were witnessing. On hind sight, I wish we had all pulled over to share what we had just witnessed and exchanged contacts. But as I said, when it actually is happening the feeling of shock and disbelief is rather overwhelming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I know is what I saw and that I will not forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a professional of sound mind and body. I was not under the influence of anything and have no reason to make this up. Actually with the stigma attached to those that claim to see UFOs, it isn’t something that I’d invent for attention. In my profession, making “crazy” claims can lead to career fall outs. I am happy to see that so many creditable people have seen object that can’t be identified and are coming forward to share their sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In closing, do you think the ants know we are here? As they build their intricate ant hills and communicate with each other, they most likely have no idea we are functioning as a society. We know the ants are here but really take no special interest in them on a daily basis. Some ants may encounter human beings but have no real idea how to incorporate that into their “ant universe”. For me, the same concept can be applied to UFOs and human beings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for providing this valuable web site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I&#39;m not sure of the exact date...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was coming up over a hill and noticed a &#34;orange-colored&#34; object that was moving accross the horizon west to east.  As I approached the object, it moved closer and closer to the road.  At first, I disregarded the object as a helicopter, but when I got close enought to see it, I realized that it was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be two 3-Demensional Diamonds that were attached side by side.  The object was small, no bigger than a refrigerator, and it glowed a strange orange-copper like color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object stopped about 100-200 feet from the road and it floated about 50 feet in the air.  When it stopped next to the road, it did not move at all nor did it make any noise.  I was tempted to stop for a better look, but quite frankly, I was too frightened to do so.  In fact, I pushed my car to its limits to get away from it; the object did not follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I went outside and saw it, moving slowly.  It was flashing red and white, in a sporadic pattern. I got binoculars and saw that it had moved somewhat in the sky.  With binoculars, I saw that it was a flat object, with steady white light along the length of it.  It seemed close at that time, and then moved away as I watched it.  The flashing lights were very irregular, and seemed not to be a commercial aircraft. As I watched it, it moved from low in the sky, then lower behind some trees.  My wife, who had come outside by that time, and she noticed a similar object in the west, flashing in the same way.  That one as we watched it, also moved down so it was behind some trees. Then we looked back to where the original object had been.  Now it was higher in the sky, still flashing and moving generally downward.  It seemed much farther away now as the lights were much less distinct.  Finally, it disappeared or became obscured behind the trees that were in that direction. I don&#39;t know what this was.  My feeling is that it was not a normal aircraft, because of the overall movement-- low in the sky, then high, up, down, etc.  Also, the flashing didn&#39;t seem to be the usual wing lights of an airplane.  My hope is that this report may coincide with others who perhaps got a better look. If you have any questions, call us.<n>

The night was unusually beautiful, moonless and crystally clear.  My head was craned back as I looked overhead and marvelled at how velvety black the night was and how sparkling the stars.  As usual,  the milky way was much in evidence.  Suddenly,  in a group of 5 1st magnitude stars ( I thought later it was the handle of the Milky Way ) two of the &#34; stars&#34; began chasing each other. [ If you took a pencil and slowly drew a 5 pointed star without lifting your pencil,  that would represent 5 seconds and the approximate angles of flight; in other words, sharp, sudden and continuous movement )  The first thing that popped into my mind was, &#34; Planes can&#39;t do that.&#34;  I remained half an hour to see if they reappeared,  but they didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I called the newspaper office and asked if anyone else had reported seeing a UFO.

One was by a minister in the 70&#39;s,  a good friend of mine and totally reliable. Check reports in the past for Sardine Creek Rd.,  Sam&#39;s Valley,  Gold Hill.

He was sitting on my right side. We were facing south looking down the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. While talking I saw something that looked like a shooting star but 100 times larger. I looked at it in awe, with my mouth open for a good 3 seconds. I didn&#39;t speak, I just elbowed my boyfriend until he looked at the object. By this time it was directly above us.  It came from the US went directly over our heads and rounded down toward Isle of Palms and faded out. We both thought were going to see some type of explosion or something. It was extremely close to Earth.  Looked like it was going to land. The sphere was about the size of a basketball. the sphere glowed yellow and had a red glow around it. It also had a very long tail about ten times the size of the ball.  The tail was red where it met the ball and faded out to blue toward the end of the tail. From the red it turned to orange to yellow to green to blue at the point, or end of the tail. This was the first time I had ever seen anything like it. I didn&#39;t know to report it. I work at a television station and asked our meteoroligist about it and asked his opinion on what I saw. He did some research and had no idea. Then I witnessed the same type of event on Sunday, October 4th. The next day there was a small little article about it then the day after that there was a bigger article with your phone # and address.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Similar report from same source, and in same location, for the date of 10/04/98.

The sky was clear, temp in the low 60&#39;s. We were sitting around the campfire star gazing, and had spotted a few falling stars. But this was no falling star. I looked towards the SSW direction and noticed a bright pinpoint of light in a straight line heading NNW above the Big Dipper, which was plain to see. At first I thought it was a satellite, but after 5 seconds of watching it, as were my nephew and friend... it became extremly bright &#34;white&#34; with a corona around the outside almost as of a burning light completelyt round, almost 10-20 times brighter and it accellerated when it did... for a burst of 3 seconds then it became the small pinlight as in the beginning of the sighting. The other two gents I was with made a commment of satellite, but I have seen thousands of them, and this did not act as if it was one. The object went out of sight heading NNW, total sighting time, 10-13 seconds, altitude undetermined, but we were at a level of 4500 feet in the mountains.<n>

It was skipping about in the sky very fast, couldn&#39;t keep track of it. It had a quick pulsating action. When it reappeared in a different spot the second time, it flew behind a mass of trees. I never saw anything like it... There is also a very strange occurrence in Lunenburg, the next town over. Over Lake Whalom, every evening.,there is a huge bright white light that hovers in the same position of the sky evening. It pulses very, very brightly. After about 5 minutes it slowly moves to the left and it abruptly disappears. It will reappear shortly after and do it again - all night long. The locals have been seeing this for years, and it very dependable. It is not a plane, for it is there every evening. It stays in the same place until it shifts to the left and disappears. It is not a planet - for it is there yearround and it moves. I guess you just have to see it. I am a webmaster in West Boylston, MA.

In my binos  , I tried to determine the range. My associate used his compass to  get it&#39;s direction. It was 78 degrees north east.  With daylight it faded to a point. Then a field around this object surrounded it and it disappeared by 06:00 a.m. also a  airliner flew past this object and  didn&#39;t seem to acknolge it&#39;s location.<n>

It was in one of these areas in Tioga County, PA that I was sitting in a lawn chair next to my van watching the sky.  It was extremely dark, yet despite some encroaching haze from the west, the stars were very clear overhead and to the south and east.  I got up to put something in the van, and as I set the object inside,  a light from above and behind me illuminated the area, enough to cause my arm to cast a shadow on the floor of the van.  I turned around in time to see a very bright light, I would estimate at a magnitude of brightness ten times that of Jupiter, located high in the southeast sky.  Suddenly, the light began to fade, made no noise, and before it went completely out, a dim, pale blue light tracked northward away from the source of the brilliant light.  The blue light travelled at roughly the same speed as any high altitude airliner for about 20 seconds, until it too faded out of sight.  I perceived it to be a re-entry of some kind, and, given the troubles with Mir, feared the worst.  The initial brilliant light never moved.  I spent many years in the Air Force.  I am certain that it did not come from an aircraft landing or collision light system.<n>

No glamorous close up sighting, but extremely high for an airplane, much, much to fast, no flashing or red lights. Deffinately not a shooting star. We know what these look like. It was in the Eastern horizon heading North to South. Could add better description, but just wondered if we are the only ones to report this. Seriously can not be convinced this was an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 22:40 (EST)  on 06/27/98 in the Eastern horizon, heading North to South I observed a circular lighted object (white) that caught my attention in the night sky that appeared to be at a height that is extremely high for an airplane, and at a speed much too fast, no red or flashing lights could be seen as you usually see with airplanes.  After it traveled what seemed a great distance in a short time it disappeared. Deffinately not a shooting star which seems to burn brighter and lasts maybe a second. Witnesses: I am 38, wife 34, son 10, and daughter 9. I am still sort of a skeptic about UFO&#39;s in the sence of from other planets, so could there be a logical explanation for what we saw. It was a clear night, is it possible to see a satalite that we have orbiting around the earth, or don&#39;t these light up like what we witnessed? Has there been any other sightings at around this time? Is it possible to be contacted with a response via E-Mail, such as your professional opinion on what we saw.<n>

After calling my 15 yr old daughter and getting a pair of binoculars, we took turns looking at the craft in the sky as it floated or slowly moved along the tree tops.  Then, before it came to a larger group of trees it seemed to turn south, still at the tree tops, and away from our view.  As it turned away, the shape of the craft changed from an oval with a bright, almost gold, lite in the center, to a more concave shape which we lost in the trees as it went south or fell slighty in the sky.

I first thought a large helium filled baloon. However, when i looked thru binoculars the object moving at a fairly steady rate of speed appeared to have ridges on the outer part of it. The 5 minute interval sighting ended when the object entered a cloud and did not exit the other side.My only thoughts on this sighting was that it reminded me of a WWII mine or a satellite.I have no UFO experience nor did I ever see  one till this night. I guess I was UFO lucky because one hour later I saw a different UFO which I will descibe in another entry.<n>

The object was larger than blimp size and was solid black with no reflective surfaces. Observer 1 ( writing this summary ) huried into house a got a pair of binoculars ( 10x50 ) and observed the object for a couple of minutes. I then proceeded to locate our 35mm camera and snap off 6 pictures. Unfortunately when I went to rewind the film for developing it was no longer in the camera and is still missing. The first thing I did when I picked up the camera was to look through the little window to see the type of film and number of exposures on it ( 200 ASA 24 exp ) I then looked at how many exposures were left ( all 24 ) and proceede to the back porch to take my 6 photos. What happened to the film is still a mystery, but this object was a very symetrical structured craft that was so black it looked like a hole in the sky. There were no lights or windows visable.<n>

Circular, rectangle,,and diamond were the smaller ones. The  3 smaller crafts remained in their positions,hovering.  The 4th one, shaped &amp; the size  like the Stealth flew very low, tree top level.  It moved at a very high rate of speed, stop, and hover, make a 90* turn and move again.  Very bright flashes occured when it would stop, like a camera flash.  It flew over our car 2 times, but seemed most interested in the farmland and stock.  Arriving home we saw the same occurrance taking place over the western section of Jonesboro.  The smaller craft were moving this time. They would move straight up into sky, stop, turn, and fly back toward the ground.  This lasted approx. 45 mins.  Then a large light, like a giant headlight appeared in the sky and the smaller craft flew to it and disappeared.  The large light went out and 2 rows of lights could be seen. They were blinking without a pattern.  Then the large craft shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.  Several people reported seeing the &#34;light&#34; show in the sky the next day.  I have seen things in the sky before that were unexplainable, but it was by far the most interesting and by far the most conviencingI have ever witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Smaller crafts:  We could see their shapes due to the full moon.  One was like a ball shaped, had steady lights on the top, bottom and around the mid section.  The rectangle one, appeared to be the size of refrigater box, 1 blinking light on one end, it was the farest away from us.  The diamond or hexagon shaped one was closet, it was hovering, would spin in place, and had steady lights on several points and had one larger blinking light on the what we called the top.  They were in an area of approx. 3 acres of land.  We laughed at first sight, thinking the National Guard from Little Rock, AR probably were out with infra red camera trying to search out the pot crops, because the objects were hovering.  Then the larger one appeared out of no where!  It &#39;s shape was like the stealth bomber, almost bird like.  Flashing lights on the nose, tip of each wing, and 3 lights on the tail.  It flew faster than anything I have ever seen, stop on a dime, hover, turn, and take off again.  A very bright flash occurred each time it stopped.  This was in a rural area just off the Hwy. 63 in Trumann, AR.  My friend thought I was kidding at first, she then stopped the car and watched.  She couldn&#39;t believe what she was seeing.  We watched for approx. 20 mins.  We then started getting spooked and drove on to Jonesboro, AR, where I live.  This is approx. 15 miles away from the first sighting.  Upon arrival I told my husband what we saw.  Of course he laughed at us.  But after seeing our faces, he stopped.  We then went outside and we saw a very large light in the western sky, looked like a headlight on a train engine, very bright. It was approx. 2 miles west of my home and it hovered above the tree line for approx. 30 mins.  Then 4 sets of blinking lights appeared in the sky and one at a time flew to the large light.  Upon the arrival of the last one the large light turned off.  Then 2 rows of blinking lights appeared.  The lights were amber, white, red, blue, and blinked in no pattern, just ramdon.  Then boom, it shot staight up in the air to the heavens and disappeared.  I check through out the night and never did see anything else.  The next day and even all the next week several people stated they saw the light show in the sky that Friday night.<n>

The lights that we saw, were round.  they were very bright, almost like extra bright spotlights. The color of the lights was a yellow or shining color.  the background of my father,(the other witness besides me)is that he is an ex-soldier in the army.  he doesn&#39;t believe thy were ufo&#39;s, but rather some kind of secret millitary aircraft. my father is the type that believes everything the government says. my own background is, i&#39;m 15, what other information do you need to know?<n>

No blinking lights, no sound (too far away), just a steady fireball-like trail, off in the horizon, set against a beautiful sunset.  It was really quite pretty. I don&#39;t know what it was and I couldn&#39;t identify it. I taped about 30 seconds of digital video (jvc digital video camera) and have no idea how to get a copy of the video to you (if you&#39;re interested).  Whatever it is, it&#39;s my only experience with seeing something I couldn&#39;t identify and therefore I&#39;m very proud of my little video!

Then, in the southern hemisphere, near the satellite path, we saw a very fast moving light, moving about 30 times faster than the satellite, although we could not judge the actual distance of the light from us.  The light was far away.  It would zig, and zag, then stop and hover, then zig and zag again at diagonal, horizontal and vertical angles at extremely fast speeds. It almost appeared to &#34;jump&#34; from place to place, it was so fast. Our elevation was over 4,000 feet and there were no lights nearby.  If it had not been such a clear and dark night, I doubt that we would have seen it.  We saw the light for about an hour until we left and went to sleep. Neither of us had ever seen a UFO before. I have good eyesight-better than 20/20 vision.  Sorry I didn&#39;t have a video camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize that this doesn&#39;t provide much info-it was a sighting from far away.

I looked up to see what i considered balloons, im saying at least eight,they moved from straight over head to a large, very large! cloud.from over head to the clouds position would be 45 degrees, the children were screaming men in black repeatedly (it occurs to me now they didn&#39;t see it as balloons). as the spheres, or balls which were extremly white,  reached the cloud they seperated equally to each side and entered one by one. during this I held my hand up to this cloud that was at 45 degrees,and its width was wider than my hand at arms lenght the balls were the size of my fingernails. it made me consider that if one of those things were near us it would have been the size of our two car garage. then after realizing the balls seemed to pause and enter the cloud one by one, I found a different interest to see what would happen next. balloons I thought would act randomly so we all waited for them to exit the cloud at some time somewhere. we watched the cloud and followed it to the horizon (as far as we could possibly see  but they never emerged also the cloud seemed to have accelerated once the balls got inside it had an eastward heading. I&#39;m only submitting this because I&#39;m hoping someone seen something simular that i may compare.<n>

This was followed by a &#34;Stealth&#34; bomber flying overhead in a easterly direction. Several streaks across the sky followed and each time a streak was seen there was an object flying across the sky at the starting point or beyond the finishing point of the streak. There were several fly-overs at altitudes exceeding the normal for passenger jets. Then there was a large silver and bright blue streak across the sky in a westerly direction. This streak exploded into many directions. The explosion seemed to be very high in the sky, and no report was heard. Within less than five minutes the &#34;Stealth&#34; came back overhead from a south-east direction and proceeded north-west. The &#34;Stealth&#34; was low enough that you could see its outline. The objects flying at high altitude were moving in several directions, but did not follow the horizon line. Some dissapeared in the middle of our line of site. Some were just flying across the sky, turned bright blue, and was gone. Some flew across the sky, stopped, and held position. Five object held position for almost an hour, moving closer together then separating. These were also a extremely high altitude. These objects had no back-trail, and were traveling 15-20 times faster than the &#34;Stealth&#34; when it flew over. The last things observed were several objects flying overhead, and a bright blue/white atmospheric something. The horizon was lit up for 360 degrees around us. It was bright enough to light the whole horizon and silouette the trees at the horizon line. We wanted to stay outside longer to see if anything else would happen, but it was late and there had only been two objects flying over the last half hour.<n>

At approximately 10:45 p.m. on June 22, my fiancee and I both noticed a strange speck of light as we stood on the ledge of our second story apartment.  The light behaved in a bizarre fashion, moving at what seemed to be incredible speeds in a zigzag motion back and forth.  It would disappear into some trees for a moment then reappear.  The entire episode lasted until 10:50. In are attempt to give this moment a rational explanation we both ruled out the following: The object did not appear to be any type of aircraft due to it&#39;s bizarre flying behavior, nor was it a search light because there was no ground source projecting it. I am writing this to the National UFO Reporting Center in the hopes that there may have been others that had witnessed this strange event.  It may be possible that the object was picked up on radar at our local air port though I could not obtain that information at this time. Whatever it was it has defiantly spooked both of us into thinking that much of the stuff we see on TV may not be figments of the imagination.<n>

I was looking in the sky off and on while we were talking and I noticed a bright orange square. It was very high in the sky but bright. As I watched it, all of a sudden it came forward at the speed of light and stopped. when it stopped,the lights shut off. The object was black. It was about 300 to 400 yards long and 5 to 10 stories tall.At this point I was very amazed at what i was looking at.I did not tell my neighbor about at first. everything that I have described so far I witnessed.As the object just sat there huvering in the sky above, it stayed dark for about 30 seconds,then solid bright orange lights turned on. on the side of the object. the were the size of a huge hollywood light. There were about 25 of them across the side of the object that was facing us.At this point i turned to my neighbor and said&#34;Oh my God&#34;, and she said, &#34;whats wrong&#34;, I said don&#39;t freak out but look up!As my neighbor looked up in the sky, she saw this huge oval shaped object with the orange lights on around it. then the lights started to blink in a rotating pattern, different lights at different times causing a strobe effect. my neighbor was scared at this point and ran in my house terrified.The object started to move slowly upward in the sky and then all of a sudden it just dashed away at the speed of light. The object was silent it did not make any noise at all. It was so Awesome it took my breath away.I know what all planes and military aircrafts look like i can name most of them. I can Tell airplanes apart at night from helicopters and stars and sattelites apart from them all.But for the first time in my life I BELEIVE!!!!!!!!I just got a computer in January. I just found your site today and decided to tell you my story. Maybe somebody will beleive me.<n>
6/21/98 22:30|Saskatoon (Canada)|SA|Other||Wing-shaped or boomerang-shaped craft at high altitude directly overhead.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04168.html|50|ndxe199806| Wing-shaped or boomerang-shaped craft at high altitude directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While sitting on the patio with friends, shortly after sunset I looked directly overhead to view the sun shining on the high, wispy clouds. At the same moment, I saw what at first appeared to be a fast-moving jet moving from NNW to SSE. Because of my location, I could only view about as much of the sky as the equivalent of twice the width of my hand held at arm&#39;s length. The object crossed this section of the sky in less than two seconds (possibly as quickly as one second), only long enough for me to barely open my mouth to draw attention to the others sitting with me, but not long enough for me to utter a word. What surprised me about the object was that it was very dark compared to other jets in the air that evening (dark grey) and the way the &#34;wings&#34; met at a right angle, giving the appearance of a carpenter&#39;s square flying through the air. There was no fuselage visible. I thought it might be a very large, very fast jet flying at very high altitude or a smaller, slower jet at lower altitude. I observed other jets crossing the sky within the following quarter-hour and, even though some were quite some distance away (i.e. viewed at 45% from the horizon or less), I could clearly make out their fuselages in all cases, they were much lighter in colour than what I had observed earlier, their wings did not have the distinctive right-angled proportions or even width from fuselage to tip, and they travelled at much slower apparent speeds. There was no sound from the object (not necessarily surprising if it were in fact a very high aircraft), although I could hear most of the other aircraft I observed that night, even the high, distant ones. Anyway, it made me curious, and I&#39;ve been closely watching a lot of aircraft for the past few days and nothing I&#39;ve seen in the air even closely resembles what flew over on Sunday night. The object&#39;s flight path struck me as rather strange, as most commercial aircraft fly either more-or-less on east-west lines in this part of the country or northeast to southwest if they&#39;re overseas flights. I&#39;ve never seen anything flying on so nearly a north-south axis (although this might be a good route for commercial flights from Russia or military craft returning from the far north).<n>

I have always felt that the likelyhood of other intelligence was a probability. Last night it became a reality to me. The sighting is as follows: Approximately 10:30 PM last evening [Sunday] while outside here in Corpus Christi and simply looking at the stars because the sky was clear, except for a few scattered clouds, I made what I know was a UFO sighting. Moving in a direction from south to north were three objects that CLEARLY were not conventional aircraft. [ Both my brothers are airline flight instructors and I have been around pilots all my life. I have a fairly good knowledge of aircraft and their characteristics.] The size of the objects is best explained by saying if you held a TYLENOL capsule [ the oval/cylindrical variety] at arms length to your vision, that would represent the size these objects were to my field of vision. They were a pale LUMINESCENT orange/pink in color. Flying/moving in formation. One behind another in a straight line. As they moved over me, the one in the rear of this formation, broke and passed the others, as an auto would on the highway and taking the lead position. Their speed was much faster than conventional aircraft. But as the one in the rear passed the others, and took it&#39;s place in the lead their speed all of a sudden intensified as they flashed completely out of my vision. I was most impressed with the impact this had on my consciousness. While observing them I seemed to be in an almost altered state of consciousness. As though time slowed down to allow me to make their observance in remarkable detail. There is not even a slight amount of doubt in my mind that these were not of this world. I am still awed by this experience. Regards K((Name &amp; address deleted))<n>

Approximately 15 seconds after seeing it, I noticed another light with exactly the same characteristics and moving in the same direction.  This is not the first time I was a witness to such an occurance.  Back in February of this year, on two different occasions, I saw a light moving N at a fairly low altitude.

We pulled over into the Tan Foran Shopping Center parking lot instead of connecting onto 280.  It still was not completely dark although it was if you looked toward the south; it was so well lit it kind of hovered and floated it went right over our heads and to the southeast.  Approximately 4 minutes later (we were still standing there in shock) from the northwest another object only this seemed to be more of a diamond or rectangle shape) followed although it was much higher in the sky and had blue and white (and possibly red) lights that outlined the bottom of the object; first you would see a dim blue blink; then next to that one a dim white blink; next to that one a dim blue blink; so on probably two per second approximately; it followed exact same direction as saucer.  My 8 year old daughter and 6 year old son saw it with me.  Neither of these objects made any noise.  The SFO airport is located to the south of san bruno and at this time there were no planes in the air nor in the surrounding areas.  My background I am 31 years old employed in an optometrist&#39;s office, have 4 children and have always been fascinated by UFO&#39;s; I have seen 2 other strange objects that I can recall in the past ten years; I know I had a couple of other times before that that I had seen strange objects in the sky; however, I cannot remember know what it was.  I have had 3 dreams of events as they happened; including one terrifying one when my greatgrandmother died in 1981; six months later I be! gan having what I call my &#34;synergy&#34; dreams - electrocuted and pulled out of my body with all kinds of horrific things happening; recurring to this day.  Odd that about 4 weeks ago I went to the library and began reading about UFO&#39;s.  I do not know what triggered the recent increase in my interest; I do find it strange, however, that I should see such dramatic examples of UFO&#39;s that even I found too close for comfort but it was extremely fascinating.  I do not know if anyone else saw this; the local news did not report a thing;  I find it hard to believe that no one saw these objects, and if I had been alone I would doubt myself by now; however, my children saw it too and I cannot doubt all three of us so I stand by what we saw, no matter how odd it may be.<n>

I notice a red glow on the pavement. I thought it was from the moon. So I turned to ask did anyone other than me notice it, and as I did one of my friends was pointing up to the sky and he said &#34;what is that&#34; I looked up to the direction he was pointing, and I saw a red light in the sky not moving at all, than it just took off like light speed. As it went over the pavement I could see the red glow that was on the ground leave with it. It went over a school and we saw it no more. I was about 1/2 mile in the sky. MOst of whome saw this had mixed views as to what it was, But I know what I saw. Note. I am a Bible school student and I do not lie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It flew back and forth for a few minutes, then it flew straight up into the air maybe like 90 feet higher than it was originaly, then there was a bright white light around it and I didn&#39;t see it again after that,<n>

Like a puck on ice. It was hard to estimate size or speed because we did not know how high up it was. I could cover it with my hand at arms length. It had five lights on the bottom. Three on one side and two on the other. The lights glowed orange and shimmered like the street lights when they first go off. Never getting too bright or too dim. The rest of the craft was not illuminated and appeared black. It made no noise. The most curious thing about it was the way it seemed to &#39;slip&#39; through the sky. It took about 120 seconds from the time I noticed it until is went out of sight. My girlfriend was shaken up a bit and asked me to take her home early. So the Et&#39;s or the Gov. or whom ever owes me for one ruined Saturday night.<n>

Then a  plane went near it and tried to follow it.I do not no if it was a commercial or army.Then came The Cylnder object. It had an upper station with windows and one blinking red light and the craft was sationary.I looked around and saw a black car with tinted windows and the linsinse plate was U.S. Govenment.I was really freaked out the rest of that week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left my house to go to stples in Medford Massachusetts, to copy something for a project.  When we pulled up i got out of the car, and i looked up in the sky because something caught my attention.  When i looked up i saw a star like object swurving around, in an irregular pattern so it was not a meteor, comet, astroid or plane. Then of all the sudden an American aircraft appeared, i do not know if it was a commercial, or an army because it did look like a commercial but i swear i saw a side-winder missle on it. Then the cylinder shaped object appeared. It was cylinder in shape and on top it had a thick oval top, and a blinking red light on top of the upper level, and also on the upper level it was surrounded by black windows, and it was staionary.  I was really the only witness because my mother had gone into the store, and two people looked up looked at me but then entered the store. When i walked into the store the 3 objects( the star, plane, and &#34;UFO&#34;) where no where to be seen, also i could of sworn i saw a black car with tinted windows, and the liscense plate said U.S goverment, Im not too sure about the car though.

My brother looked up and saw something. He told me and I looked as well. We saw 12 bright objects in the sky, moving.I grabbed my video recorder and stated taping them. They moved around as if the wind was moving them and also deliberatley in straight lines. Sometimes there would be a couple that were stationary and one would move away from them. My tape has also been viewed by a retired air force pilot and he said they are definately ufo&#39;s.They were appx. at 85 degrees up toward the north east above the cascade range. This is no joke.<n>

While we were walking towards the blding. for a break I caught a movement faceing south starting at aprox. 80 Degrees moving at a high rate of speed towards the northeast to aprox.30 degrees off the northeast horizon. This object was sphere shaped and about the size of a pickup truck. Its elevation was about 1500 ft. lower than most cub piper aircraft cruising elevations.What really shocked me is that it stopped instantly and hovered. Suddenly it shot back south-southeast to a point almost directly overhead. This was aprox. 160 degrees back from its original course and at a high rate of speed. Again it stopped instantly and hovered. The sun light reflected off its surface showing that it was silver or metalic. I was in awe about what I was seeing and at the point of telling my co-workers &#34;Hey! Whats that in the sky&#34; when this object shot out of site over the north-northeast horizon. I then asked my co-workers hey did you see that, after a discription they all laugh saying I was seeing things. I don`t know what I saw that afternoon but I do know that it was not any weather balloon or airplane. I`m now just starting to talk about this and have only told a selected few friends and relatives about my experience. I`m a amateur astronomer and have 20-20 vision. Nothing in my 40 yrs. of life ever moved so fast outside of  shooting stars!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I live in the country and I was going to drive into town to get to my work place.  I was with a co-worker who lived on the way to town (we were car pooling).  The sky was clear and it was just a quiet morning.  Then my co-worker pointed into the sky and said, &#34;Look at that! What is that thing?&#34;  I am not an aircraft expert, but that thing didn&#39;t look like any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen.  It was in a sort of oval shape, more like an egg.  It was a dark gray color.  There weren&#39;t any lights or anything like that.  The object made no noise.  It was about 1000 feet in the air and it was moving very fast across the sky.  Then there was a jet aircraft chasing after it about three seconds after the craft passed.  The jet made jet noises, unlike the craft.  The craft didn&#39;t have any jet engines, but it was going so fast that it would almost have to.  Both me and my co-worker didn&#39;t know what the craft was.  We still don&#39;t to this day and we classify it as a UFO because that&#39;s what it is to us.  I&#39;m not going to give out my personal information because I don&#39;t know what people (people with the jet aircraft) will do to me if they see this story.<n>

I found it disturbing because I could not determine the reason I had awoken. I did not usually wake for no reason. I felt alert and full of adrenaline. I then noticed my old cat looking at something outside. This itself would normally be very odd. She was old and almost blind. She never focused on anything including me. That is when a spotlight illuminated my room for an instant moving from N to W. My room had 3 large (4 ft tall, 1.5 ft wide) windows facing directly south and one window facing west. I quickly pulled my blinds up on 2 of the south facing windows hoping to catch a glimpse of it. My house is close to Cecil field airbase and our house was directly in the path of P-31 Orions on landing approach which normally fly E to W. They never illuminated my room. Sometimes, our local Sheriff  helicopters fly over too which is what I expected to see. They had illuminated my room before but they flew higher, their light was not as blinding, and they tended to fly in circles which this did not do. They also tended to make noise. I was surprised to see a dark circular craft hovering over some nearby tree lines. There was no sound. None. It had an Extremely bright spotlight which was very Blue in color. The craft was moving NNW and its path took it just past my house and past my backyard. I estimated the craft to be hovering at a very low altitude. 50-75 feet above the ground. As it moved, it was also moving its spotlight. After I had opened my blinds, the light had been refocused at the street 60 feet away (South of me) and just to the right of the craft straight down. Again, if facing my house from the north, to the right of my house and south 50 feet on our street. It moved the light quickly north, then northwest and then again into my bedroom where it then stayed (obscuring my view of the craft for most of its time within my vision) focused on me as the UFO moved towards, and then past my house. I would estimate its speed at 20 mph.I tri! ed looki ng through my west facing window and watched the light as it moved to the neighbor&#39;s house directly behind mine and then northward out of view. I never heard of other reports and did not bring it up because it greatly disturbed me. I didnt sleep the rest of the night. I cannot stress how errie it was that there was no sound at all. Were there sound, everything about the incident would scream normal sheriff helicopter activity. There was just absolutely no sound at all, completly silent, and it seemed much lower than I normally observed local helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was about 2AM, and we were just approaching the Dover Airforce base, Off to our right was a clearing and about 200 feet in the air was a giant craft the only way I can explain it would be as a flying football field, being dark I could see the outline, and many lights spread out through the bottom of it. I said to my friends did you see that it looked like a UFO, they said its the Airforce base dummy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as I know we have no planes that size or shape.

Me and my friend had just gotten back to his house on Ireland Road near route 86 in Hartsgrove from an evening out with some friends.  Instead of turning in for the night we decided to shoot the breeze for a while because the weather was so nice.  So after a while of sitting in my car talking we noticed a strange light in the east sky.  It seemed to be off in the horizon moving steadily closer and higher into the sky.  It was such an odd looking light, it was so bright but it&#39;s light seemed so artificial so unlike that of a star.  That is what initially got us out of  my car to go investigate what we were seeing.  As we watched we noticed that it seemed to be moving about the sky in small figure eight configurations all the time while changing the intensity of it&#39;s light. After a while of watching the strange light do the same thing over and over again we lost interst and went back to talking.  Then about twenty minutes later in the north sky we noticed a weird looking craft in the sky, it was a rather wide looking object that made no noise, was pitch black in appearance, and only had three lights on it (one red light on each end and a blue light right in the center of it.)  If it was an airplane it was one neither of us had ever seen before.  About ten minutes later there was a huge flash of white light down the center of the sky and the aircraft that was on our left side (south) was now on the right of us.  Other than the fog that had rolled in just before the flash of light it was a perfectly clear night.  So to say the least we were pretty freaked out. Now this is the really freaky part of our night.  We were still in my friend&#39;s front yard talking about the weird stuff that was going on, not thinking too much into the events that had all happened within an hour and a half.  Like I said we were in his front yard just talking, we were facing towards each other, and I was looking at the ground kicking at some dandelions.  All of a sudden the ground got brighter like someone was shining a spotlight at us.  When I looked up over my left shoulder into the south sky I saw a perfectly round, perfectly white light floating down out of the sky right at us without giving off a single sound.  It was so bright I had to shield my eyes as I tried to look at it.  I was so stunned all I could do was yell, &#34;What the hell is that?!&#34; to my friend.  As I got to &#34;hell&#34; the ball of light stopped on a dime not more than forty feet away from us and immediatly shrunk in size, hovered for a brief second, and shot straight up into the sky with such amazing speed.  We watched it as it traveled among the stars until we lost track of it because it was moving so fast and blended in so well with the stars.  It was at that time that I turned to my friend and said, &#34;I think it&#39;s time I go home and go to bed  now.&#34;  And that&#39;s it, that was my one of a few strange sightings in Hartsgrove township.<n>

He asked me what I made of that, I told him it obviously is not an airplane because its sitting perfectly still, my first thought was that it was a helicopter but it was too large and although his car was still running there didn&#39;t appear to be any sound coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stood there for a few minutes looking at it he told me they had to leave so I pulled up the road a bit closer to it and shut the car off.  I watched it for another several minutes before it started to move toward me, there was absolutly no noise coming from this object,  it was silent and it was moving very slow and the only change in the lights is that before it started to move toward me the bright white light in the center dimmed. As the object which was clearly a craft of some sort approached me it turned just app. 20 ft before it did, I was more in awe then I was scared, when it turned to the northeast it turned very smooth just like a car turns, it was also at its very closest at the turn point, it kept heading northeastward at the same slow speed just above ground at app 150 ft above ground level.  I watched it till it was out of sight then I turned the car around and went home, I phoned the RCMP and asked if they had any calls about strange lights in the sky, after talking with them for a few minutes they told me to get in touch with the airport...so I did, and they put me through to the control tower, I told him my story and he was quite interested knowing that I sounded sincere. He told me that there have been no flights out in the past two hours and none were do in for another hour and a half {small airport} and he said that aircraft had a red light and a green light not red and blue lights - after the report to the control tower there were a few small planes I noticed circling around the area...but this thing was gone by then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this has happened some years back I can not exactly remember the date, but the details as I have described them about the sighting are, I will never forget it, I have since moved not to far from there and occasionly talk with my former neighbor, we still agree what we seen that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

But before we left, I had to finish up a load of laundry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, our house is the middle house in a cul-de-sac, so when we open our garage door, it faces the cul-de-sac and the street that leads into it. Our washing machine and and dryer are in there, and so when we do the wash, we can see the outside world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After putting the clothes in the washer I opened the door to the house, to go back inside. The door, is the kind, that when open, it automatically shuts close, real fast. Well, I opened the door, and all of a sudden, my entire garage is flooded in a bright neon lime-green light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turn around and see that the entire neighborhood is flooded in this light. Everywhere I looked, everything was covered in this light, as if someone was holding a light, right over our cul-de-sac. I didnt see any object, but after about 10 seconds, of being in light, this huge shadow came out of nowhere and then flew off to the western sky. And then there was this weird wind (like a suction)and the trees blew along with other debri, to the west and then stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light &#34;flew&#34; off too, and everything turned back to normal. I turned around and started to walk back in the house. Now, all this time, the door has been opened. And if you recall, I told you that it was one of those sprung doors, that shut as quickly as it opened. Well, right then and there, the door shut, right over my left foot, ripping up my nail on my big toe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Dr. said, the nail would never grow back, because the nerves had been lifted out, but it did, and to this day, my toe has a nail. Something, my Dr. said was a &#34;miracle.&#34;  I dont know what it was that happened that day, but I always thought, that it had something to do with an alien. So, I was wondering if you can shed some sort of information on this, and tell me, if you have another experience such as this, recorded. Thanks.<n>

6/18/98 18:45|Narcoossee|FL|Light||"bright light" that lit up the sky|11/21/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03364.html|73|ndxe199806| Heard on the local news a report regarding a possible UFO witnessed  3/17/98  in a small community S.E. of Orlando FL, called &#34;Narcoossee&#34;. Witnesses reported a &#34;bright light&#34; that lit up the sky &amp; one resident/witness related that the event actually &#34;scared&#34; 11 chickens to DEATH! NOTE FOR INVESTIGATORS:  Local Orlando TV, CH.9, an ABC affiliate, has a copy of the 911 call concerning this event, it was aired on the 11pm news broadcast, 3/18/98. Authorities assume &#34;someone was possibly shooting flares...&#34;, according to the news report...... ***************************************************************** UPDATE: Narcoossee, FL event of 3/17/98 According to ABC News affiliate, Channel 9 TV, Orlando FL, the &#34;Bright Light(s)&#34; experienced by numerous witnesses on the evening of 3/17/98, was due to &#34;Test Flares&#34; launched at the Avon Park Bombing Range. HOWEVER.....if one looks at a map, one can easily see that the distance from the Northern edge of the Avon Park Range to the town of Narcoossee is in EXCESS of 50 miles! HOW are they (whomever THAT may be!) &#34;testing&#34; flare-launches from Avon Park with the flares dropping over 50 miles away to the North?! ****************************************************************** ADDED NOTE: According to Ch 9 sources, the &#34;testing&#34; would continue for &#34;the next several nights&#34;. (Additionally, I Emailed the TV Stations Programming Director &amp; asked them to explain why flares launched from Avon Park Boming Range would be landing in Narcoossee, 50 + miles to the north! Also, one would assume that in &#34;testing&#34; said flares, PART of the test would be to view the flares lighting &#34;effectiveness&#34;......therefore I asked CH 9 TV to send a Film Crew to observe &amp; report how/why the tests were going by observing govermental workers that by all rights SHOULD be in the vicinity of Narcoossee, or any potential landing area to document the results of any &#34;test launch&#34;. I ALSO asked the TV station in my Email if having HOT Flares, buring brightly enough to have one resident blame them for the deaths of 11 chickens, drop on unsuspecting, populated areas such as Narcoossee, did not constitute a risk (duly warranted?) of fire/damage/injury/death from fires that WOULD occur if said flare(s) were to easily land on a residential/commercial/occupied structure.......I have not had a reply to that as yet.<n>

6/16/98|Broken Hill (Australia)||Rectangle||regular sightings of massive "intergalactic" craft in or around Broken Hill NSW australia|12/23/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26576.html|83|ndxe199806| regular sightings of massive &#34;intergalactic&#34; craft in or around Broken Hill NSW australia<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was reported on the well respected ABC National radio network several years ago which is where I learnt of it. It took the form of one on one interviews and I&#39;m bringing it to your attention because the people of Broken Hill have withdrawn from the spotlight and you will not see the city which is a copper mine town, I think the largest in australia, on any ufo map. But its stories are the most rivetting I have ever come across in the past ten years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft were described as common in the area, but not talked about because the people do not wish to be thought of as crazy. They are generally recognized as being massive by all witnesses including a world famous and respected artist who lives in the city, Pro Hart, and I quote , &#34;about the size of sixteen football fields&#34; ie each one or &#34;about a mile long&#34;. And on a regular basis. This story might be old and the craft have probably moved on . Why stay near a desert town like Broken Hill forever, but I think it deserves to be put on the record. I believe these craft are Intergalactic ,  which would explain their great size. I was again reminded of them by your Rense show with a similar sized craft (or three) in Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These craft obviously know everything about us , see my earlier post about the searchlight phenomenon and continuous presence over Sydney Australia for several weeks with nothing in the media ,they have been studying us with superior technology for so long ,and are probably just waiting for us to grow up.Finally like my mother used to say &#34;there is good and bad everywhere&#34; and no doubt this applies to these extaterrestrials as well. In which case maybe some of THEM should grow up. I was just wondering, do these craft need copper? it doesn&#39;t hurt to take the discussion beyond &#39;Did you see that.It was..etc!&#39; Finally I believe that maybe every star in the Universe may support life at some time. This concept gives glory to God so it is worth thinking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is unspecified by witness.

I do not know how long we were out there before we both got up to go inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw an object shaped like an egg but, slightly flatter, not really a saucer shape.  It had no sound, no lights, left no trail and could have been missed if not for the light from the moon.  It came from the north east, over the neighbors house, and headed to the south west.  It was barely above the power lines. It appeared to have a brushed aluminum appearance, with no seams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both stopped and I said to my dad, &#34;Do you see that?&#34;.

As we were looking we saw a bright light that was &#34;gliding&#34; across the sky we were shocked because we could tell it wasn&#39;t a plane. Soon another light appeared floating nearby the first.  We watched them for awhile until we began to lose sight of them so we ran down the road to a park to watch more. When we got there, what appeared to be two jets (possibly from Grissom Air Force Base) were in pursuit of the lights.  The lights broke off from each other and the jets broke off to follow. The first jet went after the first light and as the jet got near to it, it seemed like the light paused for a moment and suddenly shot across the sky leaving the jet behind like it was standing still. The second jet followed the second light until it got too close and suddenly the second light made a DEAD stop in the air and made a complete reverse of direction passing the jet and soon after disappearing in the same fashion as the first. If anybody else has had any experiences like mine I would like to know because I really haven&#39;t discussed this with too many people and its dificult to talk with someone who has no frame of reference.<n>

They were not visible until they illuminated the sky.  They might have been using high power microwave and lasers to generate magnetic fields and magnetohydrodynamic or electrohydrodynamic propulsion.  They would have been invisible to radar as plasma disrupts radio signals.  They were definitely hypersonic aircraft or spacecraft as I am aware of some from an aerospace company I used to work for.  It had rocket flames which would be magnetohydrodynamic diffuser generators to provide power.  I know the Air Force Research Laboratory is building UAV&#39;s and SDI weapons using these same technologies.  Also they might have had flickering skins to confuse IR heak seeking missiles from tracking it as it had a enormously long rocket plume(They had intense lights from them that were flickering and plasma doesn&#39;t flash at such a high frequency).  The two spacecraft darted across the sky at high velocity going in opposite directions on the hypersonic test range.  The plasma was blue and there was no noise or shockwave as the plasma attenuates the shock wave at hypersonic speed.  You can find more information from Venik&#39;s Aerospace Website.  They also test hypersonic missiles and missiles can&#39;t keep darting back and forth for 60 minutes at least.  It was near the border of Nevada.  I haven&#39;t seen them test since that time.  But they acknowledged that a super secret TRW test range was there but couldn&#39;t comment on the subject as it was highly classified information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.aeronautics.ru/archive/plasma/index.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.rpi.edu/dept/eng/live/mane/lightcraft/Research/DEAS/deas.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was sitting on the back steps of my house on a partly cloudy day.  It was around 2:00 in the afternoon when I noticed a silver ball, very tiny, just hanging in the sky.  The reflection of the sun off the object caught my eye.  I sat and watched it trying to determine what it was.  I kept squinting to try and see it better.  It looked as though it was stationary as the clouds were slowly moving East.  My first thought was it was a runaway balloon.  But when it was not moving with the wind...it had to be something else.  Then without warning and with no sound at all, it took off in a straight line...it&#39;s tragectory North to South at a slight incline.  The velocity was phenominal.  It went through the cumulous clouds and passed over my house.  No vapor, no sound, very fast.  If I were to guess it&#39;s size...I might have to say around the size of a Volkswagen Beetle.  That&#39;s my story...that&#39;s the truth...take it or leave it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

I imediatly realized that I was seeing a u.f.o. as I had never seen anything like this before in the broad daylight.I stood very still and was a little concerned with the fact that I was all alone and could possibly be abducted.I watched the entire time as it passed hopeing that it might change course or maybe even get a little closer to where I could see it even better.It came to a point where the sun reflected off of it for a moment.Not knowing the true size of this object I could not determine how high or far away it was. I would have to guess that it was at about 5000 to 10000 ft. up.The shape did appear to change at a certain angle as it seemed to go from cigar to football looking.I could not hear any sounds other than the sound of the process area that I was standing in when noticing this object.I called the local sheriff dept. to both report what I had seen and ask if anyone else had called about a sighting, they answered no.This was a unforgetable experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We wonder whether the witness might have witnessed an aircraft, which reflected sunlight off an unpainted fuselage, but we also presume that he probably addressed that possibility at the time of his sighting, and ruled it out.  The witness is correct that it is virtually impossible, without triangulation, to calculate the altitude of an object, whose dimension is unknown.  PD))<n>

At about 11:00am the weather was partly cloudy and very windy from the NW. I was watching an eagle soar over a ridge about 800 ft away. That is when i saw a shiny, silver, metalic object (perfectly round). It was slowly moving to my left and away, in a N to NE direction (against the wind!).I could tell it was moving because it was just over a ridge and i was stationary, the houseboat was moored. The object appeared close, about 1/8 to 1/4 mile, because it was in front of cloud formations. I watched the sphere for about 10 seconds. It was shiny on top and shaded below just the way a ball would be illuminated from an overhead sun. It also appeared to be spinning. Suddenly it vanished, so quickly as to give the illusion of imploding to nothing. If it moved, it moved to quick to see. As a side note: On our drive from Albuquerque to Navajo Lake my wife saw a simular ball but only for a couple of seconds. She too said it vanished quickly. I am including my artist rendering of the scene that day.<n>

Instead of three there where five, i thought this was odd, as we starred and questioned what it was the first star on the left moved down and very quickly moved to the left behind the fifth star. After reaching its postion it did this circle motion in a counter clockwise motion while staying in its postion,it stopped and disapeared. I said,&#34;did you see that&#34;! As soon the words were spoken the second star did the exact samething....and so on until all five stars where gone. I didn&#39;t blink once because i didn&#39;t want to miss a thing.

Object gave appearce of a star, whitish in color, but did not twinkle, no blinking, more like the reflection of light from an object sufficiently high in the atmosphere reflect sunlight despite that it was still very dark in the park.  I have walked in the park for the last 18 months from 0530 to 0630 and have essentially identified all the air traffic that flies overhead from the airports in the vicinity, and this object was a new object and did not appear to be an aircraft.<n>

It was about 4:30 AM.  I was watching the stars and the moon.  I looked up about 75 degrees, and I saw a formation of lights.  The lights were not a brilliant in their luminicity, and I assumed that it was rather high in the atmosphere.  When I first saw it, I thought the stars were moving...impossible...then I realized what I was seeing.  It looked like a large arrow in the sky, and it moved about &#34;one foot&#34; across my field of view, then it hovered and just stayed there.  To demonstrate what it was, make an equalateral triangle with a 6 dot pattern...then attach a smaller square, using 5 dots.  There should be a total of 11 dots.  (I don&#39;t remember exactly how many lights there were)  I assumed I was seeing many craft, but now wonder if it may have been one craft with many lights.  I wastched it for about 20 seconds, just hovering in the sky (it &#34;pointed&#34; upwards at an angle of 45 degrees.)  I walked away from the window, amazed, and went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.  I came back, and the lights were gone.  Off to my right, there was a bright light.  I didn&#39;t hear any noises and it seemed to move quite quickly across the sky, at about 1 foot per second.  I expected for it to go off into the horizon, but it did not.  There was a tree near my window, just off to my left.  It flew &#34;between&#34; two branches and slowed down.  Then it moved upwards quite eradically and blinked out.  I think this was all meant for me to see for some reason.  There is more to tell, about myself actually...and it leads to conclude that I may be a subject of theirs.  I would like very much to be contacted about this.<n>

When I relized that it was an unusual light I thought SPACESHIP. The dull orange light was only about 100ft from my car.  I kept driving, not really staring at the light, due to fear. I then made a right on Placentia. The light was now about a half a mile away and now moving north at a rising 30 degree angle. It was heading towards March AFB. I finally got home, told my parents and my sister to come and see the UFO. When they got out side the light was moving slowly up.  The light was, at the most, four miles from us. I did not see it move that distance in that short of time. The light then made a fast U-shaped turn in the sky and went out. The whole ordeal only lasted about three minutes. We were awe struck and went in; telling ourselves that there was some simple explanation for that. Ya right. I am a college student at UCR. I have always been trustworthy and honost. My mother grew up in Orange County. She sings in a local church band. My fatheralso grew up in Orange county. He plays drums for that same band and preaches every third Sunday of the month. My sister graduated From Rancho Verde and now has a child and works as crowd control at Disneyland.<n>

I do a lot of strenuous exercise, so I use the spa practically every night.  We&#39;re usually reclining, looking for falling stars and sattelites and watching the planes come in.  We&#39;re surrounded by airports (LAX, Santa Monica, Van Nuys, Burbank -- etc).  So we&#39;re accustumed to seeing lights in the sky, but not like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was the first to see them.  She said,&#34;What the $%^&amp; is that?&#34;  I turned and looked up to see this formation of 5, white, lights.  Flying from West to East at a couple thousand feet.  At first glance I thought it was a bunch of ultralights flying in formation.  There are a bunch of pilots in Santa Monica that have these planes and they often fly them in formation, but I&#39;ve never seen them fly at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as they passed over I realized these weren&#39;t aircraft lights (not conventional aircraft at least).  The lights themselves were sort of diamond shaped and not real bright and one of them seemed to be jockeying for position in the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the passed overhead I realized they made no sound -- which was the eeriest part.  My neighborhood is quiet and my spa wasn&#39;t turned on.  I lost sight of them over Hollywood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife said she saw the formation &#39;flip&#39; as it reached the ocean and start heading back toward the East.  I didn&#39;t see it &#39;flip&#39; but from the time she saw it to the time I lost sight of it towards Hollywood was only a matter of about 5 seconds.  It or they were moving very fast and appeared at one point to dip slightly and rise again in perfect unison.  It was like a giant kite with lights on the edges -- although I could never make out any shape and assumed at the time that the lights were independent elements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 34 and work in the entertainment industry as does my wife -- who was a little rattled by the whole thing.<n>

It was a dark mass in the sky with no lights, and moved in complete silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were standing in my driveway looking up at the moon when she pointed out the object.  It had no lights at all, and moved without any sound.  It just a big black object that was heading south about 100 feet in the air at a slow steady pace.  It was a bright night so the object was silloutted in the sky.  It was very boxy in overall appearace but not completely.  Its structure was simillar to that of a plane, If you cut off the tail fin and then crashed it through a split level house.  The object continued heading south untill it disappeared beyond the tree line.<n>

Skies bright, few clouds.  Traveled between mach 4 and mach 10.  Could not see object.  Could only hear it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My six year old son and I were working in the back yard when I heard a loud whooshing sound from approx. 10 miles NW of my location.  At first I thought it might be the sound of a very large fire, such as a large farm structure burning.  Then I noticed the sound was moving from NW to NNW.  The sound then appeared to calm down for a portion of a minute.  Next the sound began to move rapidly in my direction and passed almost directly overhead.  Neither my son nor I could see anything, but I judged by the level of the noise that the source of the noise was either very low in altitude (500-1000 Ft.) or the object was very large and moving air like an object larger than several barns.  The sound continued in a SSW direction for about 30-40 seconds and then appeared to travel beyond audible range.  I estimate the distance traveled to be about 40 miles in under a minute.  On a map this would have been approx. 10 miles SSW of Corvallis, OR. to the vicinity of Springfield, OR..  For the entire duration of this event, I could not see any flashes of metal, nor could I see a con-trail or any other evidence of a common aircraft.  After I thought about this event for five or ten minutes, I decided to call air traffic control at the Eugene airport to see if they had noticed anything or had phone calls about an unusual event.  Their reply was negative. I am reporting this event 3 months after the actual occurance, so the exact date and time are approximations.  I would assume that the Eugene Airport should have record of my call.<n>

They just floated in the same position for maybe a minute. Then two more seemed to materialize just above the first two. Then two more seemed to fall out of the second group like the first group. they stayed stationary in the same place for maybe 2 or 3 more minutes. We then went back into the cabin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Traveling from WNW to ESE.  Followed about two minutes later by similar light, traveling in same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:58 pm I went outside to investigate what at first sounded like thunder. There were approximately four loud booms.  I looked up to see that the sky was cloudless.  I told my roommate &#34;thunder doesn&#39;t go boom, boom.&#34; While looking up I saw the first light, about the brightness of Venus, traveling from WNW to ESE.  I thought it strange that there appeared to be only one light and no other blinking lights.  There was no sound of a jet either. I ran in to get my binoculars but could only make out a vague, black silhouette whose shape was not readily apparent.  I told my friend to come outside but by the time he made it out the object was out of sight below the tree line. As I was walking back to the house I looked and and saw another similar light. I said &#34;Look another one.&#34;  It traveled in the same direction, at the same speed. I got a good look at this one with the binoculars and saw no flashing lights, the vague, black silhoutte against the moonlit sky.  I saw both lights for approximately 15 to 20 seconds each.  They traveled in a straight line, again no sound that I could detect.  At about 10:02 pm I hear two more explosions about twenty seconds apart.  I have no idea what the loud booms were. Fireworks maybe, from nearby casinos.  There was nothing on the local news to explain the loud booms.  And, I have no reason to believe that they were associated with the flying objects.  Just a strange coincidence.<n>
6/11/98 21:00|Tampa|FL|Light|30 seconds|I saw a craft that probably was not from earth.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45179.html|121|ndxe199806| I saw a craft that probably was not from earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a sighting previous to this one which displayed certain similarities to the one explained.  We were walking down a boardwalk right after work.  The airport was to the right, to the east - about five miles away.  I saw a light hovering in that direction.  At first it looked to be a helo or close plane.  Then, as quickly as I spotted it, it started moving sporadically; first to the left, then to the right, then back, then back, then up, then down, then 20,000 mph to the right and gone.  Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m fully convinced that it was a gov&#39;t craft - or worry.  The only thing I have trouble with is that about four years before, I witnessed a craft do the same type of motion, exactly.  And not only that; we were talking about that previous experience when this one occurred.  However, my previous observation was of a craft that was so far away it was equal to a satelite in distance.  I grew up watching stars and planets and I do know what I am talking about.  Currently, I own a four and a half inch reflector telescope which I can see the rings on Saturn and the moons of Jupiter.  Well, four of them.  Back to the original story; This craft was so close it could have been a local craft before it started to move in a manner consistent with a non-earth-craft type of motion.  I hear the Discovery channel skeptics who relate observations like this one to energy and motion hallucinations.  These people are on the pay-roll, don&#39;t listen to them.  If what I saw that night was from here, God help us.  If it wasn&#39;t, God really help us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was trully awesome!|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48183.html|122|ndxe199806| Just before Dusk I saw, 50 feet from my car a Flying Disk that had two Rings Rotating around its main body. It was trully awesome!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were driving home to San Luis Obispo from Chico California on day and spotted something flying in the sky a quarter of a mile ahead of us. We were headed south-bound on highway 5 parallel to the city of Patterson, Ca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun had just gone down and there was still light out when we noticed a flying object over the highway headed toward us. It had flashing lights on it and its movments resembled that of a helicopter..at first. The object began to descend from above the highway of north-bound traffic into an area over an aquaduct. I turned my head to see where the flying object was going. The flying object stopped when it was parallel to us and changed course, flying at the same speed as us. When I finally caught a good look at it, I realized it was not a helicopter at all, but an obscure shape with lights rotating around it. It was a wierd sight. I didn&#39;t know what I was looking at. I intended it to be a helicopter, but it was not. My girlfriend was shocked. She pointed at the object with her mouth open and her eyes wide with awe. Her harm blocked my view of the road, so I slowed down to about 45 miles per hour. I turned my head again, and examined the flying object further. I realized at that moment, next to our car was a FLYING DISK with two RINGS rotating around it, one ontop of the other. The Craft was comprised of an approximately 25-30 foot long disk with the color of gun-metal silver. The shape was not round, but more oval in its length-wise, with a rounded off pointy tip. At the end of the disk was a smaller disk apparatus of the same color. Its length was appox 10-12 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing this I slowed down the car to roughly 25 miles per hour. The Flying Aircraft then began to speed up and rise into the sky. It flew above the northbound highway and stopped in mid-air appox 200 yards ahead of us. My girlfriend was panicking. The Flying Disk then began a perfect diagonal decent to an area above the south-bound highway 5. I remember the crafts movments were so perfect, as if the craft was in another world, uncontrolled by gravity. The movments it made, made me sick to my stomach. They seemed very unnatural to me. I began to cough. After the diagonal shift downwards to the side of the road, the craft stayed there for a moment and then made a perfect upward movement approximately 35 feet straight up into the sky. (I am sorry, this experience is very hard to describe). We were driving very slow and there was no traffic infront of us. A few cars could be seen in my rear-view window, but they were about a half mile behind us. There were oncoming cars going northbound, but they were atleast 3 quarters of a mile away. Then the Flying Disk with rotating Rings made a perfect opposite movement towards the ground. Its movements were that of a mouse icon on a computer. It moved very unnaturally and fluidly. I slowed the car down to approx 15 miles per hour and we watched as the Flying Disk hovered above a grassy hillside. My girlfriend scrammbled for her disposable camera she brought with her on the trip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was still light out, so the whole examination of the Flying Disk was unobstructed. I noticed its shiney body, and rings that had becons of lights on them. It was a marvel to whitness. It was the most awesome piece of machinery I have ever seen. This is when, under further examination, I noticed that the rings were huge metal looking apparatuses rotating around the disk. But there was something I could not intend to fathom, they were not connected to the craft by any bars, cooks, anything physical. The first ring closest to the Flying Disk was rotating at a 45 degree angle to the ship. The second ring rotated around the first ring 45 degree&#39;s to the ship counter to the first ring. This was trully an amazing sight. After about 10 seconds, of examination, we were parallel to the Flying Disk. This is when I began to rise upwards about 20 feet straight up. Again its movements, made me feel ill-at-ease. After rising approximatly 20 feet, a bright light lit up from beneath it. It permiated the ground and I saw dried grass sparkling underneath. I was trully in awe. Again, I was shocked by something that could not be intended by modern physics. The light was not attached to the aircraft by a light bulb. The light (similar to that of a hallogen) began from a point approximately 5 feet below the craft. It was as if it was a hallogram or something. Whatever the craft was doing, it was obscured by its awe-inspiring looks and movements. We kept our speed and moved on until the Flying Disk was out of sight behind us. A mile ahead we saw a police car in the middle of the north-bound highway with its sirens on. The police car was traveling approximately 5 miles per hour and was evidently there to stop traffic from passing. Every light I saw for the next 145 miles, I thought it would be another Flying Craft, the same Craft that I saw before. For a least a month I tried to explain to people what I saw. But the words would not come out of my mouth as I intended to voice them. I was completely spellbound by the awesome sight of that strange Flying Disk with Rotating Rings around it. The object made no sound. A detailed drawing of the becons of light, shape of aircraft, can be offered upon request. My girlfriend was unable to find her disposable camera, which was later found just beneath her feet under the passenger seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Photos were transferred to my computer and were being reviewed in Corel PhotoPaint ver. 7 when I noticed the bright white dot on Photo no. 2.  I then reexamined photo no one to see if the object was present there also.  I discovered the object, only this time appearing as a dark spot.  I then increased the resolution from 288 dpi to 1200 dpi and cropped the object.  I then increased the size 300 percent and was surprised to find what I did. The physical shape of the object appeared to change as well as did the color.  The photos were taken approximately 1.5 minutes apart. I am e-mailing both photos 1 and 2 as well as the enlarged cropped object image of both.<n>

About ten of my closest friends and my|12/14/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41012.html|128|ndxe199806| I just called a friend that also witnessed the UFO to verify the time. As for the sighting goes. About ten of my closest friends and myself were at my house having a barbecue. It was a summer night and hot down here in Brownsville, Texas around 9:30pm. Well we all had finished eating and were sitting around having a nice conversation when my friends girlfriend yells out, &#34;Hey, look, a shooting star&#34;. Everyone looked up to see what looked like a regular really bright star. This supposed star was traveling at a constant slow speed, in what looked to be an East to West direction. We all started talking about it and debating whether it was a falling star because it had no burn trail whatsoever. Still staring at this object, we all pretty much concluded that it must be a satellite because of the constant slow speed, perfectly straight flight path and never burnt out like a falling star usually does. A couple of friends got bored of seeing this object and looked down at each other to continue talking, while the rest and myself stayed staring at this thing. In one split fraction of a second this object Zoomed the opposite (180 deg.) direction from what now was a West to East direction at enormous length of space in just, like I said, A split second. We all were in awe. The ones that stayed staring including myself let out this &#34;Whoa&#34; sound grabbing the attention of the other friends that had turned away. Suddenly this &#34;star looking&#34; obect started making these incredibly, incredibly fast zig-ziag maneuvers. At this point, all ten witnesses were now watching. We all looked at each in amazement. I can not emphasize on how fast this object was. I&#39;m talk about 90 degree turns, among other angles, zig-zags and zooming the opposite directions in a fraction of a second then haulting at such abrupt stop. I still get excited right now just typing this out. It was such an amazing experience. Then all of a sudden this, now through our eyes we had labeled it a UFO, shot straight up towards space and disappeared. There is NO WAY! on earth a human can withstand such sonic speeds then coming to such abrupt stops...NO WAY! Just as soon as this UFO disappeared, it reaappeared at a different location of the sky. It started flying the different zig-zag patterns again, then shot back up then reappear. It continued this pattern for the length of which was fifteen minutes. You know, it was weird, but it was as if it knew that we were watching and was taunting us. It then shot again straight up toward space and never reappeared again. The best part of this entire experience is that we are very good friends and we all saw the UFO and there is no denying it. Oh.....one more thing. Two of my friends out of the group of ten that witnessed this UFO had the same experience a year before at another friend&#39;s outdoor wedding reception. The only thing that I regret was that were weren&#39;t prepared with a camera or video camera. That&#39;s ok though cause several of us saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although witness does not indicate that fact.

It was a little past midnight when we were sitting on our porche and we seen a bright light flashing so we looked up at the sky to see what was happening, and we seen a 3dementional diamond shaped craft it was turning round and round and shooting off diffrent colors, blue,purple red and orange, it was weird because we didn&#39;t see it appear and it stayed above us for at least ten minutes just spinning arround we just stared at it,we didnt even see it leave it was there than it was gone. I will never forget that momment it didnt even look like a craft really, besides the fact that it was spinning. I was 17yr.s old at the time he was 25yrs old at the time, we never thought we would ever encounter something like this before, we have never done drugs before, we both go to church and have a relationship with god, I work as a secretary for a big company and have never told anyone this before because I knew people would laugh, but I can tell you I wasn&#39;t laughing when I seen it I was scared because what if the ufo came down and captured us,I mean it stayed put it didnt seem like it was going any where it was like they were studing us or something,waiting for the right time to land,we were nervous to tell people as if they would know we did and come back to finish what ever it came here for,or maybe it just wanted to see our planet but how would we really know why so we kept it secret till now,so now you know and I will leave it at that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

6/8/98 21:00|Newport|RI|Light|25 minutes|Clear night+high visability,2  yellow lights,even shading,no vertical movement,close proximatey,very long visual time|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16356.html|133|ndxe199806| Clear night+high visability,2  yellow lights,even shading,no vertical movement,close proximatey,very long visual time<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my friend were taking a rest on one of the many boat piers in Newport, comming back from a bike ride around the scenic drive. Being an MP with the National Guard, I consider myself to be very attentive and aware of the unusual and out of the ordinary occurances within my view at all times. It was a very clear night, with light to no humidity, the moon was visable and 3/4 full. I noticed a semi-bright yellowish light hanging in the sky. It seemed to be stationary while comparing it with the moon which was about 3 feet away from the object.  We stared at it for quite sometime, about 25 to 30 minutes. During that time we noticed it move slowly to the left and remain stationary for a few minutes, then slowly to the right and remain stationary for a few minutes. It moved back and forth about 3 times, and on a straight horizontal path, no vertical movment at all. From my military experiance with roughly estimating distance to an object, I could tell it was no star, yet lower than an airplane would normaly be, and by movement, no airplane, helicopter or balloon of any type. And no known antenna towers in that direction of the Island. The low intensity and color of the light led me to beleive that it wasnt serving the purpose of a marker or for arial safty. The overall size of the light was about 3/8&#39;s of an inch when compared to my pinky finger at arms length.  For almost a two second time span, another light appeared to the left, as if it were turned up from a household dimmer switch, and was gone in an instant, the distance from the origonal light was roughly an inch, by perspective. My friend didnt notice the second light. The yellowish light was evenly illuminated, no bright or dim area, and no ring, or signs of any type of propulsion discharge or wake in its path. When I saw the second light come and go, I thaught they might be two baloonists and the second baloon was trying to gain altitude. Baloons are rare but not uncommon for the area. But the closeness of the two, and the consistent round ! shape an d duration of the second light ruled that out. After stareing at the unknown light for a while, and comming to no conclusions as of the source, other than that it wasnt going anywhere in a hurry, I told my friend of an occurance that happened many many years before, that involved the police from roughly 3 local countys giving pursuit of a slow moving object in the sky, which I beleive was first sighted and called in from a small single engine plane.  As for my background, I have four years of active military, and twelve years of National Guard, ten years as an MP with the Guard. For my friend of 4 years, he seems normal enough. We very seldom talk of UFO&#39;s or paranormal topics, as interesting as they may be. And as for the purpose of reporting this supposed sighting, I came across the web site while browsing and thaught that someone might find the information of use, or amusing.<n>

It was a full moon night and we watched as they flew over head. They were very high so we assumed either an airplane or satelite. The only problem is that they were in a course with the moon. They flew in to the path of the moon but never came out of the otherside. I was currently at this time enlisted whith the New York national guard. I was some what injured at the time and just wrote it off to being satelites, but now I am a little curious to what it might have been. I have no real proof other than a handful of soldiers and my-self were watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

Cornville is about 80 miles north of Phoenix, and 20 miles south of Sedona.There was a full moon that night, so the stars was hard to see, but not this object.It appeared to be very close about thirty to sixty miles away. It was very bright like a meteor but 500 hundred times brighter and closer. Even considering it was a full moon.When it descended below the tree line I lost sight of the object. One second later it then appeared to hit the earth.  At the time of impact there were two bright burst of light, from what appeared to be the point of impact. No sound was heard. It was Truly Breathtaking.  I have not heared any news reports about the incident.<n>

These sparks were at first white, but then quickly dulled to orange.  Met a neighbor about two or three minutes later, who also saw the bright flash, and asked us if we had seen it.

Hay algo en particular en esto, cuando uno de los Objetos Acelero, se oyó un estruendo como un trueno, el carro volvio a encenderse y la radio comenzo a sonar sin ningun problema.

Living in a small canyon about five miles from and just out of sight of the Pacific coast, it wasn’t uncommon to see small planes flying over about five hundred feet up.  They were visible for about ten to fifteen seconds.  But without a sound this time, a flaming crop-duster appeared from over the ridge tumbling end over end about a second a turn toward the setting sun.  I called to my mother, &#34;Look out of you front sliding glass door, Mamma!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was too old &amp; slow to see it while I described to her.  Before the object disappeared over the hill I saw the flames flicker out, but with the setting sun shining on it, very visibly was a huge coal black potato shaped, eyes and all, rock still tumbling at the same rate until it faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should’ve turned it in then, but better late than never.

I was looking at a large cloud formation that was pouring out an unbelievable amount of rain. While looking, a shiny object caught my eye. It was just at cloud level. It was V shape in formation, pointing west. It was made up of 7 silver balls. It passed in and out of the clouds, and finally dissappeared in them. At first I thought the formation could have been balloons because of its low elevation. However, the object never changed shape. The object was just at the bottom level of the clouds. It would pass through lower parts of the clouds, and then re-imerge. It was very windy that day. Extremely windy, however, the bject never deviated from its straight course. Sorry, I had no camera at the time, nor a camcorder. My wife and I live in Quincy, CA. About 75 miles from Reno. We were going for a few hours to shop. I work at the saw mill, and she works for Safeway. Also, my mother and father were watching KCRA news on Channel 3. The luive &#34;sky cam&#34; was overlooking Sacramento on 06/04/98 at 12:20pm. Both of the also saw balls of lights in the clouds. They saw 2 sets of 2 balls emerge from the clouds together. They also saw a formation that appeared as the Big Dipper appears in the sky. Although they do have a VCR, the &#34;sky cam&#34; shots over Sacramento are very brief, allowing them to only observe the event. Haime Maussan has video of balls of light coming out of heavy cloud cover over Mexico City, some of them observing the planes closely. What are these things doing in the clouds? Thanks.<n>

I turned and directly overhead was a bright white circle of light about 20 yards across. It had a faint red halo around it, outside of which the white light was dimmer. The object had a tail. The tail was a deep blue. Within it were diamond aquamarine shapes which fluctuated in color and position. There had been clouds in the sky prior to the event. The sky was completely clear. There was a noisy fountain behind us. Throughout the entire event we heard nothing. All sound stopped. The obeject slowly flew over us about 500 feet up in relation to tree tops. Both myself and the witness felt completely at peace. We both had an out of body experience. As it flew over the object stayed a perfect circle. It did not elipse. In total the event seemed to take about five minutes. Later we discovered it had been about 20 minutes. The object came to the tree line and disapeared. It never sped up. We rushed to look around the trees and saw nothing. It was gone instantaneously. It wasn&#39;t as if the light had blinked out. It was simply no longer there.We rushed inside to tell two other friends. They did not witness the light. They came outside with us and we all looked around. The four of us saw two planes flying by. There are no commercial flight paths over this area. We had all worked and lived in the area for at least two years and know the skies pretty well from being outdoors so much. The whole experience felt very peaceful during but afterward both my friend and I were terrified of seeing it alone. Myself and my friend are both 22 years old and college students.<n>
6/5/98 22:05|Kelowna (Canada)|BC|Triangle|22:10|Triangular object seen at night at close range flying over Kelowna British Columbia Canada|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71788.html|156|ndxe199806| Triangular object seen at night at close range flying over Kelowna British Columbia Canada<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear Spring evening in Kelowna.  Myself and two other house mates were outside enjoying the view of the sky.  The sky was partially cloudy but quite bright due to the presence of the moon which was slightly bigger than half full.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:05 P.M., our attention was drawn to a high flying jet aircraft travelling from west to east.  It was low enough for us to hear the faint roar of the engines.  I lowered my gaze and noticed a dark shape with lights drop from the sky approximately 5-8 miles south of our position over Okanagan Mountain Park.  It began to move slowly over the park in an east to west direction. I alerted the rest of the group and they all turned their attention to this object.  As it reached the outskirts of the city it changed direction and started to move south to north, towards us.  At first we thought it might be an aircraft except for the fact that most aircraft in the area fly an east west route.  Kelowna has a relatively busy airport and we were used to oberving aircraft arrivals and departures.  I was formerly employed as a Ground Specialist at the Ottawa International Airport and was familiar with most aircraft including those at air shows.  This was something I&#39;d never seen b! efore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We first observed the object as a dark triangular shape silhouetted against the bright night sky.  We could not hear any noise from the object as it proceeded slowly towards our position.  A soft white glow emanated from what appeared to be 3 portholes, one at each corner of the underside of the object.  The colour was flat black.  The size was equal to that of a 737 jet aircraft viewed from 500 to 700 feet away at it&#39;s closest point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object approached a position to the west of us it seemed to change its course slightly to the east for 5 to 10 seconds then turned back to its original course.  At this point its apparent size was that of a football held at arm&#39;s length.  The object proceeded north and gained in altitude as it approached the western spur of Knox Mountain (where the mountain meets the lake) and passed over and out of sight.  The entire sighting lasted approximately five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We don&#39;t know what it was but we are absolutely certain that it was not a conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later, after I&#39;d moved and gotten married, I mentioned the incident to a neighbor of mine.  He said he had a friend who lived a block to the west of our original sighting position who saw a large triangular shaped object fly right over his house.  I asked my neighbor to speak with his friend and enquire about the date and time.  He did, and though he was not sure of the exact date, the time was right and it was early June 1998.  Other than that he really didn&#39;t want to speak about it because as my neighbor put it, &#34;it spooked him&#34;.  He never reported the incident.<n>

Make me a believer in the u.f.o. phenomenon. A disk like object appeared hovering above the tree line outside my window. As it hovered above the trees there was a series of red lights circulating around the lower portion of the object.The top of the craft, I really couldn&#39;t make out that well being that there was a white hazy glow above the red lights. Below that there seemed to be 2 white lights blinking on and off. At first i thought it was a plane but after watching it descend lower and to my right, I realized it was not possible movement for an airplane. All of a sudden it instantly turned into a very bright red dot, something along the lines of a laser pen. It quickly made a figure 8-like shape before turnig back into the disk-like shape and slowly made its&#39; way below the tree line. Upon waking up the next morning, to my surprise i had found out that there was a problem with Airforce 1 not being picked up on radar approx. near the vicinity of LaGuardia Airport. This experience has definately made me a believer and will always feel close to the&#34;other&#34; side. I am a 22 year old male from Northern New Jersey.<n>

( Hwy 98 ) , I pulled over at the cable company by the big Christian Church . It was about 10:30 p.m. I noticed something moving towards the East in the sky .  I thought with tourist season in effect that it was a helicoptor but it was strange to see one at night and at back beach road . As it got closer , I noticed it was not a helicoptor , I had no clue what it was . It was dark in color , almost transparent with the exception of 3 reddish lights , one on each corner but very dim . It was about 100-150 feet above the ground , and not a sound what so ever . Several vehicles pulled over to witness this , I had a disposible camera and took the whole roll full of pictures , but all I got was black pictures back when they were developed . No TV news reported it , I called the police and was told several calls had come in but no one knew what this was . To this day it still baffles me . This thing was huge .<n>

We stopped to drink some water and eat some snacks.  My friend Jo-Jo sudenly told me &#34; What the hell is that?&#34; Jo-J0, I , and 1 other  looked into the sky and observed 7 medium sized triangles glowing in the air, motionless.  At first, we thought they might have been stealth bombers, but they were much larger, and had an ominous glow.  For 5 minutes, they sat there.  After  five minutes , the crafts darted into the sky, and made 3 vast loops through the air.  The crafts were suprisingly low.  We took cover, and were scared of being detected.  We had never seen anything like this before.  After the three loops, the crafts stayed again motionless for another 3 or so minutes, and then they were gone.<n>

The aircraft followed us aprox. 1 mile then flew away very fast. We pulled of on a side road for about 5 min. When we gathered enough currage we begane to drive back to my house. On our way still shaken up I noticed a bright light small enough to be a big star. Within 30 seconds it was hovering right above us. The craft wasn&#39;t so bright when it was directly above us and I could see the siloette of it. It was oval with sort of a buble in the center. The monuverability of this aircraft was unlike any thing I&#39;ve ever seen it was as if it changed it&#39;s whole appeance. The craft then flew towards the south at a quick speed.

I looked to the left and saw over the trees and fields about 500 feet off the ground a strange craft, tranglular shaped object moving about 20 MPH. The object was about 300 feet across! It had a series of about 6 lights on the underside which was circular around a dome on the underside. These lights were shooting a beam in the direction of the crafts movement. In the center of these lights was a red light blinking or pulsating. I turned and followed the craft towards my home. I got to my home on the lake and jumped out of my car, my son was in the back yard, he was watching the craft also. We watched the craft go acrosss Lake Weir in the direction of Cocoa Beach FL. The craft made no noise, continued about the same speed.<n>

Somehow I was removed from my seatbelt and through a broken car window and placed some way away from the almost squashed car[ a Mercedes[. My flaskbacks are of being carried to that spot by a creature I would say was not from Earth, there was telepathic communication and a great feeling of compassion from the creature. There was also something else that I will not post here as I believe it is an important indicator as to when there are other creatures like this around.The dreams that followed the incident were very vivid and some sleep walking took place although it felt more like some type of hypnosis as I was aware it was happening but could,nt stop it. I saw other creatures on another occassion on one of these sleep walking incidents. They always communicate telepathically. Has anyone else had an experince like this? It,s slightly strange to feel watched like a goldfish constantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request a copy of the accident report.  If the report alludes to skid marks, etc., we feel that alien involvement in this one would be difficult to prove.  We will inquire of the witness whether an investigation ensued.  PD))<n>

I’ve never really been compelled to write or talk to anyone about it, since nobody else saw it, nor would they take it for truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn’t have any fancy lights, no sounds, and nothing was really extraordinary about it.  I’ve read a lot of reports of sightings and seen a lot of videos of people who have apparently filmed UFOs, and they all seem really exciting.  My sighting wasn’t very spectacular, but nonetheless, I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 15 years old at the time, and we were on our way home, heading west from Havre, MT.  We were driving in an extended cab pickup on US Hwy 2.  It was a wonderful summer night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t remember the exact date, but I do remember it was during the summertime.  It was warm outside and the stars were all shining brightly, but unfortunately there was no moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in the backseat with my mom (whom was sleeping), and my sister and brother in law were up front; my brother in law doing the driving.  Everyone was quiet and we were listening to the radio, but I’m not sure what was playing at the time<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point, I had gotten tired of watching the boring road ahead of us and decided to look out the back window at the stars.  The stars were really bright, since we were in the middle of nowhere and it was such a clear night anyway.  We had just passed Joplin, MT and it was about 10pm or so when I saw it.  It was moving slowly about 20 feet from the ground and on an interception course with our pickup.  It was heading SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were traveling there was a light nearby next to a radio tower and between us and the tower, the UFO moved past the tower, becoming invisible as it passed by the light.  It made its way, silently, across the highway behind us.  I could barely make out what it looked like.  It was definitely pyramidal in shape, as I could see it from the side.  It looked black in the night sky, but when it passed the light, it was invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it, it seemed like my eyes were playing tricks on me, until it passed across the road.  It happened so fast, I didn’t even know what I saw until after it had disappeared into the night.  None of my family believed me!  That partly discouraged me from telling anyone else.  The duration of the sighting also discouraged me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said, it was completely silent, nearly invisible, flying slowly (same speed as we were driving), partly moving in tune with our direction, keeping up with our vehicle for a short time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw anything like it again, but wished I had.  Ever since that sighting, I have been interested in other people’s UFO sightings.  Unfortunately, I haven’t seen many convincing videos or convincing stories.  I’m sure a lot of people make up sightings for fun, however, I know what I saw, and it is the truth.<n>

Without a doubt they were there, and I experienced them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that however is just an empty space, no memory of what happened afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now for the strange part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was this woman who had recently moved into this house bus next to ours with her abusive boyfriend, we all sort of became friends and years later still are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a couple of years ago she lived with us for a while (me and my family had moved to the city into a house) and we got talking about ufo&#39;s and things like that as we were both interested in that sort of stuff, and she told me about a night in Waitati, in the house bus, where she was visited by an alien who she described as the usual big eyes, grey skin, so on so forth...<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial thought was &#34;mhmm, doesn&#39;t sounds very realistic,&#34; but then I remembered that night with the lights and the sounds, and I told her about that and she said that is exactly what she saw and heard from inside her bus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And that is pretty much it, it sounds completely unrealistic, but I at least know for myself that that is what I saw (I didn&#39;t see aliens or anything), and now I&#39;m just hoping for some kind of answer oneday.<n>

Totally clear, starry sky.  Of course, I&#39;m not looking at the sky, I&#39;m looking at my wife&#39;s bikini top.  But she&#39;s looking at the sky (damn you, pot belly!), and she says, &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;  We both look up, and there&#39;s this triangle shape obscuring the stars.   It&#39;s totally black, slowly moving from east to west, silently.  That&#39;s the thing I remember most, the silence.  Our neighborhood is very quiet, so any aircraft passing overhead is always audible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In retrospect, I wish I had grabbed a camera, but this was when 1-megapixel digital cameras were state of the art and didn&#39;t come with shutter speeds, plus I was wet.  So we just watched this triangle mask the stars as it slowly cruised overhead.   From our view, the size was like if you put both your forefingers and thumbs together in the shape of a triangle and held your arms out.  There were no lights at all.  I have waited over 10 years to tell this story, and I present it here as fact witnessed by my own eyes.  I wasn&#39;t beamed up by a UFO with multicolored Christmas lights.  I saw a black triangle obscuring the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

My friend had come for a visit to Salt Lake and my boyfriend and I wanted to take him to a casino out in Wendover, NV (appox 120 miles west of Salt Lake). IT was a dark night with a semi full moon in the south east sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WE passed the Aroginite Exit on I-80 and we saw lights in the distance coming towards us. Same side of the freeway as the moon. As we got closer we all started making comments, like &#34;What the heck is that&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was huge and dark, but had 3 very big bright white lights on the front that went on and off. The lights where in a row, spaced apart pretty far. The 2 at each end would go on for a few secs then the middle one would come on. It was so weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend wanted to pull over and take a look at it.  Me and my friend said do not stop the car. We were very freaked out.  Other people on the freeway, I know, saw what we saw. There were truck drivers and everything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend was in the back seat and had the window down as we passed.  He said it was the shape of a triangle.  Whatever it was it was huge and kinda flat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forgot the lights and how they turned on and off in a strange sequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

6/1/98 21:30|Mt. Airy|NC|Light|1 hour|We where at a drive in movie, it was my family and my fiance.  My mother first noted the objects.  Due to her recent outpatient surgery|8/10/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08481.html|178|ndxe199806| We where at a drive in movie, it was my family and my fiance.  My mother first noted the objects.  Due to her recent outpatient surgery and her consumption of pain medication we ignored her when she first told us about the lights.  About ten minutes into the first movie I noticed small lights maneuvering strangely in the sky.  I quickly asked everyone else if they saw it too. To my astonishment they had been watching it for a while.  The objects where very fast and made pinpoint turns. Sometimes they flew in formations, sometimes they flew irradically.  They almost seemed to be chacing each other sometimes. Then other times they would be completely stationary.  They looked almost like fireflies.  Thats what I dismissed them as at first.  But then when a small cloud flew over i noticed that they where far above it. They seemed to be in space. I think this because at times they would fly in a large circle moving away from me and then back towards me.  When they flew to the backside of the circle they would dissapear, then a second later they would reapear on the opposite side.  Finally after about an hour of these acrobatics another craft appeared.  It was the same as the others and it approached them from the center of the sky.  When it came close to them they all stopped moving.  They remained motionless untill the other craft joined them. Then one by one they quickly streeked out of sight.<n>

During the Halftime Home coming events on the field I witnessed a 2 foot diameter orb traveling horizontally from north to south over the field.  The object was not like the 2 dimensional translucent orbs seen in most pictures after development.  This object was a solid 3d Sphere, not a light.  Its color was a bluish green.  It was traveling between 80 and 100 mph. The entire sighting lasted a little over 2 seconds. It traveled over the eastern hatch marks on the field and was slightly lower than the Field Lights. Nearly ever person was focused on the Homecoming court down on the field. Upon seeing the orb I immediately notified my friends. Two of the three were able to see the orb before it rapidly faded out of site. The object had very sharp defining edges no blurs or fuzziness, the inside seemed to be made of plasma, it was not extremely bright and flew in a perfectly strait and flat trajectory. The most interesting part of the story came later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day upon seeing my neighbor in his yard I related the events of the previous night. To my shock he had a story of his own. He told me on the night in question at app. 1:30am He and his wife was up late watching TV, when all of a sudden he had an urge to get up and walk outside. He claims he had not heard or seen anything to make him go out. As he proceeded outside his wife also followed suit. They were both drawn to look westward towards my house.  An oak tree stood just south of the southwest corner of my house. Upon first looking toward the southwest corner of my house they saw nothing, then a small solid orb about 1-1/2 to 2 feet in diameter came floating out from either my bedroom wall or behind the west wall of my house.  The orb floated up into the oak tree maneuvering around the large branches.  After a few seconds the orb floated clear of the tree then stopped perfectly still app. 35 feet off the ground as if to let them get a good look at it. Then all at once it flew upward and away in a southwest direction at a very high rate of speed until it could no longer be seen. I asked the wife if she had got up to follow the husband outside, and she said No, she had been drawn by a mysterious urge of go outside also. These are professional college educated people. The only discrepancy between their two stories was the color of the orb. He said it was bluish, she said it was greenish. I saw it as blue green. The orb made no sound and left no visible trail. There is nothing openly known in the industrial or military complex that can fly with no open ports or wings that we currently know of. The orb is particularly similar to the orb recorded on NASA TV  STS Mission 37. Only the color is different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The individuals kept these sightings silent so as not to create a &#34;hot spot&#34;until they could verify that it was not military and obtain photographs and contact if possiable. These individuals invested in some low tech equipment and were able to get the craft/crafts to respond to signal. The individuals are a former police dispatcher, an airline mechanic, a former private investigator and a CNA.It is not until now that they have chosen to make the location of sightings to your center. Currently details of their sightings including times,location,and response from local military bases and FAA will be posted on a web site 24 hours from the sending of this report,whose address is http://www.((URL deleted)) Currently they are conducting their own investigation. Several astronomy individuals have also sighted objects. These four feel that simply reporting a sighting or even getting video tape is not enough to change the proof already offered in large volume. Therefor, their goal is not neccarilly to photograph but to contact and or signal the craft. They have been successful with signaling the craft on two seperate occassions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday a report was sent to you concerning Lake Wales Florida. We did not give you the correct web address for a database of these sightings. the correct address is http://www.((address deleted)).html This is where the four investigators in central Florida after remaining non public for almost a year have put their findings , sightings on the net.

Driving east on highway 70 in O&#39;Fallon area, just east of Hwy 40.  Suddenly, we hear low hummings, like many aircraft.  Looking out the cars front window, at first glance, looked like helicoptors or F fighters in escort - but in a wide V formation?<n> <n><n> <n><n> We rolled down the windows.  Husband began to drive very slowly in the emergency lane.  I looked out my side window and saw many aircraft with flashing lights, both jets and helicopters in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed a section of the sky a dull black .. and that it was moving slowly.  And it was what the &#34;escort&#34; aircraft were surrounding!   All aircraft involved could not have been more than half a mile up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could determine which were helicopters &amp; which were jets, if that is a judge of how far up they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All in all, the entire &#34;V formation&#34; (aircraft + BT) covered both east &amp; west bound lanes of the highway equally 8 lanes plus emergency lanes.  This was not a small sized event!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well we could not believe our eyes!   What was this huge dark triangle that was so black, no emissions, no sound, no color, flew so slow and low to the ground?  It kept a straight and even paced course.  My first thought was &#34;oh my word, not only is Boeing near, Scott AFB is not that far either.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband got a bit ahead under it and I looked more and more closer and noticed that it was flat and triangular.  No reflections under, etc. What appeared to be lights on its side, were indeed the aircraft surrounding it.  It was thee strangest thing I ever seen.  And ominous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15 minutes my husband pulled over to the side of the road.  We got out of the car and watched it move slowly away over highway 70.  I remember thinking &#34;why do not more people pull over and watch this?&#34;  But my eyes were more glued to the skies than worried to see just who was or not pulled over to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the dark triangle &amp; escort fly off east, following highway 70s course, (geesh how blatant I kept thinking), I remember noticing that it appeared rather &#34;thin&#34; in thickness ... which added more to the whole bizarreness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I barely remember getting into the car.  And I do not recall the drive home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: when the object was directly over us I felt sick to my stomache.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

After probably a couple of minutes, of both trying to think whay they could be, but failing, the middle of the three suddenly vanished; then one by one the other two did the same.

As we stood looking I said to my Son no one will believe me and he said &#34;I know&#34; just as we said that the thing just took off fast and vanished right before our eyes. My Son has graduated form college now and everytime he comes to visit me, I asked him did you remember the thing we saw in the sky and he said &#34;yes, but we can&#39;t tell anyone no one will beleive us&#34;.  I held it for nine years and when I saw the story on Weird Travel I said to myself I need to tell my story, I did and now I feel better about it, although I know no one will believe me. Since I could on put one sighting on this page, I did the one that bother me the most.

A black non-reflective object floated up out of the base of another mountain north of my position about a mile away from me.  The object was diamond shaped as it floated up slowly rotating and hovered above the tree line.  As the diamond object hovered, rotating slowly, it began to change its shape into different geometrical shapes very fast ending into a multi-pointed star.  Like a christmas tree star.  Then slowly rotating, the object floated back down into the trees, disappearing.  It never changed color, remaiming black and I couldn&#39;t see any reflections at any time.  It seemed to soak up light which made it seem blacker than black.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving about 2 miles north of Addy, a quarter mile north of south McClain road. The highway in this area is straight with a slight grade north, to the west is approximately a mile of open farmland, to the east a hill that abuts the McClain farmhouse, and small hills to the east and north of the farm. The sun had gone behind the hill to the west a few minutes before, the sky was clear and headlights were unnecessary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove north I noticed two parallel lights approximately a quarter mile ahead, at perhaps 300 feet elevation. The lights were extremely bright, the brightest white light I had ever seen, with a slight blue tint-they looked exactly like halogens, though I had never seen a halogen at that time. They appeared to be separated by a hundred feet or so, but traveled exactly level in elevation and distance from one another. If you put a light on each wingtip of a jumbo jet, then erased the jet, this is how they appeared. They were about 6 times larger than lights you see on plane wings, more the size of round headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw happened quickly. I noticed them first about a quarter mile to the left of the highway, they were moving extremely quickly, faster than a jet, yet slower than a meteorite. They flew exactly eastward and then turned a 90 degree angle north without losing speed. Everyone on the highway slammed on their brakes when this happened, so there were other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened approximately 60 miles north of Fairchild Airforce Base. I assumed it was a military excursion with a new secret weapon or aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

So it is slowely and silently hovering past us, and shining it&#39;s spotlight all over the place as if searching for something, and even shines it&#39;s spotlight on us! then i found out later on by ufo telvisions specials that this same craft same shape and silence, is spotted in other places. then just about a week ago i decided to look up ufos on the internet, when i discover that this same ship with consitant features; looks, silence and ability to move slow.has been seen many times in many parts of the world and there are even website sections about that. then last but not least, i bring up topic ufos with a friend of mine at work, and he said he had a ufo encounter, but he wanted to hear mine. so i told him, and he was astonished and said that was exactly like his ufo encounter back in 1979! amazing some people claims it goes fast, changes shape, move back and fowarth rapidly. It didn&#39;t do any of that for me, just quite and slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1998 is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was just outside Ellensburg and estimate when I first spotted it, it was near Cle Elum heading toward me.  I counting immediately and got to eight when it was gone over the Columbia Basin past Vantage.  I estimate the distance I watched it travel to be at least 25 miles approaching and 25 miles going away from me.  It had no tail, just a very bright white light and totally silent.  It passed by me just a little to the north and east of where I was standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a passenger in small planes on several occasions here and live near the airport so have witnessed countless small planes over the years and know how to approximate their altitude.

We were the only witnesses as far as we know to see three small bright lights and one huge &#34;mother ship&#34; object--we knew what we were seeing was not normal, and it kept us in awe for it&#39;s entirety.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a very clear, dark night, while mending a horse fence, my roomate and I had our attention actually taken off our job at hand, as we both focused on and witnessed the same event together as a pair, but individually as spectators.  It was quite apparent that these bright, round, lights hovering in the southeast on the horizon (we were looking North) were different from anything we had ever seen before, and we immediately knew what we were watching was paranormal.  Three bright, non-flashing, hovering lights that stayed in a tight formation non-moving for approx 5 minutes, which then took off in a tight formation at a high rate of speed in one direction, and then another, always staying together in a tight unit.  Then after approx 10 minutes had passed, they zipped along VERY fast as if &#34;done&#34; with their task, in a straight line to the West, and Many miles across the horizon, shrouded in what looked like fog, they actually met up with a HUGE sphere-shaped object which we only noticed upon their arrival to it, because it seemed to turn on &#34;headlights&#34; in order to travel onward into the West.  This HUGE object seemed to &#34;take in&#34; the three bright objects immediately, and started moving at a slower, more lumbered speed and was so big and had so many spot type lights, that it lit up the fog enshrouding it in such a large area around it, that you could tell approximately how large it was, and how slow it moved compared to these tiny lights.  I will never forget it.<n>

I suppose it was a grand opening of some sort.  I turned around to look at them and noticed that there were several lights inside the beam. I thought to myself that they looked like bugs swarming around a flashlight beam.  It surprised me when the spotlight left them-they were still there! Only now we could tell that the objects were far away in the sky and were moving as if in a dog fight or something. They moved quickly in all directions.  After about 40 seconds they disappeared.<n>

I was sixteen at the time. My 2 younger sisters and I were sleeping on our large outside trampoline. Bakersfield gets very warm during the summer time. I would always stare up at the stars hoping to see shooting stars or more, I was an avid Art Bell listener at the time. All of a sudden I saw the stars being masked by something very large. It was very slow moving and made no sounds. There was no lights on this object. I was in awe at how big it was. It was kind of hard to stay focused on it because it blended in with the sky so well. I am not sure how far up it was but it looked pretty low. About a minute passed and it moved over the trees of my backyard and I could no longer see it. I am 22 now and just learning of other people who have seen a similar object. I am excited that I get to post this sighting after 7 years of telling my friends and family of this odd happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I had been asleep in my bedroom, at about one am.  My mother ran into my room, wrapped in a sheet.  She woke me up and insisted I follow her outside onto our wrap around deck.  As we walked outside, she pointed up.  To my amazement, I saw a circular craft, with lights around the circumference.  The lights were bright, and varied in color.  The craft was flying very low to the ground, just above our heads.  My mother seemed to be more in shock that I was.  I had always believed in such things, but she was more of a skeptic.  The craft hovered over our heads, and slowly began to move forward.  My mother jumped off the porch, and ran after the craft.  She ran the entire 3 acres, until she reached the road.  The craft then shot straight up, and disapeared.  I will never forget this sighting.  The next day, after talking with our neighbors, we realized that they too, on different occasions, had witnessed similar events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1998 may be approximate.

At the small farm house I grew up in outside of town.  Everything was quiet, we heard no noise that was unusual.  My dog who was near and was a good watch dog never barked.  My friend and I turned around and looked up above the house.  There was a very large saucer shaped craft hovering above the house.  It was making no sound and was still.  We both saw it and saw it emitting bright orange and red lights.  We screamed and ran and saw it shoot off into the sky making no noise.  On a separate occasion at this same house I stepped out the back door during the day.  I saw a silver saucer shaped craft hovering still and soundless above the tree where my dog was tied out.  The dog did not react.  As soon as I looked at craft it darted off soundlessly.  I noticed no lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

THERE WERE 5 EXCEEDINGLY BRIGHT LARGE LIGHTS AT VERIOUS PARTS OF THE NORTHERN, EASTERN, AND SOUTHERN SKY.  I FINALLY WENT OUTSIDE TO LOOK FOR MYSELF--THE ONE LIGHT WAS STILL SHINING THROUGH MY WINDOW WITH GREAT INTENSITY--WE WERE BOTH EASILY ABLE TO SEE THESE LARGE, VERY CLEAR AND DISTINCT LIGHTS WITHOUT OUR CONTACT LENSES.

I observed the object for 3-4 minutes then 2 military aircraft flying in side by side order straight toward the object. the object then disappeared. Also in June i observed a very bright light in the eastern sky . It was 5 am and it was not venus. The light was huge and it would contract and expand. I observed this for 5-7 minutes. It finally seemed to implode in on itself and became a small point of bright light then dissapeared.<n>
