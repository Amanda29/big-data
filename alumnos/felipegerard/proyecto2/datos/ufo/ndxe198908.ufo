THE OBJECT CONTINUED FLYING TOWARDS US AND STOPPED ABOUT 15 FEET DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF US, HOVERING OVER THE WATER AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 10 FEET. I COULD NOW SEE IT MUCH CLEARER. THE OBJECT WAS IN THE SHAPE OF A TEARDROP SLIGHTLY FLATTENED. SILVER IN COLOR WITH NO IDENTIFIEABLE MARKINGS. IT MEASURED APPROXIMATELY 7 FEET LONG, 18 INCHES HIGH AND ABOUT 3 FEET WIDE ALL MEASUREMENTS COMING TO A TAPERED TIP WHICH I BELIEVED TO BE THE TAIL OF THIS CRAFT. IT HOVERED FOR A FEW SECONDS THEN IT, QUITE EFFORTLESSLY, WHILE REMAINING IN ITS&#39; PRESENT POSITION, IT TURNED RIGHT FACING NORTH THEN IT TURNED LEFT FACING SOUTH. AFTER A FEW MORE SECONDS IT LOWERED ITSELF TO ABOUT 6 TO 12 INCHES OVER THE WATER AND REMAINED THERE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. I FIND IT QUITE INTERESTING THAT WHILE IT HOVERED AND EXECUTED THESE FEW MANEUVERS  I COULDN&#39;T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT IT: 1.HAD NO PITCH AND YAW, 2. HAD NO VISIBLE  HEAT SIGNATURE, 3. IT HAD NO RIVETS OR WELD SEAMS TO SHOW HOW IT HAD BEEN PUT TOGETHER,AND 4. THERE WAS NO DISPERSAL OF THE WATER AS THIS CRAFT HOVERED DIRECTLY OVER IT, AND 5. THAT THE TWO BRIGHT LIGHTS THAT I SAW I BELIEVED THEM TO BE ITS&#39; PROPULSION SYSTEM BUT INSTEAD OF PUSHING THE CRAFT IT APPEARED TO BE PULLING THE CRAFT. AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES OF JUST HOVERING ABOVE THE WATER THE CRAFT RAISED ITSELF TO ABOUT 3 FEET ABOVE THE WATER AND PROCEEDED SOUTH OUT TO SEA. AS IT WAS OUTBOUND IT STOPPED AND SLOWLY STARTED TO RISE AS IT WAS RISING I NOTICED THE SUNSET CRUISE BOAT WAS OUTBOUND IN THE CHANNEL. IT WAS AS IF THIS OBJECT KNEW THAT TO CONTINUE ON ITS&#39; PRESENT! COURSE THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY THE SHIP. THE SHIP PASSED UNDERNEATH THE OBJECT WHICH WAS NOW AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 200 FEET AND CONTINUED OUTBOUND UNTIL I LOST IT IN THE DISTANCE. ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER A STORY APPEARED IN THE KEY WEST CITIZEN OF A MASS SIGHTING OF A UFO THAT HOVERED OUTSIDE OF THE SEATTLE SPACE NEEDLE. AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING I WAS ASSIGNED TO THE HYDRAFOIL USS PEGASUS (PHM-1) STATIONED AT KEY WEST FLORIDA. AND AS AN OPERATION SPECIALIST (RADAR OPERATOR) I WAS TRAINED, BY THE US NAVY, IN LOOKOUT AND REPORTING PROCEDURES WITH EMPHASIS ON ATTENTION TO DETAIL. DATES LISTED ABOVE ARE APPROXIMATE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and he seems credible and serious-minded to us.  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

All lights went out, the radio, all electrical equipment, while the engine kept running.  I got out of the vehicle to see what was wrong and heard a loud humming.  I could not see anything even though it was a clear night.  The trees and a nearby water tower blocked the view that I thought was near the sound I heard.  This was a realtively new vehicle at the time and had never experienced any electrical problems whatsoever.  It never experienced any electrical problems after the incidents.  While I am not certain it was connected to a UFO sighting, I had heard of vehicles that had experienced UFO&#39;s with the same type of symptons.  I am interested if any other folks have experienced similar incidents. I will never forget the erie feeling that I had, especially after it happend three times in a row in the exact same place at about the exact time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After my first encounter with the incident I made it a point to drive slowly through the same area during the next htree evenings thinking that something might be wrong with my vehicle.  Nothing was wrong with my vehicle. I had it checked out the following day after the first incident and the electrician said he couldnt find anything wrong with it.<n>

Stationary for 2 hrs. plus, highly visible, eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is in response to a query 1/18/05 about a bright&#34;flashlite&#34; type light in the sky, which remained for duration of two hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occured in Aug.1989, about the 20th+ or -.  Was with a disabled friend in an East-facing enclosed porch with a very large glass wall/ window.  Bright sunlight.  A very bright occasionally flashing object suddenly appeared in the Southeast at about 70 degrees above the horizon-- it was larger than a dot-- about the size of a pea held at arm&#39;s length.  It remained clearly there for about 2 1/2 hours, and was stationary.  It brightened and dimmed periodically, then suddenly blinked out.  Never saw it again.  Because of the date, and the memorable sighting of the object/light-- when I read the GA report-- I found a remarkable connection/coincidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is cow country, quite rural and remote, especially back then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were four of us, but the other two were sleeping.  It was a cloudless August night.  We were enjoying some the stars (and his Dad’s beer we stole) before bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were facing south toward the Gulf which is an hour’s drive from there.  I noticed an airplane drifting from Houston (west) toward Beaumont (east).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember saying something like “that must be a military jet; it’s way up there.”  It was perfectly silent, so that made initial sense.  This area is a flight path for the Houston airports; we grew up there.  We knew what commercial jets looked like at night—and you can definitely always hear them, especially in the still of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My buddy said something like “it can’t be an airplane, that thing might not even be in the atmosphere it’s so high.”  It’s moving way to fast to be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suggested it must be a satellite reflecting the sun to us, but I had never seen one before.  So we’re trading ideas of what we’re looking at.  It appeared to be no lower than our upper atmosphere, but probably under the satellites.  Remember, back then there weren’t many satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe it was 45 to 60 seconds of watching.  Then it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing did something that was simply impossible.  It bounced up and down like a graph of a Cosmic Ray; high peak to trough in a relatively short space.  In about 1 to 1.5 seconds it must of oscillated 8 to 10 times.  Then it shot back in mostly the same direction it came from, maybe at a 30 degree angle over where it just came from (the west).  The problem is, it went from a nice slow visual pace to something near the speed of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the moment it quit proceeding to the East, it only took about 0.5 seconds for this thing to cover (I swear we’re not crazy) many thousands of miles.  It appeared to be many, a great many, diameters of the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had what I’m sure is a normal reaction to this; we both shouted at the same time “Did you see that S---T?!?!?” That woke up the other two.  They were upset and accused us of being drunk.  We had each had maybe 6 beers.  We were weekend drinkers, so not really drunk yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other two stuck their heads out of the tent, but weren’t interested in “our prank” until morning.  They never believed us, and I don’t blame them.  We did get very drunk after that and stayed up almost till daylight trading ideas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since what we saw was impossible, we settled on this explanation:  We were watching a satellite that just happened to quit reflecting sun light at the exact moment a meteor just happened to flam up and streak the other way.  A handy description I’ve used is that it moved like the Star Ship Enterprise gunning it for “warp 9.”  The bouncing around we dismissed as the initial explosion of the falling star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a very brief trail, but never since (I’m 40 now) have I seen a falling star like that.  He and I started hunting at about 10-12 years old.  We had spent many and hour watching stars and falling stars waiting for the sun to rise.  Plus we loved to go camping.  We each must of seen 100 falling stars by the age of 16.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My subconscious new it wasn’t a falling star, but my conscious mind prevailed and I remained a non-believer for 24 more years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I realized that someone video-taped something 98% similar (I never watch UFO stuff) I went into a light case of shock as my mind considered the ramifications.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve picked up quite a bit of physics and theoretical physics since 16.  My guess is this thing wasn’t from outer space, it came from hyperspace (5 or more dimensions).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went from making fun of guys like you to instant belief.  Sorry I’m a quarter of a century late with this one LOL.  I hope this helps someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dan  P.S. I’m holding off until my Christmas visit back home to show Don the video-got to see his reaction in person!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We&#39;d come back to my home to call it a evening and was sitting in the car in the drive. I knew the area well as I&#39;d grown up in the same home. An empty field about 1 acre size joined our yard and at the S.E. corner was a huge cottonwood tree guessing around 80 - 100 years old ( a big tree) and just above the tree was a florecent (glowing) orange light the shape of a door. We could not see any beam, it was as though it was the light within whatever it was. Never seen light that color before or since. No actual craft shape could be seen, but the light never moved and could not hear any sound. I first seen it, almost like in a daze looking up at it, then like I came to and pulled away from my husband and said look. We both looked up and we both looked at one another and looked back up and it was gone. As strange as what we saw, was also the way we both felt afterwards. We were both so tired, I went straight into the house and to bed, unlike me to do, and now husband, could&#39;nt even make it back to his home, stopping a few miles down the highway stopping at a rock quary and sleeping in his car. Not normal. We both felt as though something may have happened to us but don&#39;t know what or how we&#39;d ever know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

One night it was dark out. I was taking a shower. In the shower there was a small window that was open with a curtain covering it. As I was taking my shower I heard this strange low humming sound coming from outside the window. I was curious as to what it was. I pulled back the curtain to look out the window and floating next to the house above the tree line was a UFO. It was metallic, grey and disc shaped with moving lights around it&#39;s edge. The UFO was very smooth with no signs of seams, doors or windows. I do not know the size of the UFO because I could not see the whole thing. As soon as I saw the UFO it went straight up like nothing I have seen before. As soon as it was gone the low humming noise that was present the whole time was gone. I ran out of the shower and into the living room where my mother was and started screaming I saw a UFO. We have since moved from there. I don&#39;t think that I hallucinated the incident. My mothere remembers me coming out a telling her I saw it. The one thing that sticks in my mind is the noise that the UFO made that I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I enjoyed walking my dog and on this particular day I had chosen a relatively quiet area, where Scud, my dog, could run around freely.  This area is known as the lower southern plateau, at the very tip-end of the Rock, from where you can see the Mediterranean Sea to the East, the Strait that divides Europe from Africa to the South, and the Atlantic Ocean, which lies to the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember sitting on the edge of a cliff and was facing the Mediterranean Sea.   Although the reader may find it difficult to believe, I felt compelled to look in the general direction of a natural elevation (the edges of the Upper Plateau) that stood behind me about 120 metres away.  Over this elevation you find a military enclave that includes an enormous and conspicuous white spherical radar.  There, I saw this metallic round-shaped craft, hovering motionlessly and making absolutely no noise or sound whatsoever.  It just stood there for nearly an hour, above the radar at about 75 feet from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it vanished as if it had imploded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, GBC TV showed footage of an enourmous baseball shaped craft, from where a small sphere descended into a nearby Spanish oil-refinery and then slowly climbed up again only to vanish seconds after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly, there had been a wildfire on the Rock that was put out only one day before my particular sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

As I came to a stop light, a saucer-shaped disk came into my view overhead.  It must have been on the same path as I was (a main road), and when I came to a stop, it kept going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The saucer was (rough guess) half a football field round in diameter.  Possibly more.  A huge disk silently gliding through the air!  Set in from the outer diameter a few yards were a ring of lights, pulsating different colors at different timing.  It&#39;s been quite a few years past but I recall seeing red and green and possibly yellow lights.  It was riding low in the sky, roughly 5,000-6,000 feet above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued down the road and the saucer seemed to be going at my pace, staying just over me.  I turned left and the saucer was still over me.  I took one last turn, which essentially  meant I was facing the direction from which I had just come and the saucer is still over me.  I came to a stop and it kept on going soon out of my sight, in the direction from which it came.  At one point I actually thought I was going to be the next abductee!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Just as I looked up, I observed a long cylindrical missle-type device at approx. 600 feet. It was traveling from WNW to ESE, in a line with Columbus Air Force Base. I came in the house and drew a picture of what I had seen. It had no discernable markings and had small stabilizers near the tail. In 1991-92 during the Gulf War, I saw a Cruise Missle that looked exactly like the device I saw. I then dawned on me that a guided military device had no business in civilian airspace.<n>

Had three flashing bluish/white lights that flashed in a counter-clockwise triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I, who was 13 at the time, and a friend who was 14 were camping out under the stars in my back yard. It was a mostly clear night with a full moon and some scattered high cirrus clouds. My friend saw the object first and immediately pointed it out to me. It was three strobe-like lights flashing in a counter-clockwise triangle. It was moving very fast across the sky from north to south. It passed over the scattered cirrus clouds, so I estimate it must have been above 50,000 feet in altitude. It would move irratically from side to side and diagonal while maintaining it&#39;s forward (southerly) course. It was as if it was actually jumping like a water bug. Since it was at least 50,000 feet in altitude, I estimate when it jumped it was jumping at least a couple of miles at a time. We observed the object until it cleared our horizon (until we could no longer see it). It was moving too fast for me to even run and get my telescope out of the house. It cleared our horizon in about 45 seconds time. A passenger jet at altitude takes nearly five minutes to clear our horizon. Taking that into consideration, this thing must have been moving at thousands of miles per hour. It didn&#39;t leave a contrail of any kind and it made no sound. I never actually seen the body of the object; all I could see was the lights, so I&#39;m assuming it was shaped like a triangle because of the pattern of the lights. The lights were not very bright -- they were like a strobe in the sense that they flashed similarly to a strobe but they were much softer then strobes. They were bright enough to see through the cirrus clouds when passing above them. I called the local Air National Guard and they refered me to a UFO reporting line, which I called and reported to. They seemed quite interested in my observation. I have never seen this object or anything similar since. It was a very exciting night for a couple of young teenagers. As for backgrounds, we were just normal kids. I am thankful that we were able to see such an awesome sight. I will never forge! t it.<n>

I&#39;ve talked about throughout the years. I use to fight Forest Fires for the Forest Service out of Mt. Hood--Clackamas.  We were comming in late from being out for a long shift and we arrived back late to out fire camp dead tired and at that point many people decided to go straight to there sleeping bags while others of us wanted to take our showers and grab something to eat.  My friend and I were talking once we had food and shower laying in our sleeping bags among hundreds of other fire fighter in a field in Redmond, Oregon where fire jumpers are trained and laying flat on our backs I saw all the beautiful stars in the sky that were so clear and out in the open like it is in Eastern Oregon, right near Bend, Oregon I started to see an image among the stars.  My friend and I were talking and I don&#39;t remember talking for a bit because of the image I saw.  Directly above me I saw the shape of a triangle within the stars. It did not block the stars but blended in with the stars except the outside shape of the triangle moved seperately from the rest of the stars.  It made no noise and it was huge. When you think of what your peripheral visions space is it alsmost took it up.  I would say the object was about 80% to 85% of my full peripheral vision area.  I did not wear glasses at the time.  There was no red flashing lights but small light that looked no different than the stars.  It look right on top of us yet far.  It was so strange and so so remarkable at the same time. My eyes looked quickly from side to side looking at the object to make sure my eys were not deceiving me then I turned to my friend and said did you see that?  We both said it at the exact same time to each other and he said what did you see?  I said &#34;No, What did you see? You tell me first&#34; He saw the same thing, when we turned back to see it was gone that I know of. My friend moved on in our own seperate live and wished I could get in touch to talk about what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then it started moving toward our house and it passed over moving very slow, slower than a small plane. It was triangle in shape with lights and it was without sound, it went right over the top of me. I watched it until it disappeared over the hill behind my house. The man from Kirkland, WA saw the same thing I did only I saw it years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen about five sightings, each one different and they weren&#39;t balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was around 7 years old, living in the Hudson Valley in New York.  It was around 8pm  (I know because that was our bed time).  We faced West, South/west and the object headed south (I think)   As my parents were putting us to bed we noticed something to the south.  We lived beneath the landing path of the planes at Westchester Airport, so we always saw planes landing.  This was not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was miles away and, recently, my mother told me it was like a floating stadium.  I remember seeing, what I believe, was a single row of different colored lights.  I think the lights kept changing colors; either that or they did something my mind could not conceive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved very slowly.  I think it floated over the Saw Mill River Parkway.  Because of our location, we looked down towards the Saw Mill River Valley.  This object took up a decent portion of the sky and it did not move fast at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran to my sister&#39;s room to get a better look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was young and greatly impacted by this thing.  The one thought I remember was &#34;who is flying that thing?&#34;  I felt like I could look into the windows to see who was behind the wheel. Were there windows?  I don&#39;t know.  I do remember the eerie feeling that someone or &#34;something&#34; was watching our world from the inside of that ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later I came across a picture of what might be the craft.  When we saw it, the craft was not tilted on its side.  It was completely horizontal.<n>

It had sparks dropping from the bottom.  It looked like something or someone was welding something on the bottom of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was about a 1/2 a mile wide.  To be honest, it scared me.

The Fair is about an hours drive from my home. It was just before midnight. The area in which we live is rural, and situated in the Blue Ridge Mountains. There is a stretch of Highway 19-E between Hampton, TN and the TN-NC state line that winds through an area with very few homes, no homes or businesses at all in some places. The road is a narrow, 2 lane in most places with no street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving, my Aunt was in the passenger seat, and three of my friends were in the back seat, 6 of us total were in the car. The evening had been one of too much cotton candy, corn dogs, and oversized stuffed animals won at overpriced games of &#34;skill&#34;! We were driving along,everyone was laughing and talking at the same time, the radio was playing. Each person, trying to outshout the other. There was basically no traffic at all on the road as it was getting late, at least for most people in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were only about 7 minutes from my house when we rounded a curve and saw what appeared to be a highly illuminated area in the road ahead, I was the first to notice, and it took a few seconds to put together what was happening. I slowed and realized that the road was illuminated...from above. I looked up and could not believe my eyes, by this time everyone had fallen silent and I came to a complete stop in the middle of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hovering about 40-50 feet above and in front of us was what I would describe as a &#34;textbook&#34; UFO. For anyone who has never seen a UFO, it is almost impossible to describe the feelings/emotions that you experience. Your logical mind says impossible, you&#39;re dreaming, hallucinating, whatever, but it can&#39;t be real, and yet there it is. It&#39;s overwhelming. Above us was a HUGE, black, triangle shaped craft with slightly rounded corners. On each of the three points it had very bright hallogen type lights shining straight down, and the front light seemed to have the ability to aim it&#39;s beam somewhat. There may have been a few very small lights of other colors (a couple of my friends said they saw them, I cannot say that I saw anything but the three large white lights). The craft was hovering, and was completely silent. There was no sign of air displacement or means of flight whatsoever. The craft swayed and bobbed slightly like a mylar balloon in a still quiet room, just very slight movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put the car in park and looked around to see everyone in the car stretching to the nearest window for a view with their mouths hanging open, and a look of astonishment on their faces. What stands out the most in my mind in how utterly silent everything had become.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As if by instinct, I turned to open the door to get out and my Aunt grabbed my arm and said &#34;NO SIR...you&#39;re not getting out of this car!! What is that thing? You could get killed!&#34; I told her it was fine, and when everyone saw that I was getting out, they too decided to do the same. Carefully, as if we were sneaking up on something, we opened the doors of the car (all but my Aunt),and we stepped out of the car. There was not a single cloud in the sky, nor any sign of traffic, wind or sound....it was eerily silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time stood still for us at that point. Whether the craft was truly observing us, or if it just appeared to be, we stood there looking up at this thing drifting ever so slowly towards us, looking back, it must have looked like an Old West standoff! Several minutes passed of staring up at the enormous otherworldy machine, and then glancing at each other. Not a single word was spoken by any of us, except the occasional plea from my Aunt to &#34;get my A-- back in the car and lock the door!&#34; After some time, I suddenly had the thought to reach inside and toot the car horn. The very SECOND I did so...the craft rose straight up about 15-20 ft. and shot straight back over us and disappeared over the tree tops. We all jumped back in the car and did a sharp U-turn and drove as fast as I could in the direction of the craft. We were able to follow it probably 7 miles or so before it picked up speed and disappeared over the hilltop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rest of the drive home was a mix of emotions... from disbelief, to laughter, to &#34;what should we do?...who should we tell?&#34; To this day, none of us can explain what we saw, nor have we ever witnessed anything else that compares. I have a couple of times since seen things that made me wonder, and mysterious lights that seemed to have abilities beyond human technology, but NOTHING to hold a candle to what happened to us that night. I have always said how glad I am that I was not alone that night. Having 5 other witnesses makes it so much more solid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I understand the people who disbelieve, or have reservations on this subject. Looking back over what I have written tonight, it sounds so unreal. It WAS unreal, believe me. There are certainly a lot of hoaxes and misinformation out there, sad to say. I can assure you however, if you ever have an experience like we had that August night, your world will change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If there is one thing that I can say with the deepest, most sincere conviction of my heart...my friends and I saw something that is not a part of this world and time as we know it. Spacecraft from another planet? Time travelers? Beings from another dimension? I wouldn&#39;t even begin to speculate, but let me assure you of this one thing, without ANY reservations or hesitation, WE ARE NOT ALONE AND ARE BEING VISITED AROUND THIS PLANET EVERY DAY. That, my friend, is an absolute certainty.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were hanging out in an area that overlooked the lake. As we were sitting down on a ledge talking to each other, I noticed an object flying straight at about 60mph and 300ft in the air on the other side of the lake (about a quarter mile away). At first it looked like the lights of a plane, but as I kept my eyes on it I noticed that there were no blinking lights just three orange colored ball-shaped lights. At the time nobody else was paying attention to it because it sort of blended into distant street lights, but when I realized seconds later that there was no sound coming from it, I pointed it out to everyone saying &#34;check out that plane, Its not making any sound.&#34; Everyone watched as the object flew another 30 seconds until it was over a mountain about a half mile away. All of a sudden as the object was over the mountain its three ball-shaped lights slowly seperated from eachother downwards onto the mountain. All of us were stunned as the balls disappeared behind the mountain and today fourteen years later, all of us are college educated professionals and yet we still refer to the event as the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

It was before dusk so there was plenty of light. He yelled out &#34;Oh my God come take a look at this.&#34; My mom and I were in the house and it sounded like an emergency so we ran as fast as we could too my dad. He was standing outside looking at the western hills. We looked in the direction he was looking and pointing and that&#39;s when we noticed a dark metallic disc shaped thing moving slowly towards us in a diagonal direction. The disc made no noise and there were no lights. It was flying lower than a commercial or millitary plane. It was at an altitude that most of the local pilots fly. We could see the disc clearly,there was nothing to hinder our view and there was plenty of light because it was before dusk. The object moved smoothly and slowly towards us. It eventually moved over us where it hovered above us for a few seconds. I had a clear view of its underside where I noticed once again that there were no lights, it was noiseless there were no evident engine noises. I also noticed that there were no windows or doors- if there were any I couldn&#39;t see them. After a few seconds the object then began to move in the same diagonal direction towards the eastern hills where after a few seconds of travel it suddenly sped away very quickly over the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Those from this area will know what I mean. The Knobs are very hilly geographical features that overlook the Louisville metropolitan area... they are where the glaciers stopped advancing in the last ice age..... so basically we were up on these hills (rural area) with a great view of the flat, sprawling metropolis below (could see for miles).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I remember becoming bored and going out to sit on the picnic table and enjoy the view... just to see what I could see from the vantage point. Only, when I went out, something caught my eye... it looked like an airplane or something at first. But I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane when it started behaving very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be just a bright, defined speck of light, that was contantly changing colors very rapidy. The entire object changed colors at once, so that it was one one color at one moment, and another the next. Mind you, this just describes the color of the light. The object was too small (and too far away) to determine a shape. I would estimate it to have been about 2-5 miles out, and about 1,000 to 3,000 feet in altitude. All I remember was looking &#34;out&#34; at it, rather than &#34;up&#34; at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was bizarre about the object was how it moved... it would basically just zig-zag back and forth at pretty good speeds. Sometimes it would go slow, sometimes fast, but always in a back and forth, up and down, to and fro motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember calling my dad and his friend outside to see it, and they at first seemed annoyed at my insistence, but once they saw it, they changed their tune. Too bad, it disappeared right after they caught a glimpse of it. It literally looked like it simply just &#34;shut-off&#34;... it didn&#39;t fly away or anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of note, what persuaded me to submit my memory was my reading another entry on this site. It was such a close description, and they mentioned wanting to know about others who have had a similar experience. That post was made on 3/21/2003, by an Evansville couple.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
