We noticed off in the distance North of Ester Dome, West of Fairbanks, in between Ester Dome (which has all of fairbanks communication towers) and Murphy Dome (which is a unmanned radar tracking station for the Air Force.)Some flickering semi red tinted lights that were moving slowly to the sky.  They seemed to follow one another then one just faded away.  We now only have 3 flickering UFO&#39;s.  They got into a formation that resembled orions belt.  They just hovered for about 6 min.  The one on top seemed to then move East the other 2 went North and faded out.  The one that moved east then faded out.  I don&#39;t know what they were but I never have  seen any activity in that area from the Airforce or anyone else for that matter. We heard no helicopter sounds, no sounds at all from that direction.  But we could hear jets taking off at our airport all the way across town.  We have lived here all of our lives and never have seen anything like this.  I would like to contact the FAA but they probably think I am crazy.  So here is our post.  Did anyone else see anything??????? I did try and take video but I didn&#39;t get but 3 lights on video.  You can&#39;t see what wesaw but you can hear our audio. P.S. We are going to be looking again tonight at the same time 23:00.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

3/31/09 20:00|Mesa|AZ|Unknown|3 min.|I saw an invisible helicopter|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69513.html|4|ndxe200903| I saw an invisible helicopter<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always look upward to the sky to see ufo’s  ( and I do see them often, but don’t usually report them.   We often see/hear police or TV helicopters in this area  I saw some red lights in a row and heard a helicopter but I did not see anything behind the lights.  I ran inside to grab the binoculars and ran back outside and the helicopter (or whatever it was), was invisible.  I live in a metro area and there is usually an outline of something!  I ran to the other side of the house and still could not see anything except the row of red lights and could hear the loudness.  Even if it was jet black, would’t I have been able to see an outline?  I got online to read about invisible helicopters, but could not find much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS.  I see a lot of daytime sightings and will try to get better at reporting them.<n>
3/31/09 20:00|Washington|ME|Sphere|2 + hrs|Very unusual sphere with multiple flashing colored lights, high in the southwestern sky.|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69495.html|5|ndxe200903| Very unusual sphere with multiple flashing colored lights, high in the southwestern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the southwestern sky, high on the horizon, we watched for over two hours an object the size of 3 large bright stars that stayed in one position and flashed various colors of light such as white, red, green, turquoise, and purple. With the naked eye, it was visible.  With a spotting scope,it was incredible. Small parts would pulsate with the same colors and break off the original just to reattach again. I contacted the county police, who referred me to the state police, who referred me to the FAA, and the local TV station.  All were very unconcerned.  The gentleman from the FAA did say he heard on the news there was supposed to be &#34;some sort of event&#34; in the southeastern sky in the Boston area, but he didn&#39;t know anything more.  It&#39;s very frustrating to try to convince anyone especially the police, to just step ouside their vehicle and look up!<n>
3/31/09 19:50|Storrs|CT|Light|30 minutes|UFO over UCONN|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69489.html|6|ndxe200903| UFO over UCONN<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, (3/31/2009) at approximately 7:50 pm, my 3 friends and I spotted what looked like a glowing ball in the dusk sky. We were at a large hill called horsebarn hill at the University of Connecticut. I was the one who first spotted it when I saw two airplanes in the unobstructed sky and noticed that there was a third object (the glowing ball) which was not behaving like the other two airplanes. We surveyed the area and noted that there were nearby radio towers and traffic lights that were visible slightly above the tree line, but none of these were at the same height as the object. We observed the object hovering for a brief period (about 5 minutes) and it was pulsating with light. Soon the object disappeared. We began to scan the sky again and a few seconds later we noticed the object again over the campus, a great distance away from where it was before. We didn’t know how it was possible for it to travel that fast. It hovered there for a while and disappeared. To me it seemed like it disappeared but I have terrible eyesight and wasn’t wearing any visual aids. My two other friends however could still see it as a small red dot traveling at an immense speed to the other side of the hill where we saw it initially. We then saw it change a series of colors (purple, white, and yellow) and it looked like it was wobbling back and forth in the sky. We continued to watch the object and it disappeared and reappeared several times, randomly getting brighter until it was the brightest object in the sky and it disappeared again to move to a new location. After about 30 minutes of observing this object, we were not able to locate it again. I did record 4 videos of the object on my cell phone camera and caught one of the object increasing the intensity of light and disappearing, however since it is a camera phone it is not of exceptional quality. I am certain what we saw was not an airplane or a radio tower or even a street light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A very bright, gold colored object appeared in the sky at ab out the 1:00 o&#39;clock  direction.  I first thought it might be a weather balloon, but it did not move and the wind was blowing about 15-20 mph out of Northwest.  I then thought it was an airplane, but it did not move.  I looked down toward ground and then back at object and it was gone.  There were no clouds in the sky at this time whick was about 12:30 CDT.  I am a college graduate, 66 years old, in perfect health.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was driving, It came out of no where, towards the right of my car in the sky but pretty close to trees.  It caught my eyes and my boyfriends eyes and we wernt even looking in the sky it was that bright!  I seriously thought it was an astroid but nothing has been reported in the news.  I felt that I have lost my breath for that time.  Theres been another time in our lives last year we&#39;ve seen a similar object in the sky around the keyport area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It disappeared only to reappear as 2 objects with very abnormal flight movement. Suddenly we&#39;re looking at multiple objects that went from a diamond formation to an inverted V to a flat line back to a diamond. I counted approx 8 objects. There may have been more than 8. They were moving very fast and kept disappearing and reappearing only to finally disappear after 5 minutes. This was right on the 395 N. at 1 P.M. Had to be seen by many drivers...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I suddenly saw a small greenish streak moving very fast through the sky, traveling west.  I saw it for maybe 1 second and before it disappeared.  I initially thought it could have been a shooting star/meteoroid but then thought that it would have been surprising to see a meteoroid so clearly within the confines of a major city and all the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

At first, I thought that it was the moon but it was way too low to be the moon.  So I stepped outside and the moon was behind me, this thing was huge. I went upstairs and told my wife and had told her I was going to get a better look. As I started driving towards it , it started to move quite quickly and then it was gone.  The lights were of a amber color not white like the moon.  This thing was absolutely huge.<n>

When I was about to get into the car I spotted some bright greenish light coming from above. I looked up, and then I clearly saw a somewhat huge disk of light floating steadily. It was over a Caracas zone called El Marques. It floated for around 30 seconds, maube a little bit less, and then, suddendly, like a breeze, it did move very very fast and, in less than a second, dissapeared flying straight toward the Avila mountain, (north of Caracas). Two other people at the parking lot also spotted it like me. I am 47 years old. The other two males are a little bit younger than me. The fun part was that the dog in the parking lot started to run, like wanting to chase the giant disk, right after it dissapeared. My heart it&#39;s still ponding. This is the second time in my life I see something like this. Last time was in 1978, also here in Caracas.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/30/09 23:25|Louisville|KY|Triangle|5-7 minutes|several lighted triangular shaped objects hovering in the sky|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69463.html|15|ndxe200903| several lighted triangular shaped objects hovering in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 11:25PM I was driving home from work down a main road and I noticed an object slowly going across the road in the distance. There where at least 2 extremely bright lights visible and 1 red light. The object was at least 3 miles from me down the road. I slowed down as I got closer and happened to look to the left and I saw another object not more than 40 feet from me. I could almost clearly see this object. It was shaped like a triangle with a dent in the middle, like a mouse pointer. There were a row of white lights from the tip to the end and a red light at the very end. I could tell that it was dark grey at the top and light grey on the underneath. As I slowed down to watch and to try to get a picture, the object moved behind a row of houses and some trees then it hovered over one houses roof about a foot from it. None of the houses had lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned down a side street to try to get closer and watched another object with similar bright lights fly very quickly across the sky far in the distance for about 50 seconds. I turned back down the main road from before and onto the same side street and another object was flying directly above my car. It was shaped exactly like the object from before, triangular and with a row of white lights with one red light at the end. There was no noise, as with an airplane and the object flew very quickly as I guess it realized I was there and took off to quickly for me to see or follow. I continued down the road and parked in front of my house when I saw at least 3 more objects. When I finally came inside it was about 11:40PM. After coming inside, I have seen at least 5 normal planes flying across the vicinity in the past 5 minutes.<n>

The object was a single bright round white light.  The object had no bliking lights like an aircraft would.  The object/light was too big to be a light from from an aircraft.  There was no noise, the object was close enough to be heard if it was an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not moving very fast.  The object had speed, but not like a shooting star, satelite or a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made some short zig zag movements that were too fast to be made by a normal aircraft.<n>

I noticed a large X in the sky made by jet trails and snapped a couple photos on my phone. I was reviewing them yesterday and noticed a strange light in one of them. I uploaded them to the computer and zoomed in. I&#39;m not sure of other explanations for this effect, if not made by some physical object in the sky. I&#39;d love to hear some feedback to how legitimate this photo may be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/30/09 07:52|Kernersville|NC|Rectangle|9 minutes|Daytime Object spotted on outskirts of Kernersville, North Carolina|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69518.html|21|ndxe200903| Daytime Object spotted on outskirts of Kernersville, North Carolina<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date: Monday March 30, 2009<n> <n><n> Time: 7:52am<n> <n><n> Weather: Clear Skies/47 degrees<n> <n><n> Location: West of Kernersville<n> <n><n> <n><n> First Sighting  While on the way to drop my son off at school, at approx 7:51am, I noticed a rather large Metallic object in the western sky about ½ mile ahead of us. Upon getting closer to the object, I was able to see the object in greater detail. The object was around 600 to 700ft. high and was hovering at the time. It was now 7:52am. The object was about 100 to 150ft in Length and appeared to be about 40ft in Width. The object was rectangular in shape and had 2 black colored areas on both sides of it that were about 5 to 7 ft long. In the middle of the object, I could see a long opening/slit than span between the black sides. Right above the opening/slit, there was a Pulsating Amber Colored Light. I observed the object until approx. 7:55 and it appeared to just be hovering over an open area to the west of us. While rounding a curve, I lost sight of the object as it went behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second Sighting  At approx. 7:57am I was able to regain site of the object and it was now moving more in a WNW direction. Then, all of a sudden, it began to bank/turn towards the North and this is when I could see just how massive the object was. At this time, the Amber Colored Light on the rear of it was no longer Pulsating, it was a Solid Amber Light. While the object continued to bank to the right, I was able to see the top of it. The Top of the object was Metallic in color in the rear and front sections  The rear of the top section was rectangular and had a pattern on it that resembled mosaic tiles. The middle of the top section was completely round and Metallic looking with Dark Grey Lines covering the entire circle. The front of the top section was also rectangular in shape and had a mosaic looking pattern on it as well. I noticed a Triangle shape on the very tip of the front of the object and it had what appeared to be a metal pipe that was angled toward the ground. The object remained at least a ½ to ¼ mile from us the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shocking Ending just before losing sight of Object  The time now is somewhere between 7:59 and 8:00am. The object has completed its turn and all of a sudden, the object splits into 3 Orb shaped objects and appears to be attempting to fly in formation similar to how jets would fly. All 3 objects are black in color and have some how reduced in size. Although now split into 3, the object in the front of the formation still has the triangular shape on the tip of it along with what appeared to be a metal looking pipe pointing toward the ground. I was only able to keep my eye on the object for about 45 seconds due to traffic in the area around the school.<n>

I was heading to work traveling Eastbound on 127 Th Street from Ridgeland Ave toward Cicero Ave. It was a clear and bright Eastern sky with the sun still below the horizon. As I arrived up to a stop light at 127 Th and Central Ave a triangular pitch black matte object that stuck out like a sore thumb against the predawn sunrise caught my attention due to its size, and orientation. It appeared to be heading from a Northeast position over I-294 to Southwest toward Palos Heights at 135th and Ridgeland while I was stopped at the intersection of 127 Th and Central Ave. Once the light changed the object was still traversing on a Southwesterly line as it passed with in 1 block of where I was located at a height of about 500 feet. As it was passing my vantage point I opened the sun roof on my vehicle to follow it as closely as possible and to listen for any sounds. Once it past what I will call the 5 O clock position over my right shoulder it disappeared from my sightline out of the sun roof and I lost contact with it between Central Ave and Route 83 on 127 Th Street.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took direct notice of the stars and realized it was not a planet, star, or satellite.  The object stood stationary as I pulled off to the side of the road to analyze it further.   There were no buildings, lamp posts or any object near the sphere, which was a bright orange/red in coloring.  I had my camera near me, for earlier I had taken some landscape photos while on my drive.  I lifted my camera to the object and the object began to move, I captured a movement picture of the object, I could not quite get a clear picture so I switched my camera to video mode.  The object then began moving drastically as if trying to avoid being captured on film.  The object darts drastically in my video, and the camera starts making noises with every movement of the object, and an interaction between the two is obvious, which is also captured on the video, you can also see rings in the object with an almost nucleus center. I then lowered my camera to grab another photo and while switching over the camera the object separated into multiple spheres now white in color, the spheres were in two lines, the spheres from right to left glowed and pulsed out light with greater intensity one at a time, when the the last sphere pulsed with light the spheres joined from right to left and formed back into one to disappear at a phenomenal speed. When zooming in on the photo of the object multiples of colors can be viewed.Like I mentioned before, I have video footage of what I have described but I&#39;m not to positive of how to send video via internet.If somebody could  get back to me and explain how to do so, I&#39;d be happy to send over the footage.<n>

Then another appeared on the same path, further behind. The second object caught up with the first. Then the first object went into a tight, elliptical orbit, heading back the opposite direction as the second object followed. When these objects began their elliptical turn, a third object came towards them, quickly, from much further away. When the third object was close to the other two, it slowed down. The three objects were moving slow at this point, then faded out of view.  All three objects looked the same, like dim, blue stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing at the edge of the, Columbia River, Washington, off State Route 401, facing east, looking directly across the river towards, Astoria, Oregon, when I saw this. As it was, I was observing the sky. My line of sight was 60 degrees.  The objects came from the north and were heading to my south before they turned. At first, I thought that I found a satellite, whereas it was moving quickly. My eyes followed it from my left-north to right-south. Then I scanned my eyes over to the left again and spotted another one moving much quicker on the same trajectory until it appeared to be behind the first one. I held my hand up, and the length of my thumb was the distance . Then they made the turn, one following the other heading north. Then I looked over to my complete left and saw the third moving the fastest...in about four seconds it was in my front view, slowed-down to almost a stop. At that point, it appeared to be near the other two, which were moving slowly, also.  From there, they faded away, as if their lights dimmed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were in a small covered gazebo talking and laughing when we witnessed what we thought was a flash of lighting directly overhead (we heard nothing).  The weather is of concern to us because we are forecasters so we all stepped out of the covered area to see where the lightning could have come from.  There were almost clear skies and no storm clouds in any quadrants.  It could not have been lightning.  I went inside while to others headed to a lookout above the building where they claimed to have seen a ball of light in the distance take off out of sight in the blink of an eye.  I cannot confirm the second part but the first I was there for.  About 20 minutes after coming back into the office local news stations from Marland to North Carolina began reporting similar sightings.  Some interesting facts that occured just after the incident are millitary aircraft taking off and seemingly patroling the area. I later called the observation tower near the airfielf where I work and asked if they had witnessed anything and the lady said she could not confirm or deny anything at the moment.  It seemed by her tone that she had been told to say that for whatever that is worth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Then there was a huge percussion werid sounding booms that followed. Minutes later I saw what I thought was an aircraft flashing from blue to red to green it moved quickly left and then backwards it stopped and stayed in place about 30 to 40 minutes then I saw jets flying in the area and it disappeared. The brillant flash was seen in three states. Some saw a green fire ball I did not see that, what I saw was the flashing spheres, it may have been our location. The media first thought it was a meteorite now they are saying it may have been space junk. I doubt that as Norad keeps track of that. I believe what I saw was 2 very different ufo&#39;s. I had never see anything like this before. And I have never heard of space junk or meteorites being seen across three states either, I am convinced it was a major ufo event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up and watched it cut from left to right (north east) and descend rapidly at an angle towards the ground. The light had turned into a fireball at this point with a bright red-orange tail. It descended quickly into the trees and dissappeared. There was no smoke, no sound, and no falling fragments. I then called my husband to tell him and he advised me to call 911. I called 911 and the operator took my report.

We had just arrived home, and I stepped out of my car to urinate, facing due north. I noticed a yellow-white light, just above the treeline. The trees are fairly close, within a mile, but the object was obviously much farther away and higher in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved toward the east at a steady clip, moving from due north to nearly northeast within a matter of  2 minutes. At this point, now in the northeast, it began to ascend. The UFO climbed then disappeared momentarily, for maybe 5 seconds or so, and then reappeared much smaller and still climbing. It had gone from being visible at about the size of a pea, and once it reached it&#39;s highest point it was the size of most noticeable stars in the sky. The light then began to move in all four cardinal directions, always coming back to a central starting spot. There seemed to be no pattern to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I called my mother to explain this instance to her. She was able, without my direction, to pick out the point in the sky that I was talking about. She noticed, as we did, that it was a different hue than what the surrounding stars were putting off. The object stayed in the sky at this distant point for about an hour. We went out to check it periodically, and it vanished while we were inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Really it looked like Venus, but moving fast. It continued east and turned slightly to the south and then disapeared over the horizon. I didn&#39;t notice any colors or any variations just bright. Based on the speed that passenger jets fly over I would say it was traveling 2-3 times faster. Possible a little more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t able to take any pictures but I did get it on video, but it looks like a bright dot. I can email the video if interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From the tree line it would very quickly go back to hovering at the end of the street again and then there were 2 more. It repeated this movement several times. I had a camera and took some pictures, but when I reviewed them it looks so far away. I will try and attach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

My co-worker was looking up at the object, and he said that it looked like a bright star (mind you it was still before sunset).  The &#34;star&#34; burst with a bright flash of light and disappeared.  About 45 minutes later, it was seen again, except this time it was about 10 miles north-east of my location. I had called someone, and they decided to follow the light.  The object lingered near manteno.  It kept flashing bright orange, fading to red, and disappearing altogether.  Soon, two small airplanes began to persue the object, which quickly took off in a NE direction.  it faded into NE indiana by 9:15 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The &#34;point&#34; or &#34;tip&#34; pf the triangle leading north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was three birds. But there was no movement expect the unwavering steady fast paced movement forward. constant speed and seperation of white patches soon made it obvious it was no animal. It looked as if it was low-flying, much lower than the average plane, yet it was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was extremely high up, then it would have been extremely massive, beyond anything we know today in modern aviation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As if to prove it was no ordinary plane, a moment or two after it passed (it was moving quite fast, and I must stress again, completely silent) a regular passenger jet plane flew overhead, (with a trajectory slightly deviated from the first unidentified craft) it was very, very high but we could still hear the jets, loud and clear, the lights on the bottom of the plane twinkled and shone and blinked. There were patches of fog so this jet had headlights that illuminated the clouds in front of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first craft had no such headlights, nor any standard lights on the bottom at all. The white patches which formed the triangle did glow, as if emmitting heat, but where not shiny, there was no tendrils of light from them as there are from normal plane lights or even far away stars etc. IT was a subdued paleness that stood out against the night sky, faint, but there never the less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two white patches that formed the &#34;base&#34; of the triangle were set farther back than the lights on the wings of the jet that followed soon after.<n>

We were standing in the alley behind my house, near my girlfriend&#39;s car having a cigarette when I noticed the strangeness.  There where three identical lights in a triangular form moving at a fast pace across the sky, due west I believe.  From my point of view it was about a few miles from our position and maybe 25-30,000 feet up, appeared quite large in the sky and was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could almost make out a blackish shape within the lights.  The lights where solid, no strobes or emergency lights where visible. About a minute later we witnessed what appeared to be two military jets flying the same direction and could be heard.  The jets had the standard lighting most airplanes have when flying at night.  I live a few miles away from Whiteman AFB and have seen hundreds of B-2 bombers and I believe what I saw was not a B-2.<n>

It was moving from the east to the west and appeared to be falling to me.  It continued to move towards the horizon and disappeared.  I thought it might have something to do with the space shuttle landing, but heard no boom and the shuttle I later learned had landed in the afternoon, six or more hours before.  Two other friends also witnessed the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then we realized he actually saw the fireball not just the light flash like we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He drew a picture of it for us and it was a roundish, white orb, with some red near the tail, with a tail about as long as the orb.  If you circle your finger in the OK sign that is how big he described it as being before it went behind the mountain, it was traveling approximately in the same direction we were west, but was out of sight quickly since we were in the foothills of the Black Range it was lost behind the mountain too quickly for the rest of us to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could tell it was very big just due to the light it emitted.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up into the sky and saw this fascinating cloud that looked like a feather. I said to myself, &#34;There&#39;s got to be something behind that cloud.&#34; There was. When the cloud had moved away I saw a bright object. At first I thought it was a star, but thought, &#34;It couldn&#39;t be at this hour.&#34; I continued to watch it. It seemed to be stationary like a star as the Earth moved. I went to my apartment to get my binoculars. This took about 3 or 4 minutes. The object was still there but it was a bit dimmer. Whenever I looked at it with my binoculars and tried to focus on it I couldn&#39;t get the object into focus. When there was a moment of focus it didn&#39;t look like a star. It seemed to have bright and dark areas.  Interestingly, as I watched it through the binoculars another smaller object went from West to East. It was much smaller than the first object and I could focus on that one. As the Earth continued to turn and the Sun slowly began to set the object became dimmer and dimmer until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had just spent an hour at a roadside rest area and slept for an hour before continuing on my trip.

In the total darkness, I could not judge how high up it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I marveled at it as it flew directly overhead and followed it threw my sun roof.  I did not think of it as a UFO because I kept thinking about how this thing resembled a bright red and orange amber in a fire.  The inside of the circle sparkled with white flashes as the orange color graduated to a cooler red at the perimeter.  The outside of the circle was not well defined and wavered slightly. I did not think of it as a UFO because I had a preconception, from what I so often have heard, that UFOs are glowing white lights in the sky at night.  I also never really believed that there were such things as UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As fast as I could, I crossed over two lanes on the interstate, stopped on the side, opened the sun roof, and stuck my head out to continue looking at this fireball.  To my surprise I saw yet another similar object approaching from the east on a collision course with the first. When they were relatively close to each other, they both made sharp turns to the north.  They continued flying in formation until they disappeared in the horizon.  I was driving a hybrid car so the car engine was completely silent and no traffic was on the highway at this moment. Yet I could not detect any noise from these objects in the sky.  I have seen thousands of aircraft in the sky and live near an airport, so there is no mistaking these items for airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after these items had disappeared into the horizon, I witnessed what I thought at first was a shooting star. However, as I thought about it, it dawned on me that this could not have been a coincident. This beam of light, coming from space, intersected the pathway of the two flying objects. It appeared to me that if this beam of light had appeared ten, fifteens seconds earlier, it would have been right on top of these objects or even possibly hit one of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is also worth noting that these UFOs were in this geographic location on the same day that the shuttle landed at Cape Kennedy.  The shuttle landed at 3:14 pm and this sighting occurred at 11:45 pm. I realize that these occurrences are many hours apart, but never the less it is on the same day and only a few hundred miles apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

3/28/09 02:00|Roseville|CA|Formation|35-45 minute|Three unexplained events experienced March 28th 2009. Group of objects seen in pursuit of object.|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69606.html|49|ndxe200903| Three unexplained events experienced March 28th 2009. Group of objects seen in pursuit of object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three unexplained events experienced March 28th 2009<n> <n><n> <n><n> The First Event  It was a very late Saturday night, Sunday early morning at 2:00am. After staying up late to watch a few movies we decided to step out on our apt patio to get some fresh air to be alone and look up at the stars. Our 3 yr old son lay tucked away in bed sleeping. It was unusually very windy earlier that day but although an amazingly clear and calm night. We sat there on the patio for a bit, maybe 15 min. I noticed a shooting star off to my left that shot from right to left downward diagonally. As I tugged at my husband I was able to catch the tail end of it as it fizzled out across the sky.  We both in fun, made a wish and then looked back up. I said to my husband looking up, “ It just doesn’t make sense, that there wouldn’t be more out there, it’s just so beautiful.”  As I looked at him I watched as he pointed up to the sky but totally away from where we were looking before. He said, “ Oh my God”. I looked up and was completely frozen solid. I could not believe my own eyes. We both were stunned. We saw a silvery pearl colored spherical shape in the sky that glistened. If you’ve ever looked at the North Star it looked just like that, but a bit larger, maybe the size or thickness around as the pencil lead inside a pencil. We definitely did not notice this being there before on account of how bright it was and my husband and I noticing it so immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to reflect the moonlight, which was to our left in the sky. The object just sat there. It then quickly shot off in a diagonal direction to our left over our building out of view, but something weird happened. It had made no sound, left no trail, and sped up at first, then almost slowed down to a stop and then shot off very quickly again, shooting out a bit slowing down and then shooting out a bit again like it may have been in trouble or something. This could definitely not been a shooting star or a piece of debris coming in from space. It quickly traveled until it was blocked from view because of our patio roof, as we are located on the second floor.  We felt a rush of adrenalin come over us as we both practically jumped in each other’s arms in amazement to what we had just seen. We were so excited we actually yelled out in excitement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This 1st experience lasted maybe about 10-12 seconds from the time we spotted it until it was gone from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Second Event  We both immediately redirected our view back to the sky and saw 5 more of these same objects out in the distance. At first they seemed to just be bright stars but as we kept looking we could see them moving strangely. Each flashed very brightly for just a second as they approached after seeming to drop noticeably in the sky. At first these objects were very far away in the distance and in seconds were flying right over top of us in the same direction as the other one had gone. We noticed they were moving much faster and even more rapidly than the first. These as well made no sound. Their movement was much more fluid as they flew in and out of one another, one coming close to even hitting another but then formed up in a random group, in a formation but not. As they passed overhead most noticeably we pointed out one in particular moving just like the first one we had seen earlier. One would shoot out faster like the movements of the first one out in front and then reform back into their clustered formation. It was apparent their clustered formation and randomness were obviously patterned as if to match the randomness of the sky and its stars. At a glance you would not notice them for it not for the moonlight reflecting off of them. It seemed as though one wanted to move out faster ahead but then would have to adjust its speed back to the groups, as the main group stayed one constant speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This 2nd experience lasted maybe about 12-15 seconds until they were out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, we yelled out and even jumped up and down a bit as our excitement for a second had got the better of us. This had been the most amazing thing we had ever seen together aside from our son being born it was that exciting. What we saw was unlike anything we had ever seen before in the skies and did not resemble anything natural or man made. The speeds most notably were to sporadic and fast to be changing speed and direction like they did. We sat there for a bit more, like 10-15 minutes, rambling back and forth to each other like excited little kids. Our neighbor in the building to our right and across from us came out to see what was going on, after hearing us and we stated that we had just seen the most amazing thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s when we experienced something so amazing; it would forever change all of our lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Third Event  We apologized to our neighbor for being loud and disturbing him. He said it was no problem. As we turned to walk back in the house we noticed he had said something pretty loud, maybe to us. We stepped back out to see he was as well looking up and was pointing at something. I yanked my husband by the shirt and practically tripped as she fell trying to get to the railing of the patio. Expecting to see the same thing we were quickly frozen by what was there. My husband noticed the neighbor ran inside quickly and came back out. I was so excited and scared, all at the same time but didn’t take my eyes off this thing. It’s hard to explain how I felt. Looking at it did not scare me at all. My husband said later he couldn’t even move or talk at first. He also said that he didn’t know what to think of what he saw and that he didn’t really want to talk about what it meant. What he saw actually scared him a bit. Just in the last week he has been acting a bit different because of what he saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling in the same direction again, but much slower and closer was an object that was approximately the size of dime in the sky. It was the shape of a jellyfish or mushroom and had brighter light emitting from the center and bottom that was reddish orange. Its sides were almost translucent like a jellyfish and more solid reddish orange in the center. It looked like its sides were moving in on themselves like a mushroom cloud does from an atomic blast with its billowing reddish smoke. It made no noise and traveled at a very slow speed, like about 4 inches in the sky, for like every 5 seconds and then just stopped. This thing just didn’t make sense. It was amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband pulled me down just below the railing and out of the moonlight where we both now crouched and watched it. For some reason during the event I put out my arm to grab the railing.  My husband quickly grabbed my arm down in fear. We both sat there in the dark motionless looking up at this thing for about 3-4 minutes. We were very afraid there for a second there almost hardly breathing. Then suddenly calmness came over both of us when it started to move again. The large object slowly again started to move from its fixed position and slowly in the same direction prior, headed over our building like the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a huge central train yard just about a ½ mile away, in Roseville. You can always hear the cars booming together and crashing in the distance, sometimes very loudly. Sometimes it’s very quiet. This night we would hear them about every 5-10 minutes. You get pretty used to them after a while and block them out. We could hear off in the distance a few pretty loud bangs and then suddenly this object sort of flashed and made a few crackling noises. Like wood burning in a fire. The sounds actually did echo pretty loudly. As the train cars thudded it looked effected by the sounds of them crashing together. It suddenly became very translucent not emitting any form of light. Almost like it shut down, for a second. It appeared to look kind of like a jellyfish head in the sky. You could sort of see through it. You could only see a kind of shimmer glare around its edges from the moonlight and a kind of blurriness in the middle. It sat there for about probably 2–3 seconds doing this crackling noise. Then with the next crash of train cars it moved so fast over top of us, we lost it in our vision as it passed over our building. The object disappeared before my eyes could even adjust to see where it had gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the only way I can describe what we saw on March 28th 2009. The whole series of events occurred between 2 and 2:45 in the morning. They occurred back to back in series. These events were witnessed by, me, my husband, and the two neighbors, a husband and wife who live across from us that witnessed the third portion of the event.<n>

They passed over me and took off up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister reports hearing her dogs barking madly. Went outside her home and looked to the Western sky. Noticed a pretty bluish white star in the sky. The star started moving slowly in her direction. It stopped,and a smaller red star dropped out of the bigger blue star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bigger blue star continued moving towards her. Midway into her back yard it shot straight up into the sky and disappeared. She turned and watched the red one slowly start coming her way. She started backing up towards the light on her porch. The red star moved slowly towards her,kept moving,but even slower as it came over her. She heard a low humm coming from the red object only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She felt that she was being observed. She figured the hell with it(she has seen so many in her area)that she waved at the red star twice. On the second wave she stated bye,and it took off straight up towards the Southeast sky into a pinpoint and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this whole experience her dogs where barking uncontrollably. Once the objects were gone,the dogs stopped barking. She doesn&#39;t have access to a computer/Internet and requested I report this incendent to someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You For Your Time<n>

He was driving from Sierra Vista, Az. north bound towards I-10 when he noticed 2 cars pulled off to the right and other cars pulling off on the side of the highway. He saw them looking up into the sky and so he did the same and he saw a big saucer shape craft fying from east to west. Not sure how high it was but a little lower than what a jet liner would fly. He said it was metalic color and didnt really see any lights on it or flashing but that is was about the size of a quarter or so and it was moving when he saw it and it disappeared over the mountains/hills of south Tucson. HE said it was moving much faster than a jet liner. There is a base near by called Fort Hachuca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/27/09 05:30|Maple Shade|NJ|Unknown|2 minutes|At 5:30 am on March 27th 2009 I was standing in my yard when all of a sudden a bright light appeared overhead and slightly to the south|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69424.html|55|ndxe200903| At 5:30 am on March 27th 2009 I was standing in my yard when all of a sudden a bright light appeared overhead and slightly to the south. It was stationery and looked to be about the size and brightness of Venus  as seen in the night sky. It’s difficult to say exactly what to place next but the light which did not have a beam pointing to the ground that I could see began to diminish in brightness or rotate forward into the direction that it was about to travel. Once the light was gone what I could now see was what appeared to be a light that you would see on the underside of an aircraft. The craft (in was an airplane) was about 30 to 40 thousand feet in elevation and began moving south and roughly in the direction of the Philadelphia International Airport. I was not able to visually track the craft across the sky as one could normally do because the object was ascending rapidly as it moved forward. Within one minute the light diminished in size so much that I could no longer see it. Very strange behavior for a conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note;  ISS??  PD))<n>

There are some ballfields on our left and as we proceeded my son and I saw small red and white lights float across in front of us. At first I thought a plane was going to crash it was so low.  The object was dark and my son thought it looked circular in shape. I just remember it looking dark with small red and white lights.  We slowed down and watched it move over the ballfields until it disappeared from our site.  Maybe a total of 2 minutes.  We never heard any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded quite sober-minded to us.  We do not know what they saw.  PD))<n>
3/26/09 21:15|Mills River|NC|Formation|10 minutes|3 circling lights, 1 stationary light, 5-10 minutes in one place, vanished mysteriously|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69398.html|57|ndxe200903| 3 circling lights, 1 stationary light, 5-10 minutes in one place, vanished mysteriously<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter, age 17, was looking out the living room window and said she saw some lights in the sky.  I looked out and saw 3 lights, rounds, a bit dim, moving in unison in a circle.  It looked like they were kind of chasing each other, but they also stayed uniform.  Then, they seemed to merge.  Then, they went back to their circling formation.  I thought it was kids with flashlights against the night sky, but when I went out side to get a better look, I couldn&#39;t see any rays.  Also, there was one stationary light to the left of the three moving lights.  If I was imagining a ship, I would say that the light on the left was like a window and the three moving lights were landing lights or whatever.  But I can&#39;t figure out how or why they would merge every once in a while.  I should also say that the light never stopped, and they always were moving in a circle.  The lights were behind a cloud.  It was the only cloud in the sky but it was big and it had stopped raining about an hour ago, so I figured it was leftover clouds.  However, I couldn&#39;t figure out what would cause such lights.  I got curious and told my daughter we would ride over to get a better look, since the lights seemed low and close.  As we drove, the lights did not stay behind but followed us!  This meant it was a BIG object.  Then, when we turned the corner, the lights vanished.  We drove about 30 seconds from the house and the lights were GONE.  We went back to the house after a few minutes of driving and stopping.  When we got back home, the lights were gone and the cloud was gone too.  The sky was totally clear.  Weird.  The cloud obscured the lights so that I thought they were coming from the ground but there was no evidence of any person or light, ambulance or party, near the area.  We live in semi-rural so that evidence would be easy to spot.  Nothing unusual on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/26/09 21:00|Wilbraham|MA|Oval|over 5 hours|Red light moving object turns into white light stationary star like object.|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69412.html|58|ndxe200903| Red light moving object turns into white light stationary star like object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 03/26/09 at 21:00 hours I witnessed an oval to circular shaped object moving from the Northeast sky to directly East of my position, it’s altitude was approximately 22° to 27° altitude from O° Horizon (level). I was not able to judge distance except to say that it was far past my digital camera and video camera range. There was no way to focus on this object with consumer level equipment and may have even been difficult for professional equipment to focus on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to photograph it in every way I could think of but could not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed the object it was in the area of being North / North-East moving southerly toward a position east of my view.  The only reason I noticed it was due to it’s movement, it was clearly slower then an airplane and going approximately at satellite speed but it’s position in the sky and luminescence was all wrong for any satellite and there are no stars of that magnitude in this area of the sky and no objects that move horizontally without gaining altitude. It also changed appearance with a range of colors from white to bright yellow into deep red and back again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color shift happened only during the time it traveled but stopped shifting once it stopped traveling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began, or I first noticed it, at 42.5° N moving to and ending at a point just over 41.5° N or in other words a horizontal southerly distance totaling about 40° along the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It ended up being exactly east of my viewing position. I suspect it also came toward me but had no way to judge its depth other then an increase of magnitude, its size appeared to stay somewhat constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Please note the longitude, latitude and angular measures are only approximations; I have not gone back and measured those.)  While it traveled and changed color the red shifting was most notable because it appeared to have a deep red sphere inside of its shape that swirled counterclockwise. The red color was contained within the sphere and was about 30% of the total size, the motion of the red shape was erratic and wild but the main motion was counterclockwise the motion was almost like a pinball machine gone berserk..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within the first few minutes of spotting this I called my wife to verify what I was seeing, she then said “I see those things all the time, around 3:00am and they are closer to the house”. She takes these things with a very cavalier attitude and doesn’t share an interest in any extra-terrestrial activities and treats these occurrences as everyday events for some reason. If she were to see an E.T in person she would say “oh that’s nice…” and then walk away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After questioning her it appears this has happened before in much the same way only closer to the house and moving faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She does not understand why I have any level of excitement over this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event lasted until the object stopped and remained stationary, it moved for a period of about 15 minutes yet was stationary for at least two hours, anyone seeing it after it now stopped would believe it to be a star, it had no outstanding lighting or motion and stayed in a fixed position, eventually after unsuccessfully trying to photograph it I gave up on viewing it, my wife’s comments took a lot of wind out of my sails, my total viewing time was about 1 hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Her total viewing time was around 10 minutes and she verified the size, shape, motion and color of this with no emotion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that I know this is / was not a one time event I have my eye to the sky more often.<n>

In front of the plane &#34;which was very visable&#34; their was a white/yellow light in front of it. We could hear the goverment type JET&#39;s noise but only one. The other light then seemed to slowly be speeding up and then we watched the JET speed up and see a large flames behiend the jet. &#34;like when the blew angles use their afterburners&#34;. The other light started speeding off faster than the Jet could keep up. And was quickly no longer visable. The jet still seemed to be following or escorting it. After that i also noticed that the San Jose airport was using a different landing path for the comercial airlines &#34;which i know they do during bad weather, because they fly right over my house only when it it raining&#34; Which it was Clear. This event was very odd due to i could tell that their was a military jet behiend the light. but could not tell what type of light and or shape it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All 4 items where around the monterey air port area then again they turn around headed back north in this weard chasing action and one of the front jet turn in a odd ( go around type ) then it was gone in a flash. the other three Jets. keep on going nouth. Around 10pm then there was two more Jets comming from the south going north and about 10:10pm another jet came from the east side going in the same direction. This was VERY weard for this area. The big dipper to the smaller one in the skys where faceing from my view was south to west at about 1 a clock angle. Trided to film it but dont think its going to show anything but me talking...WOW!<n>

I stepped out to take out the trash at 10p tonight, looked up to find the dipper and was surprised the sky was so clear. I saw the dipper almost immediately, then my eyes traveled over to the NW...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first saw a consistently moving satellite moving left to right, then I was struck by a blue red and white…lit-up object that was moving in a pattern I had never seen before. This object looked much like a typical star or planet initially. It moved left, then right, then in a semi-circular motion. It was slightly larger than a star and seemed to be very high in the sky, because it was difficult see it clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two most peculiar aspects of this object were the movements and the change of shape and color. It moved quickly in a swirling motion as well as at sharp angles before stopping completely and not moving at all. It at times moved slowly too.  It moved then stopped, then moved again with a very inconsistent frequency. At points, the object appeared to twist, or rotate to expose a three-light cluster. The colors changed at inconsistent intervals…nothing like an airplane. It was also unlike the flickering of any star I have seen<n>

On the trip, we both noticed a single non-flashing light.  I pointed out to my wife that the object was not in the correct position for Venus. The light travelled from my left to my right over a 15 minute period.  I looked at the clock when we first noticed the light, and the time was 19:22.  We watched the light until it suddenly disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/25/09 19:00|Seattle|WA||10 minutes|Strange low flying lights over Seward Park in Seattle, Washington on March 25, 2009.|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69388.html|67|ndxe200903| Strange low flying lights over Seward Park in Seattle, Washington on March 25, 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK, this was a strange night.  After walking my dog at Seward Park, we sat at the picnic table near the clay studio so my dog could have his treat break.  It was about 8:00 p.m., the sun had already set and the stars were finally coming out.  I&#39;m fascinated with stars and as usual, I am looking up at the Big Dipper in the Northeast direction.  As I glanced at the I-90 Bridge, a flash of light caught my eye above and north of me.  I noticed that there was a small light followed by a larger light flying directly behind the smaller light, if I had to guess, the lights seem to be four blocks apart from one another, it was moving slowing to the east and it didn&#39;t seem to be more that 600-800 feet above the evergreen trees of the park.  As I pondered where the these planes came from and why they were so low, I realized that they were too close to be flying behind one another.  I noticed that they moved at the same speed and the distance between the two lights never shifted but remained straight across from one another.  In addition, there were no strobe lights as there are on all airplanes and helicopter&#39;s (as far as I know) and the most amazing thing was that there was absolutely no sound at all.  All this I described happened within a minute of me noticing the lights and I was chatting with my mom on the phone at the time and told her I was pretty sure I was seeing a actual UFO.  Although it was not completely dark I could see there was no outline of a vehicle between the two lights, however, it was just too strange that the lights moved as if they were connected to something.  The only example I can offer is this, if you see a ship on the ocean at night and there was a light on the front of the ship and another on the back of the ship, you would not see the ship but you’d know that there must be a ship out there because the light spacing never changes.  I could see that the larger light was globe like with either vents of blue light or some feature that I was unable to clearly make out at t! he dista nce I was at. However, I could see there was something more to the light.  As the UFO disappeared over the tree going east, my mom grabbed her camera and because her house sits on a hill over near the airport she was able to see the lights as I had described and she said that she could see them going a little below the tops of the Cascade Mountains going south.  Then she lost them.  A minute later she was again able to see the two lights heading south.  They still appeared to be near the Cascade Mountains.  I hope there was others who reported this because it was truly an amazing sight for me and I will always regret not carrying my camera or binoculars.  The observer is an accountant.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first being in WVA in the early 70&#39;s. Almost exactly the same craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, child and I were visiting my Father-in-law today at his place by Medina Lake here in San Antonio, Texas. I took my daughter on a small tractor ride through a dense wooded area about a mile from the lake itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter was on my lap steering when she suddenly pointed up at this object directly in front of us about 100 yards and around 30 feet off the ground. She turned around quickly and hid her eyes on my shoulder as I tried to stretch my leg out to get my cell phone out of my pocket and take pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was extremely nervous that it was so clearly in plain view and that I knew I needed to get the pictures. But not being able to take my eyes off of the object made for fumbling fingers and tight pockets, not to mention that my daughter was scared to death. This whole process from first sighting to getting the cell phone out took about 7 - 9 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By that time the object tilted slightly and the sun light gleemed off of its surface as it disappeared. I tried to see a trail but there was nothing. I told my daughter to relax and when we got back and told everyone they said we were pulling their legs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting lasted an estimated 11-12 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: I DID post this to a different website earlier tonight but forgot that there WAS an aura or fuzziness to the stability of the crafts &#34;flight&#34;. I apologize for this error.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. The craft (object) was semi-circular 2. A mercury - mirror type shell 3. Slight protrusions from top center and maybe bottom as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. No sound 5. No lights 6. No windows 7. Slight acidic taste to faint odor (may have been any number of outside scents though) 8. No exhaust trail visible 9. Craft (object) was around 12-15 ft side to side and 5-6 ft top to bottom 10.

I was standing next to my house, looking up at the sky, observing the chemtrails which I do often. It wasn&#39;t a heavy chemtrail day, just a couple of Xes and lines that were spreading out. Suddenly I noticed something moving quickly past the trails. My eyes focused on what I first thought was a flock of birds in the far distance. It looked like bunch of dots in a formation. I&#39;m wasn&#39;t sure how many, maybe ten or twelve, because this formation of dots was moving very fast. When I noticed them, they were directly in front of me, but within 2 to 3 seconds they had traveled across the sky to my left until they vanished in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there a few minutes thinking about what I just saw, wondering what it could have been. If it wasn&#39;t for the speed, it could have been a flock of birds so far away that they looked like dots. Then I thought it could have been a group of insects that were quite close to me streaking by and staying in a perfect formation. Maybe a squadron of jet fighters? But there was no noise made by this UFO. I thought it couldn&#39;t have been any of these things because it was just moving to fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t think much more about my sighting until last night when I saw the photo of the London sighting. It appears to be the same kind of formation only closer to the viewer. Could it be that there&#39;s a UFO squadron speeding around globe? I think it&#39;s a possibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a degree in Nursing and have worked in the manufacturing field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

When I got out of my vehicle I looked at the sky over the nearby lake, known as Shell Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My attention was immediately drawn to a sighting in the sky. I witnessed a line of five objects. The objects stretched across the sky above the lake. They stayed still in the same place for several minutes, and blinked a clear white light one after another from left to right in uniform fashion. I immediately called my girlfriend to let her know what I was witnessing, as I was pretty amazed at this, I have never seen anything like it before. I continued to watch these objects blink high in the sky as I talked to her. A car passed behind me on the road. Then, they suddenly stopped, all at once, and were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/24/09 21:30|Oakley|KS|Triangle|~15 minutes|Large triangular craft over Oakley, Kansas - multiple sightings|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69440.html|73|ndxe200903| Large triangular craft over Oakley, Kansas - multiple sightings<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside having a cigarette at 21:30 24 March 2009, and as I have become accustomed to doing I look directly up.  I noticed a large, silent craft in the shape of an equilateral triangle overhead, moving due south.  The craft had three white lights, one at each point of the triangle, which did not flash or blink, and one red light in the center of the triangle which flashed like the light of a &#34;normal&#34; aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was completely silent and left no vapor trail.  Although it made no sound, I could &#34;sense&#34; the craft, as though it were somehow silently moving air or altering the pressure around it, much the way you &#34;sense&#34; a person moving behind you even if you don&#39;t hear them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft appeared approximately one-half the size of Orion&#39;s belt on each side.  I am no expert on estimating altitude, but I do not believe it was at commercial aircraft altitude.  My best guess is that the craft was maybe three to five times the size of a large commercial aircraft, assuming it was indeed flying comparatively low.  If it was at a high altitude, based on observations of hundreds of commercial aircraft during both day and night, it would be dozens of times larger than even the largest commercial aircraft that fly over Kansas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also briefly noticed several (didn&#39;t get a count) flashing lights, alternating between pale blue, green, and red, along the two front edges of the craft.  As it moved over my head, I could no longer see these lights.  This is the fourth time I have seen this particular craft (or others just like it) in the past month or so, but this was the first time I noticed the flashing lights along the front edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft moved at a steady pace without any fluctuation in speed, roughly the observed speed of traditional aircraft.  Again, depending on altitude, it was either moving very fast or extraordinarily slowly.  The two rear white lights were visible for nearly fifteen minutes as it moved out of sight to the south.  In two of the other instances, the craft similarly moved south.  In the other instance, the craft was moving due north as it passed over me, then turned northwest (toward and over Colby, by my estimation) before turning due south and disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During one of the earlier sightings, maybe two weeks prior to the 24 March sighting, I had noticed a number of other odd happenings in the sky, including two very bright lights about five or ten degrees off the southern horizon that flashed on for about two seconds, then slowly dimmed like stadium lights being turned off.  These flashed on and off for about two minutes before disappearing outright.  I also noticed several larger-than-usual aircraft flying due west over a roughly half-hour period on either side of seeing the triangle, these could have been passenger aircraft but they would have had to be flying lower than usual to appear as large as they did.  I was on the phone with a friend during this whole time, and recall relaying to him several oddities that night.  No aircraft followed the triangle, but the other oddities happened in a time frame centered on the triangle flying over.  I remember commenting on the fact that almost all the other aircraft were moving due west, as usually the aircraft at this time (this sighting was right around 20:30, just before the time change) are moving in various directions and are not as highly concentrated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

A bright light in the sky caught my eye, which at first looked like a regular star, but it was awfully bright and it would flash every 10-15 seconds. It was already starting to turn daylight at the time of this sighting, plus I can&#39;t recall seeing any clouds (it was mostly clear all night long with distant visibility) that might&#39;ve hindered this light. I shall add that there were trees outside, but quickly concluded that the trees were not causing the flashing, as I witnessed this light flashing without the branches blocking the view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To clarify location of sighting, it is located about 7 miles north of Johnstown and about a mile south of U.S. Route 22. There is also a small airport about 10 miles southeast, but I doubt it was a plane, the light was stationary too long.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I originally observed an object that had a trail just like a shooting star but it was orange in color. The object was about 10-20 degrees NW of where I was. I continued to observe the object and after about 15-30 secs the trail went away and the object changed to a white color just like an airplane would look like. The object was traveling in a SE path, and once it reached to about east-southeast of where I was, I could no longer see it behind the clouds and houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I listened to it fading like that, I thought it might be a helicopter from the nearby army base, Fort Indiantown Gap, PA. I went out from underneath our porch to see if I could see anything. I saw lights through our grape arbor that were sort of yellow, but they were moving. I thought it might be the moon and I might just be swaying or something. When they came out from under the cover of our grape arbor, I saw two lights that were horizontal to each other. I watched them soar across the sky at a sort of slow speed across the sky, about fifteen seconds and they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was the only witness that time. So anyways, I asked my girl friend “do you see that?” and she said “yes I see something in the sky moving fast then slow and in weird directions”. “Yes that’s exactly what I see” I said. I then ran in to my apartment to get my roommates so that they could take a look. They both saw it too and they thought it was odd also. But they didn’t stick around to watch and they went back inside. I stayed a little longer to see if the objects behavior would change. It seemed to get further away. The UFO was in the sky in the direction of Lebanon NH a neighboring town to Canaan. The UFO seamed to stay in the same kind of region of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok so the UFO looked like a saucer from the side. It looked like it had a row of sequencing lights along the length of it. It had a red light in the center and two lights on the sides of the red light. Sometimes the two lights on either side of the red light were blue and sometimes they were white. Most of the time they were white but when they were blue it was brilliantly bright like the red one. So at all times the UFO had three lights constantly blinking. When I stood still it seemed to move more and when I moved around a lot it seemed to ….well try and hide from me like it could see me or sense me looking, and it would stop moving and would stand still or even stop blinking and look like a star. It was bizarre. This object was making shapes with its movements such as triangles, half squares, what I mean by half squares I mean shapes like this. It would go back and forth and up and down or in a direction but at an angle. It was doing half circles like this C. I mean seriously I’ve never seen any object in the sky make these movements before. I’ve watched lots of shows about UFOs in my life and they seemed very similar to some of the things I saw. From what I understand humans don’t have the technology to make movements like that. The movements were absolutely acrobatic. It was so unnatural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So that’s my report, hope it can help in your research or do something for you somehow.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I believe at the time the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range was directly south of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw one pulsating light, I think it was orange, for a few minuets. Then other lights popped out of nowhere. They were fairly far away.  They did unnatural formations around each other. They weren’t fixed in place. Occasionally they would disappear, and then the main one would come back and pulsate for a little while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of their formations seemed to be the stair stepping formation. Sometimes they would pulsate while they where flying. It was obvious that they weren’t fixed in place as sometimes they would fly fully lit in formations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their altitude varied in height constantly, which was what was so unnatural about it. They were probably no more than 30,000 feet. They would fly as if gravity didn’t matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were directly south of us almost the entire time, almost as if they were going along with us. As we got further west, we thought they were done but eventually the one pulsating light came back again. It stayed until we drove further west and finally seemed to not be going along with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know I wasn&#39;t the only one to see this as there were many others driving that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My biggest regret is not stopping to get my camera out of the trunk!<n>
3/23/09 10:30|South Zanesville|OH|Sphere|10 sec|Looked like end of a Q-Tip, beachball sized object appeared from north to south, daytime, color matched cloud horizon, 80mph at 60'.|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69556.html|85|ndxe200903| Looked like end of a Q-Tip, beachball sized object appeared from north to south, daytime, color matched cloud horizon, 80mph at 60&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a fifty-six year old male and I’ve debated about reporting this event for several days.  A friend of mine is a believer and he encouraged me to tell you about what happened last Monday.  My son and I were working on the exterior of one of our customer’s buildings.  My son was on the roof at the northeast corner and I was on the ground looking up at his position.  It was a beautiful day with bright blue skies and wispy clouds at the horizon.  I was observing all the planes that were in the sky above us and was amazed how many there were at that time.  The contrails were long and well defined.  As I was watching the planes and keeping an eye on my son I noticed an object coming into to my line of sight from my left.  It was traveling from my north to the south, directly behind the building we were working on, at about 60 to 80 feet above the ground.  When I first focused on the object to determine what I was seeing, I dismissed a bird because there were no wings, no head, no movement a bird normally makes when it flies, ie; beating wings, up and down pattern as the a bird raises and lowers it’s wings in flight darting back and forth, etc.  Was it a radio controlled plane?  No.  Then I really started to focus, because this was making me uncomfortable.  I yelled at my son so he could verify what I was witnessing.  He did not acknowledge me.  He was busy.  I really yelled his name again and he raised his head in frustration.  What!  He yelled back.  Look! Look! Look!, I said.  Did you see that?  I said to him.  See What?, he asked.  That thing that just went behind the building in the sky.  No!, he said.  See what, Dad?  I paused for a moment, not believing what I had seen and that no one would ever believe what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, here comes the important part.  Details of what I saw last Monday.  There was a railroad track behind the building and the object was following the tracks or at least it seemed to be.  This, whatever it was, was about 60 to 80 feet above the ground and traveling at about 80 miles per hour.  It was small, about the size of a beachball.  (Not sure because things don’t look as big when they’re elevated that high.)  With my first description, to my son, I thought it was the size of a bowling ball and white in color.  After I replayed this sighting in my mind I changed that description.  It looked like the end of a Q-Tip.  It was almost fuzzy and the color matched the clouds in the horizon.  The only reason I saw it was I was looking up and the blue skies allowed me to spot it.  If I had been on the same plane with the object it would have blended into the clouds in the horizon.  One of the more interesting things to me was that it was traveling as if it were on a rail.  It never varied in it’s path.  It never ascended or descended.  I’ve never seen anything that didn’t vary a bit one way or the other.  Anyway, I watched the object until it blended into the clouds in the horizon at about ½ mile to the south of my location.  The fuzziness that surrounded the object seemed to be consistent.  It didn’t change or pulse.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/23/09 09:50|Morgantown|WV|Disk|30 seconds|Saucer-like object seen passing by downtown Morgantown|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69346.html|86|ndxe200903| Saucer-like object seen passing by downtown Morgantown<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in a classroom and happened to look out the window just at the moment a spacecraft-looking object passed by.  It was moving at what I would call a normal velocity for an airplane (i.e. did not zip by). It was moving in such a way that it passed by all the windows in the classroom, so I had about 30 seconds to look closely at the object. At first I thought it was an airplane, but did not see any wings or tail; the object looked just like a saucer or the generic idea of what a UFO might look like. I honestly couldn&#39;t believe my eyes and kept watching as it passed by, looking intently because I expected to recognize it as an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m terrible at gauging distances, but the object seemed close enough to where I would have expected to hear some noise from the jets, were it an airplane.  I did not hear anything. The lack of tail was especially puzzling and I&#39;m still convinced the object was not an airplane.<n>

I walked into my living room which is all glass, and the night sky was exceptionally clear, no clouds.  In between some palm fronds I noticed something that was EXTREMELY bright, like a planet, but upon further inspection, I noticed it had a somewhat strange shape, somewhat of a triangle, with a larger flat top and pointed bottom.  It seemed to be &#34; pulsing&#34; bright, dimmer,brighter, dimmer, AND was moving in a jerky side to side motion, while very slowly moving upward, I lined my head up with the wall of the sliding glass door to make sure I wasn&#39;t moving and I watched this thing making a weird, loopy motion, sort of wobbling here and there, but always slowly moving upwards, while it still kept getting VERY bright, then dimming, and getting bright, over and over.  I know it wasn&#39;t a plane, or a helicopter, or a satellite, or a star, etc........ and as I said, I have seen this same type of &#34; star like&#34; object, ( MANY times through my life from the time I was a teenager, and I am now 56) that if you were to just glance at it, would seem like a planet or star, but if you start to stare at it, you notice it is doing very bizarre things, just subtlely, as you study it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I once observed an object like this on a beach in Oxnard, Calif. at 5 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> which was just above the horizon of the ocean.  Some surfers were in the ocean, and the sun was just barely starting to come up.  The object went directly into the ocean !!!!!   I was STUNNED, and apparently the surfers were too because they started yelling and screaming and going wild !!!! We had all witnessed something of the most bizarre nature, not knowing what to think.   I witnessed the object I am reporting now, for about 30-40 min. before I noticed it started waning in intensity, and it just &#34; went out&#34; and vanished in a perfectly clear night sky............<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Lots of commercial planes flew that time and we are able to see it. Then I saw some strange light turquoise with a similar oval shape, moving too fast and making strange trajectories. I thought that could be military airplanes, since I live near the air force academy. But then I saw something real strange, the light had become stationary about 15 seconds, and then I make some things real strange. First I had make it circular maneuvers and the I saw the light flipping several times and then a real big noise, like the plane breaking the sound barrier. And the UFO just vanished in black sky. The UFO could not be very high, because has clowns in that night. Normal the commercial planes I can see the shape, even some times I can see what company they belong. This was strange. Too bad I didn’t have any recording machine available  at that time it would be interesting. Any way I saw films about some maneuvers that modern aircraft can do, but Portugal doesn’t have that planes, the only modern planes they have is the F-16 and Dassault Alpha-Jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They are all independant lights , as they were to far away from each other to be one unit.. they flown over in a very straight line and dissapeared one at a time,not that they were too high more like the light had been dimmed and turned off, we knocked on the neighbour who came out to see,, and the another neighbour was out watching as well.. we saw the last two lights moved around eachother before heading towards us and dissapearing as the others did. my husband tryed to get photos of them but they are not very clear as they were to far away and it was too dark to focus.. we are just hopeing other people around north manchester have seen them,and let us know, we think it&#39;s not the last time we see them again,, hopefully not another year away...the photos are showing orange lights but go to pixalated when zoomed in, but you can see they are all the same size and colour.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pulled into my driveway and looked up at the stars because they were so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what I assumed was a satellite, and said to my wife and two kids hey look at the satellite, they got out of the car and looked up and said where? My wife and daughter went in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I couldn&#39;t see anything moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I said, oh I could have sworn I saw something moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son said oh yaw there it is, and it was moving slower than a few seconds before when I saw it from in the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the corner of the roof of the house to see if it was really moving and it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it started moving a little faster so you could easily see that it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for a couple of seconds and I saw it jerk real quick to the right about an inch, (as your looking at the stars) and then back. I thought that it was my eyes playing tricks on me so I didn&#39;t say anything , But my son said hey that moved back and forth real fast didn&#39;t it .I said with total surprise you saw that ? And he said yaw it moved, I asked what direction it moved in, and he motioned with his hands what it did. Showing the same direction and movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as we watched, it picked up speed moving in the same direction (North) and it moved really fast and we lost sight of it in a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I traveled closer I was able to see that the lights were part of an aircraft/mechanical object.  This object was directly above the southeast corner of the I-25 to C-392 interchange.  The object was comprised of square shaped beams making up a metallic silver cross of equal dimension on the x and y axis, with a circular shaped ring of the same silver metallic material that encompassed the outside of the cross and connected at the ending points of the cross itself.  The distance/size across the bottom of the cross/ring section was approximately 50 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a large dome light in the direct center of the &#34;cross,&#34; and four smaller lights at the end points of cross sections just prior to where the circular section met the square cross sections.  There was a dark, solid section that extended above the cross/circle, but I was unable to identify any specific details/shape of this dark colored area.  It’s height seemed to be about one third to half the size of the width of the craft.  The five lights on the bottom of the craft were solid white, neither blinking nor changing color.  The large center light was the lowest part of the craft, with no type of landing gear or runners (such as seen on helicopters) being visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was perfectly stationary as it &#34;hovered&#34; in the air, neither tilting nor moving in any specific direction.  After I passed by/under it, and traveled for approximately ¼ of a mile, the craft tilted on an approximate 30 degree slant and began to slowly travel towards the west.  I could no longer identify/see the craft after five minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were numerous people/cars traveling on the road at this time who also could have seen this craft quite easily, but I have not been able to find any mention of this type of craft or anyone who saw it and/or had the opportunity to photographed or video capture the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The object was a considerable distance away, yet visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t think anything of it because I thought it was a star at first.  I was watching a movie with my son, and my peripheral vision caught it yet again, minutes later. It was now hovering slightly lower. I thought again that I was making this up, when I would glance at the television, and minutes later I noticed it was now only visible through the tree limbs.  I asked my son to take a look, noting where to look and asked him to tell me what he saw. He said he saw a silver light, sometimes flashing and sometimes not.  There was no sunlight at this time, so it could not have been a reflection of light off of some craft like a plane, or blimp, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went outside and looked with the binoculars to get a closer look. This was now some 20 minutes from the 1st notice of this object.  As we looked with our own eyes, and then with the binoculars, we noticed it wasn’t a star. Now, we had a few stars out so that we could make a comparison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was probably 10+miles off to the west, near the city of Tampico.  The object disappeared behind some dark clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was gone out of sight about 715pm. I went onto the internet to see if there had been any UFO sightings in Yakima.  I was amazed to see how many there were. This is another to add.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It rapidly moved acrosss the sky, in front of us. It stayed there about 20 seconds and speed up and moved away and out of site.  The entire incidence took about 2 minutes.  We had time to show our son and question what the object might be.  The object was the size of a airplane nose to tail from our distance.  It had no wings and was very shiny, which is what grabbed my attention.  It appeared to be shaped like a saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was the driver, our son and I were observers.  Both my husband and I are dentists.  Our son is 10 years old.<n>

It was quite big, the biggest flying object ive ever seen. It made several turns without banking like a normal aircraft, and kept constant speed as it turned. We watched it for about five min. Also the radio went in and out a couple times before it dissappeared into the night sky. We also noticed about six or seven helicopters following it about two to three miles apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Spherical in shape and orange in colour. Exact location provided including latitude/longitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving to work and had just joined the Motorway (highway). I noticed 2 objects in the sky to my right which were clearly NOT a natural phenomenon.  They looked so strange that I pulled over straight away to have a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were spherical in shape and glowing a deep orange colour.  They were both in close proximity to each other but one looked to be higher than the other one as though they were flying in formation.  They weren&#39;t too high up - defiantly a lot lower than aeroplanes fly.  They looked to be travelling at helicopter speed, not as fast as planes usually fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects passed over the top of my position.  As they came into view on my left side, they instantly sped up and quickly went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had tried to get my mobile phone out to record the objects but by the time I thought about doing it the objects had sped up so I wouldn&#39;t have caught them in time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the time it was a dark sky but quite clear.  There weren&#39;t many clouds in the sky though the objects would still have been visible in thick cloud as they were well below cloud level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you look on Google Earth, the exact location I was parked watching this was: M60 motorway, Manchester 53°32&#39;25.23&#34;N 2°12&#39;57.70&#34;W The objects were travelling from the direction of &#34;Middleton&#34; - a nearby town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were travelling in a South Westerly direction towards &#34;Prestwitch.&#34; I was travelling northwards hence the object passing from my right to my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am open to science and had always been willing to accept there may be UFO&#39;s visiting us but had never believed most of the reports you read about. I always thought the people reporting would probably be trying to earn money from a story rather than be truthful of the situation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no background in UFOlogy and I do not do this as a hobby. I don&#39;t study internet reports and it generally doesn&#39;t interest me, I just wanted to share my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For those of you who are interested, I hope this has helped your research.<n>

At first they just swirled and circled; they were too high to have been operated from the ground as I saw that they were at a high ehough elevation that, when a plane was taking off from Lindburg Field at San Diego International Airport, it passed near the same elevation.  The other reason is that there was a dense fog and the objects were going what looked like into and out of the cloud cover.  They were flat and saucer shaped but initially looked like a ball of light.  The light pulsed, was white in nature and one changed to red. I went inside to get my boyfriend and when I came out they were gone.<n>

PD))|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69400.html|108|ndxe200903| 03/21/09 Four lights circling approx 6 stories high in residential are, unattached to one another or other object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> March 21, 2009.  Approx. 8:30 pm EST in McMurray, PA 15317.  Overcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Drove out of driveway and noticed 4 lights in the sky that were revolving in a large circle.  Initially thought someone was having a party with strobe lights, but the temp was only about 50 degrees F.  and there was no party outside.   The four lights were revolving in a circular pattern parallel to the ground, but not obviously attached to one another.  Sometimes two would join and revolve together while the other two continued the revolutions.  They were rarely perfectly symmetrical from one another revolving in a circle like shape.   Each orb was approximately 4’ in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to drive slowly down our road the lights remained and moved ahead of me on the left side of the road over the houses and were approx. 5-6 stories high.  Before I got to the main road I wanted to find out what would happen if I stopped.  I turned off the car and radio and lights after opening the window to determine if I could hear anything.  The four lights/orbs remained in place circling above the houses near the end of my street – where I had stopped.  A few cars entered our subdivision and left it during the approx. 15 minutes I sat watching the lights, but the lights never varied or went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to go to CVS to get medication for my husband and decided that I couldn’t wait any longer.  Started the car, went to the stop light and crossed to go south on Rt. 19.  The lights crossed ahead of me and were now on the right side of the road.  Due to lots of streetlights and business lights on Rt. 19 I was unable to see where the lights were and thought they might have disappeared.  When I arrived at CVS about  1 mile from home, the four orbs now were circling over the rear of CVS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside, made my purchase and returned to my car – the orbs were still there circling.  I was tempted to call someone from CVS out to see the lights, but wanted to keep it to myself because it was so fascinating.  I returned home and could not see the lights on the return drive until I got to our subdivision again.  Again the lights were on the right side of the street (where they originally were when I went out).  When I pulled in my driveway I called my husband outside.  All I did was point to the sky and ask him what he saw.  He saw lights spinning and there were four.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now it was about 8:55 pm/20:55 and I wanted to find out if I could get any closer to the lights so walked toward my neighbors’ houses where the lights were.  They revolved in a clockwise messy circle (not attached to anything and not particularly round) and retained a constant speed.  I could not determine the exact color, but they weren’t bright enough to be white so I thought perhaps bright blue or green.  As I watched them and the clouds started to clear, I noticed that as a light/orb passed through clear sky, it virtually disappeared and reappeared once behind cloud cover.  There was no light on the ground (no flashlight effect) from them.  The color may have been blue since disappeared when passing through dark blue evening sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I moved forward down our street toward the lights, they moved forward as well and appeared to keep a distance of two house lots between me and them.  The clouds were breaking up and the lights disappeared more frequently with clear sky.  I went inside at about 9:05 to check on my husband and when I came back out at 9:15, the sky was clear and there was no sign of the lights.  Unfortunately I never thought to get my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  PD))<n>

After a series of turns in my car I looked again and saw that the lights hadn&#39;t moved and was amazed to see them suddenly blink out.  Therefore - whatever it was had been stationary for 3 mins. at least - and wasn&#39;t an aircraft coming into land.  All I saw were extremely bright white lights.<n>

I decided to take a quick couple of photos while at a stop light since it looked so cool.  When I checked out the photo shortly after, I ruled out the look of the sun in the pic as an optical illusion from taking the pic in the direct sunlight, but the sphere in the top left hand area of the photo I always found very interesting.  You also see a jet plane streaking underneath the sphere going East to West.  As I was going through my family photos I came across the picture once again along with a second picture I took around the same time.  In this second picture the sphere appears to have moved and is more in the center and below the sun.  This is when I said okay maybe the sphere is not an illusion and maybe the jet planes were checking this thing out; far-fetched theory but very cool pictures.  Maybe an expert can enlighten me to what I possibly captured in these photos.  The camera phone was a 2 megapixel on a Samsung Instinct smartphone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate.<n>

It had a bright red light and a couple other white lights but none were blinking. I parked my car after seeing it and waited for a minute to see it move, but it didn&#39;t. I noticed that 2 police officers were outside looking at it. There were many more people around but they did not notice it. It seems that most people don&#39;t see UFOs when they do show up. I started to get closer to it but then it started to move in the opposite direction. I chased it down the highway going 60 miles per hour, but I still couldn&#39;t catch it. After a mile down the road, it turned of all white lights and it only had its red light on.

Each disc had eight bright blue circular lights around the perimeter of the craft.  The lights were estimated to be 14-16 inches in diameter. They were hovering and making quick small motions darting slightly left than right and up and down. One of the two craft even slightly wobbled for a couple seconds. One of the craft than appeared to dart away completely east and disappeared.  Excited I woke my wife a she saw the same thing.  We also overheard some neighbors two houses down the street talking in an excited manner about the crafts, so we are not the only ones to have witnessed this.  The remaining craft slowly lowered down than disappeared.  One more thing the blue lights occassionally dimmed about three times and once when out completed for a second before becoming bright again. One more thing there were no sounds.

PPB officers usually ride alone in patrol cars but it was the week of Spring Break and night-shift officers, like myself, were asked to pair up to enforce city curfew ordinances that night. At approximately 21:10 hours, my partner and I were dispatched to cover another officer who was responding to the report of a domestic disturbance. The problem address was located either three or four houses north from the intersection of N Moore Ave/N Jarrett St. Portland, OR 97217 (Latitude: 45.565156, Longitude: -122.667971).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we were done assisting the primary officer on that call (~23:30), we remained outside our cars to discuss the night’s events to that point. As we were talking, I glanced to the southwest and noticed two gleaming lights, flying in formation, moving in an east-southeasterly direction. I pointed out the lights to my partner and we walked south 15 or so yards to the NW corner of the intersection. We stood there and continued to watch the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two lights were visible against thick, high clouds. It was not raining, there was no noticeable wind, and no stars were visible. The lights were a pale streetlight-amber, the lights shown steadily, and about were approximately three to four times the diameter of the brightest/largest star I have ever seen in the night sky. The height of the clouds helped me estimate the sources of the lights were no larger than a small shuttle bus. There were no aircraft navigation strobes or safety beacons visible on or near the two light sources.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner and I both commented we could not hear any sound coming from the lights. The two objects were moving at a speed I judged to be slower than a typical propeller aircraft could travel. We assumed if the light sources were helicopters we were close enough to hear the blades of their rotors and see additional lights on the aircraft. Aircraft was audible in the distance to the northeast. Portland International Airport is only a few miles from that area. However, it struck me as odd that the lights were flying eastbound since almost all air traffic approaches the airport from the south or east. My partner is a captain in the Army National Guard and is familiar with military aircraft. He had no idea what we were watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two lights were flying in a loose formation, at the same altitude but one slightly ahead of the other. The northernmost light was leading. The lights’ relative proximity to one another was also out of the ordinary. I estimated the source of each light was approximately 25’ in diameter. With those dimensions, I would guess the distance between the two lights was 150-250 yards. It is very unusual to see aircraft flying that near to one another over the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights began to turn toward the south in a lazy arc. The leading light took a wider turn than the other. As they did so, we were surprised to see another pair of lights following the first pair. The second pair of lights was at the same altitude, moving at the same speed, and flying in the same general formation as the first pair. The distance between the two pairs of lights was hard to estimate but I would guess there was a half-mile or so between the two pairs of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner had received orders he was deploying to Iraq in a few weeks and had bought a video camera in preparation for his departure. He had brought the camcorder to work that night, and he ran back to our patrol car to retrieve it. He returned and began filming the lights as the first two lights began to disappear out of view behind some tall trees. The second pair of lights followed the same course and began to make the same turn to the south when something odd began to happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The southern light of the second pair slowed noticeably and began to flicker. The random tempo and change in luminosity of the flickering reminded me of a lit candle in a slight breeze. The flickering had been going on for about eight seconds or so when we both saw something begin to “drip,” multiple times, from the bottom of the object. The molten substance was the same color as the light and it dimmed then sputtered out as it fell from its source. The speed at which the incandescent substance fell from light indicated to me it had significant mass. For example, a drip fell at a greater rate than that of a fizzling firework ember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eyes traveled downward in-line with some of the drips. I saw the material reignite briefly although it was significantly dimmer. Overall, I estimated it would have taken the material ten seconds to fall to the ground. That intuitive estimate of altitude helped me get a bearing on how far away the lights were from us. I suppose the nearest light passed within 15-25 blocks south of our location. My partner stated military aircraft are forbidden to drop flares over populated areas in order to prevent fires. No unexplainable fires were reported in that neighborhood that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flickering light eventually stabilized and began glowing steadily again as it continued moving to the south-southeast. I estimate we watched the lights for the better part of two minutes. The non-flickering lights did not move toward or away from the flickering light.  That led me to think the flicking light was not in distress.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not get the opportunity to view the footage my partner filmed. He promised me he would get me a copy of the raw video but failed to do so before being shipped out to the Middle East. I imagine it looks like all the other night UFO videos in that it depicts a strange light with a black background. I do not know if he caught the flickering and dripping on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything else in my life that I would call a UFO.  My partner and I discussed what we had seen for the rest of the evening and were unable to come up with a plausible explanation for what we had witnessed.<n>

I guess my peripheral vision detected a slight movement so I continued to look at the 2 stars.  Soon I realized that the right light was actually moving east very slowly.  Its light was a distinct muted red, definitely a different red from Mars.  If I were to measure the distance of travel at arm’s length it moved about 8-9 inches in the night sky.  It moved to the east for about 2 minutes and then stopped, soon after it just stayed in one position and after 30 seconds or so it began to slowly and steadily fade away until it was completely gone as if it were leaving Earth’s atmosphere.  It took about a minute to completely vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what it wasn’t.  It was not a satellite, airplane, jet, helicopter, weather balloon, Chinese floating lantern or anything else that I have seen before.  I do not know what it was.  I would love to understand what I saw.  I feel very lucky to have witnessed this event.  I keep asking myself, what the hell was it that I saw?!  I am curious to know if any other folks saw what I saw in the San Francisco sky.<n>

Every once in a while, some clouds would roll in, but at the time of the sighting, the sky was clear.  We were facing the West and off to the SW I noticed an aircraft traveling West to East.  I pointed it out to my nephew.  From the lights and sound, I could easily tell it was a jet.  A few seconds later, right overhead (North of the jet), we see this bright, yellow light moving about the same speed as the jet, moving along with it, West to East, about the same speed as the jet.  It seemed like it might have had two very faint red lights on the rear, but no lights on any wings.  You could barely make out red lights because the yellow light was so bright.  We heard the jet briefly, but didn&#39;t notice any sound from the yellow light object.  Maybe it got drowned out from the jet noise.  I&#39;ve sat out on my deck lots of nights and see lots of aircraft flying overhead and am used to the light configurations on them, but I haven&#39;t seen anything really like this before.  I don&#39;t believe it was a meteor, or any kind of space debris, or satellite because it was moving too slow and didn&#39;t seem to &#34;burn up&#34;.  It was too bright to be a satellite.  The yellow light was a lot brighter than I&#39;m used to and no lights at all on the craft were flashing.  They just stayed on and were consistent in color and brightness the entire time.  Whatever it was I think it was flying around the same altitude as the jet, or maybe higher, because even though it was at night, I&#39;ve seen low flying planes and helicopters at night and can usually make out their outline.  I couldn&#39;t make out any outline on this.  Even low flying planes with their landing lights don&#39;t seem as bright as this thing was. At first I thought it might be ISS, but I&#39;ve seen it before and it seemed a bit too slow to be ISS, and brighter from what I remember, plus there were the two faint, red lights to the rear of it that didn&#39;t seem consistent with ISS.  I thought maybe this might be! some ki nd of new aircraft I&#39;m not used to seeing, maybe military since the jet was near.  If anyone can solve this mystery, I&#39;d greatly appreciate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(For orientation and topographical purposes a description follows :   The lot is about 3 acres in size roughly triangular in shape with the broadest part toward the road.  The front of the house faces NE.  The entire lot is surrounded by woods with tall pines and hardwoods.  Elevation is 345 ft. , topography is low rolling hills.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed two bright lights traveling low through the trees and to the south west.  We thought it might be a helicopter but there was no sound.  The object continued on and became more visible as it approached the house while line of travel was to the west of our house.  The object was traveling from SW to NE.  The estimated time of observation from first sight to last sight was about a minute to a minute and a half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object description based on full observation period: triangle shape, about 50 to 60 feet wide, 3 large round lights each located at the points of the triangle and underneath and visible at all points of observation, green flashing light above and centered over bottom light and red flashing light at rear.  (90 degree side view and at closest point of observation) : 3 large lights visible underneath,  green light on front , red light on  rear, toward the front of the object and well above the under side was a row of about six very bright lights that appeared to be windows They were shaped  like vertical  rectangles with slightly rounded corners and side by side, these lights being toward the front of the object.  The only sound  was that of a large object passing through the air.  The sound could only be heard shortly before the object reached the 90 degree observation point and shortly after it passed this point,  otherwise there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following are estimates based on knowledge of the terrain, distance at 90 degree observation and prior training and experience:  SPEED between 30 and 40 mph; ALTITUDE between 300 to 400 feet; DISTANCE AT 90 DEGREE OBSERVATION POINT 150 to 175 yards (land measurement).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background:  4 years USMC Air Wing (air frames mechanic); 20 years Jackson, MS Police Dept.

I noticed a bright light moving fairly quick, flying much higher than an airplane. I told my husband to take a look at it and he mentioned that it was probably a satellite, although it was much too low and moving much too fast to be a satellite. We watched it move east, and my husband then decided it was a high flying airplane, but then we noticed it move in front of a low altitude cloud. Meanwhile a descending airplane flew south above us and when the strange light intersected the path of the airplane it stopped and then quickly shot off to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we came back out an hour later, the temperature had dropped significantly and I had become nauseous and my husband began to shake. We noticed that there was a lot of movement up above, lights flying past quickly, as well as several much brighter shifting lights in triangular formations. There were multiple sets of these formations. These were not stars because the lights that seemed to be hovering were not covered by passing clouds. My husband describes witnessing several lights emitting other, lesser lights. They did this in such a way that it seemed they were arching out of the bright light in symmetry. This seemed to be happening around, inside, and above faint clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both thought these clouds were strange. The clouds seemed teaming with activity. Some lights just hovered in one spot, some would rock back and forth, other would rise softly and drop dramatically, sweeping away into the horizon, much like the very first light we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All these lights moved gracefully and moved at incredibly fast rates. We also noticed that some of these lights seemed to shake softly, in the way a pen would move across paper while writing. We kept watching this, and the activity never seemed to let up. We became colder and more nauseated and had to go back inside. Once inside, we felt drained of our energy and fell asleep quickly in all our clothes, and slept uninterrupted for the next 10 hours.<n>

I went inside to get my dad and told him i saw something odd in the sky and then he came out and i saw it again but he did not. It came around a 3rd time and he saw it and we though it may be a searchlight but it had no pattern and it was oddly shaped and then we though maybe a stealth bomber but it was the wrong shape and bird was out of the question so we were left with a ufo.

Within 20 minutes I&#39;d say we witnessed another object of the same color come out of the east and then begin to cross to the north. It&#39;s direction was a straight line I might add. It didn&#39;t seem too make any sudden movements or anything to that extent. However, we know that it did not make any sound whatsoever. Also, there were sever other aircraft seen coming from the east going west at the time. So who knows but we were able to catch it and I&#39;d figure i&#39;d post it. I seriously doubt that these were satelites given what time of day we were witnessing these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source of alleged sightings of UFO&#39;s.

I left the border town of Palomas, Mexico at 10:32 and had traveled approximately ten miles north on New Mexico highway 11, within a couple of minutes after passing thru a permanent Border Patrol check point I noticed an object in the sky to the north west of my traveling vehicle, at first glance I thought it was a commercial aircraft, after two or three minutes I became aware it was not moving.  I estimate the object was over 1000 ft. above the ground.  The object resembled a tube that was larger on both ends similar to having a 747 bulging cockpit on both ends size large but size relative to a 747 is unknown and I could not identify any wings, white on top shaded on the bottom and I observed the object for 15 minutes while I traveled. After about six minutes total time it was directly to my left and still not moving. I estimate its distance from the road to be four miles plus or minus one mile. As I continued moving I kept looking back, the object remained where I had originally seen it but it became harder to find as I was driving. when I was about eleven miles from Deming New Mexico I could no longer identify it. It may have moved or it was just to difficult to see in the scattered cloudy sky while driving at 60 mph. Please don&#39;t criticize my looking behind while driving, there was only scattered traffic and at least I never use a cell phone while driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange part of this is the object did not move, it hovered or at least from a moving car it appeared to hover in one location throughout the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have an engineering degree and I firmly do not believe in alien aircraft. There were other vehicles on the highway that should have seen the object, the border patrol agents at the checkpoint may have seen the object although it would have been behind them as they faced the traffic they would be checking. What I saw is unidentified, at least by myself, Einstein&#39;s theories seem to preclude the possibilities of space travel and until somebody, as advance in their thinking as Einstein comes up with a better theory I will continue to not believe in space travel, but I saw what I saw.<n>

Only the reflection of light was seen off the house and trees. No object was observed. This is the second time the same incident has occurred.

I too was so tired that my eyes were getting to heavy to hold open.  I had the radio turned very loud and singing trying to stay awake.  I was only 15 minutes from home.  Driving through a community called Carolina just outside Andalusia I thought I saw lighting in the clouds but no signs of rain in the area.  I assumed it was just another scattered shower with flickering lighting.  No big deal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove on and there is a house on the left side of the road that had a bright blue light in the front yard.  I thought it was a bug lamp in a new color.  I was driving by so the blue light seemed to be moving and not connected to anything, but since I was moving in my car I just thought it was me and my eyes were playing games on me since I was so sleepy.  I keep driving when I noticed something else a little odd.  Above the tree tops was alot of flickering light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My thoughts were, &#34;What crazy contruction crew would be working at 3:30 in the morning&#34;.  It was bright and flickering continously.  Within a few seconds I realized that the lights were moving ajacent with me and then consider it to be a helicopter with a ultra bright light possibly looking for something (I assumed a drug force looking for possible drug related plants or vegetation.)  It was the most logical thing I could think of at the time.  I was more focused to get home til I realized I started to feel like I was being followed by this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is where I had a rude awakening..... I realize this &#34;helicopter&#34; is getting ahead of me due to it speeding up slightly, and I am slowing down alittle because I&#39;m getting curious.  It was just out of my direct vision.  Then it came out from behind the trees over the road.  I could see a bright white light coming from the bottom and it is about the length of a football field ahead of me.  It still seems to be a helicopter........ til I saw it tip to the side with the bottom toward me.  That is when I realized this thing is not anything my logic can assume or suggest.  It was, in fact, a small round saucer shaped craft.  The most common form that is seen on tv.  I start hitting, pushing, and shaking my friend to get her up and she is waking up so slowing even though I am in a clear panic.  See,  this thing is over the road.  I driving toward this thing..... under this thing.  Behind me is a hour before any town.  Andalusia is ahead... 8 minutes away.  I&#39;m going home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never turned down the radio so I can&#39;t tell you if there was any sound coming from it.  I can tell you that I drove under this thing without blinking and it was very beautiful.  It had a primary light source on the bottom center of the craft, there were smaller lights around the sides and it rotated quickly causing the flickering.  I remember that the light felt unusual on my eyes and the brightness didn&#39;t seem to hurt my eyes.  At this time I&#39;m in a full blown panic and floored my gas and drove going 70 to 75 mph home.  I did not want to go too fast I lost control of the car.  My friend never saw what I saw.  She does remember seeing the flickering light in the back windshield and always assumed it was an elabrate hoax I pulled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, at the moment of my passing under the craft, there was a small orangy red car on the road heading in the opposite direction. I know this car saw it to, because it slowed way down and looked like they were debating going under it.  I don&#39;t know what happen to the craft or the car.  All that happened almost directly under the craft and I was under a panic and just could not believe what I just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made it home.  I could not sleep despite my exhaustion.  My friend drove herself home still convinced I&#39;m lieing.  The next afternoon, I told my husband about every detail and he believed me.  I am a believer in God and the Bible.  This seems to have no place in reality of a Christian faith.  So, my husband knows I would not make this up.  My reply to this whole experience:  Even the truth about God is against logic but not reasoning.  God has absolute knowledge and I believe it is not in us to understand things that we cannot relate to therefore we disregard it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot disregard it since see is believeing, but I know we&#39;re are not alone.  I can&#39;t say that gives me peace.  Actually, I have alway loved traveling at night with no traffic.  Since the experience I don&#39;t travel past city limits at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to be able to talk to someone about this in a serious conversation and maybe have a better understanding of it all.  Please contact me through mail.  I don&#39;t give out my phone number.<n>

I noticed a couple of bright, yet discernible,lights moving from a NW to SE direction.  Often times I have seen Jetliners moving at a recognizable pattern involving a straight line flight or satellite movement which are very high above normal commercial aircraft flight patterns.  This was during spring break so my two children were at home and outside with me at the time,in fact, my oldest was the first to spot the bright approaching lights and coined the term &#34;Space wars&#34; after the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The leading craft was moving much faster than a normal high flying jetliner and was moving in a 30 degree zig-zag as if it was &#34;swimming&#34; (best way I can describe it) and it suddenly passed another very bright and stationary object.  Then, For the lack of a better description, it &#34;dematerialized&#34; and faded away after it passed the stationary object.  Once passed and it was no longer visible,immediately in a split second, it seemed as if another craft equally as bright with a streak trailing, shot/zipped past where first craft had been headed ,  As if it was attempting to intercept the first crafts position in one of it&#39;s zig-zag motions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It honestly looked like something was attempting to shoot it down and was making a &#34;leading shot&#34; just as if you would if you were shooting a fast moving object.However,instead of hitting the first object by anticipating it&#39;s location,  The first object had disappeared leaving whatever it was that was attempting to intercept it shooting off into the distance with a big bright streak behind it. Then the stationary craft illuminated very,very brightly and shot off into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like it in all my life. My daughter kept saying, &#34;They are shooting at each other&#34; over and over again until it woke my wife who was sleeping upstairs on the other side of the house she was so loud. My son, Who is 6 was there to he ran inside to grab is toy gun and a set of cheap tasco binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 20 minutes later there were several fast moving aircraft all over the place at about half the altitude of these objects. They did a number of grid like patterns then they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for me,I have been a police officer and I have been in the military as an imagery analyst and held a DoD TS/SSBI (Security Clearance) and my integrity has never been challenged or questioned when dealing with some of the highest military intel on the planet.. I can tell you without a doubt this was combat between two or three craft of extraterrestrial origin, without question!<n>

A group of six people reported seeing a fireball, said to be too large to be a meteor, moving towards the ground.  The witnesses all saw the same object, and they described it as appearing with a large tail, turning a greenish color approaching the ground. A sheriff&#39;s deputy was among the witnesses.  The group said that they thought the object had crashed nearby, but they did not see any fire or indication of impact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A truck driver on I-26 also reported a fireball and made a 911 call to the Hendersonville Police department.  In another, possibly seperate case, a TV station in Gastonia, Georgia, also recieved reports of fireballs at approximately the same date and time.  I was not a witness to this case, but I thought it would be of interest to NUFORC.

It seemed to be following the same path of the railroad tracks and river.It came in fast and suddenly slowed down completly silent.when it came in it seemed to roll left it had three white bright lights at three points black in color,a perfect tri-angle 50 to 75feet in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I spotted to the east 2 planes flashing red and white lights very high up heading west. I turned to the south and saw a delta shaped craft at a much lower altitude, heading northwest. It had 5 or 6 multi colored balls of  light, odd colors, not the typical red, green and white of regular aircraft. The tips of the triangle had yellow lights that flashed alternately back and forth. I didn’t hear it make any sounds. I tried to get my cell phone camera on, but couldn’t see it on my phone. I called my son to go outside and look up, it was heading in his direction, he saw it also. It flew in a straight line at normal speeds. It had to fly within a half mile of Bishop airport. Time observed about 1 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It made no sound.  It looked like spotlights but it kept going off in the distance.  We stood there in shock.  We waited to see if we could see it again and if it was really, spotlights after all but we did not see it again.  We took off running back to my house and told every body there.  I do not think anybody believed us.  It blew my mind.  Today I looked up pictures of stealth bombers during the nighttime to see any similarities.  It looked very different from what we seen.

At first I thought it was a star, but it seemed way too large and bright.  The object appeared to be stationary at this time.  I did see an airplane flying by in a NW direction, at what appeared to be a much lower altitude than the large light.  By comparison it&#39;s lights seemed exponentially smaller that the bright object in the sky that I was focused on. The two did not seem to interact in any way. As I watched it began to look more like 2 stars very close together, then the space between the white lights appeared to grow larger. When the horizontal distance between them reached a certain size, the object began to move south toward where I stood. At this point I knew it was not stars, so I thought it might be an airplane, but it seemed strange that it had hovered in one spot for so long before moving, not to mention the way the lights went from looking like one light only to looking like 2. As it flew over me relatively slowly, I could see it was a matte silver color, and triangle shaped with 2 larger bright white lights approximately in the center of it and 2 smaller ones that were closer together and directly behind the 2 larger ones. It did not have the flashing red or blue lights that you see on airplanes. These lights did not blink at all. I think I could hear it as it flew above me, but the noise was very low, not nearly as loud as any aircraft I&#39;ve ever experienced that was flying that low. Also the sound was more of a deep low hum that the usual roar of an engine. And I think I almost felt the hum more than I could hear it. As it flew over the house. I ran back in the house, through the living room and out the front door. I should have been able to still see it somewhere in the sky, but it was nowhere to be seen. It was moving rather slowly when it flew above me, and it only took me a few seconds to get out the front door.! From my front yard the part of the sky that&#39;s visible goes on very far in every direction, there are no tall buildings blocking the view for miles on every side.<n>

We were not drinking or under the influence of anything.  The hot tub was shut off, no music playing.  Just before getting out, I was looking at the southwest corner of the sky and it was completely dark. The stars were very visible to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I noticed an objects(s) traveling northwest.  My first impression was a gaggle of geese.  I directed my wife’s attention to the UFO and she asked if they were geese.  It was moving way to fast to be any kind of bird(s).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all went by very quickly, but the best way I can describe this object is that it looked like a “v” formation , with very dimly lit triangles in a very light orange or yellow luminescence. Maybe a total of 8-10 triangles forming a large &#34;v.&#34;  It moved very quickly and there was no noise whatsoever.  In a very short time it faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My last thought was maybe it was a military stealth bomber-the flying wing?   I don’t know, but it was enough for me to submit this sighting.<n>

I was in the window seat (15A) on the left hand side of the plan sitting directly beside the wing.  We were at cruising altitude of 3600 feet.  We were above the clouds and the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking out the window and could see several planes in the distance and started to look all around to see if I could see more planes.  I looked towards the rear of the plane and saw a dark object. It looked like a cigar.  It may have been a disc but I could not tell for sure because it looked as if I was looking at a side profile of the object.  The object appeared to be moving away from the plane I was on and was turning left.  It was also above the cloud line and there was no tail as seen with planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for about 30 seconds I took out my cell phone and tried to get a picture of the object.  However, by the time I got my phone out the object was gone.  It looked like the object had move so the plane was covering my view.  I still took a picture and there appears to be an object like I seen in it, but I am not sure if it is the object or the tail wing of the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to look out the window and about one minute later a jet fly by going in the same direct I seen the object go.  I could not tell what kind of jet it was, but there was black smoke trailing it unlike the white trails I was seeing from the other planes I saw.  I believe it to be a military jet and it was moving very, very fast!<n>

I exclaimed to my husband - &#34;look! A shooting star!  Make a wish!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> But what I thought was a star wasn&#39;t.  It didn&#39;t fade out, it seemed very close to Earth too close to be anything but an airplane), it made no noise at all, and the shooting star-like thing split, uniformly, into 4 parts.  The 4 parts looked like shooting stars, same size as the original and they moved slightly away from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After moving away from each other for 5 seconds, still going North East very quickly, they joined back up in a uniform fashion.  They didn&#39;t lose or gain speed, they just moved very fast at a steady pace.  By this time, I was squealing at my husband to get out of the car to see this, but the &#34;shooting star&#34; moved to a spot in the sky behind some trees in the yard, and I did not see it again.  I looked all around for anything that might have reflected light, like tree branches or power lines, but I found none.  This occurred in the middle of the night on a very quiet residential street, and no one else was around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no trains, cars, airplanes or clouds around at all. I hope I gave you enough info!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a very exciting experience!<n>

As I looked ahead, I saw what appeared to be a plane taking off.  It was flying at a height of about 250 feet, in an eastward direction at about a 30 degree angle.  It seemed strange, but I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it until I saw it make a dramatic climb in altitude.  It went from flying at a 30 degree angle to flying at about an 80 degree angle. It was practically flying vertically, and it was climbing altitude rapidly. After about 5 seconds of flying, it had probably risen to a height of about 600 feet. Then, it gradually began to level - off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it was level, it slowly turned left and headed north towards me and my dog.  It banked, and its triangular shape became apparent.  It was probably flying at around 70 miles per hour.  As it approached and passed overhead, I was able to see its underside.  It was clearly a triangular aircraft. It was black or gray in color, and it had one small white light on each corner (which made 3 white lights altogether), and one small red light in the center. It continued to fly north, and I watched it until it disappeared behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout the entire flight, it made a low whistling noise, similar to a quiet &#34;whoooosh&#34; sound. It sounded similar to the sound that an airplane makes as it moves through the air, but I didn&#39;t hear the humming of an engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire experience probably lasted about 1 minute.<n>

It was something that is not a common sight in the city.  As I was taking in the sky I noticed, what looked like, 5 stars that were brighter than the others. They looked to be as bright as planets in the sky. I don&#39;t know much about astronomy but I do know that there aren&#39;t that many planets to be seen that well, not to mention these &#34;stars&#34; were very close to one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple minutes of trying to figure out what they could be they began to move.  They had been fixed in the sky and now were moving towards one another.  They were in very close proximity and moving all around each other.  The best way to describe them is to compare them to gnats or moths flying around a light source only a lot slower.  When they first started moving I thought maybe they were lights from helicopters but I don&#39;t think helicopters fly that close to one another and not in those kinds of patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 30 seconds or so of being confused by what I was watching they moved, in unison and fairly quickly, over the tree-line and I could no longer see them.  These objects never made a noise that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am generally a skeptic when it comes to UFOs but I am really perplexed by what I saw. I have been searching the web since, trying to find a similar sighting.<n>

It vanished as I got passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way to work driving along the Mountain Parkway when i saw something large in the sky ahead of me.  I wouldn&#39;t have noticed it if it weren&#39;t for the lights on the front.  It was just above the trees and sat motionless.  From the distance I thought it was perhaps a plane or a helicopter but as I drew nearer I saw that it had a triangular shape and didn&#39;t wasn&#39;t making any sound.  I pressed the gas harder and quickly hurried on down the road.  I chanced a look back and was shocked to that it was gone. Where could something that big go that fast?<n>

The light was not extremely bright, like a police light or the sun, but rather like a blue runway light at the airport.  The light was steady and there were no other lights, flashing or otherwise.  It appeared as though the light might have been suspended under a small, white parachute, but it did not seem like the movement of the light was consistent with a parachute.  I only got a short look at it, since I was driving on the busy roadway, and I did not see any indication that anyone else noticed.<n>

At first it looked pink (like it was in the light of the setting sun) but as it continued ENE and rose to about 30 degrees above the horizon it gradually changed to a bright white. It&#39;s speed was constant and about the same speed as the commercial planes flying in the area. There were 6 aircraft in the immediate vicinity of the object and it appeared that one was following it for about 15 seconds while it was in the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband got binoculars and we both looked at it through the binoculars but all we saw was a larger point of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was silent and left no contrail  There were no blinking red or green riding lights on this craft. I&#39;d say it was magnitude -1 or so-it was bright.  It traveled across the northern sky heading east and was about 40 degrees above the northern horizon. As it got into the eastern sector of the sky it dimmed a bit and than disappeared  I checked to see if this was the ISS but there was no fly over of that or any other satellite in my area at 21:16.<n>

One was a seemingly oval object with numerous multi-colored lights on it, all flashing quickly and sporadically and changing colors as they did.  The second looked like a single red light.  They were both slowly flying south away from us maybe 20-30 degrees above horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my son run in the house to get my boyfriend and my other son to come out and see.  As we all watched, they continued moving south and the red light flew towards the other multiple lighted object until it looked like they would collide.  At that point, the red light object instantly became an oval object with numerous multi-colored, sporadically flashing lights just the same as the other.  When that happened, it began flying eastward away from the first object as they both continued moving south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched until they were out of view.<n>

We where able to see these objects in the clearing we had entered. We immediately stopped and begin watching the 2 stationary lights.  The lights seemed to glow slightly red and orange and where much larger and brighter than any thing else in the sky to include the standard air traffic and stars.  They then faded out one after the other at the same rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can assure you, being former USAF Crash Rescue, they were not aircraft, flares, or any other normal objects.  Nether of us were surprised about seeing the objects, we have witnessed a number of different unknown objects separately.  I recently found that as many as 5 other Firefighters and paramedics (1 while on duty) may have also witnessed this sighting, as well as a similar sighting 2 weeks earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Note: I am a member of SC MUFON, I thought I&#39;d just pass this along to you.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this witness, and to MUFON, for their sharing the sighting report with NUFORC.

I didn’t know what it was, so I didn’t respond immediately to it, but kept an eye on it. The light was big enough to notice but the trees were making the light indistinguishable. As we continued to drive home, I then saw the lights much more clearly. There were four huge circular lights, each light being bigger than that of a streetlight, flashing - then would disappear, then one huge circular light would appear and disappear, then four more huge lights would appear, then disappear…and the cycle of circular flashing lights continued in that pattern: four then one. They continued to flash and move at a steady pace toward the south. My brother-in-law was amazed at what he saw and yelled, &#34;What is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of us knew for sure what we were seeing.  I had moved slowly down the road observing it, and then stopped completely in the middle of the road to observe this odd and unique sight.  After about one minute it just disappeared out of sight.  This was my first sighting ever of something in the sky unexplainable.  If you would have asked me about UFOs before last night, I would have been a complete skeptic.  Neither of us can explain what it was that we saw last evening.  We just know it was definitely an Unidentified Flying Object coming from the north and traveling south.<n>

I thought it may have been an airplane but as it passed the brightness remained constant so I am sure it was not an airplane. There were no other lights just a bright blue-white spere very large and very high. It was not racing across the sky just moving at a moderate speed about as fast an airliner would fly by us being that we are close to ohare and midway airports. I was on the phone with my brother at the time who lives in the same town about a mile away and he could see it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It sounded at first like a car with a bad axle or something, with a repeating whistling noise I could only describe as “whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo”, only very highpitched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The noise got closer, but since there were no cars or anything else obvious we stopped to see where it was, and then could hear as it passed overhead. Based on the volume, it seemed close to us, and even made a “Doppler Effect” as it passed by. There were clouds so I couldn’t see it, but I did see what appeared to be a shadow on the clouds, as if something was passing by over them. The shadow was somewhat oval shaped, almost cigar shaped, but was moving “sideways”. The shadow could be seen in two spots at once, but I cannot describe what I mean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved quickly, too fast for a helicopter at that height, and was gone within a few seconds.<n>
3/17/09 19:59|Long Beach|CA|Changing|26 minutes|UFO seen in Long Beach California; Air traffic rerouted, helicopters search and no word in the media!|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69269.html|164|ndxe200903| UFO seen in Long Beach California; Air traffic rerouted, helicopters search and no word in the media!<n> <n><n> <n><n> From 7:59 to 8:25pm on March 17th, 2009, (please excuse my ignorance in forgetting to reset the time in my camera for DST!) my sons and I saw another UFO in the skies over Long Beach, California.  We were in the backyard of our home taking pictures of whatever might look interesting, as sky-watching is our hobby.  We do it at least 5 days a week to relax after a long day and I&#39;ve been teaching them the constellations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed something that didn&#39;t fit what we&#39;ve come to know as a terrestrial craft, whether a jet, prop or experimental aircraft.  There was an object that was going from the west to the east and there was no red light visible (FAA REG) as with ALL OTHER AIRCRAFT taking off from the airport. Then it started to hover and immediately changed direction and again... did not have the FAA green light on its opposite side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have almost 60 photos of this sighting... you really must see them all to be able to appreciate what is going on here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my vantage point of about a mile off of the Pacific coast, this craft was hovering on the southern horizon - probably above the electric company at the corner of Studebaker and 2nd Street/Westminster.  After hovering, the craft would then make 160-180 degree turns going east, then west, then repeating while slowly drifting further south - over the Pacific Ocean - towards the famed &#34;Redondo Trench&#34;.  This went on, as can be seen in the properties of my photos, for 26 full minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of our sighting this time, it was not clear what shape the object actually was until the photos were analyzed upon download to my computer, and even then, it seemed only the lights were visible.  As far as structure and the apparent &#34;shape-shifting abilities&#34;, this was one spectacular sighting! However it didn&#39;t beat the Triangle &#34;Mothership&#34; we all saw last November 12th, and I don&#39;t think anything else could!  That was reported the same day on UFO NorthWest, if you are interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I took a few &#34;real-time&#34; photos of the craft, but didn&#39;t want to &#34;waste&#34; the pictures and knew the only way to be sure to &#34;get proof&#34; was to take timed shots, so - as a result - most of the almost 60 photos I shot were 8 second exposures at a F 2.5 setting with an exposure value at +2.00 (the highest my camera goes) and certainly showing the true colors of the crafts lights and its flight pattern/path.  I used a high-pixel, Sony Cybershot digital camera and did not alter the originals AT ALL! I have kept their integrity to help you to prove or disprove whatever it was that caused more than ten helicopters to be in the air after it disappeared, and caused them to refuel and return to the search for the next 2 hours or so.  The light appeared to be of whitish/yellow color with a bit of red from time to time, and what got my attention was that the lights and colors did not match the FAA regulations with regards to Red on the left and green on the right and white lights that blink 40x per minute.  This thing pulsed and then stayed lit.  Then it blinked white lights fast and then went back to pulsing again only to follow it with another blast of bright, solid light for another thirty to sixty seconds.  From where I was, it looked like a saucer, then looked like 2 doing maneuvers together.  Then it looked like two orbs that were connected somehow, then &#34;shape-shifting&#34; into something else... more square-round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also like to mention that based on the photos I have taken, I have reason to believe their may have been more than one craft in the sky last night, too.  Several shots seem to show what could be mistaken for stars, but upon closer inspection, can be seen to have the same color coding/ shading as the inital craft and in two of my photos, it looks as if their are 2 saucers of another shape that might even be a couple of boomerangs, but on a timed photo, it is hard to tell. You are the experts and I do hope that my final disclosure to you will help figure out what is happening on our planet! Well, this was absolutely incredible, but did not come close to others I and my family have had and would like to talk with an investigator about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, there were a total of 7 of us and an 8th joined in at the last minute, that witnessed this sighting and the after-effects. Only three of us saw it for the first 20 minutes or so, because I was getting pictures while the boys watched and tried to get neighbors out to see it, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What else is interesting is that on March 11th, 2009, there was little to no usual traffic going into or out of Long Beach Airport and around 8:18pm, seven military and police/civilian helicopters flew over our house, seeming to be looking for something on the ground. They flew rather slowly, from west to east and then took a more southerly direction when above Seal Beach, moving towards the Huntington Beach Area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Scary thing? I took photos of them, too as soon as I heard them coming and watched them go... and the first shot set off the flash which seemingly caused one of the helicopters to turn on and shine a searchlight on us! I had the kids shut off the lights in and outside of the house, got to my computer and downloaded them as soon as I could - just in case I got something I wasn&#39;t supposed to have! I would most certainly like to speak with an investigator, especially since I&#39;ve had multiple sightings (as has my eldest son) over the last many years and would like to finally share some of them with anyone willing to listen. I am beginning to fear whatever the heck is going on... and there IS something going on. Especially here in Long Beach, California.<n>

I was on my way to an appointment, and had just turned onto northbound Wadsworth Blvd from Center Ave, in the Belmar area of Lakewood. A second or two after making the turn, I noticed this white &#34;line&#34; (could have been cylinder, cigar, disc or almost any shape) moving fairly quickly from left to right (west to east) well ahead of me - I estimate at least a few miles, maybe several miles (could have been over Wheat Ridge or Arvada...). As it got further east, the white color dimmed to a gray color, probably from going underneath the shade of a cloud (just a good guess). It was difficult to keep a really good eye on it as I was in rather heavy traffic, which was slowing down as I approached Alameda Ave., so I had to also keep a good eye on the traffic. I lost sight of it as it went out of view (an office building on the NE corner of Wadsworth &amp; Alameda blocked my view). Once the traffic had moved forward enough, past Alameda Ave, I looked for it again, but could not see it, and had to continue to be careful driving. It might have still been there, but harder to see perhaps because it closely matched the color of background clouds? It also would have been getting farther away (farther to the east). I did not have a camera with me, and even if I had had one, I wouldn&#39;t have had time to turn it on, aim it and snap pictures while driving in heavy traffic - would have been very unsafe, also. However, I went back to that stretch of Wadsworth Blvd and took 4 pictures, approximating what my views were as I was driving this morning. I then used software to draw in what it looked like to me. I will upload the pictures in the sequence of the viewing; you will be able to see it as a white, angled line, west of Wadsworth and roughly above a bank building on the left side of the street, past Alameda Ave. The 3rd and 4th pictures show how it dimmed to gray as it moved farther east. I was on the phone with a friend this afternoon and told him about it. He a! sked me if it could have been an airplane banking in a turn. No, it could not have been that; if it had been that, it would have not appeared to move relative to my position, as it would more or less be flying away or toward me, not moving to my right (east), and it maintained this &#34;tilt&#34; throughout is movement eastward. If it was an airplane, then this would mean that the nose of the plane was inclined about 45 degrees, the nose pointing up and the tail pointing down. When a plane is landing at an airport, the nose is slightly raised so that the rear landing gear touch down, then the nose lowers and the forward gear touch down. This was a much greater angle. If it was a plane, then something must have been very wrong and the passengers would have been very uncomfortable, to say the least. So, no, I don&#39;t believe it was an airplane. If it wasn&#39;t an airplane, what was it?<n>

The weather was perfect. I was enjoying the day, seated in the patio, working with my PC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I heard and saw a green helicopter flying low and I tried to photograph it, but couldn&#39;t because because I had to adjust the zoom and could nto be fast enough, so I kept taking photos of the sky, towards the mountains and freeway 118, farther away.  Later upon examining all the photos in my PC, I saw the object that looks like a saucer, shiny surface and all. (This is a crop of the original, zoomed-in photo.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in the afternoon, I heard another chopper, went out, and there was the same green one.  I tried again, but it was too low to focus and I had my camera in zoom to take photos of distant objects, so I could not catch it.  Again, I continued to take pictures of the sky at random.  I waved goodbye to the green chopper as it went behind the trees and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photos in the afternoon pictures look like triangular objects, I am sure these cannot be birds at a distance; they would have to be gigantic to photograph this way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;saucer&#34; like object photo was taken in the morning.  The afternoon photos show dark triangular objects.  The photos were taken with a Canon Powershot G10 digital camera.  (This camera has a maximum resolution of 14.7 mega-pixels.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that day I have taken more photos and some days I have caught cylindrical, triangular and cigar shaped object.  For 2 years of doing this I did not discover any strange objects in my photos but they are becoming a weekly thing.<n>

My fiance was getting ready to go to the the store when I heard him say &#34;holy sh*t&#34; and then he pounded on my window and I ran outside, immediately seeing discs in formation with a reddish goldish soft glow over head heading west . Their were 3 at first in formation, then 5 in formation, then I saw 3 again, then I saw 3 more in formation approx 12:35(I went outside again during typing this). They moved extremely fast. I said we need to report this to someone and I looked  online for you guys. The discs were about the quarter of the size of the moon approx. They moved so fast, you had to keep your eyes on them and it seemed like they were only their for a matter of seconds.  They sped up after a few seconds whizzing through the sky.  During the writing of this email (as mentioned above), I went back outside again and talked to my fiance. At that moment again, I saw 3 more heading north.  I called my friend to see if she had a camera to go outside. She did not. My fiance saw alot more than me as he has been outside for over 45 minutes now. He will be making his report after my email.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/17/09 00:00|Grand Rapids|MI|Disk|45 minutes|Multiple flying objects over Grand Rapids Michigan.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69237.html|168|ndxe200903| Multiple flying objects over Grand Rapids Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside just before midnight, to smoke a cigarette and looked up at the stars and saw a formation of 5 golden lights speeding across the sky West/northwest.  I stared in disbelief, then I saw two more reddish golden disks flying (one slightly behind the other) much lower and extremely fast.  I started backpedaling and tapped on the window to the room where my fiance was and before she came out I saw five more heading northwest.  By the time she came outside they were gone, but I just said, look at the stars...then bam, 3 more just flew West right then.  We witnessed a few more flying west and then I called my parents (looking at my phone I believe it was 12:07 when I called my mom and I talked to her for 11 minutes about what I was seeing)  My phone wasn&#39;t working first, but just as it finally started ringing and she answers, (she lives in Kalamazoo Michigan) two more flew over heading due west completely silent and extremely fast.  I witnessed 3 more formations as I talked to her, but I started seeing so many, I lost count of how many were in which formation.  Every formation was heading west or northwest, except one lone formation of 3 that traveled southeast.  The whole time I was seeing them, I only saw one airplane with blinking lights and one helicopter which was extremely huge and loud (it was flying very low, so I could see it was like a Huey and had only red lights)...my fiance had went into the house to file a report and I stayed outside and kept seeing these things.  At about 12:30am she came out and we called a number to report what we had seen, and two flew over very low and fast heading northwest.  I talked to someone on the phone for 4 minutes, and the helicopter flew over during the call. then we tried to call the airport, but only got automated answers.  I also was shocked when I witnessed a small flash and shower of sparks in the sky to the north.  It looked as though something may have exploded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These things were a goldish somewhat red color and traveled in formations of 2, 3, or 5.  I lost count, but I saw at least 2 dozen.  They were silent, extremely swift, and mostly stayed in very tight rigid formations, that were shaped like triangles, or an upside down check mark.  Two or 3 of the formations were loose on one side, with the things weaving back and forth, while the other side of the formation stayed in a tight line.  The lights DID NOT blink ever.  The ones that were flying lower looked as though they had a ring of light golden light around them.  They moved easily 10X faster than the airplane I saw to the north (which had blinking lights that were greenish)  There wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky, and I saw no moon.  If I had to guess, I&#39;d saw they were heading towards Muskegeon and Lake Michigan.  I have NEVER seen anything like what I saw tonight.  I have seen meteor showers, shooting stars, satellites, airplanes, helicopters, planets, and the MOON of course.  I can&#39;t say what to use for a background, but the formations with 5 all had objects the size of stars and were flying much higher I believe.  The lower flying formations which only had 2 or 3 objects were much larger than stars.  Probably 4x the size of a star.  These larger objects were moving incredibly fast.  Even the smaller objects moved easily 10 times faster than the airplane to the north. We do not have any camera to take pictures.  And these things were so fast and some of them were so high, I highly doubt anyone could capture them on film.  It would just be a blurry mess I think.  I hope someone has at least tried to capture them though.  It was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever witnessed in my life.  When I witnessed the shower of sparks, I did not see any objects around it and it was to the north.  It was around 12:30 when I saw it and my fiance just missed seeing it too as she was dialing a number for me and our house blocked her view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is all I have to say.  I would suggest following up in Muskegeon and around Lake Michigan and the Gerald Ford airport here in Grand Rapids....  I hope someone else saw this besides us.  It was so unique.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

An hour later, I went outside to go to the grocery store. I passed the spot from where we observed the flare, stopped, and looked up. I saw a straight line of about 5-7 dimly lit objects moving through the sky, first appearing at about altitude 30 degrees and azimuth 6 degrees. It appeared to me that the objects did not emit light on their own but were reflecting light from the sun below the horizon. They moved about twice the speed of the satellite we had seen earlier. There seemed to be a bit of haze surrounding the group. They were almost pinpoint sized objects, dim yellow color (which makes me think it was reflected sunlight) and as they approached about azimuth 0 degrees, they changed formation from a straight line to a cluster. The rearmost objects caught up with the foremost objects to make this cluster. As the group continued across the sky, they disappeared at about azimuth 310, which appeared to me that the objects moved into the shadow of the Earth and could no longer be seen. The objects made no sound and seemed to be very high above the Earth and moving at incredible speed. As a background on myself, I am an RN and budding amateur astronomer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Overlooking the Central Valley approx. 50 miles South S.E of Fresno  On a semi-regular basis we see and or hear F16s over our property returning to the 144th Air Guard base in Fresno. This evening while in our spa we again heard the sound of the F16s. This time when we looked up we saw something very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:10 PM on Monday the 16th of March 2009 we heard an approaching aircraft. We looked up and to the east since this is the normal direction these jets take. As soon as we looked up we saw a white light moving extremely fast from the east to the west. This light was about as bright as a semi-bright star moving nearly as fast as a meteorite. There was no tail or sound coming from it at all and the light stayed constant. We could hear the jet coming w/afterburners on but by the time he was overhead the &#34;light&#34; was nearly out of sight to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These jets normally head north towards the guard base after reaching the valley but this one headed straight across the valley as fast as he could (without breaking the sound barrier) As fast as the F16 was moving, it was nothing compared to the &#34;light&#34; he was apparently attempting to follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next several minutes 5 more jets (jet 2 also had afterburners on) headed in the exact same direction as the object and first jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe if this was a meteorite or space debris the object would have been burning leaving a trail behind and would not have been traveling in perfectly straight line from east to west with no noticeable elevation change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On clear nights we can see the city lights across the central valley to the base of the coast range, tonight was one of those nights.<n>

I was sitting on the west side of the place where I live. At that particular time I was watching with my binoculars (20x50) at the night sky when I spotted what looked like a triangular cloud, at least that is what it look when I first saw it. I straighten myself so I could get a better look as I was in uncomfortable position never taking my eyes on the mysterious shape.  The cloud travel at about forty five degrees from the west horizon, from south to north. It sort of looked like the Star Trek Romulian war ships when they are cloaking, sort of blurry trails behind the front cloud  but I could only see the outer edge. I followed this shape until it disappeared in the northern horizon. I want to point out that you could not see this with the naked eye nor did it make any sound. The whole event took about thirty second since I spotted this in the middle of the sky or its trajectory. I also have to confessed that this sight gave me chills and made me a little nervous since I have seen other “strange” objects before but nothing like this big or weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately thirty minutes after this event two marine jets took off from the MCAS base  in the direction that the device had taken but instead of  following all the way north the sort of cut in the middle of the sky and continued on an northeasterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am submitting this report with the hope that there may be someone else that saw this object.<n>

The 2 distinct glowing items were around the size of a thumbnail at arms length. Their glow was diffuse so that they did not look yo be a sharp singular point of light but more like a glowing object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hard to discern their altitude. But there was an impression that they were close because of their speed. This did not really seem close because of their speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They took around 20-30 seconds to travel across the sky. At the end of their course through the sky the lights crossed and then split into 3 before going behind a tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They were not airplanes, as they were much larger and would move much faster than airplanes. They also hovered in midair and flew in directions airplanes couldn&#39;t. Every once in a while, one orb would shimmer a bit, and then stop and another one would shimmer, and finally the other would shimmer. Almost as if to communicate with each other. They flew in a triangle but would frequently form a straight line and then form back into a triangle again. During the final five minutes, they were drifting away from us, and one on the left flew very fast off to the side, away from the others. Then one of the two left flew off to the right very fast. The final orb got brighter and brighter as if to be coming towards us. Then all of a sudden it disappeared. the lights were suddenly &#34;turned off&#34; and the three orbs were gone. The two orbs that flew to either side, also disappeared in the same fashion soon after leaving the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used to be a sceptic. Not that there were no aliens, but I was sceptical that they would enter our atmosphere. After this sighting, i now have no doubts that what i saw were not airplanes. And i highly doubt they are man made.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were in mid-sky, south-east of our house, in the Tinley Park direction. We jumped out of our car and stood in the street to see them better.  We called our neighbors immediately, when we noticed the lights, and 2 of them joined us, as well as my sister.  Our neighbors called their brother, who was at a different location, and he saw them as well.  The lights shifted to near the horizon line, but were clearly red, not blinking, and in a triangle position. We crossed the street and stood on the bleachers at Grasmere Park to see them better, since they were now lower in the sky.  The lights moved into a straight line at one point, then moved back into a triangle.  After a few minutes, one light began to move away to the left (west).  The other 2 stayed in position but moved further away until they were out of sight.  Also, another guy in our neighborhood walked over and saw them when they were on the horizon.  These lights were very similar to the ones we saw in August 2004, but they did not stay in the sky as long. We did try to take a photo from my sister&#39;s camera, but she couldn&#39;t zoom in close enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be quite serious-minded, and quite credible.

This was in Mokena, Illinois, heading southeast away from Tinley Park. They were moving in a triangle then to a straight line. I saw the same thing in August 2004 a little over four years ago. It was just like it had been. They were nothing like airplanes; they were far away and moving fast. They were together in a triangle then went to a straight line, back to a triangle. The one started moving away from the other two. It was like nothing I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the UFO Hunters season opener- about the Illinois invasion. The Tinley Park phenomenon featured these lights.  I watched it three times. Right when I saw the lights it reminded me of that. It was NOT a hoax.  Nobody could stage that. I still can’t believe they were back.  They were flying the same path they did in 2004.  The UFOs flew right over us heading in a southeastern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbors (who also sent you a report) were out there watching it with me.  They were the ones that told me to come outside and they said the UFOs are back!<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were seven witnesses and we all saw the three red moving lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates a date in 2008.

It seemed close but not too far away.  We both watched it turn red and dissapear. No sounds were heard and nothing seemed to fall from the sky in that area.  It was very clear to see that night.  We thought it was an airplane but no lights were flashing and it dissapeared.<n>

In the middle of the object was a smaller dark circle, almost like a small hole. I watched the object move from the northeast towards the north very slowly, in a slight up and down pattern. The object slowly rotated as it was traveling across the sky, changing from a perfect circle to a thin line, as if I were looking at the object from it&#39;s side. The object also slowly changed color from bright yellow to orange, to a darker shade of orange, and then back to bright yellow. It continued to rotate from a full circular shape to a line then back again. The object completely disappeared and reappared twice as I watched it travel slowly across the horizon line above the water. I paddled up to two other surfers in the water, pointed out the object to them and asked if they had been watching it. One said he had been watching it and didn&#39;t know &#34;what the hell that thing is&#34;. The other surfer said it could possibly be a kiteboarder, but there is no way a kite could make a perfectly circular shape like what we were seeing, or be that far out to sea. All three of us ruled out certain slow moving objects like a blimp, or even the moon. The moon could not have traveled that far along the coast in 15 minutes, nor change color, nor disappear as it did. I called the St. Augustine Beach Police Department when I got home. They said no one else had called with such a report today, and was hung up on in mid-sentence while I was trying to honestly describe what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went outside to smoke a cigarette and looked up, no moon.  The sky was relatively clear and there was no moon.

I turned from the fire to warm up my back side and just stared up at the cool night sky.  The moon was bright and there were a few slow moving clouds, the stars were shining bright.  I noticed what I thought was one small cloud moving faster then the others, that is what first caught my eye.  Then I realize it was not a cloud but rather a dark triangular object moving silently through the clouds.  The object flew in a straight line and I did notice 4 large lights underneath, the lights did not flash or blink and they had a strange color to them.  The color was like an aluminum flashlight beam.  I yelled at my wife and her brother to look but the triangular object was too hard to see, they looked further on and saw an airplane in the distance.  I kept my eye on the object; it was low to the ground, triangular, silent, with 4 eerie white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was driving on I-10 just south of Phoenix, east of South Mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the stars being blacked out by something huge (UFO) moving in the air.  A big rig truck a lane or two to the right slowed down and the driver leans forward to look up through his windshield.  Other drivers also slow down and look up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I take my foot off of the accelerator to look up through the large front windshield of my 1983 Toyota Supra and see something big, black, slow and silent, couldn’t hear anything but the road noise of the cars and trucks on the freeway.  This “UFO” was moving from behind me (North) in a South-East direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed a small flare, bottle rocket or meteorite come from above the huge UFO and hit the leading edge of the left wing and break up into many small pieces.  It really looked like a lit meteorite hitting the leading edge of the left “wing” and then brea! king into many lit pieces.  I thought this was very strange that a meteorite would just happen to fall to hit this very unusual object as it glided over, a strange coincident indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving about 70-75 mph in that stretch of the freeway and the object was moving slightly faster over me in a Southeast direction.  I then thought the object which hit the UFO could have been a bottle rocked but I thought again about this because when it hit, it sounded like a pebble hitting something made of metal because it made a slight ringing sound.  I remained uncertain as to what I had observed as I completed my drive home to Tucson.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day the incident was all over the papers but I still didn’t make the connection to what I saw because when I saw the UFO I didn’t see any Lights other than the “meteorite” which broke up when it hit the left “wing” and shatter into lit pieces.  The UFO was totally black, blocking out the stars as it passed but seemed to be slightly illuminated by the city lights below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later, I read people accounts stating that they felt no fear.  I recall that I also did not feel fear but more curiosity and confusion, like, &#34;What Is That???&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen large planes up close before, B-52, B-747, C-5, Hughes Aircraft Co.’s Spruce Goose, and the Space Shuttle, etc.  None can compare.<n>

As this light was moving a plane appeared into my vision from over my house, as soon as the plane got maybe half a mile from the object the light faded out. This could mean it faded or it shot upwards. A very strange and interesting sighting.

The light seemed a bit hazy or fuzzy in appearance. The light also seemed to slow down and it zigzagged in an S shape before speeding off.  Within five to ten minutes we then saw another light in approximately the same location.  So after the second light, we really started to keep an eye out.  Over the course of the next three hours we spotted an additional fifteen to twenty more of these lights.  Sometimes they were by themselves other times they would appear in twos or threes.  Some would move across the sky and then stop completely and reverse direction two to three times before continuing back in a northward direction.  They would also tend to get fainter as they slowed down or stopped.  One light even appeared to travel below a cloud when we thought that it would have traveled above the cloud out of our view.  There was no sound and speed would change as they crossed the sky.  We went to bed at 11:15 and lights were still appearing at that time, out of the South.<n>

My attention was drawn to an extremely bright, round object approaching from the south.  At first I thought it was a satellite, but it was too large, bright and fast.  The object was circular, bluish white in color, with a faint reddish corona-type effect around it.  Its’ speed was too fast for a satellite and too slow for a meteor.  The object’s brightness remained the same as it passed overhead, traveling from south to north.  It did not flicker, sparkle or leave a trail as a meteor would and it made no sound.  There were commercial and general aviation aircraft in the sky at the time, and the object seemed to be much higher than the aircraft.  I watched it until it disappeared behind some scattered clouds that were forming to the north-east of my location.  The object changed its course slightly to the east just before it disappeared for good.  I saw an identical object about a month ago, following the same general path, but I was busy at the time and did not make note of the date or time.<n>

I could judge the speed of the light to be going at or faster than 50000 miles an hour because when you see a satellite in the sky it is usually a small light traveling at a nice steady speed and it will travel around the earth’s atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason this light was so different was, it was about 10 times the size of a satellite light, and this light was a steady light it did not blink, it did not change color, it was just a big white light. Now the other reason it was so different that any light  I have seen in my life was it was very far away and it was traveling away from or solar system.  I saw the light for about 2 minutes the light did not get any smaller or bigger as I was looking at it, which was weird to cause after 2 minutes the light just vanished.   Like it was traveling though a port hole or something, and when I saw the light it was just ripping through space at very high speeds it came in one side of the port hole then when it vanished it disappeared though the other side of the port hole.  And when I say port hole you could refer it to ripping a hole in space time continuum, or it could be a worm hole, in one side out the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We heard a jet passing through quietly from the East heading West.  As I looked up I glanced to the North and another passenger jet was on a South East heading when I noticed a white light rushing toward the airliner.  It was about half the size of the plane and it swirled around close to the jet and then shot back to the west.  While moving it had an orangish white color and then it flashed reflecting the sun for second or two very brightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then wobbled back and forth two times and shot off in a northern direction very fast appearing to be all white at that piont.  The sky was very clear and only a few clouds were present.  I have seen video of these craft before on tv and I can say the flight charactoristics were very similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it seemed like it was playing a game with the passenger jet.  I thought It might have been a bird but I have concluded that it was something very diferent.  Birds don&#39;t reflect the sun the way this thing did and they don&#39;t look orange in color either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it was but I know it was no airplain!<n>

I will say mid-March 2009, but I could be off a month either way. It was mid to late winter or early spring of 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My location: Intersection of 108th AVE NE and NE 12th Place at the north edge of McCormick Park on the west side of 108th AVE NE in Bellevue, WA. NE 12th Place is a small dead end side street and not to be confused with NE 12th Street, which is immediately to the south. NE 12th Street is the boundary between urban downtown Bellevue to the south and the suburban/residential area to the north. McCormick Park is a very narrow park that runs on the north side of NE 12th Street between 106th Place NE and 112th Street NE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather: Very overcast. No wind. Dark, except for street lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration of observation: 40 to 45 seconds?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Circumstances/description:  I was walking my dog at about 1:30 in the morning. I had just crossed NE 12th Street on the west side of 108th AVE NE and had reached the north boundary of McCormick Park which abuts NE 12th Place.  I was about to turn west into the park when I looked north up 108th AVE NE and saw two steady (not flashing or strobing) bright white lights about 50 to 60 feet off the ground. These lights were about street width apart (I will say 20 feet -- 108th AVE NE is one lane in each direction there). They were apparently rigidly connected and moving right down the street in my direction. I will put their speed at 20 to 30 miles per hour, 35 tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sort of partially hid myself behind a tree next to the street and watched the lights come right down the street toward me (again about 50 to 60 feet up). There was absolutely no visible structure there of any kind, even though I was really squinting and trying to make something out. The lights were all I could see.  Furthermore, there was no sound of any kind. When the lights got to about 200 feet up the street, they started to turn to their left (my right). I figure they got within about 150 feet distance of me or less at closest approach – and I still could see nothing but the lights (although they did get dimmer as they started to turn and especially as they started to move away to the northeast). Only at the very closest approach did I hear any kind of sound at all, but I am not sure the sound was coming from what I was looking at. The location I was at is about a half a mile from I-405 and the traffic noise from that distance can be much louder than what I was hearing! at that point. It sounded possibly something like the engine of an ultralight, but exceedingly quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights turned they briefly moved to the east perpendicular to 108th AVE NE and finally headed away to the northeast. At some point during this slow-speed maneuver, I did for a fraction of a second get the impression of a dim red light such as you might see in a dark room illuminating part of some possible structure, but it was much to fleeting to make out what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unusual features of object:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)  Silent or virtually silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)  Invisible, except for two bright white steady lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)  Moved so slowly a conventional aircraft would have stalled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could have been a helicopter except for the first two items. I considered, an ultralight, but even an ultralight should have been much louder at closest approach, and even an ultralight would have stalled at that speed – and an invisible ultralight with bright lights 20 feet apart – not a chance. I even had a novel theory that I was seeing something tethered beneath a helicopter flying at a much higher altitude, which I did not see because I was preoccupied with what I was seeing in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My guess: my guess is that I was seeing (er – not seeing) some type of unmanned surveillance aircraft. I am thinking that if a craft did not have to take the weight of a pilot that it would be possible to construct something that would not stall at that speed. Also, there might not be much of a profile to see. There is still the issue that it was VERY quiet, whatever it was, and I still don’t understand why I couldn’t see any type of structure at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: there was one other person in the immediate vicinity who MIGHT also have seen this. Without going into details, he may have had even a much better view than I did, but I do not know who he is, and have no way of contacting him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

We were going home from a friend’s house after watching a show together. The time was approximately 12:30 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately, I saw two bright orange balls of light in the sky, diagonally north of where we were driving. I yelled for her to pull over. We quickly parked in a parking lot facing the objects, in front of the Towpath Hotel. We jumped out of the car, and at that time, a man in another car pulled into the hotel and parked. We did not get his name, but the three of us watched this phenomenon together. These two objects moved at a very fast rate, independently, in all different directions, around each other, then they suddenly stopped and seemed suspended, parallel to each other. They were large and appeared to be at about the height that a plane would fly when descending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend took a picture on her cell phone. After a couple of minutes, the ball on the right very slowly seemed to recede and disappear. After it was completely out of sight, the ball on the left slowly receded, on a parallel path to that of the first one, until it disappeared. The three of us talked about it briefly, with all of us agreeing that they could not have been lights or aircraft that we’ve seen before. My friend and I felt thrilled to have witnessed such an event, as we have never had this happen to us before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both have our masters degrees; I am a fifth grade teacher and my friend is a computer programmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, we bought the book, The Phoenix Lights, and agreed that what we saw looked exactly like the orbs on the cover. We are curious if there were other reports from our area or other locations on that day.<n>

Just looking without bonoculars flashing lights and slight jiggery movement and high in the sky above the large tree like appearance of a star and the others appeared to be on the surface just stars, some blinking or may have all been blinking but could not see those that were far away clearly what they were doing but most of them blinking. After an hour went by the one I observed larger (and assuming closer to me) disappeared when I went back to look again but off to the right and farther away not moving but fixed, the colorful blinking one appeared again. Higher to the right now are two vivid thru the bonoculars facing each other were upright flat facing each other and close to each other blinking those had no colorful lights that I could see? So I moved bonoculars to other starlike figures and ones I could see closer were ALL WEB LIKE WHITE STREAMS OF LIGHT AND FLAT but were blurrier. I&#39;ve seen this before in the skies ONLY AT NIGHT off my patio. Assumed or wanted to ignore it&#39;s presence..denying it being a UFO in my mind then, but now I&#39;m seeing more clearly these objects at least last night. My opinion; could be a satelite as one policeman on the scene bet his badge, the other didn&#39;t know like me. I will get a police report.

We watched it pick up speed on a constant bearing to the north-east.  At first the craft appeared to be a bright chrome like light. We put binoculars on the craft and it was so bright it was hard to keep looking at it.  Before it reached directly overhead, it became a dull orange.  At first we believed it to be an experimental aircraft from Nellis, Hill, or one of the other Air Force bases near our state.  When the craft was overhead, it slowed momentarily, and then picked up speed at an unbelieveable rate until it reached the horizon in the north-west.  There was no sound and no contrail visible. I have seen other such craft while camping in Utah&#39;s deserts over the years, this one was faster than anything I or my wife have ever witnessed!  When it headed for the north-west, it accelerated so fast it was hard to keep binoculars on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This band of distortion was ordered and not random (like heat waves), a distinct pattern was present in the halo. The ripples and waves of this translucent halo gave the appearance of emanating from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While sitting outside casually observing the clear sky and evening sunshine. I first observed the objects in the southern sky at a low declination. Within the span of a second, it was clear to me the craft to did not fit any definitive criterion known aeronautical craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a engineer with extensive aviation experience and knowledge, I have a larger than normal list of criteria. Without an explanation for the speed, altitude, shape, and ballistics demonstrated by the craft I was observing I was naturally riveted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the objects approached toward my observation point, more detail became clear. I could at this point clearly make out precise shape, color, and the above stated characteristics.  Of particular amazement to me was the transparent halo around each craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the craft travel to the north as long could observe them, which was less than a minute. Having already calculated the approximate speed I knew any effort to retrieve a camera would have been futile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed this alone and have no one to corroborate these events. I am a professional engineer with 24 years experience. I am currently in fine health. Weather balloons do not travel at 3000ft and 120 knots against the wind.<n>

It was at about 6:30 PM local time, when we suddenly observed a cigar-shaped object moving noiselessly fast from North to South.  It was emitting orange flickering light from window-like openings of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it suddenly stopped, reversed its direction of movement, stopped again, begun to continue its North-bound path, and finally performed a zigzag kind of a dance and finally rapidly moved over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have to stress that are both scientists and are not easily subjected to illusions.  We have never seen anything like that in our lives, and now we are convinced that we were seeing a true UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After coming back to Boston, we checked at Internet and found out that Cancun is the location at which numerous UFO sightings were reported by many people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would be interesting to know why Mexico and particularly Cancun is such a UFO’s favorable place.  Maybe they are also attracted by a warm climate and beautiful scenery of this place?<n>

Traveled NE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting a UFO sighting that my fiance and I saw while driving to a restaurant on Chicago&#39;s NW side (not too far from O&#39;Hare airport). I saw a few light colored spheres in the sky above an airplane and my fiance confirmed it was there. I pulled over on Oak Park Avenue and took her camera to grab some photos. She counted 12 of these spheres, which seemed to be very high up. I was so busy trying to get her point and shoot Lumix camera to focus that I really didn&#39;t pay attention to any other detail about these things. I don&#39;t know if they all moved in unison or if they were all moving individually. They were traveling North East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiance says they may be balloons, so I checked the weather. The wind was blowing southwest at the time. Also, these wouldn&#39;t be planes because they were not only too high up but, I really don&#39;t think that many planes would be at the same altitude traveling North East (to Canada?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called 311 (information) to make a report, and they transferred me to the Police. I was sort of embarrased so I asked them to just let the military know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spheres eventually dissapeared into the distance and could no longer make out where they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 1 photo of the luckily zoomed in capture of only a few of the spheres which I circled on photoshop with a pen. The camera had an auto focus which, unfortunately, couldn&#39;t find the things in the sky to focus on. So, out of the 10 or so pictures I took most were all blurry. I do have 1 picture or two that you can make out these things. I&#39;d be willing to share the photos with someone who&#39;d be able to help identify the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email. If you can find anything about similar sighting of these, please let me know.<n>

No sudden maneuvers, flew v. slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a possible UAP (UFO) over S. Boulder, Colorado about 1415 MDT (GMT - 6) on 14 Mar 09.  I was out enjoying the sun when I noticed a light or silvery object (a point) drifting very slowly to the W.  It passed overhead about 1415 and finally disappeared behind the trees.  It did not perform any of the sudden maneuvers often reported of UAPs, such as darting off at extreme speed; it just slowly traversed the sky.  Size, height, speed unknown. It left no trail, did not flash, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A star or planet, or even a spacecraft such as the ISS?  Not likely.  It was too bright to be the former; and S/C are usually launched to the E. to take advantage of the Earth&#39;s rotation, so fly W-E.  They also usually go much faster, in angular velocity.  Not a jet; it went too slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather balloon?  Possibly.  Wind here has been light NE all day (as usual); but winds are usually W. at higher altitudes.  It did not seem to slow down or get fainter as it would if it had been climbing.  It could also have been a UAV (pilotless drone airplane), very high or flying very slowly.  It jogged to the N. a bit then continued drifting W.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location observed from: ~Lat. 40° N., Long. 105° 15&#39; W. (just N. of Baseline Road near 29th Street in S. Boulder), el. ~1625 m. (5330&#39;). Weather: clear, light NE wind, 15° C. (59° F.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background: A.B. in Applied Physics, MSEE in weather radar.<n>

We were standing in the backyard and my boyfriend pointed out a light that was incredibly bright in the sky.  He thought it was a plane until the light grew dimmer, yet was moving downwards in the sky at a fast rate.  The light, still growing dimmer then turned upwards and slowly disappeared.  It was not a plane or helicopter as it was very far up in the sky and moved at an unusual angle, and because it seemed to vanish into midair.<n>

We were traveling west bound on a two-lane road, roughly 40 miles per hour.  We looked out of the drivers side window and noticed  the object.  It had multiple lights, probably around 5 or 6.  The majority of the lights were white but there was also one or two red ones located somewhere from the middle to the rear of the object.  At first we thought it was a plane, especially since there is a small airport located nearby, but it appeared to be stationary.  It was also extremely low but we were unable to hear any noise as we passed.   I couldn’t say exactly how far off the ground it was, but the height was equivalent to an extremely tall oak tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now as we were both passing, we both started to comment on the object at the same time.  We both noticed how low it was and how it appeared to be hovering or moving at an extremely slow speed.  First instinct was that it was just a plane on it’s way to the airport, but the speed, height, and sound just didn’t add up to the normal sightings of planes in that area.  Then the thought was that it was possibly some kind of stationary tower, such as a cell phone.  So once we passed the object, we decided to do a u-turn and go back and get a second look.  We had trouble finding a good place to do this and finally just slammed the breaks on  and turned into the other lane.   By the time we got back to  the spot where it was located, the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In hind sight, I wish we had just slammed the breaks on the moment we saw it.  There were no cars directly behind us and I don’t recall any other cars passing in the other lane at that same moment. I’m also surprised  at how I felt.  There was no uneasiness or frightened feeling.  Just a feeling of confusion.  The area in which it was spotted is also heavily populated.  In the same direction as the object was traveling, there is an apartment complex and a large high school, which are both located on the other side of the cemetery.  I would be extremely surprised  if no one else saw it.<n>

It was not pulsating, and i am 100% sure it was not a plane as there was no sound or blinking lights. After viewing it for aproximatly 10sec from my bed room window, it flew out of sight at which point i ran down stairs and into my back yard to witness the same object traveling in a westerly direction.My mother also witnessed the bright object in the back yard. We watched the object until it disapeared into the horizon. I estimate the object was around 100ft above the houses, and was the size of a large grape when held at arms length(if that makes sense). I also noticed that there was a wind blowing in the same direction as the object was traveling. So could it have be some kind of latern being carried by the wind??? I dont know, but all i know it was very bright and moving fast. I am sure other people in the area must have seen it as it occured 7.10pm in the evening in a densely populated area. Just wished i could have filmed it on my mobile phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My neighbers couldnt explaine what we were looking at either. After about an hour or so,The light moved slow tords the right.I then called the Portland Police,Two police officers showed up,they couldnt come to an answer for what we were looking at either.My neighber stayed and watched the light until it was out of sight.It was not a sattllight, or a star,cause the lights were brighter and moved slowley away.My mom doesnt beleave in UFOs but she does now!!<n>

Saw a shiny metallic object when first pulling into the parking lot so assumed it was a plane since it was the same relative size and shape as a plane and was reflective like the metallic body of a plane very visible in the afternoon sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I parked, checked the craft again and noticed it had not moved at all.  I then assumed it was a blimp. But I do not know of any metallic blimps and this one was extremely reflective.  And it was not the typical blimp shape, it looked more like a large jetliner from the side profile but I did not note a rear vertical fin.  It also confused me since it appeared to be the same distance away from my position that I see the airplanes take as a path to land in Miami International Airport.  I was running late to class so I did not observe it much longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was the distance I believe it to be, relative to my position= ~10 degrees CW from N @ 1 mile.  So it would have been almost directly above International Mall.  I know some stores fly balloons but this would have been very unlikely since planes take a direct path over the mall to land in the airport 3 miles to the east.  And it&#39;s altitude was roughly the same if not slightly higher than planes that use that path to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Suddenly out of the corner of my eye I see a flash of light coming from my right.  The flash was turning on and off. The object was moving very fast. It almost seemed like it was skipping through the sky because its light was flashing on and off. It seemed like a white light with maybe a hint of blue to it. It zipped from way far off to my right across to my left. I was driving and trying to keep an eye on it as I was searching for it through the trees. As I was close to losing sight of it because I was not stopping my vehicle, I saw the craft hovering near the top of a nearby tower (possibly a cell phone tower) with its lights still flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the craziest thing I have ever seen.

I was  turning in a shopping center to go to Walmart when I noticed some red/orange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 1st I thought it was a plane until I noticed a similar set of lights underneath at an angle.  They appeared to hover and then go back and forth.  This was strange and no typical of a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my new G1 phone and tried to take a picturng fore.  It was dificult since not best camera. After taking several pictures, I spent some time looking  for the phone case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I realized it was getting late, I decided not to go to the store,but get something to eat.But the place I wanted to go on the other side of the shopping center was closed so it mus thave been after 9 by then. I got back into my car and headed in other direction on route 1 to go to a fast food  place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to drive in window got my stuff and started heading back in western direction on US 1 south to 95 s toward my development.  It was now at least 20-25 minutes since I first saw the lights.  When I pulled in my devlopement Hopewell, NJ, the lights appeared closer. (Apparently, the sighting in the shopping center was at greater distance and the object(s) were actually closer to my home.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I pulled in my driveway, I again took pictures.  When I looked at them I coulnt see any thing on the shopping center photos due to the distance.  But 2 taken from my front yard show a bomber range or v-shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on the brightness of the lights at opposite ends, it appears the object was larger than a typical plane.  There was no noise.<n>

I was reclined so that I was facing the window.  I was staring off into the blue sky; when I noticed two distinctly spherical shaped objects slowly drift by at an altitude of about one thousand feet or so.  They were white in color.  They were moving at a slow rate of speed, and as I began to lose sight of them I noticed that one of them split off from the other one and began flying in a perpendicular direction from the other one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/12/09 09:05|Newport Beach|CA|Rectangle|21:05|Lights going from left to right, with a stable red light on top|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69170.html|235|ndxe200903| Lights going from left to right, with a stable red light on top<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girl fiend and I were on the couch watching TV.  When she said look a UFO and I said what and jumped up from the couch. and looked out the window and saw it.  It look almost like it could have been a plane when I saw it, only with atleast 10 flashing lights going from left to right stopping for just a second and then left to right again. the lights could have been going all the way around the object in a circle but I cant be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On top of the object was a stabilized red light almost light it was on the tain of a plain.  It was fairly low in the air like the height of a helicopter only when we went on the deck I couldn&#39;t hear it, its speed was also like the speed of a helicopter it was pretty slow.  My girl friend claimed that before I saw it it was going south and then changed direction. to the straight heading I saw which was east Northeast away from Newport beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upon going outside, she saw that the sky was lit up with these lights.  There was no sound.  She went back inside, and when a coworker arrived shortly after, she asked if she had seen anything odd on her way in.  The coworker was relived, and said that while driving into work, she saw what looked like a 2 story building sitting on top of the place where they work.<n>

3/12/09 00:45|Hoffman Estates|IL|Formation|3 minutes|Massive 1/4 km+ sized UFO near Chicago|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69165.html|239|ndxe200903| Massive 1/4 km+ sized UFO near Chicago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time I&#39;ve seen this exact same phenomena in this area.  Two &#34;stars&#34; out of place and moving so perfectly in formation that I get the distinct impression it was a single large object, at least 1/4 kilometer in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 20 degrees above the horizon and about a grapefruit in size at arm&#39;s length.  There were not enough stars as a background to see if the object was opaque between the two lights, nor was there enough moonlight or lit clouds to illuminate the side of it facing me.  The object/objects was between me and the stars on the Western horizon and was moving N/NE, slowly and steadily at maybe 100mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to observe it for about 3 minutes before the lights faded. The disappearance was very slow and gradual and could just as well been a changing angle as distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The differences to the last time I saw it (reported here at ufocenter.com on or around 2002 in Rolling Meadows, IL at about 3:30am)was that this was slightly earlier in the evening and about 10 miles west the first siting.  I heard military aircraft immediately after the first siting, but the freezing cold breeze this time eliminated any chance of hearing anything.  Lastly, the first time it was a clearer night and my eyes could just barely detect a slight curved edge between the two lights like it was a gigantic saucer ufo with its back end tilted 45 degrees higher than the front as it flew forward.<n>
3/12/09 00:25|Amboy|CA|Light|about 5-10 minutes|4 lights in diamond shaped formation hovering in the california desert, then dissapearing.|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71394.html|240|ndxe200903| 4 lights in diamond shaped formation hovering in the california desert, then dissapearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 32 year old night photographer, living in Oklahoma at the time, but now living in Germany.  I was driving down Route 66 on March 12th, 2009 at about 0:25 local time.  I was driving former Route 66 between Essex, CA and Amboy, CA. I drove over a hill, where i suddenly saw 4 lights just hovering in a valley, in a diamond shaped formation. I guess those lights were about 5-7 miles away. Those lights were round, orange lights. I can&#39;t tell how big they were, but they seemed pretty big from the distance, i would guess at least 15 feet in diameter. They were solid orange, not flickering, not blinking, not changing colors. Just bright solid orange. It seemed like they were hovering about 50-200 feet above the ground. While they were hovering there, i heard no sounds or noises at all. You could see the lights were bright enough to illuminate a pretty big area in the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My location was at http://maps.google.de/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=de&amp;geocode=&amp;q=34.565853,-115.489876&amp;sll=34.562697,-115.490298&amp;sspn=0.026082,0.055747&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.501464,-115.557289&amp;spn=0.208807,0.445976&amp;t=h&amp;z=12 and the lights could be seen at a west/southwest direction from there, at what i guess was about 5-7 miles away. The whole area is pretty much abandoned. Amboy is nearly a ghost town, there is virtually no traffic there (in over 1 hour, i didn&#39;t see any oncoming or passing cars). There are train tracks running not to far from Route 66 though and there seems to be a pipeline, since there was a pump station that i passed earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as i drove over the hill and saw those lights, i pulled over, turned off my engine and my lights, grabbed the camera (which was readily mounted on a tripod, since i was doing night photography about 15 minutes earlier and placed the camera and tripod on the rear seats) and started taking a picture. I did a 1 or 2 minute exposure or so, and in that time i realized that those lights are slightly moving individually. The right light was not moving at all, the top light was slightly moving to the left, the left light was moving to the bottom right and the bottom light was moving up. Shortly after taking the picture, the bottom and the left/right lights were forming one line, with the top light above them. That all happened within a few minutes though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to take another picture of those lights, when the left light started moving sideways and dissapeared (kind of just turned off) with multiple loud &#34;explosion/thunder&#34; noise. The other 3 lights simply faded out a few seconds after that. I heard no unusual noises while those lights lasted, but i did hear some very deep short thunder/explosion noises. Not like rolling thunder, but like short &#34;boom&#34; noises a few minutes after i saw those lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited for about 10 more minutes to see if they would come back, but they did not appear again. Since it was a relatively clear full moon night, i could clearly see into the valley, but didn&#39;t see any houses, cars, trucks, aircrafts or other vehicles at all. Since the location is pretty much in the middle of nowhere, i am not aware of any other people that might have seen those lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued driving westbound on Route 66 and about 4 or 5 minutes later i realized there is another, smaller, orange light a few miles behind us directly on Route 66. I stopped to see if that might be another car, but it didn&#39;t seem to be one. That was another orange light, but way smaller than the other one. I couldn&#39;t tell if that light was on the ground or only a few feet above the road. It didn&#39;t come any closer and didn&#39;t seem to move, and also, after another minute or so, it dissapeared. I am not sure if that was in any way related to the previous sighting or if that was just another car or light from one of the pump stations/train signals or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The picture i took is available at http://michaelkesler.net/blog/uploads/UFO4.JPG and a cropped version of the &#34;UFOs&#34; themselves is available at http://michaelkesler.net/blog/uploads/UFO3.jpg .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what that was. I am kind of thinking that it might have been some sort of funny military craft, since there is an Airforce Base not too far away from that location. However, i don&#39;t know if that could be an explanation for what i saw. I hope you might have any ideas to tell me.<n>

I live in Claremont, Ca, a suburb of Los Angeles, a city that lies against mountains, on the other side of those mountains is desert.  I believe we are stationed in a path on the way to a military base, as I have often seen military helicopters flying over, and we are stationed on some sort of air travel path as many vehicles fly overhead often.  I noticed that it was a very clear day.  I was standing looking westward, which I consider to be Los Angeles, and I noticed a bright white light in the sky.  Which is unusual, as you don’t usually notice lights in the sky during the day.  It was metallic and white looking and I thought it moved unusually.  It was extremely bright and from a distance just looked like a spot/metal.  It was very far in the distance and seemed very high, so I thought if it moved closer I could tell if it was a plane or a helicopter.  As it came nearer and closer, I noticed there was a red tint to it as well.  I thought it maybe a blimp.  As it moved towards me, along this northeast path, along the mountains, and the same direction as the weather clouds today, it became brighter.  The white/diamond light became stronger and it also flashed red.  The lights were unusual, more high-tech than most planes or other flying objects.  The shape was cigarish.  I became slightly frightened as the light was very bright.  It continued moving on its path over my home and along the northeast latitude along the mountains, and continued until it was out of sight.  The entire time was approximately five to seven minutes.  I did not have the time to go inside and get binoculars in order to get a closer view.  I have seen an unusual light at night one other time, but this was by far the rarest and most unusual sighting.  The movement was also strange, as it moved in a very fluid and smooth/high tech manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as I could tell, it was not emitting sound that I could hear.  I have heard other auditory flying vehicles in the air ! since I sighted it, but I cannot see what craft is emitting that sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to do a quick research as to weather this could have been a weather balloon, but my immediate response that I’ve found seems to be that weather balloons do not emit light.  My background is mostly that I have an interest in many things, but I do have a slight knowledge of ufo subject matter, and I do sometimes listen to coast to coast, and sometimes read on the internet.  I noticed when I went on your website and looked at other sightings that someone in Rancho Cucamonga has written to you, which I find interesting as that is a neighboring city, although we saw two different colors of lights, we did see things in a similar time area.  I will try in the coming days to keep an eye out, and will possibly try to go outside tomorrow at the same time.  I have to say, today’s visibility is exceptional, and visibility here changes day to day and hour to hour.  Yesterday it was overcast.  Also, smog, clouds, being against mountains, etc. influences.  Not sure what I saw but it was interesting.<n>

I see a bright cylinder in the sky, between clouds.  I stare at it for a few seconds, then go find my camera. I come back and only find a giant cloud.  I wait a while, then I give up.  I look up again about ten minutes later, and it’s back in the blue sky.  I immediately start taking pictures. Not long after, it starts floating down towards another cloud.  It stays moving between the clouds, sometimes “bobbing”. A plane flies above it. I lose sight of it again, and put down my camera.  As I’m on the phone, I see it again in the blue sky. I try taking a few more pictures but only get 2 before it floats into more clouds.  I stare at it briefly before the clouds completely cover it.  Just like 2 months ago, the whole thing lasted about an hour, and it was roughly between  the two points the last ufo “floated” between.  Upon closer inspection of my photos, I realized it was a strange “capsule” shape, made up of 4 lines: dash, line, dash, line.<n>

They appeared to be very high in the sky, as they moved southwest, and the other branched off and moved southwest.  They were moving at an incredibly high rate, moving accross the entire sky in less than 10 seconds.  The formation was that of a V, and was slightly distorted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights seemed to not be moving still while flying, but rather dancing around a bit while going very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They eventually ran accross the sky, and disappeared before they actually left the horizon.  They just seemed to melt into the sky after awhile.  Also, everything around the V seemed to disrupt as well.  The clouds along with the starts out seemed to dissapear and reappear and fluctuate as the V went by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We at first were convinced that it was the shape of a stealth fighter, and since our proximity to the CIA as well as Quantico meant it was simply just a plane such as that.  However, we decided it couldn&#39;t be that, because those planes do not have active divises to hide like that.  The lights were just dots in the sky, slightly larger than normal stars in the sky.  They were moving at an incredible rate, and had no other comparison to anything on Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was moving very slowly and looked like a plane that was flashing blue and red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 20:40ish, it was hanging still, and flashing yellow, blue, green, red and purple lights in varying patterns and rhythms. The average shape seemed to be a sideways oval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 21:10ish it began gently moving side-to-side, still flashing.  It also seemed to move towards and away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 21:20ish it began moving away and seemed to lower, and then disappeared from view.  We thought it was behind a tall building, but it was not visible from an overpass either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were many onlookers in my area of campus, 50+, and I am sure more clumps elsewhere.  It seemed to be far away; only the lights were visible. It did not emit a noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 21:30 there was a searchlight to the northeast of campus, and two planes flying in tandem from the same direction.<n>

I was driving at the time and could not discern movement until after observing for about ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My route was on winding country roads, so as I constantly changed direction, the light stayed consistent.  I began to suspect this wasn&#39;t a jetliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly, as I drove I saw two jetliners on approach to RDU to the west of my location (about 30 miles away), and could see their flashing beacon lights.  The object I was observing did not have flashing beacon lights.  The object I had been observing seemed to be about the same altitude but farther west of the jetliners on approach, and the object shown much brighter than the jetliners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the object as my view was blocked by trees.  When the tree line ended to my surprise I saw three idenical objects in a razor sharp straight line appearing to head north beyond the RDU approach the jetliners had taken.  Military?  Satellite?<n>

After I arrived, he didn&#39;t put any label on what it was, he just simply asked me &#34;what is that up there&#34;. . at first glance, I replied &#34;looks like a bright white light&#34;. . . after this being said, he replied, &#34;yeah, but there&#39;s no stars out right now&#34; . .(it hadn&#39;t gotten dark yet) While still observing the bright white light, something happened to convince me that it wasn&#39;t just a lone star. I began to see white lines projected in different angles. . and then pulled back in. . (i then closed my eyes and rubbed them with my knuckle to make sure that it wasn&#39;t possibly a glare from the light being so bright). . it was no glare. . the projecting lines, or what we called them at the time &#34;wings&#34; came out and were pulled back in for around 15-20 minutes, sometimes projecting out longer in length than others. . it was aparent that we were seeing the same thing and it was no glare, because when they were at a longer length, we both reacted at the same time explaining exactly what we were seeing. . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching this for around 30 mintues or so, we then saw another light going in the direction of the object we had been observing. this I easily identified as an airplane, (due to the flashing red lights) however, when the plane got somewhat close in the direction of the object, we then saw the object take off at a REDICULOUS speed and a weird angle almost arching upward towards the sky. .we watched as the object got smaller and smaller until we could no longer see it. After the plane passes , we&#39;re still looking at the same point in the sky that the object was . . and out of nowhere, we saw the object fly back, at the EXACT SAME POSITION and point in the sky as it was previous. . this was amazing. .<n> <n><n> <n><n> After calming down, from what we saw, we continued to observe the object as it continued to project the wings, then pull them back in. afterwatching for another 15 minutes or so, we grew tired, and went in the house. Later,a bit after 9:00 pm the object was nowhere to be seen. .<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother is a very straight laced, mature adult (39 years old) and a police officer. . . for me to witness this with someone that i look up to, someone that i believe (if i had mentioned or told him a story like this,that he hadn&#39;t witnessed with HIS own eyes, he would NEVER believe me)  I&#39;ve always been a believer of extraterrestrial , UFO findings etc. . but always had that bit of doubt in the back of my mind. . after seeing this with my own eyes. . AND with my brother being there seeing the same thing, backing me up. . . THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT ALIENS,UFO&#39;s,and LIFE on other planets DO EXIST. . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 5 , 30 second video clips, plus a picture taken with his Nextel i880 video phone as proof. . not the best quailty, but i&#39;m glad we had SOMETHING to capture some type of evidence that we saw something out of the ordinary. . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be recording a video explaining exactly what i saw, this week, followed by all 5 video clips and picture summing up what we saw March 8th  2009, any information of groups or organizations in the Metro Atlanta Georgia area that shed light, investigates, or just has other witnesses of UFO&#39;s and extraterrestrial life would be appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon request, i have 5 video clips as well as a photo of the occurance  ((e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a star??

After eating, we laid down on the blanket and found ourselves looking up at the sky discussing the airplane contrails we were seeing all over the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From our left (which was north) there appeared to be a ball shaped object (not a disk, but spherical shaped) travelling at great speed and directly overhead. It crossed our field of vision in about 10 seconds and then stopped suddenly at which time it appeared to simply hover and then disappeared to our right which would have been to the south. The shape was a two tone color, being a copper color on the bottom and silver metallic color on the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no protruding features such as wings or a tail – simply round and featureless apart from the color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both stood up and watched it saying ‘what the heck is that?’ I am a private pilot and this was certainly not a plane or a bird. It was difficult to estimate its altitude but there was no contrail and it appeared to be perhaps 1000 to 5000 feet above the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was much closer then any other stars and it was relatively large but it was not moving, just hovering there, so we ruled out and airplane or helicopter.  At around 10:15 PM I had to drive my brother and sister to their grandmother’s house for the night. The kids went outside first while I grabbed my things. One of them screamed so I ran out to see what was wrong. They immediately pointed to the object which we earlier thought was a very bright star or planet, but this time it was bright red, still sitting in the very same spot it was just 3 hours before. By this time my boyfriend and my other brother had also emerged from the house. After observing it for about five minutes the big bright red ball shot across the sky at an amazing speed and covered a distance in one second that would take any airplane a good 5-10 seconds to cover. Then it slowly faded out and was gone.<n>

I was able to see it from my window on the 2nd story of my house, it was a white light, seemed like a moving star except you could see it moving.  I am in the country, and the town lights are in the northeastern sky but some stars are visible still. I thought it was a shooting star until i saw a plane seem to follow it.  The plane behind it had the sound of a jet. It was slightly off in the horizon.  This all took place in the eastern sky.  It was a perfectly clear night, about 65 degrees.  Star lit skies, and the moon was present.   I was able to pick up an very faint odd transmission that came through my guitar.  I was recording on my macbook with garageband and i heard what sounded like a data stream from an old telephone modem and a voice in the background that was jumbled and not really audible, that sound is what alerted me to look out side and i saw the object and the plane as stated above.  I was able to record a bit of this, there are parts where the recording just seemed to go to nothing and then back in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following url is a link to the sound file in mp3 format.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing i did was to amplify the sound as it was very faint.

He told me where it was located but I couldn’t find it, so he came over.  We went in my backyard where there is a huge clearing to look at the sky and UFO through binoculars.  The UFO that he was looking at was to the right of the dipper and to the left of the moon.  So the star was between the two.  I couldn’t tell that it was moving.  But what I did notice was a plane that had took off from the airport and was heading in the direction of the supposed UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And what was unexpected, we weren’t even looking for it; a big bright light that was located in the dipper took off in an s shape up.  My brother said the light looked red/orange. It appeared white to me.  It was just a stream of light.  The event only lasted seconds.  Where ever this UFO was I didn’t see it until it was this bright light in the bottom right of the dipper and went in an s shape up to the left corner of the dipper.  I know for sure that this wasn’t an airplane; since I live right by the airport I know the difference. This event took place between 8:14 and 8:20pm.<n>

I noticed the moon up in the sky and noticed a jet really high up, a white jet, leaving a chemtrail, sort of to the right of the moon when I noticed a really weird object moving perpendicular to the line of the jet.  It was much higher in the sky than the jet and it was moving much faster than the jet.  It was either two objects moving at tandem or it was one object with some sort of &#34;color&#34; in the middle of the object making it seem like two objects.  This object was very white. It seemed much whiter than the jet and this object was moving so much faster than the jet it was unreal.  I stood and watched it for approximately 15 seconda when I came back into the house since I had no way of filming it.  I could not see any wings or tail on it. It seems to me that if it had been a jet that the darker area between the two objects or the dark area in the middle of the object would have not been in the middle of this thing since wings on a jet are not in the center of the plane.  They would have been closer to the front. I&#39;m not sure what it was but I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t an airplane or helicopter.  I could not hear any sound.<n>

The color of the lights was bright white. It wasn&#39;t a craft in that you could make out a 3 dimensioanl form it was just there like a presence but the lights never moved out of their shape  The closest shape i can think of was like the shape of a sacrum (the body) not quite a an upside down triangle but more rounded. .<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it dissolved i did feel a kind of gravitation to and from in my body but not feeling anykind of abduction or that i was in danger.

This object was spinning slowly and had the look of burnished metal or plastic. It began to come closer and I was determined to not look away no matter what, so I got a really good look at it. The object never stopped spinning and sort of glided in the wind, was out of the SSW, and was moving against the wind. It appeared very stark against the background of high, fluffy, white clouds. The object moved directly overhead and was stationary for a good 15 seconds. The bottom appeared to be almost plastic with a few brownish marks on it. The surface seemed to fold in on itself--not like liquid in an operating blender would do, but kind of wrinkled together. It had to be 30-40 ft. in diameter. I recently went back to the sighting location so I could get a better fix on the object’s size. There are two old coke mill towers right next to where I was standing at the time of the sighting that are about 10 stories high, and this thing had to be no more than 200 ft. above me. It was large. Then, as I watched, it moved very gracefully, (against the wind) to the SSW, and as it did I saw at about 600 ft away, it either rolled onto its side or morphed to a classic saucer shape. I continued to watch and after a couple more hundred feet it changed again to delta sort of shape! Its movement was very fluid and very well defined, and the way it moved is rather difficult to describe. It sort of slipped and dipped in the air from one place to another. A full-blown daylight sighting I will never forget!<n>

Looked up to see the beautiful night sky which filled with high, puffy clouds that were reflecting the moon and I could see a few stars here and there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eyes quickly fell upon the typical “spycraft” triangle UFO. I knew it wasn’t a plane, although at first I thought it was because it had flashing lights like one. One light was white, the other red, and the other blue if I remember right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven’t a clue how high up it was but it seemed a bit higher than the clouds and seemed small from a distance, and it was moving about as fast as a plane. No engine sounds although that didn’t surprise me at all considering the height it appeared to be at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My assumption it was one of those spyplane things. Why it had flashing, blaring lights though when it’s supposed to be spying is beyond me! But that’s what I think it may have been as we have an Air Force base nearby.<n>

I was in the back seat of the car and I saw it first (on the right side of the road).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a glowing red star with a curved glowing red tail. It looked stationary to me. I thought it was a neon sign or a reflection of one in the window. I don’t live there so I thought it could be something explainable. I stared at it for about 3 seconds before asking my friends if they could see the thing I was seeing. When they looked at it, the object began to move. The star in the front got smaller and the tail became straight and skinny (still glowing red).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, the object begins to turn and the red glow went out. It was dark out so we couldn’t see the object’s shape but we could see its lights. It had a big light at the front that looked like a dull glow to me. It could have been the glow from being heated. It also had a light at the end. It was a very small flashing red light. That’s when we realized that this is a UFO. The object was long and skinny judging by the placement of the lights. The object continues flying with the appearance of an elongated aircraft for about 5 seconds. (It’s now on the left side of the road and had made a complete U-turn.)  Then, the object begins to light up again. It gets brighter and brighter and becomes engulfed in blue flames. It looks like a meteor now. It was still moving slowly. It appears as a slowly falling meteor for a little over 5 seconds before all lights go out and the object disappears completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three people observed it while in the car. The driver only caught a glimpse of it. We are all college students from the ages of 18-20. I can’t speak for the three people who saw it at the house, but they had a completely clear view of the object. They were sitting outside around a fire when they saw it.<n>

3/6/09 19:45|Point Richmond|CA|Sphere|3-5 minutes|Star-like UFO moving like a bloodhound from side to side & backwards across the sky in S.F. Area|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69094.html|287|ndxe200903| Star-like UFO moving like a bloodhound from side to side &amp; backwards across the sky in S.F. Area<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 6, 2009 at approximately 19:45 hrs. my husband and I were walking in the hills of Point Richmond, California.  We were looking upwards at the constellation of Orion and my husband brought to my attention that one of the brighter &#34;stars&#34; was moving.  Even though I was not wearing my eyeglasses at the time (I am near-sighted and thus have trouble focusing on far objects) I could see the movement of the object quite clearly.  It looked almost exactly like any other star.  It was so far distant from us; however, that we were unable to discern any distinct shape other than that it looked like a star that was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my husband nor myself have either seen nor witnessed any other UFO that behaved in this manner. We have both seen the Space Station and other satellites in the sky as well as comets and meteor showers at other times, but this &#34;apparition&#34; did not behave in any way like any of those other objects.  We are also very used to seeing many different types of aircraft in the sky, as we are on the flight pathways of various airports in the San Francisco Bay area, and this object did in no way resemble any aircraft or the manner in which any aircraft could possibly fly  The UFO appeared in the constellation of Orion and moved in a Northerly direction, but not in a smooth or straight line such as a satellite or comet might, its pattern was highly erratic and it &#34;wandered&#34; along a Northern pathway.  To me it appeared to &#34;jump&#34; from side to side, probably due to the fact that as I was not wearing my eyeglasses and my eyes kept trying to focus on it as it moved.  However, my husband said that the objects movement was fairly smooth, but that it was moving erratically from side to side as it moved &#34;forward.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point it suddenly stopped and it moved backwards quickly and then just as quickly it returned to its forward progression.  It continued to move erratically in this manner and traveled approximately halfway across the visible sky before it rapidly faded and disappeared into the Earth’s shadow. To me it appeared as if it was moving away from us and thus was getting smaller as it progressed on its path.  .<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband describes its behavior as being like a bloodhound during a tracking exercise, in other words it did not move forward without varying from side to side.  Due to how small it appeared and how very far away it seemed to be, it must have been moving at an extremely high rate of speed to cover such a distance in the sky while it moved in this strange pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire event lasted perhaps 5 minutes, maybe a little less, although we were very spellbound by it’s appearance and movement so it may have taken a bit longer in actuality.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded quite mature and sober-minded to us.

3/6/09 16:05|North Augusta|SC|Oval|6-8 sec|Shiny, silver object - looked like flying submarine; No noise, markings, or wings; Fireball/Sonic Boom 2 wks later in same area.|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69315.html|289|ndxe200903| Shiny, silver object - looked like flying submarine; No noise, markings, or wings; Fireball/Sonic Boom 2 wks later in same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday afternoon, March 6, 2009 at about 4:05 PM EST, myself and both my parents witnessed an object flying through the sky from the NW to the NE.  We were sitting outside at our picnic table, because it was such a nice day outside - the sun was shining and there weren&#39;t any clouds in the sky.  I looked up in the sky and saw a trail running vertically between the NW and NE portions of the sky, which we see often when outside.  I pointed the trail out to my parents, and not but two seconds later I saw the object come flying out from behind the top portion of a pine tree, seemingly out of nowhere.  It moved fairly quickly, I&#39;d say quicker than airplanes that we always see flying by.  The area of the sky that we saw the object in is the same area that we always see airplanes and helicopters flying in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was silver and shiny; we noted after seeing it that it was the same color as a silver chain-link fence.  We did not see any wings at all and it made absolutely no noise.  I&#39;m not sure if you would classify it as cylinder, cigar, or oval shaped, but we described it as looking like a submarine.  It was flat looking on the top and bottom and rounded on each end, just like a submarine.  It was flying lower than the airplanes we normally see flying by (and we see lots of airplanes going over where we live and they are extremely noisy), and it was low enough that if it had writing on the sides, we&#39;d be able to read it (but there was no writing on it).  It was obvious to us it wasn&#39;t an airplane or a helicopter, and it was low enough that if it were a blimp, we&#39;d be able to tell.  It literally looked like a flying submarine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate that the object took about 6-8 seconds to get out of our viewing and get behind some more pine trees where we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  About 5 seconds later, a commercial airplane (the kind we always see flying over) came flying from the same direction, NW, flying towards the same direction that the object went, NE.  The object didn’t have any lights that we could see (though it was the daytime and sunny, so we couldn’t tell for sure) and it didn’t leave any kind of trail behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father told me to report it here that very day, but I wanted to wait and see if anyone else saw something and then I forgot about it.  But then, on March 20, 2009 at around 2:45 AM EST, we heard an extremely loud boom come out of nowhere.  It sounded almost like a tree splitting in two or a really loud cracking sound.  Later on in the day on the local news, they reported that everyone in the area had heard the noise and they think it was some kind of a sonic boom.  People who were outside said they saw a fireball in the sky, including some police officers.  The electricity also went out at about the same time at one of the hospitals in the area.  After hearing that noise, I thought I&#39;d better report what we saw earlier this month, in case there is some kind of connection with that sort of thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here are some links to some of our local news organizations that reported on the sonic boom/fireball incident to give you more information on what happened:<n> <n><n> <n><n> WJBF News Channel 6 -<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.wjbf.com/jbf/news/state_regional/south_carolina/article/talk_around_the_csra_is_the_big_boom_in_the_night/11997/<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.wjbf.com/jbf/news/state_regional/georgia/article/breaking_news_mysterious_boom_rattles_csra/11990/  WRDW Channel 12 - http://www.wrdw.com/home/headlines/41580572.html  The Augusta Chronicle - http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2009/03/21/met_515443.shtml<n>

His initials are PD.  This is real not a hoax.  I described what I saw as a flash and you want more detail-ok.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i was driving south bound on the 605 south coming from santa anita- I was probably near passing Duarte.  As I was driving south bound i looked up just below my blue tint of my wind shield.  I seen this glow-it looked like a flash not the speed but the color.  Its shape i would say like a parallagram or like a diamond a smashed diamond- thats the closest i can say because it was bright in a sense that I could not make out the exact form.  As i was looking at it I thought it to be a reflection of a commercial planes wings to the sun, but I did not see any plane after- I repeat-I did not see any plane-planes are not that fast as we see them flying from the ground.  I am looking at this UFO for about 6 seconds or so then I reach for my cell phone.  My cell was in my center console-so I looked down just briefly maybe 3 seconds i get it then I looked up the flash was gone so I am continuing looking for a commercial airplane- as I thought it was a reflection from the sun to its wings.  No plane in sight.  I called my mom and told her because i freaked out- I was gonna tell her what I was seeing and I did.  Then when I happened to look up after i got my cellphone it was gone.  Yes-I seen a UFO.  I will never forget that.  It looked like a smashed diamond the color was-well look at flash from a camera that was the color.  It was still-it was not moving it was still.  I cannot give an estimate in feet but like i said - I thought it might be a reflection of a commercial airline to the sun, but it was not.  I seen something that dissapeared- it was gone in a matter of seconds-just when I was getting my cellphone- go figure- that was something crazy.  again I am not BSing.<n>

I was busy getting linen,when I looked out on the grounds an saw a round object with a orange probing light. I watched it for a bit,when it stared to roll down the grass along the sidewalk a bit than stopped. So I went back to what I was doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got done, I thought I would go check it out an if it was a toy I would take it with me.                 I stared towards the object,when something told me to go back to my van, which I did.                          Once in my van I rolled up my window an started it up, an I sat there a bit an watched it. It turned towards me still rolling on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to move an made a turn, an the object rose up off the ground no higher than the window on the drivers side.At that point if I had le! t my window down I could have touched it, or it could have come inside the van with me &lt; no thanks&gt;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bit smaller than a socker ball.   At that close range I could see it had like hawk wing spread out design all over it except for right in front were the pulsating orange light was comming from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took off an it started to follow me right behind my van.  When I got back to my building I didnt see it any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 5:00am I saw a very bright light light out in the parking lot. I dont know if it had anything to do with the object I saw or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A day or 2 later at the house where I live,there were 2 strange tornada shape things growing in my yard. I have never seen anything like it before. I had asked 3 diff people to come by and look to see if they knew what they were, but they didnt know either,they hadnt never seen anything like them before either<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the person touch it and said ! it felt like it had a grease texture!  I know it sounds weird but I beleave it all had to do with the object I had a very close encounter with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen U.F.Os ever since I was a teenager an have never been scared an I have had some very close encounters with them.  But this was different some how.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the time of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

WHILE PARKED IN SOMERFIELD I SAW A BRIGHT LIGHT APPEAR ON THE HORIZON. IT WAS ROUGHLY A SPHERE SHAPE, ABOUT QUARTER THE SIZE OF A FULL MOON, AND REMAINED STATIONARY SO AT FIRST I THOUGHT THIS WAS A FLARE. AFTER A FEW SECONDS IT PROCEDED TO QUICKLY FLYING TO THE LEFT OUT OF SIGHT BEHIND A HOUSE. AGAIN AFTER A FEW SECONDS IT RETURNED TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION.IT THEN SEEMED TO SPLIT IN TWO AND FLEW OFF AGAIN IN THE SAME DIRECTION THIS TIME VANISHING ALTOGETHER.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE ORIGINAL INCIDENT THE LIGHT RETURNED, ON ITS OWN, TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION. THIS TIME THE SPHERE ALMOST THREE SMALLER, DIMMER SPHERES OUT OF ITS CENTRE WHICH IN THE ORDER THEY PETRUDED FIRED OFF LIKE THE FIRST INCIDENT TO THE LEFT AND DISAPPEARED. THE MAIN LIGHT THEN DID THE SAME AND VANISHED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  AROUND 40 MINUTES LATER AT HOME I DECIDED TO GO OUTSIDE TO SEE IF THE EVENTS WOULD REPEAT THEMSELVES.AFTER A FEW MINUTES I SAW THREE MUCH SMALLER AND DIMMER OBJECT FLYING IN A FORMATION IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE FIRST INCIDENTS. THEY FLEW IN A TRAINGLE FORMATION WITH THE LEADER SPHERE BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHERS. THEY MOVED ACROSS THE HORIZON AT A SPEED TO QUICK FOR CONVENTIONAL JETS.

I was traveling on Union Mills Rd. and at the point where it dead ends into Marvin Rd. is where I saw what ever it was, as I was about to turn right onto Marvin Rd. I seen an extremely large extremly bright yellowish light floating in the sky, that illuminated the surrounding clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the way I was positioned at the stop sign before I turned onto marvin it was directly in front of me, hence if I would have driven directly across marvin and into the field in front of me it appeared to be approx. 4-5 miles away which would have put in only a couple of miles from McChord Air Force Base,<n> <n><n> <n><n> so I turned on to marvin road, and then took an immediate left into the Mcallister Park housing development which leads up a large hill, unfortunately after reaching the top of the hill I could not find anything, I was intrigued enough to go back to where I had my sighting and again could not find anything.  I was just hoping maybe someone got a better look,  Thanks<n>

There was no noise and the lights seemed to be less then 2 miles high. They seemed to be going at mock 3.  There was no noise.  I thought it was a little strange but dismissed it at first as a trick of light when the lights seemed to twist. Less then 10 minutes later 2 lights came from north to south going at more then mock 6 but like before there was no noise.  Then I was sure that what I was looking at and seeing was not normal.

3/5/09 20:05|West Valley City|UT|Circle|20 minutes|Objects hovering near and above Salt Lake City and other one flying in zig zag pattern|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69091.html|295|ndxe200903| Objects hovering near and above Salt Lake City and other one flying in zig zag pattern<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 4 sightings Feb. 27th , 2009, I have been out most every evening except for Wednesday, because it snowed. So I’ve been out every evening with binoculars looking for UFO’s or whatever they are. So five days have pasted and I have not saw anything else. On the sixth day after my first sightings it is Thursday night, March 5th , 2009. I have 3 sighting that were note worthy. These objects were not at all like the objects in my first sightings on Feb. 27th, 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (1)  March 5th, 2009 in the evening about 8:05 I spotted 2 odd bright white lights close together above the mountain range NNE of down town Salt Lake City. I didn’t recall ever seeing any lights here before so I watched them. About 8:15pm an airplane flew near these 2 lights and over the mountain range, so I decided to watch the plane. The airplane was flying across the valley from the east and heading west. Because of this I spotted an object with my 10x50 binoculars while I was watching this  jet fly over the valley from east to west. The object I spotted was coming from the north west and heading south east ward and just a little lower than the airplane. The object was a small dim light with a slight amber color to it. It flew close and under the airplane and then arced up and stopped at about the height that the airplane was. It stay at that spot for about 3 seconds. Then the object moved north a very short distance before stopping again. During this very short movement towards the north I could see 2 circles of lights on the bottom with one light in the center. The lights were white in color, one circle of lights with a smaller circle of lights inside that circle and inside the inner circle was the light in the center.(The object was mainly visibly clear with my binoculars and too far away to bother with photographing it.) The object was fairly high up and hard to get any real detail once it stopped and hovered. At this time I could only see that it had a cluster of lights on the bottom of it. It hovered there for 20 minutes before it flew north and disappeared at about 8:35pm. While I was watching this object, at times I would put the binocular down and give my arms a rest. It was during these periods of resting that I would check out the 2 lights that were close together but never moved. (This sighting is pictured in the northern west area of the map picture with the white line showing its flight path. In the “V” of this line is where it hovered for about 20 minutes.) I am viewing this sighting jus! t south of the red dot marking where West Valley City is on the map.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (2)  The other object that I first saw (8:05pm) was the two odd bright white lights that were side by side and a little above the mountains (NNE of Salt Lake City). I had not ever seen anything bright there before and this was about 8:05pm when I first became aware of this. I felt that it didn’t belong there. I watched it off and on with the binoculars, it never moved at all.  It was during this that I saw an airplane flying near these 2 lights and decided to watch it fly across the valley and if not for this I would have not saw the sighting I first described. During about a 4 minute period of time  while I was watching it, to my surprise, it took off and headed west and then sharply turned north. It didn’t appear to bank at all during this turn. Shortly after I saw it moving north I could see other lights on it and after a short distance a few of the lights  began blinking. Soon it was out of my view. ( 8:20pm) The lights were mostly white and one red light. It flew away at a normal speed similar to a regular aircraft? It was at a good distance and I didn’t bother with trying photograph it. It would have only been another unknown light with no way to identify it. (On the map picture of Salt Lake City in the area NNE on the edge of the mountain range is a red line that goes northward. The start of this red line NNE of Salt Lake City is where it hovered for several minutes before flying north ward) I am viewing this sighting just south of the red dot marking where West Valley City is on the map.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (3)  Later near where I spotted had saw the 2 odd bright lights hovering above the mountain range NNE of Salt Lake City, but north of this area. I panned across this area with my binoculars and I saw a multiple colored light darting back and forth, up and down at times. It mainly zig zagging up and down in “Z” pattern laid on its side! It moved in this jerky fashion as it traveled south ward across and near the mountain tops. At times it was higher than the snow topped mountains under it and other times it was lower than the tops of the mountain. The multiple colored light was only visible with my binoculars. The colors were white, green, red and blue, I didn’t see any of the lights blinking. At times the colors were very sharp and vivid. It kind of reminded me of a buttery flittering about. (9:40 pm) The sighting was about a ½ a minute in duration. I don’t understand why anything would be so erratic in flight. (On the map picture is a squiggle greenish line just north of where the red line starts. This is about where it was sighted moving south ward.) I am viewing this sighting just south of the red dot marking where West Valley City is on the map.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My phone was upstairs, so I went up to answer it, and than out onto my 3rd floor balcony as I noticed the moon was very light.  The night sky was almost absolutely clear, the stars were really shining and I could see very well, since all the sreet lights were out.  I am in Quito Ecaudor, in a valley outside the city.  At about 7:30, while looking at the sky, I saw something far away, as it looked like a star, moving across the night sky.  This was nothing like a shooting star, as I have seen many before....this maintained its luminosity? and moved consistently at the same pace about 90 degrees across the sky.  I called my dad to tell him what he saw, and at his house  1 mile away, he went out.  He noticed something moving across the sky, in the other direction...i was still looking in the direction on mine as I thought it had stopped moving.  Than about 1 hour later, i went back out and saw another object, much lower in the sky move across the mountain range. It definietly have a few red lights....and one white.  It moved across the mountain range, than out over a valley andover a mountain.  This was not a plane.  Since the night sky was so clear, you can EASILY tell an airplane....and also hear it.  This was silent.  About 3 minutes after that had passed, another passed in the same pattern, no noise.  About 5 minutes later...an airplane came in and I could notice the MANY differences in ligthing, noise, etc. than what i had previously just seen.  I could see NO shape with my object really...just by the lighting, it seemed almost circule or diamond shaped, but the lights were clustered close together, so it&#39;s hard to really tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He was playing in the dirt with some trucks, her and I were just talking, looking around.  I was looking around at the mountains, and all of the sudden I see this thing come thru the sky, and it was heading due north across the next mountain, which is a strip job. (coal mining operation) I watched it go all the way across the sky and out of sight.  It was approximately 300 yards from the ground, and went straight north. It did not slow/speed up, it did not turn, the altitude never changed.  It was almost like it was on autopilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the front, it was shaped like an egg, with the pointy end pointing forward. There was a straight part coming from the rear of it, and it was about as long as a car.  It definitely was NOT a helo, was NOT an airplane, was NOT a toy...I looked for 3 hours to see if I could find a picture of a spy drone or something that would have been it, but no luck.  I posted this on a message board and was told to report it to you guys.  All three of us saw it, it made no sounds, no smoke, had no external attachment looking pieces, it was a dull white color.   I have no idea what it was, but it DID scare the crap out of me.  MY gf&#39;s son said &#34;what is that?&#34; and all I could say was &#34;I have no idea.&#34;     This thing wasn&#39;t way up in the sky like a prop plane, it was low , I&#39;d have to know how high the mountains are, but I&#39;m gonna gess maybe 3000ft at the MOST?    I dunno how no one else saw this, it was so obvious, stuck out like a sore thumb.    If you want to contact me, fine...I&#39;ll tell you anything you want to know, but I have no proof, just my word.  It FREAKED ME OUT, I WANT it to be a spy drone or something, because I&#39;ve never saw anything like this in my life. I&#39;ll feel a whole lot better to know it came from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will take pictures of the area if you want it, whatever I can do to help.  I hope you take this as serious as I do.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was moving in an easterly direction at a relatively low rate of speed.  The object turned to the northeast and appeared to be ascending when it quickly disappeared.  There was no contrail and no sound from where I stood.  The elapsed time was approximately ten seconds.<n>

The object was moving erratically in the sky and was slightly larger than the planet Venus just after dark or just before dawn.  It was about 25 to 30 degrees in the morning sky about 6 to 10 miles away and we were facing south. The digital camera we used was hand held and not on a bipod as we were not expecting to capture anything morning. The weather was clear, no cloud cover, no rain, perfect and cool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object, as stated earlier, moved erratically for a short time then stopped and hovered for about 5 minutes. The photo numbered 705 is the picture of the object just hovering.  Once stopped we could tell that it was shaped circular like a doughnut with lights of every color around the outside of the craft with a solid center.  After hovering for 5 minutes or so the object took off moving north relatively fast making no sound what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I saw the object and even though we have been looking for it every morning since we have not seen the object again.  I do realize that alot of people try to hoax the public and are out for their 15 minutes of fame.  This is not the case as we want no media what so ever. Just simply an answer for what we have seen in the sky over our home would suffice.  We understand that may not be possible but just knowing somewhere someone has seen something similar would help.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are not nut cases claiming abduction and honestly we have reservations about the people who do.

3/5/09 03:00|Summerland (Canada)|BC|Triangle|5 Minutes|Triangular UFO over okanagan lake|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70407.html|304|ndxe200903| Triangular UFO over okanagan lake<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reluctant to bring this up but I have been having strange nighttime apparitions which seem to be harmless but are becoming more and more frequent. Have been having these for 9 or 10 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway aside from that have had many curious and odd things happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to start with my sighting in March 2005 at 3:00am in Summerland, B.C.. I was visiting relatives in Summerland, B.C. and go there regularly, on this particular evening oddly enough we were discussing UFO&#39;s and my comment was, &#34;How could you not believe there are UFO&#39;s or other types of beings? The universe is so big we would be arrogent to think we were the only beings to exist.&#34;   There was some agreements and disagreements and the conversation fizzled out and eventually everyone went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was staying in my cousins house in the bedroom attic with the head of my bed facing south. I woke up looking out of the north window and it was very bright out and didn&#39;t think much of it then looked out the south window at the head of my bed to see if the light was comeing from the south. When I turned to look out of my bedroom window it was anything but bright, in the middle of the sky probably about 1/4 mile from me over the Okanagon Lake was a beautiful black triangle with lights on each corner. I pinched myself and patted myself down to make sure I wasn&#39;t dreaming and was stunned and frightened. It was really beautiful and smooth and black. I thought maybe for a moment it was a new type of plane like a stealth but I knew at once it wasn&#39;t. I wanted to run downstairs and tell my cousin but, #1. I didn&#39;t want to freak her out and #2. I was afraid to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway It silently hung in the air and did not move, I didn&#39;t sense it was hovering at all it was just there as still as anything. The triangle was probably about as large as a football field and extremely smooth and beautiful to look at. While I was looking at this UFO or whatever it was, this huge opalescent ball, (something like a bubble full of soap) came right up out of the top of it and hovered for a few seconds then flew straight up in the air and disapeared. By now I was totally freaked out and ran downstairs to get my cousin and of course by the time I could calm down and tell her what happened we ran back upstairs and it was gone. Naturally my cousin thinks I&#39;m a nut and had too much to drink. (for the record I wasn&#39;t drunk)  I have always been a believer of things that are unusal and strange to us that the majority of people refuse to think is possible, this event has totally solidified my belief in UFO&#39;s or whatever you want to call them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw and regardless of what anyone thinks there is something going on here that our government is well aware of and has been for many years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My ex-husband and I have also witness ball lightning floating through our bedroom window in 1994. It floated around the room very slowly then left with an explosive crashing sound through our night light. Nothing was damaged, although it sounded like the light shattered . My ex husband is about as cynical and skeptical as they come, so, slightly happy that such a skeptic actually saw this strange phenonema.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Further back in the 70&#39;s my aunt and I witnessed a huge fireball in the Nevada desert. We were on our way to Disneyland for a family trip (I think I was 10) I was in our camper on top of the higher bunk with the window facing forward towards the road. My aunt and I were the only people to witness this huge fireball that seemed to come toward us then blow up. The funny thing was that my aunt and I never talked about it until 20 years later. She has also been a witness to UFO&#39;s. Although, I have great interest in Ufology, she does not, but certainly cannot deny what she has seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To tell you the truth this frightens me a bit and have read alot of books on the subject and have come to a few of my own conclusions, mostly conspiracy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I certainly hope letting you know about this does not open a can of worms for me but have wanted to chat about it for some time. I did report this incident to UFOBC years ago but to me its always at the forfront of my mind and     wanted to share it with whomever would listen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

3/4/09 21:45|Fairchild AFB|WA|Other|7 mins|Silent strange shaped chopper|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69066.html|306|ndxe200903| Silent strange shaped chopper<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 4 2009 at about 9:45 pm. I was outside on my back porch smoking a cigarette, when I noticed what I thought to be the light of a plane to my left. (west or south/west) then I notice it wasn’t moving so I thought it to be a star, however too bright to be, then I remembered my wife telling me of an asteroid that recently passed earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I began to think that’s what I was seeing, for it was too big and bright to be a normal star.  I then heard what I knew was an airplane coming from behind me heading towards the same direction.  (I was in the back porch and the flight line is about ten blocks in front of my house give or take.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I notice the &#34;star like&#34; light rise, then I began to notice a flashing light from the bottom left and the airplane was passing under it.  The object began to slowly move to the right in front of me.  As it did it did the airplane was coming up on the object and the plane looked different from what I was used to at night.  I definitely could identify the airplane, a little further away than the object, in a normal flight path that I usually see them.  For airplanes tend not to fly too close over base housing from what I’m used to.   However the plane was darker than usual. The object moved at a slower pace closer to me, allowing the plane to pass below it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was a helicopter, trying to convince myself with the fact that it was a hovering light in the distance at first. But there was no chopper sound, for it how close it was.  I then noticed the dark outline similar to a large helicopter or even a shoe.  I saw a bluish light on what would be the tail of the helicopter. The bright light was now towards what would be the windshield of the helicopter now a little dimmer since I believed to be seeing it from the side, a blinking light under the rear and a red light on the bottom towards the front about a third of a distance from the front.  The lights were definitely brighter than the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw that the lights of the object were projecting on the body of it. Giving me somewhat of an idea of how the body was shaped other than a silhouette. So as it flew away to my right, (East, north/east) it was very wide in the back.  The bluish light still visible.  The bright light dimmer, but still visible.  Narrow at the top and wide at the bottom. And a smaller blinking white light towards the left center of the rear. Reddish light also still visible, but also dimmer.  There was also a glow coming from the center of the object, running in a line almost the entire rear.  I believe it could have been interior lights or just the exterior lights projecting on the outside curvature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I believe it to be strange was the fact that the airplane was darker than I was used to and also that it appeared to be there only to make a sound everyone was familiar with to make up for the strange object in the night sky tonight.  Also, the fact that it was close enough for me to see the outline and the lights projecting on the outside and the fact that it was hovering for about five minutes.  But considering the hovering and the distance of the object, there were no sounds of a helicopter, nor any other aircraft coming from this particular object.   As it flew away the plane was ahead of it to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was about two hours ago.

It is what I believe to be known as a flap, only not so many people seem to be spotting them. One other person has seen three before, unknown others may have too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was putting the rubbish outside when I spotted the UFO in the sky, directly adjacent to my house. I jusually check now and this is the second time in under two weeks. I rushed to the window upstairs for a better look, and used my torch and a list of morse codes to try to establish contact. All that happened was that the UFO (which was perfectly still in the sky, only differentiating from a star by its flashes and colour changes) flashed more sporadically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I gave up on contact, seeing it couldn&#39;t communicate back. I got my mother and showed her it, but being a sceptic she glanced at it and just said it was a star. However she likes to deny it, she is a witness to this too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then anothe UFO or possibly more (I couldn&#39;t tell) flew north west past my house, just like many before them. The first one stayed still, and the others dissapeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then tried morse coding them to take me onboard, in the hopes of some third kind encounter. At this point a very bright light came flying past from behind a tree. At first I thought it was one coming for me, as it seemed to be getting closer. However it flew past, and even now I can not tell whether it was a UFO or a stealth fighter. It had three lights in a triangular pointed layout, but I do not wish to jump to conclusions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another UFO then seemed to come and head north east, after the stealth fighter. I did not see much but a faint shimmer of this one, leading me to wonder whether or not in my current excited situation my eyes were playing tricks. However when I settled down to report it to my friends on the internet site Facebook a heard a loud rumble. I looked out of the window to find a plane or jet on its side, heading extremely fast north east. This is a clear sign that the RAF is now involved, and most likely RAF Cosford.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please look into this, as I have pleaded many times something big could be happening here and I seem to be the only one to realise it. Also a few weeks ago I had another sighting which I did not report, in which I saw one of them taking off from a nearby field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several seemingly serious-minded reports from same source.

Coming outside from the house, I immediately saw an object about the size of a penny held at arm&#39;s length.  It was circular and yellow/orange in color, with a bright center and slightly dimmer radius.  At first I thought it was a meteor, but it was moving slower than that and appeared larger and less bright.  Its speed was very consistent, and was becoming more dim as it moved from south to north.  I didn&#39;t think any of this was particularly unusual until it INSTANTLY changed direction, almost but not quite 90 degrees to its original path.  It continued in this direction and became more and more dim until it faded completely from view.  At one point it was obstructed by a bush in the yard, so I ruled out some kind of hallucination / visual artifact.  There was no sound accompanying the object.  The entire event lasted perhaps 15-20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It lasted one second, maybe less. A bright star appeared in the sky and instantly began falling.  It wasnt falling on an angle like a shooting star or meteor, it fell stright down.  It was a white blue bright color that didnt change at all as it fell. It had no tail trailing behind it. It looked like a bright dot in the sky, like a falling star, but without the trail.  It made no noise, and the color stayed the same as it fell. A plane was in the sky as we were driving; when the object fell the plane changed directions and began to head towards the fallen object.  All 3 observers are Humboldt State University students.  We all saw it as soon as it appeared as it was the brightest star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I stared at it, then looked behind me at the moon and a bright star (to make sure my eyes weren&#39;t playing tricks on me), then turned back around, and saw the object still there.  A plane then passed by it at a lower altitude, and I was stunned to realize it truly wasn&#39;t moving.  I have never seen anything like this.  Silver, boomerang and slightly shiny. It was twilight (5:50 pm).<n>

Yesterday, 03/04/2009, Wednesday, I was on my way to work. I was east of Neosho, MO, between Netonia, MO, and the MO hwy 86 and US 60 and MO 59 junctions. The exact time was 3:10 a.m.  The sky was clear and I could see stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I passed East Newton High School on hwy 86 I looked in my review mirror and noticed two amber lights approaching me fron behind.  The lights approached me at a steady pace and then back off to keep distance between me and the amber lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought someone was coming up on me without head lights on and just had their parking lights on.  As I had this thought, the amber lights came up behind me again this time very fast, I then tapped my breaks and slowed some.  I watched in my review mirror as I did this. My tail lights then illuminated the outline of what appeared to be a wedge shaped object behind me and the two amber lights where in the bottom front of it and the bottom front was wedge shaped like the front of a snow plow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then sped up to 90 mph to get away and the object then dropped back about 10 car leangths. As I approached the intersection of MO rt H and hwy 86 the object was once again on my rear bumpper , with the amber lights glowing.The speed at wich it approached me was AMAZING. It was right behind me and a amber hugh then engulfed the car on the inside. As I looked in my review mirror I observed the amber lights on the front of the object look as if they shuddered. I could feel heat on my neck, arms,face, and back.I could also hear a very distinct humming sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to drive 80 and 90 mph until I approached a curve in the highway. when I hit my brakes hard and slowed for this curve.The craft then dropped back again and the amber hugh then left my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I went around the curve I observed the craft leave the road behind me and travel diagonal to the southwest from my position across a vast open field, but the amber lights were still facing my direction. The object was now about 150 yards to my left. It was now about treetop high.  The craft then continued facing my direction with the amber lights facing me and started moving to the southeast and climbing slowly as it did.  The craft then paused in mid air, turned were the amber lights now faced the northeast and shot up at an angle to the northweast horizon.  When the craft went to the northeast it was a very bright flash of amber light and a silver streak.  If I would have blinked I would have missed it.  That is how fast it left.<n>

I listed them in the full description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello, I have seen objects several times in my life. I will list below the year and what was going on at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1985  My 1st sighting, I was in 6th grade, we just came home from food shopping, it was late, my dads friend stopped by, I went into the backyard to help with the groceries, while talking to my dads friend, I noticed lights above me, when I looked up, I saw a large, round craft that was encircled with lights, it moved so slow, I stood there watching it, as it was barely above my home, I asked my dads friend “What is that” he stated “I don’t know”. We watched it moved towards my garage, then past the alley, then disappeared out of sight. It was so strange, I never spoke of it. This sighting was in Upland, CA   1989 I was 16, while driving to pick up my friend who lived in Ontario, CA, I noticed an object moving quickly through the sky, it was cylinder in shape. What caught my eye, is that while flying, the craft seemed to be flipping, or turning, it was so strange, that I found myself watching it, suddenly just disappeared. This was in the evening, it was dark out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Summer 2000 While driving through Phoenix, AZ, it was late, I was on my way to California from Texas, the sky was changing colors rapidly which caught me and my brother’s eye. It was about dusk, when the first craft appeared out of clouds it came, suddenly there were 2, then next thing we knew, there were 5. We started to talk about the crafts and it was like they heard us. The crafts were round, and almost in formation style, when one craft lifts looked like they were signaling to the others, then the others started to signal back. The next thing we knew we were being followed by the crafts, I know it sounds strange, but they stayed with us till we reached our destination. I was so scared I even stopped at some gas station to call my husband, and mom to tell them I was being followed and didn’t know what to do, of course they didn’t believe me, needless to say, I never pulled over to sleep that night, and drove straight through to California. During the time I was driving ! they would put a light on us, then back away, they would hide behind building then pop out of know where, then they drive along side our car. I had never been so scared, and it really sucked no one believed us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> March 2009 My daughter actually seen this one, she states she was in her room, when she heard a noise, she walked to the window to see 2 crafts, one was hovering above the other. The other one was in our backyard, hovering, she states it was round with lights all around it. She states after a few minutes, it finally started moving towards the front of the house, she came running downstairs saying “I just seen a UFO it going to the front” so we all ran out to the front porch, but we did not see anything. This was in the evening after dusk, in Piqua,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  We have invited the witness to re-submit her reports, each separately from the others.  PD))<n>
3/3/09 20:45|Gurnee|IL|Light|1 minute|It was a mysterious light that headed our direction and then turned off never making a noise.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69052.html|318|ndxe200903| It was a mysterious light that headed our direction and then turned off never making a noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of March 3, 2009 at 8:45pm I witnessed something unexplainable along with a friend.  I first witnessed the light while I was on the way to a friend’s house from the coffee shop that is about 1 mile away.  To get to and from the two location I generally take the back roads cutting through the neighborhoods and this time while I was looking into the northern sky I saw a light that I dismissed to be a planet that must have been visible in the night sky and I had the intention of looking up what planet it could have been.  As I was driving through the neighborhood I was constantly losing and regaining sight of the light and after about 15 seconds it was gone which I thought was weird because it previously appeared to be in a constant position in the sky.  About a half mile down the road I proceeded to turn to the south and the object or at least an identical one appeared in the southwest region of the sky, this time the object was high enough that I didn’t lose sight of it all the way to my friends house another fourth of a mile down the road.  Once I pulled into to the street he lives on I proceeded to get out of the car and look up at the object which now was directly south of me at this point.  I stared at the object for 10 seconds trying to imagine what it could be but I had no idea then another friend pulled up and got out of his car asking me what I was doing just standing out in the cold so I told him to look up at the light.  We both gazed at it for 15 seconds then it started to move towards us at a fairly fast pace and once it was about halfway to us the light turned off and the object whatever it may have been was gone, there was no sound the entire time just the light.  We both stood there completely in awe at what had happened scanning the sky trying to find the object assuming it would reappear and after a minute or so we went inside not knowing what we had just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the same night three hours later at 11:45pm there were three of us in the car coming from the Wendy’s which is right next to the coffee shop that we were at before the previous incident and when we first headed there I looked into the sky hoping to see something but of course there wasn’t anything but the stars.  But on the way back all three of us saw the object again in almost the same place as before only a couple miles further south and maybe 1,000ft higher in the sky.  We watched it wondering what it was for about 20 seconds then it proceeded to move to the west for 5 seconds and suddenly changed direction and headed to the south east at an incredible rate of speed.  It was gone from sight in less than a minute and now all three of us were amazing at what we had seen but still no explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was larger and brighter than anything in the sky, the moon wasn’t visible during either sighting.  The object itself was easily 10 to 15 times bigger than planes that fly at that altitude and distance away if not larger.  And it was going 10 times faster than any other planes in the sky.  This was something that I cannot explain and would have never have imagined seeing with my own eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To me, no big deal. 6 minutes later as I headed north, I saw 2 red lights not far away from 2 other red lights. There were no other lghts on these UFOs. I tried to get closer, but as I got closer they started to fly further and further away. I had my video camera with me and I tried my hardest to at least get some video, but I could not. I drove after them but I lost them. About 15 minutes, I saw a single light pulsating like crazy. I pulled out my camcorder that was turned on, but it some how turned off by itself so I had to turn it back on. As I drove toward that UFO, it flew away as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was at the computer, up much later than I normally would be. The way the room is set up has the computer on a desk facing the window. Since the computer room is on the 2nd floor, it provides a decent view of the sky outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, while playing an online game I was suddenly distracted by an extrememly bright, amber light outside the window. I looked up and in the sky was an orb, growing in size and brightness. It became so bright so fast I had to squint and shield my eyes. Once it seemed to reach its peak of brightness it suddenly dissapeared. It was floating right above the treeline, probably a good bit away. It was hard to make out a distance of how far it was away because it was so bright. Right afterwards I ran downstairs and outside to try and get a better view, but the sky was empty except for stars. Looking south I saw a normal airplane, but that was all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know if this was an actual &#34;craft&#34; or not. It did not move, it was just grew in size and brightness. It was an interesting shade of amber, but what I found strange was the light it emitted did not light up the earth below.

At first I thought it was a small-medium sized blimp as it appeared to be the same shape and made little, if no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared as though it was faintly illuminated internally with slowly pulsating electric blue lights, similar to lights used on emergency vehichles. The blimp then slowly halted and remained stationary for 30-40 seconds.Then in awe I observed the blimp roll on its side and slowly &#39;peel off&#39; over school/college/office buildings. I beleive that at this point the blimp climbed at 15-20m/s perfectly vertically and disappeared into the cloud covered sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had drunk two pints of lager, but I believe that what I saw was not imaginary.  I was within 400 meters of the blimp and although I was in a poorly lit street, the internal illumination made it look just like a blimp with a thin non-metal skin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I first noticed the bright shining object as I started home on US Route 12.  I gave a casual glance at the sky, as I often do. The stars were visible.  When I first noticed the flashing object, I thought it was an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued driving south on Route 12, I continued to watch the object.  I noticed that it was not moving.  I then thought it might be a cell tower, but quickly realized that it was too high in the sky to be a tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost track of the object as the road curved through the valley.  I spotted it once again as I turned onto Route 122.  It was still in the same spot. I was able to monitor its position in the sky by the other star formations present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I again lost sight of the object as I went down the mountain toward my home. As I turn onto the road to my house, I again spotted the object.  I had a good view, so I stopped my car and sat about 5 minutes observing the bright flashing object. It had not moved from its position in the sky from my first sighting about 20 minutes previous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, I glanced down at my clock.  When I looked up it was gone.  I searched the sky.  It was gone.  It disappeared in the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this because I believe it is note worthy.  I often take time to observe the night sky.  I have observed the Sky Lab as it transverses the sky.  I have seen shooting stars.  I have observed many airplanes in the night sky.  This object was different than any thing I have observed. It was as bright as the brightest star in the sky.  It was as large as Mars or Venus in the winter sky.  It appeared more oblong than round.  It was flashing very fast.  It was stationary.  It disappeared in an instant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

They were flying together, but not in straight and level flight. They were moving up and down and weaving in and around each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were flying at the bottom of some low clouds, sometimes visible and sometimes hidden in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing them for 15 seconds I grabbed my Nikon 12 x 50 binoculars from just inside the patio door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to view them again for another 30 seconds before they were out of view. I was able now to see more detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were round circular flat objects, which appeared to taper down from the center to a fine sharp edge. I was not able to see any lights or windows, because of my distance from the objects. The diameter of the objects is difficult to determine but I think they probably were less than 50 ft in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects continued to fly North above the 205 freeway area and disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total viewing time Aprox. 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, I thought it was a star, but it had a silvery shine to it, so I ran to get my camera and binoculars.  As I first saw the object with my binoculars, I could tell that the stationary object was not a plane, or anything that I have ever seen.  It was about two hands above the horizon directly East from my location. My wife is a witness to the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained stationary for about 10 minutes.  At this point I tried to take some pictures but could not find the object in the viewfinder so I just randomly took some pictures in the hope of capturing the object.  I was not successful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then began to move NWN and made a 45-degree travel in a matter of about 30 seconds and then disappeared behind some clouds.  About two minutes later, my wife spotted another similar bright shiny object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This second object was about three hands above the horizon and SE from our location.  I saw the object with my binoculars and it had the same configurations as the first object.  After a couple of minutes clouds covered the object and when the clouds cleared, the object was nowhere to be seen.  I tried looking for it but could not find it anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes later a twin-engine propeller plane flew a route of east to north, exactly the same route the object took but at a lower altitude.<n>

3/1/09 21:30|Colorado Springs|CO|Triangle|15 minutes|UFO hovers off of mile marker 129 (Interstate 25) in Colorado Springs??|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69022.html|334|ndxe200903| UFO hovers off of mile marker 129 (Interstate 25) in Colorado Springs??<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were headed south on I-25 towards Pueblo, CO when at approximately 9:30 PM I saw a bright light ahead of our vehicle in the distance.  Assuming it was a low flying airplane or a helicopter with the bright search light on, I watched without much thought or concern.  After about 5 minutes passed I realized that the object had not moved and we were getting closer to it.  As we got near, the one light from the distance became two distinct lights with a couple red lights in between.  Again reminding me of a plane, however, this object was still stationary.  We actually passed the object at around mile marker 129 (it was to the east of the interstate) and at this point we could make out the three bright white lights in a triangle shape.  The object NEVER moved.  I also noticed some blinking coming from on top of the craft, I could make out two brighter white lights that would blink up high and one of the red lights blink below.  The craft made no sound and continued to hover as it got smaller in the distance of us driving away.  In total, I watched the object for about 15 to 20 minutes.  This length of time rules out the possibility of it being a low flying airplane because that would have come and gone in minutes.  The helicopter is the only logical explanation, but that doesn’t explain the silence nor the triangle shape of the lights (and I could be wrong, but I thought they could not hover in one spot for too long of a time).   Furthermore, I have seen many helicopters growing up in Colorado next to all the airports and air force base and I’ve never seen one stay perfectly still for as long as this did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/1/09 21:00|Leeds (UK/England)||Light|16 minutes|2 UFO's sighted over Leeds UK.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69017.html|335|ndxe200903| 2 UFO&#39;s sighted over Leeds UK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 21:00 on 01/03/09 while driving up Ramshead Drive from Northpark way Leeds 14 with my partner and our daughter, I observed to the west a very bright stationary object, which immediately drew my attention as being &#34;not normal&#34; and so I pulled over in the road to observe it. From where we stopped we had a very clear view over the city center to the south west, and just over to the west was this stationary bright white object hovering around I would say 1000 feet or less. It was what looked to be pulsating in size and changing colour from brilliant white to red over in cycles. My partner being very skepticle about these kinds of things, struck me as unusual as she was very excited at what we were observing. Both myself and my father have a very keen interest in the UFO abduction phenomenon and so at this point I phoned my father to tell him about what I was observing. Only to have the phone answered by a very excited tone saying how he had too seen the objects and was observing &#34;them&#34; with my mother and brother in the sky to the west. At this point being very confused about them seeing more than one object, a red object of slightly smaller size appeared in the sky at a much lower altitude to the first, but pulsating hovering around i would say 500 feet. I am training to be a pilot and so I feel I have an accurate knowlege on jusging this height. At this point around 21:10 an airliner approaching from the south decending into Leeds Bradford Airport (at which may I point out was a Jet2 boeing 737 LS348 from Dusseldorf, and must have also viewed these objects) passed between them on its decent into Leeds. This was a very spectacular sight, as just as the airliner passed the lower red object, it ascended virtically at a very high rate of speed before winking out and disapearing. At which point the larger higher bright white and red object that had remained fairly stationary, although seemed to change in size and shape in cycles, now from what I could see began to move to the west, con! stantly pulsating red and white light, until it too winked out and disappeared into the distance at a very fast rate to the west. At which point I made the journey back home to talk to my family about what I had seen, who also had exact same accounts to what I had just witnessed. Now these objects were fairly stationary in the sky for at least around 10 minutes before making movement and departing sight. In that time not only did the previous airliner above pass through the airspace but another Jet2.com from paris CDG also on approach into Leeds. Both of these must have also seen the objects, as must have Leeds air traffic control. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a small dark object, stationary unlike a bird or plane.  I watched it for a few minutes to see whether or not it was a plane, helicopter, bird, etc.  It had none of these obvious characteristics.  It just hovered.  It was difficult to determine exactly how far away it was, but I would guess between 2 and 5 miles, based on the geography of the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the object rise, I would guesstimate a few hundred feet, I alerted my friend Phil.  He immediately wrote it off as a bird or plane. I told him to keep watching it, it was stationary and would move slowly up and down, then horizontally some distance.  We measured the movement and it’s position by the distance between the telephone poles that are about 3 to 4 blocks away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued watching it for about ½ hour as planes flew by it and we then realized it was not an aircraft, plane or helicopter.

She was as mystified as we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only explanation I had is that it might have been a kite.  The only problem with that explanation was there was little or no wind, plus the altitude of this object was at least 1000 to 1200 ft high and it would not swing from side to side as a kite would naturally do. After about one and a half hours, the object seemed to drift in a south west dierection out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Anaheim report of 2-01-09 was 3-01-09, I submit this correction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is to correct the date of my first report.

Bliss, TX.  My Fiance is a twenty five year old accountant major studying in her final semester at the University of Texas in El Paso.  My friend is a twenty year old Army Spc. stationed at Ft. Bliss as well.  My fiance and I were at this friends apartment in central El Paso between the hours of 1830 and 0200.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The electricity in El Paso was disrupted due to a vehicle collision with a power transformer approximately around 0015.  Clear skies with stars brightly visible with a low smoggy haze in the south western end of El Paso.  We stepped outside to determine if other neighboring apartments had lost power along with my friends apartment when my friend noticed an unknown number of white/yellow lights traveling across the Franklin Mountain range above the western end of El Paso.  Pointing our attention to the western skies of El Paso, my fiance and he both witnessed the cluster of lights disappearing over the mountain traveling east.  I did not witness the lights due to a highway sign obstructing my exact view.  Not able to see the lights in the western skies I turned my attention directly to the skies above me and on an angle looking towards the east.  I then witnessed four dull blue/white balls of lights in a diamond shape pattern approximately two to three miles above me traveling east to west at an unknown high rate of speed.  The pattern of lights then slowed and came to a stop directly above me.  At that time I grabbed my fiance&#39;s arm and pointed directly to the lights above us. She witnessed the formation as well.  The four lights then seemingly holding its pattern turned directly straight to the ground the forward light now at the bottom of the diamond (creating the pattern of an upside down diamond), this all taking maybe two to three seconds. It within seconds of repositioning itself continued moving towards the west at a high rate of speed. As the pattern was heading west, the far left light darted directly out of the formation to a dis! tance ap proximately a half of one mile to the north east and then snapped back into formation within one second. The formation continued to the west until it was no longer visible. My friend did not witness these lights as he was still scanning for the lights that travelled across the Franklin Mountains. Five to ten minutes passed while we continued watching the sky above us as well as the skies above the mountain range. My friend then witnessed and called our attention to a dull dark orange ball that was only noticeable due to the street and parking lights below it. It was approximately the size of a seventy five centimeter exercise ball hovering one hundred yards above the ground, two hundred yards to the west of where we were standing, above a one story building. The ball darted slowly one or two feet to the left, then up one or two feet, then right one or two feet, it then slowly traveled away from us moving west at an very slow speed, possibly three to five miles an hour, until it was no longer visible due to the smoggy haze or beyond the street lights that were illuminating it. We continued watching the sky for an additional ten minutes until retreating back inside the apartment and out of the forty five degree night air.<n>
