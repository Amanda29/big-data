4/21/86 18:30|Marysville (Plumas Arboga Road)|CA|||We saw a 3 foor diameter glowing sphere hover over water, land and then straight up to the sky.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56134.html|2|ndxe198604| We saw a 3 foor diameter glowing sphere hover over water, land and then straight up to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve waited long enough, so here is my sighting and I hope someone else saw it or can help me figure out what it was that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s been awhile, springtime in 1986 and I think it was past mid April, and I must admit, I don’t recall the exact date, but it didn’t seem to matter at the time, the weather was nice. The place was a back water slough at the south end of Plumas Arboga rd just past the over pass of highway 70 in what is considered part of the town of Marysville California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My younger brother, his friend and my cousin ( all about 16 years of age) went cat fishing at a jack slough that evening around 17:30. We were on the east side of the slough which ran north and south, and would be facing east while we fished, ( towards Beale AFB at that) and were gathering firewood before the sun went down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin was next to me and suddenly sid, &#34;Hey you guys, what’s that?&#34; I was hunched down toward the east getting ready to start the fire, and turned around and looked back toward the west. The sun just went down past the levy and the sky was clear, there was a little glare, and when I first looked back I didn’t see anything. My brother and his friend started yelling, “what is it, what in the hell is it?” I looked at them and realized they were looking almost right over our heads, I looked up and I saw a glowing sphere, approximately 3 feet in diameter, about 10 to 12 feet over our heads! I was in awe as I quickly began to rationalize what I was looking at because I am skeptical when it comes to this kind of thing, but this was not ordinary and it was right there in plain, clear site!.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a round bubble looking sphere, transparent, with a small bright glowing light in the center. That outer perimeter of it was slightly glowing because of the small light from within it. It was moving dead east about 2 to 3 miles per hour on a straight course for the AFB. It did not make any noise, did not move up or down or side to side, just straight and very steady. The younger boys were getting excited and kept asking me what it could be. I kept staring, watching it almost every single second, and paid attention to everything that was happening to the best of my ability.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved steady over the water, I believe the cooler air would cause some sort of fluxuation or rift with any man made floating craft especially something so small, but nothing, straight it went. There was a reflection in the water, and a shadow as it went over the opposite side and towards the opposite levy from us. Over that levy was nothing flat, plowed up farm land as far as the eye could see, and I knew it, so we ran south toward the bridge, went eastward over the bridge and watch it float over the field. We didn’t know what to think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it travel slowly for about 10 more minutes and  then, without a sound, about ¾ of a mile away, it curved  up at 90 degrees and shot away! 	We talked about calling someone, but, couldn’t come up with anything that was going to sound serious or rational. I should have called anyway, and I regret it to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it didn’t stop there. A few days later, my cousin, who lived across the street, and about  75 yards from the first sighting, called on the phone screaming for me and my brother to get to his house right away, the light was back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran as fast as we could, and when we got there we could hear him and his mother in the back yard, so we ran to the back yard and there it was, the same sphere, floating just  like before, over his fence, over the small field, over the levy, over the exact spot where we first saw it, over the slough, the east levy, over the field toward the AFB and then disappeared just like before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my knowledge, it was never seen again. I will send some images via email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ps I was 23 years old.<n>
4/15/86 21:50|Lafayette|LA|Light|1 minute|A sighting of four bright objects seen performing unusual maneuvers with no apparent change in speed.|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14106.html|3|ndxe198604| A sighting of four bright objects seen performing unusual maneuvers with no apparent change in speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four objects of medium luminosity were observed travelling at an undetermined height - but definitely greater than 10,000 feet in line abreast formation with uniform spacing between the objects.  It is impossible to determine their speed other than that they appeared to be travelling more quickly than a commercial airliner, but their speed was constant.  After traveling roughly 1/2 of the way across the visible sky, the formation instanteously changed to a diamond formation with no apparent change in the speed of any of the objects.  It was almost magical, in that it changed literally in the blink of an eye.  After travelling approximately 2/3 of the way across the visible sky the formation again instantaeously changed, this time into a line with the space between the objects considerably diminished.  As soon as this line was formed, in order each of the objects described a semicircular path with the first going right, the second left, third right, and fourth left. With the completion of the maneuver, the objects ended up in a line identical to the one observed just before the maneuver began.  As soon as the line formed, the objects again instantaneously shifted to a line abreast formation, and contined until I could no longer observe the objects.  Thoughout the entire process, with the exception of the semicircular maneuver (at which they appeared to move more rapidly) was there any change in the apparent speed of the objects.  As an enthusiast of military and sporting aviation, I can categorically state that no military or commercial aircraft that I am aware of can make the types of manuevers made by these objects.  During the entire event there was no sound associated with the passage of these objects.<n>

He observed something in the sky, he then called out for us to come out and tell him what he was seeing in the sky.  What we observed was a main Saucer above us facing south. It had lights of red, yellow, blue and white and maybe one other color spinning in a counter clockwise motion..<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then noticed to the left of us three smaller disk moving in high speed towards the saucer and once all three reached underneath the saucer they stopped in an instant, danced around in a slight up and down motion for a about 10 seconds and all of the sudden shot out in a blink of an eye over the bay area in the direction of San Francisco.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three smaller saucers were lit up like balls of at least four different colors of light.  They made triangular moves all together for about 5 seconds and shot back to the main saucer in such high speed if you blinked you would have missed it.  Came to a stop again underneath the craft and in an instant the! y looked like they were sucked up into it and the saucer shot off in the sky, south over the ocean, towards what would be Hawaii and gone it was.<n>

About 12:30 a.m.I had to go to the bathroom. My husband walked  with me into the woods.Off in the distance we could see poachers spotlighting for game. I do not remember going to the bathroom at all because of the very large red and blue orbs that appeared one on each side approximately 50-100 yards apart from us. The intensity of the orbs blinded us like a paralyzed deer in headlights. Slowly thay came together directly in front of us and merged they shot straight into the sky. We scambled back to where our friends were and were shocked as they began telling us how worried they were because we had been gone almost 4 hours.We never spoke about that night after that night. 2 years later we separeted. 8 years after the incident I ran into him . He came over and I asked him if he remembered the incident. His jaw dropped to the floor as he then told me that he has reacurring dreams of it but he did not remeber the actual incident or that I had been with him. and<n>

It was similar to a top and the color was similar to amber .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The drone craft&#39;s appearance was similar to a toy top.  It was a spring day and I had some windows opened to enjoy the cool air.  I was in my kitchen and just ended a telephone call when I walked into my hallway.  I turned to the left adjacent to the laundry room and saw this craft.  I was stunned and also quite surprised.  I was scared and walked down the hallway into my family room.  The drone craft moved silently toward the spot where I was just standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to observe the motion of this craft.  It was spinning silently counterclockwise.  I said to myself, it looks like an old-fashioned top.  It had a long grayish, granite looking cylinder at the bottom with notches at the end.  The color of the drone craft was a burnt brown color, almost like an amber color.  There were gold tones with light glowing from inside.  Each rib on the top had a formation of what appeared to be hexagon or honeycomb shape.  The very top had a grayish or charcoal surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I was in the family room, I panicked and realized I was trapped.  The funny thing was I walked back into the hallway and got down low to go under this drone craft and it moved out of the way. The drone craft appeared to be looking inside my house.  Looking in the living room, the bathroom and then into the family room.  I went to look for a camera, but when I came back.  It was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never knew this site existed and after looking in sitings in Illinois, it appears nothing like this was ever reported before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is an incident I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

We were with a tour to see the event of Haley&#39;s comet leaving earth that day. It was too hazy to see the comet,so we watched the clear sky overhead. Lights started to appear &amp; move at great speed in all directions &amp; angles. We counted at least 30 or more. It was like play, as there was no pattern to moves. They cavorted all around each other. This lasted 1 hour. Just before dawn,about 5 am, one craft broke away &amp; swooped down towards us at great speed.  It did a pass over our heads &amp; disappeared into the dawn sky very fast. It showed us a definate round flat disc as it came close. It appeared like a celebration at the exact time of the comet&#39;s last view from earth. It was awesome. The observers were the Tour leader, myself a registered nurse &amp; another registered nurse. I have observed other ufo displays similar to this, but have never seen the disc so clearly or low. In the dim dawn light, it appeared kind of brownish colored. It moved too fast to see any other details.<n>

My brother, his wife and my now ex-wife were driving across the desert from Las Vegas to Palm Springs early morning and encountered a huge craft hovering fifty feet off the desert. Our wifes were screaming and locked the doors, but then everything gets fragmented after that.. We do remember watching it later- way up in the sky, pulsating off and on and zipping back and forth across the sky between the mountains- off in the distance. It zipped out into the middle of the sky waited a few seconds and zipped away, just as a jet zoomed by where it was a few seconds before... We were all very upset, confused, dazed and stopped at the first pay phone. My brother and I had a hard time getting both of us into the booth and getting the door closed to get the light on so we could read the phone book.(too scared to actually complete call).. We later freaked out when we were unpacking at the first motel, when we realized that we had left early so we could have lunch in Palm Springs-----so it shouldn&#39;t have been dark... Fragmented memories of more and fear ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I observed 3 objects in the west I couldn&#39;t tell their size so I really couldn&#39;t tell how high they were.They were oval or round dificult to tell at the hight they were. I observed them till they left. It was like they were putting on an air show.They were in a triangle formation, the top one stayed still most the time. The left one moved the most. The right and left did all the different moves. After each one would get done w/ thier moves they would go right back into formation in the triangle. Once they were inthe triangle before they would move I could see they would rotate and lights would blink fast red , yellow, blue then it would move but once they were in motion they didn&#39;t do this. THEIR MOVEMENTS--- st. up/ st. down / change directions w/out stopping / circles / figure 8 / sideways R or L / stop abruptly then sit still. There was no noise. The speed was unreal we don&#39;t have anything today that can come close to the speed these had 17 yrs. ago or the movability. The area they covered was huge.The R one went out of site toward the west 1st then the L did the same while the top stayed, the top one never did any of the manuveres. The L returned to the triangle formation for a short time then left to the west again. Approx. 45 min. after this the top went to the west also 11:38 pm ( 2338 ) My son who was 20 yrs. at the time stated he and 3 other boys saw the same thing in the west on 3/29/86. Iv&#39;e never observed anything like this since. ABOUT MYSELF: I am an RN work ER so I am use to things happening abruptly and keeping notes. I didn&#39;t know who to tell w/out sounding nuts.These were not weather balloons, or swamp gas. I wrote it all down since I couldn&#39;t take an instamatic picture at that distance.I still look for them. We have nothing that can come close to these in any way yet today. If they were here to harm us it wouldn&#39;t take them long. While I watched the 3 objects there were pl! anes in the air.I live in a direct line from Columbus to Cleveland air port.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/1/86 22:15|Brownsville|TX|Disk|10 to 20 minutes|UFO tries to communicate|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22157.html|12|ndxe198604| UFO tries to communicate<n> <n><n> <n><n> On an evening of April of 1986, as we had just dropped off one of our fellow student who lived outside the city limits we decided to take a back road as it would be faster to get to our destination.  I had noticed a bright star that seemed to very slowly be moving downward and toward us.  I told the others to look at the start that was moving toward us.  We had just stopped at an intersection. All was dark with the exception of the bright white light that was moving toward us. We were all frozen and the man driving the station wagon was also mesmerized at what we were seeing.  He comented &#34;It is probably a helicopter.&#34; I told him &#34; But there is no sound.&#34; As it got closer we could make a shape. It was a saucer like shape.  Finally, it was almost directly over us. Actually toward my side of the station wagon.  It was about as high as a two story house so we could see many details of this thing that was above us.  On the lower part of the UFO there was a bright light and it was surrounded by what seemed about a ten foot section area which all of a sudden started emiting different lights.  It almost seemed as if there was a pattern to the lights as they went in one direction then in another.  The lights emited were changing fast from white to yellow to blue to red and many other colors.  Then they stopped.  It almost seemed as if they were trying to communicate to us.  Above the area where the lights were being emited there were what seemed to be glass windows and I could make out things moving in there.  The shape of those things were exactly like a human being except the arms seemed to be very thin and long.  The man who was driving the station wagon got very anxious and said &#34;Let&#39;s get out of here.&#34;  His mother agreed.  This UFO followed us for what seemed to be about five to ten minutes and as we were getting closer to the city lights it suddenly took off in the oposite direction.  It disappeared in what seemed to be an eyeblink.  I looked behind and noticed three military helicopters headed toward th! e genera l area where the UFO went.  We were silent all the way home.  We dropped off another of the students and then my boyfriend and I were dropped off at my mother&#39;s house.  We ran in and told her all about it.  To this date I have never mentioned this to anyone else.  I ran into the mother of the driver on a city bus and she looked at me and asked if I remembered what we saw and I told her I did.  She said &#34;It was incredible.&#34; and I agreed.  It would be nice if someone would try to contact all of us and see what we draw and say.  Again, there were four others and myself in the vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in April 1986 is approximate.  PD))<n>

Standing in an open area surrounded by aspens when object appeared just sightly above tree top level I&#39;d say approx 50 ft.  At the time I said to myself &#34;holy ((deleted))&#34; I&#39;m seeing a ufo.  Then I realized the craft had regular aircraft lighting.  What was weird was the craft was absolutely silent and traveling at about the speed of a car on a residential street 35mph.  I was an air traffic controller for six years both radar and tower, and for some reason I just wrote it off as some new military technology.  It was traveling east to west and I watched it go slowly out of sight.  In this area there is a radar range where aircraft rotinely practice terrain avoidance flights. I had seen quite a few other aircraft practicing this procedure in this area as the B52&#39;s used to do when I was stationed in ME.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

I was on a kibbutz in Israel called kibbutz Einat, about an hour from Tel Aviv.  It was evening around 9pm, and I was walking by myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a flying object moving slowly above me.  It was a triangular craft with a triangle of pulsating red lights in the center of the bottom.  I don&#39;t recall if there were any other lights on it. The triangle of red lights was at an opposite angle/position to that of the craft.  I don&#39;t recall any sound either, I believe it was fairly silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A moment after I walked into view of the craft it stopped moving and hovered above me. I couldn&#39;t tell how far away it was at that time. I stood and looked at it for a couple minutes or so; I waved at it; it hovered for a bit and then suddenly darted in the opposite direction from me, made a sharp left and went behind a tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at that point that I realized that it was smaller and closer than I first thought - about 10-20 feet across. I stood and waited for a couple more minutes, not sure if it was still behind the tree (about 100 feet from me) or if it had continued on behind it.  Eventually it came back out, stopped above me for another moment, and then very quickly zoomed out to my right towards a sunflower field.  I watched as it went, and about 2-300 feet away from me, it suddenly plunked straight down into the sunflower field. The height of the sunflowers (about 6 feet) was higher than the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to tell other people about it, but they all thought I was making it up.  The most amazing thing about it was the way it moved - quickly jolting from one spot to another in the sky, and hovering in one spot. The other very memorable thing was the pulsating red lights.  They pulsated as though a wave was going across them from one side to the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was an army base near the kibbutz, and I wondered if it was actually some sort of creation by the Israeli army. In the last year or so I saw a TV show that described similar types of crafts seen by others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just wanted to share the story with anyone who&#39;s interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks!<n>

I heard it make no sound but, then, it was outside the window, and it appears to use the air as a stepping stone and it glided toward the window as I happened to look that direction.  It stopped, pivoted once, paused, pivoted again, and left quickly in the direction from which it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way I can describe seeing it is like seeing Predator, wherein one can look directly at it and not see it unless it moves.  And if you are looking a few feet to the side of it, one would not see it probably.  It was too small to have occupants since it was about 10 to 12 inches in diameter and a portion of that diameter seemed to be made of spikes, but you can see thru it.  It moved &#34;with purpose&#34;, though, and could not have been some eye phenomenon because I saw it pivot twice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only saw it once, and have never heard of anyone quite describe what I saw, or at least I do not know of anyone whose description matches mine.  I did see a fairly similar depiction of my craft, but is was all black in the book, and there was no additional informaton.  I think a good description of the basic shape is that of certain pollen when viewed with an electron microscope, but that would be shape only.  The color is like a crystal that reflects the colors of the overcast sky at daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not emit lights or beams, left no trail, and did not land or make any sound.  There were no lights on the object, no aura or haze around it.  It did not change colors any more than a series of crystals would.  There was no aircraft in its vicinity, and it had no noticeable affect on any equipment in my livingroom where I was when I saw it.  I do not have pictures of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sense is that it was a probe of some sort, gathering information of some sort, and it may have taken a picture perhaps on the first pivot.  Who knows?  It is just a guess...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
