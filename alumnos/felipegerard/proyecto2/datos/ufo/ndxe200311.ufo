I was following my boyfriend because we were on our way back home to the Bay Area from the Thanksgiving weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I were in two seperate cars traveling on 168 hwy about 60/70 mph. About mile and a half before that &#34;Sierra National Forest&#34; sign came up I had seen this beautiful navy blue light and a saucer shaped &#34;object&#34; that came above from the mountains, flying couple feet from front my car and couple feet behind my boyfriend car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw this beatiful navy blue light, I thought it was a shooting star.  But then, instead of going straight as it suppose to go, it came so close to my car that I thought we were going to collide with eachother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we stopped at a gas station to get gas in Madera, CA., I had asked my boyfriend if he seen this blue light too? and he said, &#34;Yes.&#34;  I told him that it was a UFO, but he insisted that it was a helicopter patroling Auberry and Shaver Lake, CA area flashing it&#39;s lights so they could see all the cars going up and down the hills of 168  hwy.  But, I didn&#39;t buy what my boyfriend had to say because where we were driving was totally dark, no lights on 168 and I didn&#39;t hear anything.  I only saw this extraodinary object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My only question is, &#34;What was that object that I saw along with those navy blue light?  It only lasted for about 3 to 5 seconds.  The object was so fast, it disappeared down the cliff.  I also want to know if anyone else seen this?<n>

Then, I noticed a bright yellow light to the left of the moon. I blew it off because it looked like a plane coming head-on, but it stayed there for what seemed like forever and there were no landing lights. I had come to a complete stop, in awe, because as I was driving, I kept glancing back at the light and it didn&#39;t look like it was a plane turning anytime soon, and it never flew overhead. I was driving slow..keeping an eye on the light, and all at once it seemed to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to just hover - it blinked (sometimes white, sometimes with green and red) and just moved around in a very small area. I went back to the window many times during an hour and a half - then I just went to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star.  PD))<n>

11/30/03 19:50|Pico Rivera|CA|Changing|20 minutes|Bright Red UFO Continues To Haunt Montebello|12/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33618.html|6|ndxe200311| Bright Red UFO Continues To Haunt Montebello<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my seventh sighting of the ufo that seems to have an interest in the Montebello area. What&#39;s going on? My first sighting of this ufo occurred on August 24, 2003, and it has appear just about on every Saturday since. The longest and my second sighting occurred on August 31, 2003 around 23:30pm. It was a very bright red spherical ufo, that blinked, blurred, brightened, dimmed and somewhat changed color to white, and that traveled in a north easterly direction for about one hour. And you know what the strangest thing about that night. There was hardly any commercial or general aviation activity at all during the event. Not even chemtrail activity. After the event of that night, I counted four police helicopters flying around as if they were looking for something. The chapter of MUFON L.A. has a clip of news footage from KTLA of the event on their website. Check it out. In fact, they all(local news stations) have footage of the event. And of the professional-kind footage that is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My third sighting occurred during the wild fires of Southern California: October 18 2003 around 23:30pm, SATURDAY. During this sighting, the ufo appeared first as the usual bright red spherical object traveling in a north east direction when suddenly it took the shape of a chandelier. It was unbelievable. Within this wheel-like transformation, there was about a dozen small bright white star-like objects dancing or moving oddly within the glowing chandelier. I and other witnesses were in awe. There is more to this event to much to get into. I reported this back on,...I can&#39;t remember, but you must have my report, right? Duration of this event: 40 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is now December 4, 2003 and my last sighting of this habitual ufo(if I can call it that) occurred on November 29, 2003 around 19:50pm universal time. Now, during this event, the ufo appeared early in the evening, but this time it was a bright white and yellowish color spherical ufo that suddenly turned into what looked like a Christmas tree. Complete with red, green, white, blue, and gold sparkling lights. Also it appeared to be getting bigger, or growing when suddenly it just blinked out of existence. Gone in a flash.(Duration of event: 5 minutes) One weird thing I&#39;ve notice during my encounters with this ufo is that when it is about to blink out, there are unusual meteor streaks or what looks like laser fire up in the stratosphere. I&#39;ve notice that in all my sightings. Also, I notice on some of my sightings, the almost non-present of man-made aerial vehicles, such as airliners, or general aviation crafts, like a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My educated guess as to how high the ufo is during my sightings,...about 3,000 to 5,000 feet in the air. It is not a plane, or a high altitude jet of chemtrailer. It is definitely not Mars, or Venus, or a supernova, or any other planetary or celestial objects. It is not an astronomical anomaly period. It is not a man-made object either. The people in those areas or cities where the object appears above them have formed ufo watch groups. In fact, many people are scared now, and I&#39;ve heard strange things happening within those cities. Some are calling the sightings: apparitions of the virgin mary. Please! Some bold individuals are now driving around armed with cameras, video recorders, and even armed with shotguns and handguns. The local police department doesn&#39;t want to inquire into it. They don&#39;t even want to talk about it. They&#39;re only statement to me was, &#34;Get going, or you are going to be arrested.&#34; Arrested? I said. &#34;Are you people out of your minds?&#34; Anyway, things are getting weirder, and scary. What&#39;s going on? There is more to this, but I rather not write anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Tonight there was a triangle shaped object with lights and no sound hovering over the trees on the far side of the house. It then started moving and came above the house and off to the east. Two of us watched this object glide directly over the house and off. The whole thing lasted about two to three minutes and then it was gone. There was absolutely no noise. I don&#39;t know what it was, but I know it wasn&#39;t an airplane, weather balloon, or anything like that. Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/30/03 18:30|Stockbridge and Whitmore Lake|MI|Triangle|2 hours|Craft seen hovering over field and then same craft seen over my house 25 miles away along with crafts hovering in distance|12/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33505.html|9|ndxe200311| Craft seen hovering over field and then same craft seen over my house 25 miles away along with crafts hovering in distance<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after sunset my mother&#39;s friend was taking my friend back to her house in Stockbridge, along with me in the passenger seat. About 15 miles into the trip we all see this bright light in the sky fade away, then get brighter and then disappear, with no clouds around it. Well after we drop my friend off we were on our way back when we see this strange object with pulsatinc lightsover a cow pasture and corn fields. Each light would pulse three times once at a time.. and it hovered over the car as we were driving.. going almost the same speed were. As it went over us i saw it had a humped shape on top and it was like a triangle. But it also had a light on top and lights all around it. The way it moved is the strangest however.. instead of moving in a straight line, it teeter-tottered it&#39;s way slowly across the sky, rockin back and forth like a plane woul with it&#39;s wings when it &#34;waves&#34;. It looked like a worm wriggling it&#39;s way across the sky. Throughout the 25 mile ride back we saw lights in the sjy get brighter and fade over and over again... when finally as one got so bright and then it jetted across the sky faster than any plane, and within 5 seconds it had reached so far past the horizon you couldn&#39;t see it. When we arrived back to Whitmore Lake just over the lake was this saucer shaped object with red lights all around itjust hovering abover the lake. Well that was freaky enough right.. well when we pulled into the driveway.. the same craft we saw over the field was right over my house... waiting for us.. just above the trees. Shaped like a triangle with a large blue light coming from the center and pulsating white light all around it.. it wiggled it&#39;s way once again slowly very very slowly across he sky. I immediately hopped out of the car to grab the video camera but it had already disappeared when i got back outside. So determined as i was i sat for only 10 minutes outside before i saw lights begin to appear just above th horizon. I started rolling film. My mother, 2 of her frien! ds, 2 strangers and I all saw what were anywhere from 2-6 crafts at a time appear and reappear in the distance slowly moving hardly at all really.. and hover in one spot over a period of an hour. I got about a half hour of footage where you can see the lights moving from side to side and fade away and appear out of nowhere. I don&#39;t have the equipment to send the video footage over the web however. And just as I type this at 11:30 i see more lights in the same spot so maybe there will be more to this story...<n>

It was a clear night and about 20 stars were visible above, but in the distance towards the south my girlfriend and me seen a light.  She thought it was a star the whole time until it disappeared.  The object was about 20 - 30 miles away.  All I could see was a white light stationary in the air changing from bright red to white to green.  It would get bright then dim then bright.  The bridge was up for a while and I kept watching this object.  I looked to see if anyone else was watching the object and they were not.  I turned around and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Sunday at 4:45 p.m. I was watching a bright white light hovering low in the south west horizon. It was in the wrong place for Venus. A few minutes of observation and I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane or a helicopter. At about 4:50 it was slowly moving toward the west. It remained a bright white light. A few minutes later and I watched it descend into the trees on the hill directly south of Vernon airport. Through the binos I watched it disappear from sight, and the bottom of the light &#34;seemed&#34; to turn orange red as if it was shutting down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then just over the lake my eye caught strobing lights moving too fast for a small plane about to land.I saw an  &#34;orb ascend quickly&#34;  towards (sort of) the north from the lake and in the binoculars it seemed to go right by a plane heading southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane was low (approx. 15,000 ft) with its wing lights on.The orb had pink strobing lights but was barely visible to the naked eye.The orb reminded me of the globes that appear when Ghosts are filmed. Nebulous but there.The sky was still in its final colors of sunset, though the sun was long gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wow. was I excited. take care  Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>

Just about 20 mins ago at approx 4.30 P.M. I saw what I thought was a streak across the lower part of the sky probably close to Richmond.  I thought at first it was airplane, you know when they streak across the sky with the sun somewhere in the background lower on the horizon.  It had a fairly long trail, that&#39;s what caught my attention. It was orange and white across the full length of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved across the sky from left to right and was very bright against the soon to be setting sun. But there was still enough light out to make out all details, as the sun was full in the sky.  When I headed out onto my balcony to get a closer look rather than through my bedroom window, the thing reversed and started going from right to left.  Still not too concerned about what I saw although a little bizarre, I continued to watch it move to the left.  Suddenly the streak of what I thought was vapors, it  just suddenly disappeared within about 1.5 seconds, and it all came together as one.  That was unusually.  The vapors don&#39;t just dissipate within 1.5 seconds.  Then I saw an object in the sky again and it was rather small.  Then I thought for a moment there were two, close together.  At this moment I grabbed my cell phone and made a call to a friend to tell him what I was seeing. The reversal was wired (from going left to right then right to left and the disappearing vapors, that was weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>

I went out onto my upstairs balcony to see how many were there to be fed. They sit on a tall lamp post directly in front of my home. As I looked up, I saw a large white orb/circle traveling from south/east to north/west at a fast rate of speed. It went right behind/past the direction of the lamp post. It looked completely white, not glowing. Holding my extended hand out in line with its travels, it was 1 1/2 the diameter of the end of my thumb. I couldn&#39;t judge how high it was in the blue sky but the sky to the east was blue, while to the west, high clouds had already moved in. I ran indoors to look out my window to the north/west to watch it. As it traveled north/west the clouds soon hid it.I have no idea how high the clouds were, so cannot judge how high the object was, although it moved above the clouds. The sighting was no more than two minutes total due to its rapid rate of speed and being hidden above the clouds soon after.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object seemed to move in all directions(swoop from side to side and upside down) at times it looked as if it were floating then it would very quickly and smoothly fly further south and then come back. At one point the object seemed to be on it&#39;s side with the top facing us while in that position a very bright white light came from the object. After a couple minutes the object slowly moved further up and further south, my husband ran in to get the camcorder and shot approx 15-20 seconds of footage before the object was blocked by trees and no longer in view. We have shown the footage to several people all were shocked and believe what they saw was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It is not mentioned but needs to be - from what I heard and understand, this film was sent into an agency (unknown) for authentication &amp; analysis.  I beleave the couple got the tape (or a copy of) back in February or March of 2003.  The determination was that the film &amp; the object in the film were not staged and is not a hoax but in fact is (1) one of best footage&#39;s taken of an actual UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was also mentioned that this footage is being considerd to be possibly the best footage ever filmed of an authentic Unidentified Aircraft hoovering.  How am I able to back this report??? Because the film was on all 4 Local News Channels for the evening news.  I understand that it actually  made National &amp; had made International News. It was not shown on TV until the tape got returned, I will try to find a copy of the News Clip Arhive - otherwise websites for 2 of the sites are WOWT.com &amp; Omahachannel.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> CORRECT LINK  Here is the link to the Ashland Nebraska UFO  http://www.ufocasebook.com/ashlandnebraska.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the footage on several occasions, and although the object is interesting, I do not believe that we can conclude yet that it is a genuine UFO.

This continued evey few seconds and when the light disapeared nothing could be seen even though it was a bright sunny day. We were all amazed and confused to what it could be. the light was intense. After about one minute and in the same direction other bright flashing lights appeared as if they were communicating with each other. We all agreed there were at least four lights maybe five. We continued to travel along the motorway and opened the car windows for a better look. We noted other motorist looking at the same thing. The lights continued for about four or five minutes. Before the lights disapeared I noted one of them move to the 2 o&#39;clock direction stretching as it did before disapearing. We are all professional type people and of reasonable intelligence, but we are all bemused by what we have seen. We are absolutely sure these lights were not aircraft but have no alternative explanation to what we saw. I felt sure that other people must have seen what we did and expected to hear something on the media, but to date I&#39;ve heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was a meteor, but when it came to a sudden stop and didnt disappear, I got chills. It was a ball of light that slightly changed color 1 time from a mild red to yellow. It sped up, slowed down, and changed direction several times. It was a bit larger than a star and it was circular in shape. I opened my deck door to try and get my mom and dad to come out and see it but they didn&#39;t get out fast enough. The object stopped and disappeared within 10 degrees of Saturn which is currently in Gemini.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A light (circle) with one pulsating light in the middle (yellow) hovered in the sky for aprox eight seconds before dropping at a high rate of speed. Nor her or I have seen a plane that looks quite like that. Nor have we seen anything drop straight towards the ground at that speed. It dropped for about two seconds before it was out of sight. In those two seconds it covered the entire sky. We both know what planes look like and how they run, as we live near Boston (logan airport) This was not a plane. It happened somewhat near the Hockomock Swamp (the bridgewater triangle)  Shortly after, a millitary style plane came acorss the area at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I first thought it was a small piper plane from the nearby Limerick airport. When the object slowly drifted over us from the nothwest, I then saw that it was one solid triangle with three lights (each light on a point) and a red flashing light in the middle of the craft. I got my family&#39;s attention and pointed at it. The craft slowly drifted over to the barren field to the left of the road and slowed down, almost stopped. The craft&#39;s blinking red light then changed to the color of green. My dad then slowed down the car and pulled the car over slightly for a better view of the craft. The triangle then started moving again but now in a west direction towards the Limerick Nuclear power plant. I moved to front of the car and we all saw the bottom of the triangle again but the glare from the lights of the town ahead and I noticed it was dark silver (the silver metal was not made of panels). The craft then moved to the right of the road and then couple seconds later it suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife and I noticed what appeared to be a cluster of blinking lights or airplanes. We seemed to be getting closer and then noticed that is was only one object not few as we originally thought. It appeared to be bouncing in the sky going up and down unusually fast. Then it flew across the horizon at incredible speed, and it looked like a smaller object was following. Then it flew in front of us and remainded there for another minute or so. When I was directly in front of us we noticed that the lights appeared to be spinning and and not blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It came towards our vehicle as if it were going to hit us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I saw a bright figure from about 4 miles away and we decided to take that route on the interstate to see what it was.  When we began crossing the Grand Marsh bridge over the Missouri River, we saw this large object somewhat hovering over the river.  My cellular phone failed to function at this time. There were bright white lights completely around it and there was one green light.  The one green light made the object look almost triangular in shape, but It could have been spherical.  The top of it was slightly rounded and the bottom was flat.  As we went further across the river, the object started to come towards our vehicle.  It continued to come towards our vehicle and then the next thing we knew, it was going the opposite direction.  The only time it moved quite fast was when we began to follow it, other than that, it moved quite slow and steady.  We followed the object for about 2 minutes afterwards and lost it over a hill in Bismarck, North Dakota.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have enjoyed your articles on Rense, and thought perhaps you would be interested in my story, or could point me to someone who would care to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live about 10 miles east of Cloudcroft, New Mexico, in a rural subdivision bordered by the Lincoln National Forest. On Nov. 28, 2003 at about 1pm I was walking my Akita Nikki in the National Forest and came upon a dead elk laying in a shallow ravine. The elk was no more than 200 yards from our subdivision, and perhaps half a mile from my house. There is a substantial elk population in the area, and sightings are not unusual. The dead elk was a small one, the length of which from chest to rear end perhaps 4 feet, and weighing maybe 400-600 pounds. Rigor mortis was full and complete. There was no apparent bloating. Nor was there any evidence the elk had been gutted by a hunter, as there was no apparent longitudinal incision on the lower abdomen/chest area. The head had been removed, as if cut from the body right where the neck joins the body, and the vertebrae stuck out from the cut area about 6 inches or so, ending in a smoothly sliced vertebrae. So far one would suspect a trophy hunter possibly who just killed for the head to mount on their wall, eh? However, I believe this elk to be much too small to have had any significant antlers (maybe no antlers at all).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now for the really interesting part. As you can see by the photo I am sending you, the rectum of this elk has been smoothly cored out. Further, the genitals have been removed, and there is no obvious way to tell the sex of this animal. The removal of the genitals could be attributable to animals perhaps (we have mountain lions and bears, as well as coyotes) as the removal does not appear  to have been in such a clean, surgical fashion upon my limited observation. I will allow you to draw your own conclusions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You may reach me via email, or at (deleted by HBCC UFO) for any further info I failed to give you. I will be happy to assist further in any way, plus provide additional photos. Also, if it will lend credence to this situation, I am a former Federal investigator, as my wife was also. The elk is carcass is still on site for investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for sharing the report.

I looked up and through the limbs of a tree I saw an orange colored light, it seemed to move slighly back and forth, not a lot but enough to tell it was moveing. While it moved the light slowly would fade darker than back to very  bright. As I was walking back to the door of the house, I looked to the right and noticed the light moving with me in parallel to my path but never seeming to get any closer. Nothing really amazing happens but I just can&#39;t seem to explain it. The thing is it&#39;s happened that same way two other times, I go outside to get some fresh air, look up and see the light, it moves a bit and then moves with me as I go in the house. I don&#39;t recall and sound or any other evidence that it was there .... just the light<n>

He was outside his home and reports seeing three very bright lights sitting over the Rocky Mountain Range. He reports watching them for approximately three minutes before they all blinked out at the same time. The witness reports that the lights were white/yellow in color. The lights did move around from side to side, up and down which the witness found very strange. He also reports that the lights moved individually, not together as one unit. Due to the distance the fellow was to the lights, which as a long ways away, he said they were fairly close together when looking from his location. But thought if one would have been up close then the lights would have been spread out a good distance from one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>

It appeared to be much like a falling star, although it was far lower in the horizon and it lit an area about four times as large as a star would. It was white at first, then as it sailed Southward, it turned into a lime green color, then it desended further into the Southeast and turned red before disappearing suddenly. It traveled too fast and the descent was too fast for an airplane or helicopter - and- it was too low, too big and too bright to be a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife and I often look at the night sky while in our hottub. We are familiar the  constellations, satellites and airplane routes. This oval reddish object was travelling SSW at least 2 to 3 times faster then any  transatlantic jet we often see overhead. The object then veered 45 deg. to the right then sharply turned left 90 deg. I was going to dismiss this as just a bird  flying but the object had a reddish glow and seemed luminescent as well as it was almost 10:30 pm.

Two of us went out the front door to see if maybe a car accident, but instead found only stillness.  There was however a loud sound, unlike a plane or jet.  More like the rumbling of the space shuttle on launch from a distance.  Very much the sound of a huge rocket.  Looking up, and due south, we saw what appeared to be to craft moving in tandam, turning slightly to the east/southeast.  Looking closer we could see the outline of a single craft connecting the two lights.  These lights were non blinking and visibly connected, white lights.  Now moving in a straight line away from us.  Within about 15 seconds of being able to see the outline of a single huge craft, the lights simply faded away into the distance.  They did not appear to be extinguished.  More like they were moving away a great speed.  The temp was 54 degrees, clear skies, with no street lights, on the out skirts of southeastern Hemet, less then 1/2 mile from the new Diamond Valley Water Project.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked out large picture widow that faces west across the Ridgefield Wildlife Refuge. The Columbia River flows North and South at this point.  On most night, aircraft are flying overhead and turning west and then south to approach PDX.  On this occasion, I noticed a bright, flickering light traveling along the Columbia River, about 2 thousand feet above horizon.  I couldn&#39;t see the craft. But the light was incredible: it was very bright and flickered, like a disco light flashing. It also resembled a tool I used many tears ago to set the timing on a car tune-up, where the light flickered.  And it was also noteworthy that the light was so bright and looked like the new halogen (?) lights on new cars.  Very BRIGHT, it was unusual.  Another thing, the object was fast but jerked up and down slightly.  Much faster moving that a commercial jet.  Also, the light was eminating from the rear of the object, as if it were on the back end of the craft.  There was no sound like jet engines, not the thumping of heliocopter rotor blades.  Silence!<n>

I am an airline pilot.  We were on top of a cloud layer at appox. 30,000 feet, and had unlimited visibility above in all directions.  At just about the half way point of the flight (approx. 18:45 local time) I noticed a bright object above the horizon.  Thinking it was just a planet, I didn&#39;t give it a second glance.  About 10 minutes after I had first noticed the object, I saw my captain adjusting our TCAS (traffic collision avoidance system) to the farthest setting of 80 miles.  I then looked out at the object and it was now below the horizon.  I asked the captain if he was trying to see if the object was an aircraft using our TCAS.  He said yes.  The object which appeared to be approximately 20-40 miles in front of us was now changing colors from it&#39;s original white, to red and green.  At first we thought it was just another aircraft with it&#39;s anti-collision lights on until the color changes.  I was handling the radios and decided to ask air traffic control if we had any aircraft in front of us at a range of 20-40 miles.  His reply was that we didn&#39;t have any traffic within 80 miles of our position.  He asked me to describe the object, which I did, and then he proceeded to contact another aircraft that was at our 9 o&#39;clock position and 80 miles from us, to see if they saw the object that I described.  They (the other aircraft) responded that they saw the same thing.  We never gained any ground on the object and as we started our decent to Memphis, the object in front of us did the same.  The object went into the cloud layer and we never saw it again.  The air traffic controller told us to keep him informed and that the object was most likely a weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They come around between the hours of 9pm and 2am.  When we flash small laser lights at them, they come closer.  They stay in the same spot for hours at a time and alternate directions every 15 minutes or so.  They are tilted sideways and appear to be sousers.  There is a local private airline a mile from us and they have said nobody flies that time of night (it is too risky).  They do not leave untill the morning dew starts to fall about 4 hours before sunrise.  Onece they had flashed a pure yellowish-white light down for a few seconds then left.  Both my grandfather and I had blacked out for a few seconds yet were still standing when we snaped out of it.  There is a big spot in our back yard where we had to replant the grass in result of this light.  We have taken pictures, but everytime we try to get them developed, the place we take them to refusses to give them back to us and will not say why.  Over all, we have unknown visators every month since 1996.  On a more personal note:  I would like to know why they keeping around our house, but I don&#39;t know how to get them down here to ask them that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether celestial bodies, perhaps twinkling stars, might have been the cause of the sighting(s).

Garden State Parkway, going south, it was about 8:15 P.M., at about mile marker 15,that all of asudden there was a bright bluish-green light, that filled the entire front windshield of the van.  We were all struck in awe, and after about 4 seconds one of us said, what the hell was that.  There was no sound, like an explosion, that we could hear, and if there were, I am sure, that we would have seen maybe some reddish color before the bluish-green.  There were seven of us in the van, but only five of us saw this event.  The other two, were asleep.  We continued talking about it all of the way home.  We figured that maybe the light originated in maybe Delaware, cause as I said the &#34;&#34;LIGHT&#39;&#39;, filled the windshield and it was away from us, I would say about 25 miles away, cause we were on a like straightawy on the parkway, and we could seen the outlines of the trees against this light.  The trees are in the middle of the parkway and on both sides.  The light did appear far off, but none the less it was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, the driver of the van, called a friend of his, who has something to do with reporting either weather or news for a local newspaper, to see if he had heard of any type of story regarding what we saw.  He said &#34;NO&#34;, but suggested that we contact the United States Weather Bureau, for a event report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event of the sighting was:  Wednesday, November 26, 2003 at approximately 8:15 P.M., at about mile marker 15 South on the Garden State Parkway, in New Jersey.  The night sky was clear, and I would say, that visibility would be unlimited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 53 years old and have never in my life ever seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, Thanksgiving Day, I checked the local newspaper, and there was nothing in the newspaper, but we figured being that it was late, in the day, that the newspaper would not report it yet.  I checked again the local newspaper of which is the Press of Atlantic City, New Jersey, and checked the entire newspaper twice and there was nothing about the &#34;LIGHT&#39;&#39;.  The second time I checked the Newspaper was Friday, November 28th, 2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It JUST BOTHERS ME, CAUSE OF THE COLOR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time and concern in this report of an LIGHT EVENT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SINCERELY, ((name deleted))<n>

The night was clear and cold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed three greyish lights moving across the sky, approximately SSE.  At first, the lights reminded me of geese flying in formation, but after watching for a few seconds, they ultimately appeared to be part of one triangular object. There were lights at each point of the triangle, although the lighted areas themselves seemed rounded, not sharp-edged or pointed.  The lighted areas were dim and hazy, and they were fairly large in size compared to what appeared to be the relative size of the object.  It is possible that the lighted areas consisted of groups of smaller lights, but the lights were too dim to tell.  The lights were moving in a very smooth, consistent manner, and were moving in a straight line.  Ultimately, not very far away, the object faded away, as it had moved quite a distance fairly quickly.  However, a normal aircraft would still be easily visible at the point where this one effectively faded into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see an outline of a triangular craft, as there was no moonlight in the sky, so it is also possible that there were three objects flying in formation.  However, I believe that most likely they were all part of one object.  The object was completely silent, and it was not directly overhead, although it was close to being so.  It was flying at a fairly low altitude, well below where planes fly in the area.  Any planes/helicopters flying even remotely close to where this object was are quite noisy and clearly heard.  Again, this object was completely silent, and it was moving much faster than an aircraft (at any altitude).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived near airport flight paths in Los Angeles for many years, but I have never seen anything remotely similar to this object. My wife also saw the object, and she recalls seeing an outline of a triangular craft.  I have reviewed other reports from the NUFORC website, and the May 2003 report from Seattle, WA is very similar to my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  See other reports from AZ for this same date.

It was 1/3 the size of Mars and was below it.  The color was bluish white, and could have been a star at this point.  However, the light began to descend at a controlled rate, too fast for aircraft and too slow for a meteor.  There was no vapor trail or comet tail.  I could not discern if the object was in Earth atmosphere or not.  It became obscured by some trees after it had descended for several seconds.  It never changed size or color while I observed it for 30 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was as low as a small plane, but no sounds were heard and there were no other lights seen. The light was bigger in size than a star or planet. We watched for about 3-5 minutes.

I saw in the sky a light that I thought to have been the sun. But to the south of this light was where the sun was positioned, noticibly brighter and more visibly defined in it&#39;s shape than it&#39;s neighboring visitor. The light was white with a lightly yellow colored brightness. The light was shaped like an acute triangle at the left with the bottom nearly paralell to the horizon. The right side was undefined and lead almost what seemed to be a curved line back to the base of the light. The light did not move and was wider but smaller than the large sun. The skies were spattered with thin clouds that were so much like lace that an airplane could easily be seen through a great majority of them. I childishly raised the question &#34;why are there two suns&#34; to my mother as I pointed to the western skies. She became as baffled as I at the sight of this luminous spectical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When an M.P. finished filling out a visitors pass and had barely had time to hand the pass over to me I pointed and asked him if he knew what the second light in the sky was, he looked but seemed puzzled and only responded with a &#34;what.&#34; My mother then leaned over to try and convey in better detail the question at hand by saying &#34;there are two suns.&#34; She also pointed and added a motion of the head that meant for the soldier to look again. He did, and apparently noticed the light in the sky because his head remained to help his eyes focus. &#34;Do you know what it is?&#34; The soldier answered that he did not and I teased him saying &#34;come on you&#39;re the government.&#34; Hearing my sarcasm, he replied &#34;that&#39;s just it, I&#39;m in the Army&#34; I and my mother continued and kept a watch on this light that began to fade then dissapear. We reached the chapel soon after and continued to talk about what was just witnessed, and as we talked in the car I saw that the light had resumed it&#39;s place in the sky only to dissapear once more only moments afterward. I used my cell phone to call a local television station WGNX Atlanta via 411. After allowing the automated system attempt to search my request a live networker assisted me by routing my call for me, but there was no answer. A church friend of ours pulled up a few seconds later. My mother and I began to tell her of what we witnessed, of course followed by the pointing also recieved by the guard. She studied the sky and saw nothing. After this I hav yet to see the light again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After about 5 or 6 minutes on the busy dark highway of I-465 I noticed flashing lights of different colors breaking through the early morning clouds. I first thought it was an airplane but it wasn&#39;t moving at all. From beginning to end it wasn&#39;t moving. It just dissapeared in a flash from then vanished into the clouds. Another scary thing about this was that it was right above the skyline of Indianapolis. Scary but true.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The skyline on Old Farm Rd, is huge. You can see planes taking off from Logan airport, traffic helicopter&#39;s, everything. Now I was about a mile out from route 93 (where the helicopter&#39;s hover near boston, and about 12 miles outside of Boston itself).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I noticed a blue/green object stopped behind the treeline in the far distance. I thought nothing of it really (though why I don&#39;t know cause the thing was blue/green) cause I just figured it was a plane taking off facing me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came back I looked up and saw two commercial airplanes in the air to the south and strangely enough, a jet leaving a smoke trail directly overhead. Then I noticed the blue green object had started to move in a direction it couldn&#39;t possibly have moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was huge, looked to be a weird top heavy shape with a round, thinner, bottome. It was flashing white and red lights. Immediately I started comparing it. It was moving incredibly fast (passing my line of vision over the horizon every 5- 10 seconds). I started to doubt it was a plane (no plane would ever fly that low) and by now was pretty freaked out because I realized I was the only one seeing this and even contemplated knocking on someone&#39;s door to get a confirmation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was viewable from where I was for about 5 minutes (the view on old farm road is massive), and then it fell out of the viewable horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it could have been a helicopter, but I don&#39;t think helicopter&#39;s are A) completely silent, and B) Glowing blue/green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interesting note the miltary jet that was high above my head seemed to be on an arching rise and when I saw it the smoke trail was descending. I think it might have been following it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My van came and when we moved the light seemed to be moving with us and stop with us I could not tell a distance at all but I am prety sure it was below the cloud level and was not a star when we got on the highway it seemed to be moving away (I saw it through the tree branches) I lost it behind a hill for a few seconds and it dissapeared. after it left ihe vans engine was cutting out going up hills sometines and other times it was just fine and when I got off it was still doing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I compared the explosion to the smoke of a shuttle launch. I heard only 2 other voices on my CB radio(I am a truck driver)who saw this. One was as excited as I was and he also saw the same thing and was amazed that the entire cab of his truck was illuminated too. The other voice had no emotion or excitement in it and all he said was that was a meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could see the reflection of the light on the river. I thought it was just a plane, but I rolled down the window and couldn&#39;t hear anything.  All of a sudden it seemed to just stop and went North, towards Washington. It was really spooky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As they drew closer, the lights seemed to spread out and all of a sudden and all of the blue lights blinked out approx: one mile in front of them. The two men thought was rather strange as they had never witnessed anything like this before. The witnesses could not make out any type of shape, or structure as everything took place rather quickly. Mind you they both mentioned that there may not have been any body to the lights. It wasn&#39;t until the fellows were at junction (highway #3 and #6) did they wonder where approx 25 kilometers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both men sat stunned, the driver pulled the car to the side of the road and the two guys just sat and looked at one another for a couple of seconds, then starred out the front windshield not saying a word to one another. Finally after a few minutes of silence the passenger turned to the driver and asked what the heck just happened and how did we get to the junction when they knew they still had a large number of kilometers to travel.  The passenger then noticed a trickle of blood running down from the drivers right nostril which alarmed him to know end. The driver used his hand to wipe around his nose area and then found blood on his hand, be started to panic due to all this strange things that just took place. Immediately the driver put the vehicle in gear and started traveling north on Highway #6 towards Samo picking up speed as they drove along. The evening was very cool outside, but inside the vehicle it was rather warm. With both men shivering with coldness (from fright and a possible experience) the passenger turned the heaters temperature up to high and both of the fellows were still not able to get warm and comfortable. Very frightened, cold and an over whelming thrust coming on they traveled along almost in shock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After traveling a good distance to their destination which was Fruitvale, B.C., they arrived at a family members home, got out of the vehicle and as they walked up the sidewalk to the door, the diver broke down. His friend told me his nerves were shot at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A family member had seen the vehicle and the fellows pull into the driveway I was going out to greet them both when she saw her loved one bent over crying hysterically. She yelled out loudly and two other people in the home ran out to lend a hand with the man. The family was very upset as you can imagine and questioned the men to find out what was wrong, not imagining what they were about to hear. After some time a hot bath everyone settled in for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both men trying their darnest to get some sleep, which wasn&#39;t easy after what just happened, finally they dropped off only to start having vivid dreams. One of the fellows remembers being in an object. He did not know exactly what it was. But in his dream he did believe it was a room of some type. So I am trying to work with him to see if he can remember any thing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Case ongoing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>

The lights were in a straight line and seemed to remain stationary for about 4 minutes or so.  I heard no noise and the lights continued to remain in place.  The formation gradually moved very slowly due north, again silent.  The lights continued to dim and brighten alternately.  When the formation moved due east of my position, the lights disappeared and did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it may be a very low flying plane, but the light was odd.  It was VERY bright and clear, like the headlamp of an approaching motorcycle, or train, until it seemed to change direction taking on a clear bright light, a red light, and either a blue or green light.  It appeared to form a wedge-like shape, until it changed again to something that seemed more cylindrical. I  was stopped at the intersection while the traffic light was red, and then kept my eyes on it as I crossed the intersection to visit a local business. I lost it as I pulled into the pharmacy.  The initial bright light seemed VERY close, yet I heard no relative sounds.  The light seemed to move rather randomly and quickly. At first notice the light seemed to originate from above the shopping center with Johnny&#39;s Pizza, crossed rather haphazardly above Lavista Rd. and then was gone when I pulled into the CVS parking lot. ...unlike anything I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a college degree and work for a local environmental engineering firm.

I like the idea of aliens and all that, but I tend to be skeptical about the whole thing.  I got out of my car and headed toward my apartment door.  I was looking at the sky, a habit of mine, looking at stars and looking for comets.  At first I noticed nothing at all, then I must&#39;ve blinked or looked away for a moment, but all of a sudden a star seemed to be particularly bright--and large.  If all the stars around it looked like periods on a paper, this one looked like the lower-case letter &#34;o&#34; beside a regular period. (o.)  I didn&#39;t know what in the world it was, but then it began to get very large, as if coming closer to me.  It got to the size that I don&#39;t think I could&#39;ve blotted it out with a nickel if I held it out at arms length.  I don&#39;t know how to describe the appearance other than a ball of light.  I didn&#39;t notice anything that seemed at all metallic or fire-like.  Just a big ball of extremely bright light, I can&#39;t emphasize how bright this was.  It was at this large size for only about two seconds it seemed, and I pushed the door open to call for my wife to come see.  Right as I pushed the door, it began to get a little smaller--and then the speed at which the size decreased became incredibly fast.  At last I found myself looking at a small dot, and eventually it vanished.  There was no sound at all that I could hear coming from it.  It did seem as if, if possible, the ojbect&#39;s &#34;brightness&#34; pulsed once it paused after moving toward my area.  That is, once it flew toward me and paused, there were two very quick pulses of extra brightness and then it flew away.  The thing is, it was so bright before the two short pulses, it&#39;s hard to imagine that it could&#39;ve gotten any brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what this was.  It could&#39;ve been some rare terrestrial phenomena, I don&#39;t know.  The only thing I can say is that it was not a plane, jet, helicopter, or balloon.  It wasn&#39;t something that we see flying around in the sky.  I don&#39;t know what the thing was.  I&#39;d like to know if anyone else around here saw it.  Maybe the light of a burst star reached our planet, whatever it was I&#39;m dying to know.  Speculating is only driving me crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Area of occurance: I live in a small apartment complexe.  As far as I know, I was the only person standing outside.  However, there must&#39;ve been people all around this area who saw it.  Surely I wasn&#39;t the only one standing outside looking at the sky.  There&#39;s a busy road not far from where I live, all one would have to have done to see it from a moving car going east is to look out the right side of the car.  Someone else must&#39;ve seen this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was not sure what I was seeing at first. The object was wobbling slowly. It was moving slowly from South to North, against the prevailing winds, which were blowing West to East. I would estimate the alititude at 1500 to 2000 feet. The sun was low in the sky. The object was reflecting sunlight from western edge, and appeared to be a silver disc shape with a brown or dark colored center. I would estimate the diameter of the object to be about 20 to 30 feet. I could not hear any sound from it. I ran in the house and got my binoculars, which took about 30 seconds. When I returned the object was gone. If it had been some sort of balloon it would have still been in sight. There was a small private airplane approaching the area where I had last seen the object. Duration of the sighting was about 2 to 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((BEGIN FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just filed a report on an object that I saw here in Portland late this afternoon. I had been watching the object for 2 or 3 minutes, and decided that it was probably not a mylar balloon or something like that. It was moving Northward towards me, and appeared to be moving against the wind. I ran to get the binocs, and it had flat vanished, which surprised me. I didn&#39;t get a feel for the size distance or altitude of the object until I had returned with the binoculars. There was a small private plane moving into the vicinity of where I had last seen the object. I don&#39;t know if the pilot had seen it or not. The plane seemed to be a bit lower than the object. Which would have meant the object was much larger than I had susupected. If the object had been something floating on the wind it could not have disappeared in<n> <n><n> the 30 seconds, or so, that it took me to get my binoculars. That is why I was surprised that it was gone from sight when I returned, back outside. I had the distinct feeling, at that point, that this had been<n> <n><n> an intelligently controlled craft, it had seen the small plane flying in it&#39;s direction, and had vacated the vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, when I had finished filing the report I went in and looked at the reports from Oregon and read the ones from 11/6/03. I live about 1 1/2 miles Southwest of the control tower at PDX, and about 20 blocks South of Lombard. Not too far from where those 2 sightings happened. I watch the air traffic all the time, day and night. Today&#39;s sighting was about the 4th one I&#39;ve had at this location, in a little over three years, since we have lived here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s good to hear your reports again on Coast to Coast AM! Keep up the the good work and the good fight!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh, I&#39;ll try and stay off the computer for awhile, in case you want to call me.  Best regards,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END MESSAGE))<n>

I then looked up at the sky and there seemed to be lights behind the clouds, I thought maybe lightening. But the lights were not flashing and I could not see streaks or bolts. The lights seemed to be undulating(for lack of a better word) behind the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then became aware of a light and some movement in the corner of my left eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked I saw an enormous(huge!) round object with 2 sets of lights in a large and small circle (inside the large) on it. It appeared to spin slightly one way and then the other.

Two and then up to four very bright white  lights appeared for approximately 25-45  seconds;  just like a large plane would in approximately the same  usual flight pattern  , but just the bright lights , no sound, no  solid object that I could see. The lights then went into a very large , very white cloud that was low  over the oil tanks. I watched the cloud go towards Portland , slowly, almost meandering, across Portland Harbor over Bath Iron Works[which by the way was working on a huge oil rig at the time] towards the Eastern Promenade  and beyond.I did not see the lights again after they went behind, into ? the large cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a large, intensely white (at least it appeared white compared to the dark surroundings) ball of light fly through the sky, parallel to the road, traveling in the same direction as the car.  The light was travelling incredibly fast and appeared to be rather low to the ground, as it was out of sight within one second (however, my range of vision was limited, as I could only see it once it became visible through the windshield, rather than directly overhead).<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I could react it had vanished into the trees.

In the distance I saw a lighted object hovering at 2000 feet just north of Highway 8. Object was on the right hand side of Highway and I was in the passenger seat. San Diego has many military bases and airports which I drive passed frequently. I have lived in San Diego all my life. This object looked odd to me immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to watch the object until we drove directly underneath it. I looked straight up at the object with my window rolled down. It appeared motionless. The object was black with a triangular shape with rounded edges. One circular light was on each of the three ends which helped identify it as triangular against the black sky. The top of the triangle had a larger circular light than the two ends. Circular lights were white and opaque. Red colored lights between the two smaller circular lights. It appeared that triangle was a 45 degree angle type with sides all the same length. Only saw the bottom of object. Maybe the length of three commercial helicopters, guessing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish we could have stopped to watch object, but my husband didn&#39;t want to bother. He could not see all the details I was seeing since he was on other side of car driving. My three little boys in the back seat started to get scared, so my enthusiasm was kept at a minimum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was so clear and beautiful to see. Very fine lines and circular lights very clean. Did not hear any noise as we drove beneath object. After we passed object, it moved slowly south west direction towards Mission Valley.

The UFO seemed to be suspended in the sky in the vicinity of the Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, across the Rio Grande river from Laredo, Texas. The UFO was the shape of a circle and gave off a bright white glow, though not shiny or glaring. Several witnesses intitially confused it with an airplane on approach to Laredo International airport. However, the UFO´s glow suddenly intensified, with a slight light blue tinge, and it appeared to expand its diameter (this may have been the visual effect of the glow). The object then moved at an incredible rate of speed, at approximately a 45 degree angle upward and in a southwesterly direction into Mexico. And with a second burst of speed the object disappeared into the night sky. At approximately 1927hrs,  two aircraft flying in formation, coming from the northeast (possibly Kingsville Naval Air Station) and at a very high altitude followed the direction of the UFO´s flight path. These jets crossed into Mexican airspace.

I showed this to my roommate so far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not contacted the military or media. Norad would be embarrassed to find this craft close to its own location. This is not a plane, balloon, hellicopter, It is very strange and was there for about 5-6 minutes. The &#34;thing&#34; next to it was very strange. Glowing type thing, smaller than the bright object and reflected (at times) from the other craft, it did change its position from the craft near the end of my filming. I really couldn&#39;t get the craft very well in focus, but in slow motion there are very strange events, designs, colors. Strangest thing I ever have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No mention of this in last nights television. That too surprised me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is forwarding film to our Center.

As it passed overhead appeared to be a 5 sided dark gray object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming to work I noticed what appeared at first to be a Triangular object, flying east, lower than a passenger airplane.  It was flying in a direction that I see many military planes coming into Mather.  At first glance it had a total of 7 lights, boomerang shaped, all lit-up.   As it approached, all the lights went out except the front single light.  Then the single front light went out and the last lights on each side lit-up, then those went out and the second to last lights lit-up, this sequence continued through the lights to the front of the object.  This sequence took place two times.  By this point the object was nearing overhead.  And it looked as though the lights started a new sequence moving from one tail end to the front then back to the other tail end.  As it came directly overhead, I saw no lights, and saw it’s shape, which was not Triangular - but instead a five sided object.  It looked to be a dark colored object.  Gray in color.  After it passed over my car, I could not find it in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I work nights &amp; was outdoors with my dogs for a few minutes before leaving for work &amp; was admiring the stars when I saw something unusual as I&#39;ll describe in the following paragraphs  I looked at the clock as I let the dogs out, it was 11:46 pm EST. When I re-entered the house it was 11:50.  As I mentioned, I was standing on my back deck looking at the night sky, being generally thankful for a clear night for my newspaper route &amp; enjoying a last cup of coffee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near a naval air station, directly under the flight pattern between 2 rivers they tend to follow when getting practice air time as well as typical approaches &amp; landings. The base is a Nato base, so I&#39;m accustomed to seeing all types of aircraft &amp; have worked on several military bases, including this one, while employed by a general construction contractor.  I also am accustomed to seeing civilian aircraft over my home at a high altitude (much higher since Bosnia).<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw last evening was entirely different from typical civilian &amp; military aircraft. It did, however seem to be following the path of the civilian craft that go over my area. It was travelling from a South-South West direction, inland direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brunswick, Maine is very near the coast; I am personally about a 5 minute drive from the ocean, a couple minutes from any of 3 rivers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The description:  I have heard on coasttocoast.com when you spoke descriptions of ferris wheel type sitings. This almost represented that, but I couldn&#39;t be sure if it was round or if it was just the rotation of light sequence that I was seeing. It may have been a different shape or even, of course, a civilian aircraft. The lights appeared to number several or many, some red, some green &amp; some white. The white ones lit up the bottom which gave a little definition as to its shape &amp; confused me some. With the rotation light sequence it appeared to be round, but the white lights made it appear more typical aircraft shaped. What made me feel very deeply that it wasn&#39;t a typical aircraft was the speed it travelled at. My line of vision between where I first saw it, &amp; where I lost sight of it behind pine trees was slight. I&#39;ve jsut measured it outdoors holding my hands up &amp; I would say there was, with arms extended only about 2 feet between them.  It covered a relatively large piece of sky in a very short period, I would guess I only saw it maybe even less than 15 seconds &amp; it was out of view. In this area, the military aircraft are generally very low &amp; in view quite a while &amp; civilian aircraft generally show 1 flashing red light on the bottom that I&#39;ve noticed &amp; are visible for a longer period. This was just all of a sudden &amp; view &amp; then gone. There was nothing unusual about the noise it made for an aircraft at that altitude. Just a general rumbling noise &amp; I had to actually make sure it wasn&#39;t another noise in the neighborhood, but it was definitely aircraft generated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps those that flew overhead, last weekend, I believe (that I unfortunately missed seeing, but heard of on coast to coast)were making a return trip?...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have just scrolled down to the contact info area &amp; have decided I will also call your hot line number. I&#39;ll be on a cell phone (with free nights &amp; weekends) &amp; hope this is satisfactory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found her to be quite credible.

It was cold, dark, and misting a bit, and around 10:30 pm there was a freak lightning strike; the flash was blinding and disconcerting, as if we were in the middle of it, but the thunder came about five seconds later. We thought nothing of it until the following week when my girlfriend&#39;s sister returned from California (Santa Cruz, I think) and told us the same thing had happened there. The night may not have been the same, but it was the same time - around 10:30. She also said she talked to people in other places on the west coast (in California) who witnessed a similar phenomenon, all at around 10:30 pm. Again, I am uncertain whether they all occurred on the same specific date.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We are determined to, 1. Find the screaming woman. 2. Find who alerted the police to the screaming. 3. More witnesses to the screaming and UFO.  Todd Sees came to mind immediately when I first heard this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Donnie  ((END))  ((NOVEMBER 27, 2003, COMMUNICATION BY KENNY YOUNG, ON CURRENT-ENCOUNTERS LIST))  SUBJECT: Unusual situation and &#39;bright lights&#39; LOCATION: Morehead, KY (Rowan County) DATE: Sunday, November 23, 2003 TIME: Around 10:00 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a follow up to a N.U.F.O.R.C. sighting report that was just posted by Peter Davenport  SUMMARY  A report was submitted to The National UFO Reporting Center concerning a strange situation taking place near Morehead, Kentucky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The report stated: &#34;Morehead-Rowan Co. Rescue Sq.had a call from Morehead Police Dept. of a female crying for help three times  From 2 witness then they was a bright light in the sky for about 1 min. RESCUE SQ.arrived on scene and started searching the area 1st &amp; 2nd witness reported seeing this. The fire dept. was ask to begin searching with the thermal imaging camera with no results found. Res.of Morehead was one of the witnesses.Unless there is a confirmed report of a missing person,the search will not be continued.&#34;   INVESTIGATION  This morning I contacted the Morehead Police Dept at (606-784-7511) and talked to two very nice officers that were in the department (located at 105 E Main St Morehead, KY).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked the first dispatcher if he could provide any information about an unusual report I had concerning mysterious lights seen near Morehead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I think that was from the Rockfork area,&#34; he said, &#34;and it was the northern lights, what they call an aurora. We had some calls on it. We had a report of the northern lights in the area.&#34;  The dispatcher also informed that no officers reported the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;There were some calls on it, one female caller reporting something in the sky, but it was the aurora borealis.&#34;  I asked if the calls were related to the report of &#34;screaming sounds&#34; and the dispatcher said he did not think so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked if there was a search conducted and he did not know for sure and began checking the logs. There was some confusion as to the date of event but found from his logbook he informed that a search was undertaken near Adams Lane on Sunday evening, November 23.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;There was some type of search because of a woman screaming, I think,&#34; he said, and also checked with another gentleman who was in the office, the captain of the fire department. I could overhear the gentleman talking (his name may have been Randy) who was knowledgeable about the situation. I then asked if I could speak directly with this person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Captain of the Fire Department came to the phone and said that on Sunday night, November 23, persons near Adams Lane began hearing a woman screaming three times around 10:00 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;We had a report of a woman screaming and then they didn&#39;t hear it no more,&#34; said the Morehead, KY fire official, &#34;they called and the local rescue squad went out there, the fire department and the police went out and a search was conducted. The search used a thermal imaging device and lasted for about an hour and a half when it was called off.&#34;  &#34;We thought it might have been two kids who got scared,&#34; he said. &#34;Maybe one scared another and they were frightened.&#34;  I asked the fire official if he had any knowledge about the bright light in the sky seen for one minute and he said: &#34;I got there at the tail end of things so don&#39;t know anything about it. I didn&#39;t see anything myself.&#34;  I asked if he heard anyone else talking or rumors of a bright light in the sky during the time frame of the search and he said &#34;no.&#34;  COMMENT  The two officers at the Morehead Police Department were kind and helpful. They were able to validate the report of &#39;mysterious screams&#39; that appeared on N.U.F.O.R.C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> but did not have any information to link the 3 mysterious screams directly to a ighting of a &#39;bright light&#39; in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first officer said the bright light, seen a couple of days earlier, was caused by the Northern Lights or Aurora Borealis, yet it seems unusual to think that several residents, as described, would see a pretty sunset and interpreted the situation in such a manner as to contact local police authorities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Further, the initial report to N.U.F.O.R.C. sought to link the sighting of the bright light in the sky directly to the scream/search event and seemed to suggest that a &#34;Res.&#34; of Morehead was one of the witnesses. &#34;Res.&#34; might mean &#39;resident&#39; or &#39;rescue&#39; as in rescue worker. The poorly worded report also does not indicate what this &#39;Res&#39; was a witness to, exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, there may be some issue as to the time listed on the N.U.F.O.R.C. report as the claimant logs the event as occurring on 11/21/2003 when the dispatcher said the search took place Sunday evening, 11/23/2003 (and also noted that the northern lights were seen &#34;a couple of days earlier&#34;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Northern Lights have been prominent lately due to increased solar eruptions and flares from the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks to Peter Davenport, Donnie Blessing  Filed, November 27, 2003 KENNY YOUNG   Dear List: At approx. 11 A.M. today, December 2nd, 2003 I spoke with another witness to the amazing UFO/Screaming woman incident in Morehead, Ky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The claimant, who is ex-military, informed me that she and her daughter witnessed the same UFO as it came down near to her home. Her testimony fits the same statements made by the prior witness, Mr. Virgil Davis.  A full report of the claimant&#39;s story will follow shortly.  The mystery of this case only deepens as this story unfolds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Filed 12/2/03 Donnie Blessing Southern Ohio Section Director MUFON  ((END))  ((NOVEMBER 30, 2003, POSTING TO CURRENT-ENCOUNTERS LIST BY KENNY YOUNG))  C.C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> CURRENT ENCOUNTERS &#34;OPP-APP&#34; List  A short time ago I located and interviewed a very credible witness in Morehead, Kentucky that has provided me with a sober link between a UFO sighting and bizarre report of desperate and blood-curdling screaming sounds heard at the same location immediately after the unidentified flying object had departed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the conversation I had to call a &#39;time out&#39; and take some time to contemplate over this development as the report is terribly interesting. It is one of the best reports I have ever taken as I am impressed with the witness  and extreme strangeness of the case. I will prepare the details of this case shortly and have a report put together in the next hour or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness did not report this except to the police and has no idea how it ended up at NUFORC (Peter, can you help if you retain a source for the original report?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As stated earlier, the Morehead police department was dismissive of this incident, when I contacted them they acknowledged a search party and report of screaming sounds but said that &#39;northern lights&#39; were seen in the area. From my conversation with this very credible witness, northern lights can be positively ruled out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a real mystery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Full report is pending....<n> <n><n> <n><n> KENNY YOUNG  ((END))  ((NOVEMBER 30, 2003, POSTING TO CURRENT-ENCOUNTERS LIST BY KENNY YOUNG))  SUBJECT: Screaming sounds firmly linked to UFO sighting LOCATION: Morehead, Kentucky (Rowan County) DATE: Friday, November 21, 2003 TIME: Between 9 and 10:00 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SUMMARY  In effort to further explore the report of &#39;unidentified lights&#39; and screaming sounds alleged in Morehead, Kentucky, an internet search was conducted to retrieve the address and phone numbers of residents of ((deleted)) (law officer earlier contacted had advised of the search taking place near this location).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a &#34;reverse lookup&#34; was conducted at the internet resource Http://www.theultimates.com one residency was identified on ((deleted)) Lane in Morehead, Kentucky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That number was called around 6:30 p.m. this evening (Sunday, November 30, 2003) and I inquired if anyone could help me with information about the report of screaming sounds heard around one week earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The call was received by Dr. ((name deleted)), a ((deleted)) college professor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I was here when the screams were heard,&#34; he said.  &#34;There were some loud, blood-curdling screams but nobody could find out anything more.&#34;  I then asked if Dr. ((name deleted)) knew anything about any UFO sighting and he said: &#34;Yes, I saw it.&#34;  Dr. ((name deleted)) said that he was driving toward his home on Friday, November 21 between 9 and 10:00 p.m. with his 2 sons, 15 and 18-years old (He recalls the specific date, knowing that one son is in college and would not have been home any day except Friday).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving, they all spotted a soundless aerial object over a nearby open field that was described as an oval-shaped, white-colored light source as big as a pea held at arms length which moved &#39;like a hummingbird would move.&#39;  The object, seen in the dark and clear night skies, was relatively high when first seen and was &#34;coming down, moving in increments as if an elevator would drop and stay there awhile, then drop and stay there awhile,&#34; Dr. ((name deleted)) said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first 3 or 4 minutes of visual observation, the object began moving around to different parts of the sky. They got out of car to see if they could identify this object and verified to their satisfaction that the object was not a plane, helicopter or aurora borealis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;My first inclination was to rationalize what this object could have been,&#34; Dr. ((name deleted)) said. &#34;rather than jumping to conclusions. After we ruled out the various possible explanations we assumed that this was a UFO.&#34;  &#34;I know for a fact that there was no explanation for this object and I&#39;m just glad I had my two sons with me to see it,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing this object for a few minutes, Dr. ((name deleted)) and his 2 sons got back in the car and drove on to their home under a certain sense of apprehension.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I would say that our feeling was more a sense of apprehension than fear,&#34; he said, &#34;I did not know what it was we were looking at and had some concern that it might or could have spotted us.&#34;  After driving the short distance to their house, they went to a second floor bedroom and looked out the window to the northwest where they continued to watch the object. It descended lower toward the ground and seemed to be settling in a nearby field where its color had shifted from a white to an orange. As the object got lower and lower to the ground, it became bigger and its color changed to a reddish light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said that the size of the object increased from a pea at arms length to a dime at arms length, stressing that its size, from his perspective, was &#34;not quite as drastic as a nickel at arms length.&#34;  &#34;There was like a vacuum of silence while we watched this,&#34; Dr. ((name deleted)) said, &#34;it was like everything was real quiet, at a standstill and then when it became a red color, everything went crazy.&#34;  Dr. ((name deleted)) said that animals in the area suddenly erupted in a frenzy. His neighbors dog was barking crazily and his German Shepherd dog tried to break its chain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From his perspective, the object descended to the ground but was not certain that it touched or made contact with the ground as trees prevented him from seeing this with certainty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;At that point, after this object got red, it just &#34;shot off&#34; like a dart, some kind of acceleration and it just took off to the west. We just stood there dumbfounded.&#34;  He said the sighting lasted for an estimated 10 to 15 minute duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I was very reluctant to call the police about a UFO sighting,&#34; he said, &#34;at that point, we were not going to report this.&#34;  &#34;Right after that my 2-sons went back outside and heard the screaming. It was a female voice. They got in the car and within minutes had called from their cell phone to say that they had been hearing screaming sounds in the field where this thing came down,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Approximately 20-minutes after the UFO sighting the police were at my door, there were about 20 officers and a rescue squad over in the field where I spotted the UFO. They were combing the area and had asked me what I knew about someone screaming.&#34;  &#34;Apparently, others had heard the screaming sounds.&#34;  I asked Dr. ((name deleted)) if he could explain what was heard and he emphasized that he did not hear the screaming sounds himself, that his 2 sons heard the disturbing commotion, along with other residents in the area that notified law enforcement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dr. ((name deleted)) paused from our conversation to check with one of his sons, asking if he could recount the nature of the screaming sounds. He said it was a desperate, blood curdling scream of a female voice that kept saying: &#34;Help me, oh my God, help me!&#34;  &#34;Apparently several people had heard the screaming, I don&#39;t know how long it lasted,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the police arrived at his doorstep knocking on his door (an estimated 15 minutes after the UFO departed), Dr. ((name deleted)) volunteered information about the UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I took the officer to the side and explained to him that this is going to sound crazy, but I need to tell you what I saw tonight.&#34;  &#34;I told the police about the UFO after they came to the door, I don&#39;t know if anyone else saw the UFO but the officer taking my report took me seriously. He didn&#39;t write anything down while I talked with him,&#34; Dr. ((name deleted)) said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When asked if the police officer indicated that anyone else had also witnessed the UFO, Dr. ((deleted)) said that the police officer said he had seen a UFO also, but was uncertain if he was referring to the same object or a separate, unrelated sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dr. ((name deleted)) said that aside from reporting this to the police officer who knocked on his door, he had not reported this sighting to any other person and that he was not the source for the report which was submitted to The National UFO Reporting Center. He was puzzled how the report made it to NUFORC and said that neither he, nor his sons, reported the sighting to anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I&#39;m still trying to figure out who reported this,&#34; Dr. ((name deleted)) said after our conversation. He went on to say how he got &#34;freaked out&#34; when the cops came to the door asking about the screaming sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He described the area of his residence as isolated and surrounded by fields and woodland. His road is paved. He emphasized that the screaming sounds came from the immediate area where the unidentified object had came to the ground. &#34;The screaming sounds came from the field, and I have no explanation for it.&#34;  Dr. ((name deleted)), who teaches ((deleted)) for the ((deleted)), also said that he had previously seen a UFO when he was in his Freshman year in college at ((deleted)) in 1976. He said the object was similar to what he saw on Friday, November 21, 2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n> COMMENT  I am deeply impressed by Dr. ((deleted)) and his efforts to remain objective and rationalize various explanations about the sighting. Based on his observation, the object in question is nothing to do with Aurora Borealis or &#39;northern lights.&#39;  Dr. ((deleted)) allowed permission to use his name and employment in this report, having no objection to it attached with the UFO sighting and situation involving a search party near his home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Information furnished by Dr. ((deleted)) sheds new light on this case. Comments from him directly contradict the dismissive approach taken by law officers in remarks made during earlier inquiries (who also incorrectly advised that the event was on Sunday, November 23) regarding a UFO situation that corresponds with the screams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When informed that a Morehead policeman and a fire rescue officer told me that &#34;someone had seen the northern lights,&#34; Dr. ((name deleted)) scoffed at the suggestion and was in disbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I can&#39;t believe they said that, this was definitely not the northern lights.&#34;  He said that tomorrow he will inspect the 50-acre field where the object descended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The report to N.U.F.O.R.C. suggests that the UFO was also sighted by witnesses with the rescue squad responding to the scene. This might suggest that the screaming sound was heard simultaneous to the visual sighting of the UFO. Peter Davenport of N.U.F.O.R.C. states: &#34;The person who submitted the sighting report for Morehead, KY, provided no personal or contact information, to include no e-address.  It &#34;reads&#34; as if it was submitted by a member of the team that was dispatched, i.e. it reads as if someone just copied a written record of the dispatch.  I would have responded to the report, save for the absence of any means of contacting the source.&#34;  That report states: &#34;Morehead-Rowan Co. Rescue Sq.had a call from MPD of a female crying for help x3. From 2 witness then there was a bright light in the sky for about 1 min. RESCUE SQ.arrived on scene and started searching the area 1st &amp; 2nd witness reported seeing this .The fire dept.was ask to begin searching with the thermal imaging camera with no results found. Res. of Morehead was one of the witnesses. Unless there is a confirmed report of a missing person, the search will not be continued.&#34;  The report of desperate, blood curdling screams from a woman crying &#34;Help me, Oh God, Help me&#34; mar this case with a disturbing sense of unusual dread. Clearly, there was a problem taking place and this report raises the specter of reported UFO/human abduction or interaction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Morehead, Kentucky is an estimated 45-miles south of Flemingsburg, Kentucky, where a crop formation appeared in a Rye Field in the spring of this year. A flap of crop formations and UFO sightings also bewildered Southern Ohio in the summer of 2003, and during this flap one strange account of a woman found in a Southern Ohio soybean field is under investigative consideration.  There is no certainty that this situation can be linked to the UFO or crop circle flap aside from the chronological and regional closeness, but the woman - who was hospitalized for a week after being found by a farmer - reportedly experienced amnesia and did not know how she got in the field. This matter is also held under close consideration by researcher Donnie Blessing and will be pursued further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This present case of &#39;screaming sounds&#39; from a female voice is linked firmly to the UFO sighting as per the same location in one specific field near Adams Lane in Morehead, Kentucky and the &#39;20 minute time frame&#39; of the conclusion of the UFO sighting to the arrival of officers involved in the search and rescue operation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Special thanks to Donnie Blessing, Peter Davenport  Filed, November 30, 2003 KENNY YOUNG -- UFO Research http://home.fuse.net/ufo<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

I go to the back fence to pet the dog then turn around and look up to the sky as is my habit.I like to look at the stars every night I can. I see what at first is a extremely bright star with a magnitude similar to Sirius but actually brighter. I am thinking to myself that it should&#39;nt be there when I notice it&#39;s moving from south to north.I&#39;m thinking this is impossible. So I step inside the door and holler at my Father-in-law and tell him he has got to come out and look at this. He is a total non believer in anything such as UFO&#39;s and the like. He comes out and I point it out to him. I ask him &#34;what do you think it is&#34;? We agree it is definitly not a plane(no sound) but it looks just like a giant star. He says maybe it&#39;s a satellite but I have saw them before and I don&#39;t think so.It&#39;s too big and too bright. We watch it until it goes out of sight.He goes back in and about a minute or so after it disappeared I heard and saw a jet on a course that could be like it was keeping an eye on the thing.One more thing my father in law mentioned that he thought he could see like a tail on it.I have better eyesight than him but who knows.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Being the non-believe he is he&#39;s like yea whatever. I continued to look at it and it just hovered there  and I eventually lost sight of it. We got to this girls house and she wasent there so on the way back to my house I looked for it again and it was gone. I couldn&#39;t believe it and now more than ever I believe. It was just an object in the sky, 3 lights in the form of three points of a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While moving slowly with a traffic along 580E toward 880S, we noticed a huge illuminated object hanging over Bay Bridge. There were a lot of lights on this object with some of them (on the top of its oval looking shape) flashing. The flashing light(s) seemed to be blue while all other lights were wight-yellow. The object started to move slowly and smoothly toward Oakland while descending gradually.

VERY LARGE. Totally silent, very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to my vehicle to get my wife a pack of cigarettes, it was dark, very cold and a virtually cloudless sky. As I shut the door to my vehicle I looked up and immedialtely noticed what I first thought was a piece of clear plastic or cellophane floating or blowing in the sky. There was no wind and it was very calm. As I watched it closer I noticed its form and was very shocked and exited by what I witnessed.It was way up there.  It was huge, two or three football fields wide if not larger. It was clear, I could see the stars right through it. I could see the shape of a triangle, it did not have lights on it, but I could could see the shape of what I thought was the front. The pointed end was facing in the direction it was traveling in. It was absolutely silent. No sound at all. I lost sight of it. I ran around to the other side of the house and was able to see it again. It started to move very fast-Several hundred miles an hour. As I was watching it I could tell it was some kind of craft. The sky behind it seemed to get distorted. It was what I could only discribe as it was being cloaked. I ran down the block trying to keep sight of it. The event lasted no more than half a minute.  I did not imagine this event, nor am I making it up. I was totally sober. I can not imagine this type of vehicle being of this planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and he seemed quite credible to us.  He reported that there were no lights on the object.  PD))<n>

Two groups of two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the Northern sky, from west to east, two groups of faint circular lights moving slowly (floating), one trailing the other.  At first they seem to be a string (like a string of balloons, or possibly geese) with no definite shape. As they reach the sky directly above me, to the north, they begin to form arcs or semi-circles, and glow brighter.  Then, at least one of the groups, forms a perfectly closed circle and rotates for a second or two, glowing even brighter.  They go back to arc or string formation and continue towards the northeast, slowly fading in brightness as they move. This whole event possibly took two to three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, as the first pair faded in the northeastern sky, a second pair appeared in exactly the same place in the northwestrn sky and repeated the same pattern as the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire two events took possibly 6 to 8 minutes to complete.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one else witnessed the event with me. I was standing on our rooftop deck in the northern section of center city Philadelphia. I did call my brother on the phone, who lives across town, to desribe to him what I was seeing.

It was about 700-1000 feet up and about 3-5 times larger than a Boeing 747. It was much larger from wing tip to wing tip than it was nose to tail. The object was completely flat with no tail fin or physical objects sticking out of it. Its color was gun metal grey with white.  The object banked left to right several times before I lost it behind my trees. The strange thing was as it got into a brighter area of the sky, it disappeared. Even though it went behind my leafless trees I still should have been able to see the object a little bit, but it was gone. The object produced no sound and had no lights. Before the object dissapeared, I quickly ran inside and got my dad to come out, him and I watched the object slowly make its way behind our trees until we couldnt see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was seen from the witnesses location which was in the southwest part of Airdrie, the beam of light was in the northwest part of the sky. Due to homes being in the witnesses line of sight, they were not able to see if the beam actual hit the ground. I asked the witness a few questions about what this beam of light looked like. He said it came straight down, not on any angles nor were there bends in the light. The fellow told me that it had an orange glow to it. The amazing thing is that this beam of light sat in one place for approx: 20 minutes, enough time that some of the witnesses ran in to telephone other friends and family members so they could go out to see this strange event. I also asked if the beam of light lit up any of the area, the witness said no, due to obstacles in their way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound was heard, plus the beam was rather wide, not just a thin beam of light. He said it was moderately cloudy as I wanted to know if any type of object was seen in the area where the light originated from.  No object was noted. No aircraft were visible at the time of the sighting flying through this airspace. I wondered if this may have been a helicopter, but again not a sound was heard coming from the area and I am sure the witnesses, and the others you went out to watch this would have heard the sound if it had been some type of normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>

There were intense blue &#34;flames&#34; coming from them. It appeared to be low in the sky to the point that, concidering the angle it looked to be going, I expected to see a crash a few miles out of town.

Last night I was in my upstairs kitchen making bread in preperation for Thanksgiving. I had the TV on and there was general noise in the background. It occured to me that I was hearing what sounded like a helicopter very close by outside. This in itself is not unusual as we are on the flight path for the trauma rescue helicopter (which I fly on occasionally). Since the noise was not fading into the distance as it usually does when the copters fly over, I went out to see what the deal was. I thought maybe Life Flight had landed closeby for a &#34;hot&#34; load (load in the patient without shutting the blades down). I looked up and there hovering in my front yard not far off the treetops is this absolutely massive cigar shaped white or light colored &#34;helicopter&#34;. It was hovering in an area close to my pond. We live on 16 manicured acres and this thing was clearly visible in the treeless part of my front yard (this area is roughly 4 acres in size). Not sure what the heck it was doing. Just hovering at an absolute standstill. The thing did not move even one inch in any direction. The sound it made was like a weird sounding helicopter. More like a loud whirring or something. The lights in my house and landscaping flickered and my dogs were freaking out. Occasionally, this thing seemed to make almost no noise at all. It sat there for what I thought was about 10 minutes. Later noticed it was actually more like 40 minutes. This would make sense though because the bread dough I was working with was nearly completely done rising (second rising takes about 40 to 50 minutes). I called my neighbor to see if she was seeing the same thing and she said she did and also wondered what the heck it was doing there. I&#39;m not psychotic. I&#39;m a nurse with a very responsible job and I do not drink, smoke or take drugs, prescription or otherwise. The only mind altering thing I do is meditate...alot. Called the police, but they said they had no other reports of helicopters low flying in the area. They said they&#39;d send over a patrolman to check it out, but I never saw any sign of him. The thing eventually moved off towards the direction of the neighbors house. It moved incredibly slowly. I could have walked way faster than it was moving. I noticed that there seemed to be no downdraft from the rotor blades.In fact I do not recall ever even SEEING any rotor blades. When it went over the neighbors backyard, it turned east and moved off over my woods and eventually out of sight. One other thing I noticed is that when it hovered over my front yard, there was one round light coming from the bottom in the center. It didn&#39;t seem to be a spotlight or anything because the grass beneath it was not illuminated. As it moved off over the woods, it had 3 lights. One on each end and the same center one. One of them was green, and the other two white. I went back out to the area this morning and noticed nothing out of order. I had intense dreaming last night, but not what I would call unusually unusual. I have no idea what this thing was. Maybe just a new type of helicopter I have not seen yet or maybe something else. Not quite prepared yet to assume it was a UFO. The military is always coming up with new designs for things. I don&#39;t live near any military base. I think the closest one is Wright Patterson (?) AFB to the south of me by several hours. This object was clearly hovering in MY yard though. Not like the pilot was just taking a break or something. It was clearly and obviously hanging over my yard not far from my pond. Maybe the pilot was looking at the fish in there??????  Well, this is in a nutshell what happened to me last night. There may be a prefectly reasonable explanation for it. Not sure. I&#39;m not an expert in military flying craft. So many odd things happen to me all the time (you have no idea...) that I can&#39;t immediately rule out something remarkable.<n>

I was visiting her father at the time and we both went outside his home which is also in Fleetwood and looked up in the night sky in the direction of her house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 6 very bright orange lights flying in a semi cicular formation which moved fairly slowly from right to left. The UFO&#39;s seemed to be at very high altitude as a local aircraft was also seen flying towards Blackpool airport and this was at much less altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we both stood watching the UFO&#39;s a neighbour came to her door to see what we were watching and she also witnessed the UFO&#39;s. We continued to watch for about 10 minutes when one of the UFO&#39;s seemed to disapear but on looking closer I noticed that it was still there but seemed to be turning to manouver in a different direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both went inside my friends house to phone my wife who was at home and then went again outside but the UFO&#39;s had gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whilst I was looking carefully at the UFO&#39;s to see where the first one had gone I noticed that each object was made up of a circle of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had dim yellow lights that were spaced out evenly in the front and were in the form of a triangle but without the sharp point (more of smooth edges). The back of it also had dim lights but fewer in numbers. One or two lights of same nature in the middle.  When I noticed it first it was a bit illuminated by the light  from the ground and I could see a shape of it.  It was a solid object (dark) except for the lights, and it almost looked like an egg, but it was so quick that I&#39;m afraid I could be mistaken of the shape.  My mother saw it at the same time, but as I called my husband out of the house, the object disappeared behind the trees.  It was flying silenty, and rather fast.  It didn&#39;t look like a plane, because it appeared to have too many lights and it was too broad.  It couldn&#39;t have been a flock of birds because it didn&#39;t change shape and moved too fast.  It just didn&#39;t look like anything I&#39;ve seen before.  I am very puzzled.  I would like to add that my mother had a sighting several weeks ago.  An object of a triangular shape with dim yellow lights on both sides, looked almost like a flock of geese, flew silently and quickly over our house.  She thought that it was birds, but first it&#39;s too late in the season, second, it was dark, so nothing could illuminate the birds like that, and third, the lights didn&#39;t change shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is what we saw.  It was a very clear, starry night.  We stepped off our front porch to take a walk.  We live in the mountains, so our horizon is high.  I glanced toward the west and saw a big, very bright full moon hanging several degrees above the mountain ridge.  We were looking through a lot of bare tree branches.  I remember wondering how the moon could be setting in the west when it was fairly early evening.  I looked away and then glanced back.  The &#34;moon&#34; began to fall rapidly toward an area behind the mountain ridgeline.  It was surreal - how could the moon be moving that fast?  Then the bottom of the &#34;moon&#34; started to disintegrate into lots of white dots.  The disintgration process went from the bottom of the disc to the top, but it fell behind the ridgeline before I saw the whole thing disintegrate.  It did not break up into lots of smaller spheres like what I have heard people report.  It actually disintegrated into hundreds of tiny lights that fell as the disc fell, but they streamed below the disc toward the earth.  It was sort of like watching the sand drop from the middle of an hour glass, only the sand was coming from the rapidly disintegrating disc.  There was no explosion or any kind of sound reaching us.  That was all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While my friend was viewing through the telescope I turned back and looked toward the SW and saw what looked like the ISS (International Space Station) coming over . I told my friend to stop and lets look at the ISS since it is so bright a -0.7 MAG. Once the ISS flew over and past us we both continued  watching when we saw three very faint star like lights moving with it. One along side,and two behind the ISS. We both continued to observe the lights as long as we could. Were not sure what we saw, and wonder if anyone else saw what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What we would describe as large headlamp that was approaching the power lines in a collision course. And from our vantage point, the power lines and light behind it appeared to be parralell to us. As it continued to approach the wires the light got brighter. As the light seem to hit the wires the large flock of birds resting on them were spooked and flew off quickley, most of them in a northerly direction. The light became much brighter at that point (what could be called the point of impact). At the time of impact the street lamps shut down for a second or two and the traffic light at our intersection did the same. The light disappeared after about a second as the birds flew away. We both experienced discomfort in our eyes similar to a camera flash. As the light changed we proceeded directly through it and quickley realized that the power lines followed the turn in the road and were positioned on the northerly side of the road. We estimated the distance from where we were waiting at the light to the estimated point of impact (centered between two telephone poles) to be less than a quarter of a mile. We stoped at the  shopping center nearby to retrieve our cell phone and called 911. I suggested to the operator that FPL should be called to check the wires and described what we had witnessed. We did not see any planes or helicopters in the vincinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness intended a date in the year 2003, and we have changed the date above accordingly.

Immediately after observing the contrail forming, the two observers saw 8 (eight) objects in the sky, appearing like stars (relatively the same size, but more metallic-silvery-shiney in appearance than a star at night) in the blue, daylight sky.  These objects had no apparent formation, but they were moving slowly. Almost 7 (seven) minutes into observing these objects, 6 (six) of the objects appeared to have a two-by-three formation:  two columns, three in each column, almost equidistant in space in relation to each other.  After roughly 10 (ten) minutes of observation, the 8, star-like objects could not be seen; it was as if they had slowly vanished from the observers&#39; sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is speculation:   We thought the objects we saw were parachutes for a while, but we deduced that, given the time we observed the objects, we would have seen them increase in size/get larger and more apparent.  However, the objects appeared to slowly decrease in size and then vanish over time.  We finally concluded that we had no idea what these objects were.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looks like a veritable space battle, with the larger object dodging the many smaller objects.  After viewing for an hour, the scene has tracked with the stars in the background.

The weather was clear and cold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was white and steady, the size of a very large star, several times the size of Mars during its close approach to Earth in late summer, and slightly to the west of where that planet had been visible in the night sky.

We went outdoors and watched for a few minutes, then I phoned the police to ask if anyone else had reported it.  No one had.  The dispatcher said she&#39;d send an officer to the vicinity to check, and phone me back if he saw anything unusual.  I went back to the window, and the light was slightly smaller, as if it had moved away from us on a direct line.  I then had to deal with a sick cat, and when I looked again, half an hour later, the light was gone.

It wasn&#39;t going as fast as most planes in my area go, do to the distance from the Chicago airports airports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this plane, which was silent, until it came right above me, and at that point all I heard was a &#34;shhhhhhh&#34; sound. Well, I could clearly see the bottom of the plane. It was a white trianglular craft with bright white lights on all three corners that didn&#39;t blink. The strange thing is it resembled (not exactly but similar) a stealth fighter. The tail section was not as notched out as a steath is, but it just looked similar. Anyway, as it went over, I knew I&#39;d have to goto the front to watch it further south. I ran through the house to see in to the south and when I got there it was gone. It was still day light, there weren&#39;t any clouds in the sky, and nothing to obstruct my view. Also, the craft wasn&#39;t moving very fast as I watched it out back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft looked like it could have been a military craft to me, although I have never seen a white craft like this on tv or the internet. I did some searching on the internet to try and find any documentation of such a craft and was unable to find that information.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were lower than a commercial plane, and the lights were not small as you&#39;d see on a commercial aircraft, however they were traveling straight at a normal rate of speed to the south east. I ran to one of my bedroom windows to see if I could see what type of aircraft had such large lights, but in fact I could not see any craft at all, just the lights, even though they were close enough that I should have been able to see what the lights were attached to, if they were indeed attached to anything at all. The sky was clear. The lights were quite large and did not blink and they were all the same size and color and were round. They traveled in an exact coordinated pattern, this being two lights fairly close to each other on the bottom &#34;row&#34; and the other light on the &#34;top&#34;, forming a triangle. I never heard any noise. They traveled at a steady speed and I watched them until they were not in my line of sight in either of my bedroom windows, then I ran downstairs and went outside to see if I could see them, but they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The flashes were about 1 second or less apart. I went inside to get my binoculars. When I came back outside, I waited for the light to reappear, as it had before. It did reappear, but there was only one light and it was more round (it was still no larger than Mars looked recently, but this was not Mars)and the color was more of a yellow-orangish hue. It had also moved about 10 degrees to the east and only flashed once. I waited for more. At 20:23hrs the light came back between the positions of the other two sightings and seemed to twist and fade from blue-whte to a yellow-orange color. I have not seen them since.

Scopeville is around 70 miles south of Kansas City, just south of the village of Parker, Kansas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 7:30 PM CST, I was observing Mars through my 8 inch Meade LX90 telescope when I noticed a bright red light on the southern horizon.  For an instant, I thought it was the star Sirius but quickly realized that Sirius should appear on the eastern horizon, and the light was nearly due south of me.  I turned my telescope on the light and saw that it was not a single light but two nearly identical lights, looking very much like a double star, each being of first visual magnitude.   As I continued to observe the lights, I noted that they were moving slowly to the North Northwest.  I followed the lights in my scope until they were overhead and slightly to the west of me.   At no time did I observe either red/green navigation lights or any flashing strobe lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to get a digital photograph of the lights through my telescope and obtained an image of two fuzzy reddish orange patches of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were also lights on the wingtips of the object, green on the left, and red on the right.  It appeared to be about 150 - 200 feet off the ground, about the size of a helicopter (the end of my thumb would JUST cover it at my arm&#39;s length).  After about 20 seconds or so of hovering, it moved eastward, towards Boise, ID, the bottom lights still pulsating, the wingtip lights still flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It&#39;s difficult to explain but you knew it wasn&#39;t an airplane by the intensity of the light and the color of the red (the red was too concentrated) also the object seemed to be hovering in one spot. My kids and I watched it after we got home as it seemed to be drifting forward, then drifting to the north.  During the last 10 minutes it stayed stationary before finally in one sharp movement that seemed to be eastward it just disappeared almost as if it evaporated, disappearing into thin air.

One of the aircraft continually circled the area for approximately 15 minutes, it could have been longer but I went inside after determining the red object wasn&#39;t going to come back.  These seemed to be private planes although it was too dark to say for sure I&#39;m guessing by the lights and the sounds. I got the distinct impression from the planes behavior that they were looking for the same thing my kids and I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

I looked up into the southern sky and noticed a red flashing light ( There was not a rythm or pattern to how it was blinking)in the sky(at about 30 - 35 degrees from the horizon) It was moving slowly towards the east / north. My line of sight of the object was about to be blocked by the corner of the apartment, so I ran out to my other patio (off of the living room) so I could have an unobstructed view. After a couple of minutes, it was still blinking but seemed to have stopped moving and the light would go out for longer dueations ( 1 - 2 second) and just stopped all together. I stood outside for about another 5 minutes to see  if it would come back, the object did not but I did see two planes flying at a high altitude, one coming from the east and the other coming from the north. The plane from the east flew very close to where the object had been, and the plane coming from the north turned west just about where I had seen the object ( about 10 seconds before the west bound plane).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I did, the first thing I saw was a big white light in the sky across the street.  It was so big and nearby, it could have only been coming from a helicopter.  But it was an unusually warm day in WI and I still had my windows open.  Had it been a helicopter, there would have been loud noise coming from it.  There was no noise whatsoever.  I watched it for about 15 seconds and it went behind the house across the street so I lost sight of it.  It just silently glided out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes later again &#34;something&#34; told me to take the dogs outside.  My dogs never go out at that time (they&#39;re on a regular pattern and had gone out a little earlier already).  As I took the second dog outside, I looked up in the sky and telepathically said: &#34;Are you still in the area?&#34;  Right then I noticed a plane going overhead.  I said out loud: &#34;Oh, that&#39;s just a stupid plane again!&#34;  And before I finished that sentence, I saw something else and said: &#34;THAT&#39;s not a plane!&#34;  Not too far behind the plane was a configuration of three amber circles enclosed in a amber rectangle. It glowed amber as if it was pure energy and a sentient being in and of itself.  As it glided through the atmosphere, it didn&#39;t fly straight like human made planes do, rather it traveled on an angle.  I watched it only for a few seconds before it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For character reference: I am a Disclosure Project Representative, have worked directly with Golden Eagle, have investigated the two WI Crop Circles this summer, been healed from PID from an ET in 1995, am a Natural Healer and Metaphysical Teacher/Student.  Among many other things I am directly connected to Aztalan and Rock Lake, WI.

Since I myself was healed by an ET, I have strongly requested those same ETs to heal my Mother.

And in that time, a mysterious white &#34;UFO&#34; van has been spotted numerous times right near where they live. So I have Faith that they are going to heal her.

There were many cars on the highway, so it is possible that many other people witnessed this as well. I looked to the left as a bright light caught my eye. It looked at first like a shooting star, but then it slowed down and moved erratically before disappearing. I thought maybe it had been a signal flare shot off, but it was bright white and did not appear to have a streak following the path of the light, the way a burning flare does. Plus it&#39;s descent was not in an arc, but moved around in a squiggly pattern before disappearing. I probably would not report this, except that I got a call from someone else in the area who saw strange lights in the sky last night in nearby Petaluma, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I initially thought it was a shooting star but it continued to shine brightly all the way down and did NOT disappear behind Mt Umhumnum (sp?) or the surrounding mountains. It was very bright, casting a very distinct greenish glow in the air around it. Based on how close it now seemed to me, I gauged it&#39;s speed. It seemed faster than a freefall - it seemed to fall @ the same rate of speed at which a professional firework goes up before it explodes. It really looked like an emergency flare, but was falling far too fast. I have been scanning the local news channels and am trying to find more info online to explain this strange sighting. I was alone in the car but believe I saw a few cars around me tap their brakes, weave a little, presumably because they saw the same thing.

Suddenly a VERY large light the shape of a cylinder, dropped straight down out of the sky traveling at a speed I have never comprehended. It was solid white light. It appeared to be in our outer atmosphere. But it was so large seeing it out in space, it had to be absolutely enormous. It just dropped out of space straight down toward earth. It had white light trailing behind it similar to a comet. It was so large it size, and just dropped behind Mount Umunhum (mountain that separates Santa Cruz from San Jose). I thought it was going to crash into earth and was expecting to feel and see some impact. I thought I would feel the earth shake when it hit the earth. But nothing happened. I couldn&#39;t believe what I had seen. I called 911 but it rang for 3 minutes until I finally hung up. The phone lines were obviously jammed. I called a friend and asked if they had seen it. They hadn&#39;t. This morning, they said there was a meteror shower last night. This was NO METEOR SHOWER.

Venus was setting brilliantly in the west, and this object looked like it was one inch to the left, or south, of it, if you held up a finger and squinted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an egg-shaped object but definitely had some jagged protrusions, particularly on the left side, and looked to be all on fire.   It was about as big as the sun which had just set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object first suddenly appeared, it was zooming toward Earth straight down and moving at the velocity of a shooting star.  But unlike a shooting star, it never zoomed across the zenith of the sky or made any horizontal movements.  Flames appeared to be shooting out from the jagged protrusion on the left, and from the top (the part pointing away from the Earth), although the whole thing looked to be on fire , and bright yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object was zooming toward Earth, it suddenly vanished!  It did not go down behind some mountains to the west of us--it just plain vanished, leaving a wiggly crooked smoke trail behind it.  The smoke was blue-black or black, and it hung in the air for a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By 5:45 p.m., I had arrived in El Rito.  It was almost dark but I could still see a glimpse of the smoke trail through the trees.  This entire incident lasted about 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was travelling about 45 mph when the object first appeared and I slowed to 30 mph.  I continued to watch it for at least another couple of miles.  I didn&#39;t stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most amazing thing of all is that the object suddenly vanished without hitting the Earth.  The smoke trail in the air was most definitely between us, here at El Rito and the mountains to the west of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> El Rito is about 55 miles northwest of Santa Fe, in the mountains of Northern New Mexico, in Rio Arriba County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s what I saw!

I was filming the sky doing my UFO studies when I witnessed a white light coming down from the sky.  So I gripped my camera and I ran looking to see where this light went.  One second it was in front of me the next it was over my head. Then the next thing I knew it was just hovering left to right it was a dome shaped and changed into a saucer shape and it just took off in one second and disappeared right before my eyes. Right after that I saw a black helicopter fly over head like it was looking for something and then I saw airplanes flying over the area in pairs of threes like they were looking for something. I believe that there is something out there and the world needs to know the truth. Ask yourself in the middle of all this war why are they still sending stuff out into space that tells me that they are looking for something and that they know the truth. The bible says in revelations 4:11 (NKJV) you are worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for you created all things and by your will they exist and were created.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pictures you will see are of a saucer shaped and dome shaped ship and the jet that was chasing it.<n>

To the naked eye, it looks like it is the intensity of Mars when it was at its closest to Earth.  But Mars is unmistakably reddish-orange.  This light appeared to change in intensity quickly and irregularly.  Through binoculars and a telescope other colors such as green, red, white, blue, and purple were distinguishable.  I have a Canon A70 camera.  I haven&#39;t learned all of the settings of the camera, but I tried to take pictures with a longer exposure so as to capture as much light as I could.  Here are some of the photos I took.  If you zoom in about 600% you&#39;ll see the object more clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Redlands, California.  I&#39;d say that the object was in a southern direction.  Standing out if front of a two story house, the object was below the top of the roof.  I noticed it tonight November 19,2003 at approximately 11:00 pm.  I observed it for about 30 minutes.  In the first few minutes I could tell it was moving relative to another star that was visible near it.  After about 5 mintues or so, it seemed to stop.  Under a telescope, it moved gently off of view.  So it looked like it was still moving, but very very slowly.  Under binoculars and telescope, the light appeared to be &#39;rectagular&#39; or &#39;cylindrical&#39;.  It was longer up and down that it was wide from right to left.  Any how, here are a few of the pics I took.

We had gone outside to look for falling stars as it was a very dark and clear night.  The moon wasn&#39;t very bright and I don&#39;t think it was anywhere near where we were looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were talking about UFOs and such, all of a sudden in a completely coincidental and serendipitous moment, a triangular object came into our field of vision.  We were standing close to the house, so it appeared to come from over the rooftop and then flew in a straight line from south-east to the north-west.   I was only able to see it for about 5 seconds as it flew over the tree line behind me.  There were tall pine trees all around me and the object was about 2 to 3 times the height of the tree top level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no visable lights and it was completely silent.  At first my brain thought I was seeing a falcon gliding or a hang-glider, because of the speed, height, and smoothness of the way the object was flying.  but we quickly realized it was a large object like a craft or something.  It was too slow to be plane, too fast to be a blimp.  It appeared to defy gravity.  It was so quiet i could hear everything around me. the slight hum of the street lights, etc.   You WOULD NOT have seen this thing unless you just happened to be looking at the exact spot that we were looking at at that exact moment.  It was a one in a trillion shot!   It was so dark, as was the sky that night, so it was very well camoflauged.   I say triangular, but i could only make out 2 sides of the triangle in the dark sky, so I don&#39;t know how the back of the object was shaped.  It could have been a triangle or a diamond.  The back was just too dark to see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the feeling it was a top secret military craft that was maybe on a test flight just to see if anyone would report seeing something that night.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I was the only one in the city to see it that night.  I just happened to be looking for something at just the right time in the right patch of the sky.  But it had white or light-colored markings on the underside, they were on the left and the right side.  They were symetrical, about 4 or 5 white spots or streaks running down the left and right side.  They seemed to defeat the purpose of hiding the craft, but they were on there non-the-less.   I am including a sketch.<n>

It appeared to be moving toward me at a reasonable rate of speed, comparable to a jet.  It did not have any flashing wing lights or any color lights other than just being a bright white light.  I really thought it was just a jet coming towards me on some sort of route to the Austin Bergstrom International Airport.  We are in that flight path for some approaches.  I was amazed at how big and bright it was.  It was not high in the sky but over the horizon by about 2 to 3 degrees.  I lost sight of it.  I then turned north on Brodie Lane, headed to work.  As I topped the little hill before entering the valley to my work, I noticed 5 bright white lights over what appeared to be downtown Austin.  I could see the capitol building and the lights were above and to the left, making it generally to the north of my position.  Three lights were in a triangular pattern with the legs being about the width of 4 fingers held at arms length.  If you look at an equilateral triangle, the other 2 lights were in line with the bottom of the triangle and to the right (east) about a finger&#39;s width, held at arms length.  All the lights did not appear to be moving.  The 2 lights to the left were all in line with the bottom of the triangle.  I lost sight of them as I continued north.  They were rather bright and all of about the same magnitude.  I called the airport police when I got to work and they said they had not had any other reports, at least tonight.  They said they have been getting several reports all month.  They said they would pass it along to the FAA.  They told me to contact your group.  Anyway, as I lost sight of the lights, I did notice a jet generally travelling from the south towards the lights.  I could not say if it was a military or commercial jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It also had one light in the middle one on what i would call the tail end and one on each wingtip. The lights on the nose and the one in the middle of the craft were the only ones blinking.

The longer i looked at it the more you could see swirling color&#39;s. So i ran in my house and called a relative who came out and watched it with me. We both got our binoculars to get a better picture and thats when we saw 2 more that were smaller but still emitting color.At that point the biggest one starting doing weird things like spinning and shooting out sparks of color all around it. Ive never seen something so beautiful.After 20 minutes the family member that was with me was cold so she left and i stayed out about an hour.I saw the little dipper to go by and all i can say for direction is it was facing the same way the end of the handle was pointed.And the other two were straight above me and the other to the left of the first one.They may have been there longer then an hour but my neck was killing me from stairing up so long.Ive seen ufo&#39;s in the past but ive never seen one that looked or acted like this one.There were no clouds and the stars were all bright and it was about 40 Degress out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then a half hr. went by and no more sightings. Then they started again and I counted 4 more before going back in the house. They moved around very high, much higher than the airplanes, and much faster, but slower than a satellite. They would either turn in a right angle, or like a boomerang angle.

It had large red flashing lights and was in the shape of a triangle. We could see the mainland and planes going to and from LAX and Long Beach which were so small in comparison I would say the object we saw was many many times larger, and silent. No sound at all. We watched it go from our far right to a cloud on the left side of our field of view. It never came out of the cloud.

Anyway, on this particular night I was hoping to catch sight of the tail end of the Leonids, as it had been far too overcast on the previous two nights to see anything.  Suddenly, I was aware of a large, V-shaped craft coming from the Southern sky.  I was immediately struck by the fact that, although there appeared to be no lights of any kind on it, I could see the object very clearly.  It seemed to be giving off light but there was no halo or aura visible.  As it came closer, i.e. moved overhead in a direction that was almost due North, I could see how fast it was moving, and that it wasn&#39;t a large craft at all, but rather several smaller, bronze or copper-coloured eliptical-shaped objects flying in a V-formation.  As I watched, and I had an excellent view of it for at least ten seconds, some of the crafts flying on the right hand arm of the V started to change places within the formation, while keeping the V-shape intact and maintaining a constant speed.  I couldn&#39;t believe how fast and maneuverable they appeared to be as they moved around within the V; I have seen many acrobatic air teams perform and no aircraft I have ever seen could move like these did.  These craft seemed to be flying at about the same height of a small plane like a Cessna.  We have a small airfield nearby and we are on the approach path for Pearson International in Toronto, so I am very familiar with the many ways aircraft can appear in the night sky.  I also was struck by the fact that there was absolutely no sound emanating from them as they flew overhead.  I watched the formation as i! t flew overhead and out of sight over the Northern horizon.  However, there seemed to be an unusually large number of aircraft in the area on this night, and the buzz of the small aircraft engines and the whine of the larger jets approaching from the Southwest were making rather a large din and could have drowned out any noise it was making.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I probably wouldn&#39;t have reported this sighting except that I saw this exact object in the night sky almost one year ago.  I was in my backyard at the time, again scanning the night sky for constellations, when it flew overhead from the Southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These lights were surrounded by a pink/red haze that seemed to emanate from the bottom and flow upward around the lights. This object was no more than 30 feet off the ground and approximately 300 feet in front of me.  It was thirty to forty feet wide and made no sound what so ever. It hovered or seemed to float for a few minutes until it fired off a smaller white light to the west/southwest not two feet above the pine trees to my immediate right.  At this point I started home across our pasture to get my husband to see what I saw.  As I moved towards the house the object followed.  By the time I got my husband to come and see the object, it was directly over the house and we both watched it ascend until it disappeared in the sky above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It went about ten miles to the east towards Cedar Hill and then turned South, it gained alttitude and very slowly disappeared.

The seem to be out every weekday, but not always on the weekends.  The first time we noticed them was when we saw one ascend to it&#39;s hovering position from the North to high overhead.  The object climbed in inchworm like motion, but in quick jerky segments until it reached its hovering position.  I know we have a private contractor developing an unmanned helicopter for the military which can fly at altitudes of 35,000 feet or more.  One of them had a hard landing near the Southern California Logistics airport (where the contractor is based) during the summer.

We have also observed flashed of light and objects &#34;shot&#34; from them (for tracking purposes, perhaps).

Investigated by Iowa MUFON, Glen Singley.  On November 19, 2003, at 12:30 a.m., witnesses had purposely gone out to watch for meteors, and saw a silent triangle fly overhead so that they could view its underside, and watch it move from north to south so slowly that it took 3-4 minutes for it to disappear from view.  Altitude estimate is 400-500 feet.  [NOTE: Witnesses specify TRIANGULAR SHAPED PINKISH-WHITE GLOWING LIGHTS at each angle of the triangle.  It should be noted that Iowa MUFON has investigated another case recently where triangular-shaped lights were also noted, although the lights were not at the apices of the triangle, but rather along the sides of the triangle.]  At first, witnesses thought they were seeing 3 objects instead of just one, but when the object passed in front of Orion&#39;s Belt, they saw that it obscured some stars in the cluster, and that it was one object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to MUFON/IOWA for the report, and for their having followed up on the sighting report.

The longitude is ( 117 deg +/- 1deg ), coincidently is the same as Spokane where very similar ongoing phoenomena is observed. Interestingly, Yermo, CA,  where a recent landing was reported (Oct 03), falls on that same line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About half of these objects pass over,usually off white or yellow, brighten up at a certain point for 10-20 seconds then  go back to normal and continue on. The other half brighten up and simply terminate or end in a &#34;spiral reentry&#34;of some sort. Ninety percent of this type of object eminate from the south and are on a northerly path. A few fly N-S or W-E. Even fewer go E-W. They are up around 250 miles. (height determined from crude angular measurement then calculated. This method checks well with the ISS). The S-N objects are the most &#34;colorful&#34;, N-S and E-W usually just pass on by. A third of the W-E will display an event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As many as 4 objects have been observed flying in a parallel formation with no other events seen. Formation flying is at about 350 miles high and tend to go the southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other on going observations include stationary strobing lights (1to 4 strobes). Some of the single strobe lights will cast a shadow. Also seen are &#34;plasma balls&#34; that stair-step down similar to those seen in Deming NM (11/5/02). Some satellites/objects display anomalies in their trails , some almost like morse code pattern.Others display small short bursts of light embedded the trail.On a few ocassions, some objects intersect with one another.Most of these events are very fast and were captured by photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well there you have it. I hope this is a useful piece of the puzzle. I am a Physics/ Astronomy  lab instructor/technician with a small college in southern Calif. I have been observing and photographing the sky for 30 years or longer. I have never seen the sky this full of  things in the past. Thanks for this opportunity to make a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the date of the alleged sighting was in the year 2003.  We have altered the date above to 2003.  PD))<n>

Nov.17. About 4:45 Pm. Sun getting low in the west. Bright clear sky. I live about 20 miles northwest of Homestead reserve Air base. I&#39;m acustome to seeing &amp; hearing military jets from there. They have a distinct sound from a civilian jetliners.  Working in the front yard I heard that military jet sound relatively close overhead as usual. Upon looking to see one of the beautiful F-16&#39;s or F-18&#39;s I was surprised to find I couldn&#39;t see anything.  The loud engine sound traversed from southeast of me(Homestead) to the northwest. I&#39;m aware that higher flying craft can be somewhat ahead of the apparent location of the sound. I searched the sky for the entire time of the relatively slow, directly overhead passage. I have excellent eye sight and have seen very high flying jetliners so high that the sound couldn&#39;t be heard, but this is just the opposite. This is the 3rd time I&#39;ve experienced this in the last 6 months. Interested to know if anyone in this area has experienced this strange situation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It caught my attention because it was birghter than any other star around - on a very clear night.  It was also &#34;twinkling with dots of colored light pulsing slightly down to the right and left sides that would often for a flat triangle shape which had the top of the triangle as the center (mountain shape vs. V-shape. The colors I saw in order of most ocurrence where green, red, blue.  I got an amateur pair of binoculars and stared for a while but couldnot see detail.  I looked at the other stars around the bright spot, and there where many, and they were all fuzzy and seemed much farther away than this pulsing star.  It was the color moving it &#34;dots&#34; away fromt he center thatfascinated me the most.  After about 30 minutes I went to bed. The bright spot had shifted out of the window pane to the south slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed that one &#34;star&#34; appeared unusually large. It was in the east sky, high from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I reached my doorway I took one more glance at the sky before entering my home. The one huge &#34;star&#34; suddenly darted a very short distance to the north from an obvious stand-still position a moment before, and then abruptly stopped. Surprised and curious, I went in to get my binolulars for a better look. When I looked at it through the binocular lenses, I was stunned to see a round/circular object that appeared to be the size of a fifty-cent piece,as one would be to the naked eye.I clearly saw that the outer ring of the object was full of what appeared to be rows of lights close together. There was a smaller blank ring section inside that ring of lights. There was also another smaller ring section of lights inside it, and a second very narrow blank ring area with what appeared to be one large solid light in the very center of the entire object. There were four rings, two with lights and two blank,  with a center solid light in the very center of the object. The solid center light appeared to be red in colour. No sooner did I get a clear, detailed view, when the entire object shot straight up, becoming quarter sized, then dime sized, then quickly &#34;star&#34; sized. I watched it for fifteen minutes just to see if it would come back down. It didn&#39;t. Becoming cold,I went indoors.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Some began to drive erratically (including myself) while trying to catch a glimpse of the object.  I had another witness in the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object&#39;s body was either in the shape of a T or a Y...it was hard to tell.  The lights it had underneath it were definitely in a Y formation.  I remember seeing a blue, red, as well as white lights.  Some of the lights were blinking.  The object appeared to be black in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object made no noise that I could hear and appeared to be completely stationary or moving very slowly in the sky.  Given how I was able to pass by it fairly quickly, I believe the object&#39;s altitude was very low.  The object also appeared to be quite large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What struck me as odd was the absence of noise and how it was able to fly/hover at such a low speed (if it was even moving at all).<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE:  The date of this event was 11/16/2003, NOT 11/16/1903.

It had lights on the outer edges that were going around. It was not solid but looked like a slide projection on the clouds. Except this projection travelled south over our roof and disappeared. i went inside and told my wife. This time we left the dog inside and went outside. There it was again!

We noticed the light shortly after it came into view from the north and watched it appx. three forths of the way across the arc before it disappeared.  The light did not dim or get brighter, it did not break up or change color from its original bright white color.  The ambient light level of the sky in this area is high, due to a large factory east of town.  Viewing stars in this area is usually difficult, thats what made this light different and attracted our attention.  We could see landing lights of aircraft lineing up for an east to west landing at lambert.  This light traveled perpendicular to those lights.  Possible meteorite?<n>

The sun was setting, already below the horizon.  Looking north of the setting sun, were two crescent shaped lights.  fairly large, with the convex pointing down.  As I watched, the two lights got closer together.  I made a turn and lost sight of lights.  When I turned west again, at about 5:37 PM, one light had turned around, changed shape into what looked like a rocket heading straight down towards Earth and the other craft.  But there was no white streak behind it, and red flames coming from the back of the craft.  (the red flame looked like magnesium burning, color-wise).   Then  as I watched, at about 5:40 PM, the second craft (which kept its crescent shape, and was stationary until now) changed into a rocket (also with no white streak behind it, and a red-magnesium burning flame) and headed straight up into the sky away from the other craft.  these two flight paths continued until about 5:50 PM, when the second craft disappeared from view and the first craft changed its course to run parallel with the horizon.  By 5:55 PM,  the first craft had moved back up into the sky, and changed into a stationary bright light, looked like a star.  Except that where it was stationary at, the sky was still light, not dark enough to see stars yet.  By 6:20 PM, when I reached Lawton, Oklahoma, Comanche County, the light was still stationary, the sun had set completely, and I stopped watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our field investigator has found him to be an honest and sincere man who is not in any way or form attemptimg to perpetuate a hoax or initiate a joke. He has never asked for any monies for his film, but has sent digital video files through the internet, and also hand given physical video tape for free use for study. The video film in its entirety is 8:13 long; is in the Windows Media format (.wmv) and is 25.15 megabytes. A sample clip of film is available for your study. The sampler film is 11 seconds in length, and only 590 KB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below is Martin&#39;s description of how the taking of the video film in question transpired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to have a look at the early evening sky, camcorder at ready just in case. At about 16:15, I first spotted the unknown object quite a way off in the distance (through binoculars and spotting scope). It took me around 20 minutes before I could zoom in with the camcorder to start filming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was quite clear with just a few wispy clouds here and there. The distance is quite difficult to judge but I would say that the object was possibly around 10 to 15 miles away. I was on my own this time with no other witnesses and with the distance involved, I couldn&#39;t hear any sound emanating from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All in all, I managed to film around 20 or so minutes before the object disappeared behind a cloud in the distance.The object went behind the cloud at around 17:05.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were climbing a small hill on Highway #16 just before Babine Forest Products when they both noticed a red ball of light a head of them, dropping on a slight angle from low in the sky. The witnesses said, the object, what ever it was seem to come down just on the other side of the hill they were climbing. Also what they found to be strange was just after they lost sight of the red ball of light behind the hill, all of a sudden at the crest of the grade, on the highway , the whole area was glowing a bright reddish color. They reported that the tops of the tress were also bathed in a reddish glow. From their vantage point they could not see anything as they had not arrived at the top of the hill. They were only a few hundred yards away from reaching the top and from this location they should have been able to see what was causing this reddish glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before they reached the top the light went out. The couple slowed down and kept their eyes open to maybe catch sight of it again somewhere just off the highway. But nothing could be observed. No vehicles were seen driving along the highway a head of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witnesses for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

I observed moon colored, lighted from within, circular disc shaped objects.  They appeared in PAIRS, not singly.  They  moved upward swiftly.  I counted about 12 objects.  From my  window I  looked down to where there was a cove in the water and then high embankments.  Two of the objects swooped low over the water and then upward over the embankment.  I was visiting Corsica for the weekend.  I was teaching ((subject deleted)) as a ((deleted)) Instructor at Santa Stephanos Island for the US Navy aboard the USS Emory S. Land.  My sister, Dr. ((name deleted)), observed the same phenomena when I called her to the window.<n>

We live on an extremely short street, two houses from a stop sign. We were laying in bed, having just turned off the television moments earlier, when without any warning, something passed down our street, only 20-25 feet from where we were laying, traveling at an incredible speed, at least 100mph. This object did not produce any light, and it was gone as quickly as it came, and it definately wasn&#39;t earthbound. There was no engine sound of any kind, just the sound of the air moved by its force. Also, we could &#34;feel&#34;, so to speak, the disruption of our space as it passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I saw what at first I thought was some kind of &#34;reflection&#34; I thought it was a flock of birds flying and some kind of light was reflecting on to them making them visible to me  in the night. But I soon realized it was not birds, it was many glowing objects in the shape of a V.  They were bluish-white and each one was about as bright as a &#34;dim&#34; star.  The V was made up of about 5 of these glowing objects down each side of the V.  There was some kind of blur or mist around each light also.  I could not determine if they were all fixed to one large object or if they were all seperate objects.  They were all staying perfectly alligned as if they were connected.  I was facing north and they were moving from my left to right (South-East)  There was no sound and it was moving very quickly.  It moved much faster then any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen.  I guess the whole thing lasted about 7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were on the balcony and something flew very close to the hotel, about 20 to 30 yards from where we sat on the 8th floor. We could easily have thrown a rock and hit it if we werent stunned by seeing it. It seemed oddly shaped like a rectangle but wobbly and it made the same noise a helicopter makes and it had a bright red glow coming from it which made the whole side of the hotel red. We didnt know what it was but an hour later we noticed lots of activity up the beach by naval station mayport, spotlights and the whole base lite up like a christmas tree. We then drove as close to mayport in neptune beach as possible and sat watching for hours all the activity out in the water. There was several helicopters with search lights skimming over the water, there were at least 12 total helicopters, 7 were skimming over the water about about 2 to 3 miles out, they would pass each other and come back and there were at least 5 helicopters we could see up the beach and up in the sky above the beach. We left after a few hours because we thought MPs would come out from the dunes and arrest us but as we left the electric boxes on the poles were all buzzing very loudly, we have been to the beach here before and the electric boxes didnt buzz like that normally. We went back to the hotel and in the morning there were still 4 or 5 helicopters skimming the water and at least 2 we could see flying about the beach. We checked the news and all the places online for any searches or rescues but nothing was reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was about half way done with my smoke and for some reason I looked straight up in the sky and just as I did I saw a very vivid triangular craft. It was very cloudy and overcast that night. The only way someone else could have seen It was if they were looking straight up. Anyway, it was a very large craft and it was moving very slowly following the interstate I-65 going south like it was following something on the Interstate. It had three distinct circular lights on the bottom of the craft which was flat. The craft was black in color. I could not say for sure how high up this thing was but If it would have been a jet It would have shook the place at that altitude. I remember hearing a lot of traffic (tractor trailers) on the interstate that were heading south. This thing whatever it was, I believe was following trucks on the interstate for some reason. Maybe Military? Transport of nuclear waste? After I spotted it I yelled at everyone to come outside and look and by that time it had dissapeared into the clouds. This thing had no flashing lights on it anywhere. Just the three dimmly lit lights on the bottom. I saw two or three aircraft in the area to the south but I never saw the craft again. Like I said it was very overcast and this thing was using the clouds as cover. The clouds were very low to the ground that night. It was only visible for about 15 seconds due to the cover of the clouds. I dont think this was a little green man ship. My thoughts are It was top secret military craft that was watching or protecting something that was being transported on the interstate in tractor trailer trucks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

She observed the object for approx: 4 to 5 seconds before she lost sight of it. Also the witness told me that there was a low cloud ceiling that evening and the green object was well below it. No unusual maneuvers or sound were noted. Now depending how far the object was away from the object, giving me a rounh idea to it&#39;s size, she said that it was very large.

On the way, T (riding in the passanger seat)noticed a bright light and it appeared to be dropping into the atmosphere. He said &#34;Oh my God, a bomb is dropping!&#34;. By the time I directed my attention to the object (only a split moment later), we were just coming to the top of a small hill, and at first, I thought it was a street light (it was the same color as a streetlight). I told T to stop pulling my leg, and then he said &#34;look!&#34; and the object was moving off to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued down the road, we seemed to be gaining on the object. We continued forward into a Publix parking lot(It was relatively empty, because it had just closed). At that point, the object was hovering right over the treeline (however many feet up is impossible to tell), and, if I were to guess, I&#39;d say it was close enough to see us. We were behind the grocery store looking at the object in amazement. We both stepped out of the car to get a better look, and the object seemed to be slowly getting closer. Me and my friend got a good look at the object: It was surrounded by a series of maybe 10 or 12 smaller lights (from what I remember, they were neon bluish), and in the middle of the circle there was a significantly bigger orangeish/red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object got closer and closer to us, untill there was no doubt in our minds that it wasn&#39;t hovering there by coincidence, it must have known we were almost right under it! After a few minutes of hovering, it took off in a blur. T and I were confused as to which direction it went in. Neither of us could agree as to which way it went, therefore, we had no clue as to which road to take to follow it. The craft made no noticeable noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a series of strange occurances that took place for a couple of weeks after the sighting, the first one being later that night/next morning:  I fell asleep at T&#39;s house that night. When I awoke (~5am) I jumped up in fright from the bean bag chair I fell asleep in, and quickly woke my friend. I didn&#39;t know why I was so worked up. I didn&#39;t recall any particularly scary dreams, in fact, I didn&#39;t recall any dreams at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later, I awoke to my door slamming shut (~11am). There was nobody home at the time, nor had there been for hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was undressing to take a shower, I looked at my back in the mirror and there were 2 sets 3 horizontal red lines on the back of my shoulders. One set for each side. I attempted to feel them, but couldn&#39;t. They were as smooth as my skin. There were no scabs or anything. I thought they may have been stretch marks, but from my experience with stretch marks, I have always been able to feel their indentation. they were evenly spaced and about 4 inches long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> T&#39;s father awoke to a slamming door at around 3am a few days after that. He didn&#39;t tell me about it untill I mentioned that it happened to me first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 months later, me and T were playing videogames. We heard a very strange noise outside his window, and the only way I could describe it was that it sounded painfull and somewhat like a bird and a human scream combined, but not overly loud. We both paused for a few moments, commented on the strangeness of the sound, and continued playing games. I soon went home, but before leaving, Me and T investigated his backyard to see if we could find what made the noise. We found nothing, and I went home that night. The next day T said he had the same marks I had. His brother M said that he awoke to something scurrying around the room when his 1 year old was crying. M thought it was a ghost. I never saw T&#39;s marks, cause they healed in like 2 days, where mine took over a weak, so I never got to compare the marks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

There was no moon and few stars that I could see. I came inside to get my camera [a simple Kodak CX4200] and snapped a picture of them.  [I remember having to hold the camera high to get the shot]. I didn&#39;t get a good shot, as the 3 lights were very faint in the photo so I saved it in my files to check out later. [Planets &#34;line up&#34; all the time]. I found this picture the other day when cleaning out my files, cropped it some, and used my &#34;brighten/contrast&#34; feature from the camera software to bring out the 3 lights, deleting the original almost &#34;black&#34; photo. The 3 horizontal lights at the bottom now looked bright red, and then there were horizontal &#34;Y&#34;s that seemed to be linked by the tails, and 4 red lights at the top right side of the formation lined up at an angle that I didn&#39;t see that night. Also, on the right inside light there seems to be a red dot next to it. [I don&#39;t think we can photograph &#34;moons&#34; of distant planets with cheap digital cameras!].  Just an interesting shot, though, and wish I&#39;d gone back out later to check on it but didn&#39;t think it was anything spectacular. Maybe my software changed the colors unjustly; but there&#39;s no doubting the odd formation, even in a legitmate constellation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

BOURNEMOUTH, UK<n> <n><n> <n><n> dont know if this will be of any interest to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been fasinated by the subject of U.F.O.s since i was a small child, im 24 now. Around october time of 2003 i happened to have a sighting. It was probably around 9pm -9:30. I was walking back from the shops to the block of flats where i lived with my mother at the time, when an egg shaped object flew above me. It moved without sound, point forwards, with a tail of light (maybe as long as the craft itself), south-east-south over the road and disapeared above the flats where i lived. There are a number of variables that make this sighting hard to describe. Its speed, i suppose, could be comparable to the speed of a jet plane when viewed from the ground, namely very slow but if this thing was flying at the same height as a plane then it was about the size of a football feild. You see the problem. If i make a guess at size, speed, or altitude then all other factors have to change accordingly. Added to this is the fact that it happened two years ago and it was a clear night (no clouds = no frame of referance). If i had to guess though i would say it was moving at around ten miles an hour and was the size of a school bus, maybe 75ft high. My second problem is in actualy describing the object itself. As i have already said it was egg shapped flying silently point forwards with a tail of light following behind it. It was the way it was lit that is hard to describe. It was seemingly lit from with, white/orange and white/yellow but it was not transparent. Maybe a better description would be than it seemed to be superheated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its my opinion that most of us, even those who want to believe are completely grounded in reality and not realy well equiped to deal with events dubbed paranormal. I dont mean to say that we panic but that we have a hard time with acceptance. maybe thats just me. As a result i have spent the last two years half doubting what i saw. You have to wonder how many people experience such things yet dont report them out of just such scepticism or fear of ridicule. Luckily i have faced no ridicule but i have faced incredulity from the people i have told. I cant blame them for this, i doubted myself after all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning came like a wakeupcall. What i saw was no conventional aircraft, it was not swampgass, venus, or streetlight reflecting of duck buts and pardon the expression but if that was a comet or meteor then we would all be fucked right now. What i saw was something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the spirit of exploration i have spent this morning surfing the net trying to find similar accounts. Incidently my mother is going to go nuts. I can see another phone bill coming in with £90 internet charges this quarter. Still im the one that has to pay them. Anyway. Back to the story. I came across this report: Occurred : 4/9/2004 21:37 (Entered as : 04/09/2004 21:37) Reported: 4/11/2004 11:17:44 PM 23:17 Posted: 4/27/2004 Location: Not Given (Canada), ON Shape: Egg Duration:Approx: 20 seconds Egg shaped (dark orange on inside, light orange/yellow on outside).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shape of objects: egg shaped (dark orange on inside, light orange/yellow on outside) Full Description of event/sighting: (name deleted - second witness) and I were sitting outside talking. I looked up into the sky towards the Big Dipper and noticed around 10-15 glowing objects moving at a fluent pace in a unorganized &#39;V&#39; shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I noticed the objects, I had enough time to tell (name deleted) after stuttering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Name deleted) looked in the direction that I was pointing to and jumped up and walked over to the fence, where we both watched the objects disappear moving North. These egg shaped objects in an orange/yellow glow were moving too fast and were too close together to be regular aircrafts. There was no sound at all and no flashing lights to indicate it was man-made. We were hesitant to contact you, but after viewing pictures in the &#34;Newbury, Ontario Egg Shaped Objects- photos&#34; link placed on your website after sketching our own drawings we were stunned that the photos taken were similar to our own interpretations. The sighting took place around 9:37 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday, April 9, 2004. We both came in and did our own rough sketches that are signed and dated.

Since then i have figured out by reading other peoples reports thatthis type of ship changes color according to the speed it is flying. At high speeds it appears to be a dark red. This fades to orange and then yellow as it slows down. (my sighting was mostly yellow which fits in with the slow speed)<n>

I had just sat down when i saw something out of the corner of my eye from the window. I jumped off the couch and looked out the window. I only had like seven seconds to see it but it was huge! It was a diamond shape and it had lights on each corner. I think it also had another light in the middle but i am not positive. It was huge though and it was fast. It flew over my house exstreamly quickly. Way quicker than any plane I have ever seen and with my father being retiered Air Force i knew my planes. I also knew that there is no planes or jets that regularly fly over my house. I am not a scientist so I cannot determine the hight or exact speed or size it was but i know it was huge and fast. I have seen a UFO on a previous occasion but it was not as close or as big as the one i just saw. After I lost sight of the craft I ran back into my dad&#39;s study and told him what I saw. He did not believe me but he said he had heard something like a sonic boom but not quiet the same. It was very amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The pulsating light was the center light and it did not have the configuration of conventional aircraft with red and green &#39;running lights&#39; on each side.  I watched it go northwest then it seemed to stop for a short time then veer to the left,then again stopped and came back to the northeast and I watched and listened for a noise of engines for conventional aircraft. There was none. I know what heliocopters sound like and jet engines and propeller driven planes-nothing!  No sound was heard and I watch this object go back in forth over my area for over an hour.  It kept going back and forth over the area and then close to an Aerostat balloon that is here and is supposed to be a restricted airspace around it and it should have been close enough at that point to have heard any sort of engine sound but there was no sound coming from the pulsating light at all.  It was 7:30pm (19:30hours) when I started watching this light and 8:30 when I went inside my  house. It was still moving back and forth in the area where I live and I tried to find the phone number of the Air Traffic Control tower of the military installation that I live near but had no luck finding any information.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Said Canyon has an elevation differential of about 5500 feet with steep grades and sheer vertical cliffs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thru Fossil Creek Canyon exists the Child Electrical Power generating camp consisting of maybe 10 structures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the return trip to Strawberry, we passed said power station and ascended upon dirt roads that winded on the southerly edge of the Canyon. I would estimate that about half way up this Canyon we noticed that on the northerly edge of the Canyon that an oscillating light that changed colors emanated from a portion of the Canyon that is unaccessible to vehicles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was visible to the naked eye, but nothing more.  We stopped the vehicle and I would estimate that at a 1-2 mile range I scoped the light with high power scope on my rifle and was able to see much more detail.  When viewing this light with my scope I was able to make out a disk shaped saucer with &#34;windows&#34; and a &#34;door&#34; with &#34;steps&#34;.  Said object had two &#34;legs&#34; that emanated from either side of the object.  A portion of the object was obstructed by shrubs. These shrubs moved, although there was no wind from the position in which I observer said object. From our position and vantage point we were able to at lenghty time and measure observe the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strawberry, Arizona is located about 19 miles north of Payson and about 60 miles west of Heber, Overgaard. The commonality between these three location is the Mogollon Rim, Fossil Creek Canyon is at the root of the rim that has elevation of about 9000 feet in places. The other interesting items that surround this area is the fact that the famous movie &#34;Fire in the Sky&#34; was based upon an incident about 45 miles West of this sighting.  I had at the time told some people in the Town of Payson about this occurence and was surprised by some of the responses I received.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once response was that of one of the Electrical workers at the Child Plant that confided in my Father in law that this was a regular occurence and that has had his vehicle and watch stop due to &#34;craft&#34; flying overhead in this same Canyon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another response that surprised me was that of a Town of Payson employee that also confided in me that in his youth he worked on a Logging crew and coincidently happened to work that night of the dissapearence of person in the &#34;Fire in the Sky&#34; movie.  He told me that that night the Forest had a green aura and a hum that filled the air.  He also stated that he had heard other stories similar to mine from that area where I had seen this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My backround is that of a Civil Engineer and Surveyor with approximately 14 years of experience. I served 6 years with the United States Air Force as a Civil Engineering Specialist and have been deyployed worldwide in said capacity.  I currently work as a Survey analyst and Geomatician at a private Civil Engineering Company.  My Father in Law has been a successful Construction Contractor for at least the last 30 years and is still building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no clue to the whereabouts of my then brother in law and his backround was in maintenance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

After reading many of the reports on your sight specifically where lights in the sky are concerned, I thought you might be intrested in hearing about the Watersmeet Mystery Light. Though not considered a UFO this occurance is considered a Ghost Light that seems very simmilar to many of your reported UFO lights. The Mystery Light is located 11 miles north of Watersmeet Michigan on an abandonded railroad grade, in the middle of the National Forest. First reported in the 1940&#39;s this strange light appears on a nightly basis From sundown till dawn.This light comes and goes as if to have a mind of its own. The light has been seen above and within the tree line, I have seen the light change from white to red numerous times. I live in the Chicago area and have visited this sight on many summer trips to the upper penninsula of Michigan.There are other areas in the U.S. where similar sightings are observed Marfa,Texas / Gurdon Arkansas / The White Mountains in North Carolina. I am entering this information as a possible explanation for some of reported sightings of strange lights in your files. There is one problem: These Mystery Lights ( though easy to witness ) are also unexplained.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up and saw an offwhite type of object that appeared to be slim. It was pretty far up.  The object was moving when I saw it and then stopped in mid air.  My daughter then pointed out another object and my other daughter also saw one for a total of 3.  I have no idea what they were, but I&#39;ve never seen an object move that fast and then stop and come to a hover.  A moment later, there was a bright flash and the object that I originally saw was gone followed by two more flashes in sequence and the other two objects were gone.  My daughters immediately felt as if the flash was some type of communication between the objects as they happened in sequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the year of the sighting is 2003, and we have amended the date above.

Very high up there was a bright silver spherical object (the size to the eye as a BB held at hands distance.) We obseved this for about 10 minutes, durig which the object would move in any direction almost instantaneously by the distance of about 1 to 2 hand-widths at arms length. Several people had large cameras observing the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> during this time some commercial jets crossed across the sky, as the object stayed in roughly the same area of sky moving from pace to place. I would have to guess altitude of 60,000+ feet considering we travelled 20 miles of highway where hundreds of behicals were pulled over looking up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never figured out why anyone ever noticed it at first, but whatever the reason it eventially spaked hindreds of vehicals to pull over and look up for at least 1/2 to 1 hr (the time I estimate it took for that much trafic to decide to pull over).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There obviuosly was no noise, and it definitely was not a balloon, as a balloon would drift in a common direction with the wind, and would not be visible for a stretch of highway 20 miles in length.

Sometimes one would fly away from the others.  It was very hard to determine the distance.  At one point, a few flew below the cloud base but still appeard as an oval illumination, fuzzy rather than a well-defined light.

I always watch the sky as there are no outside lights around our home and star gazing is very good.  I watched this object sort of hover or &#34;wobble&#34; in the eastern sky.  There was a 1/4 moon and clear skies with no fog/haze.  The object flashed blue, green, red, and orange.  Altitude was probably 25-30,000 feet as I also watched 1 jet flying south in the west at what looked like the same altitude.  I watched it for 20 minutes then went back in the house to get the binoculars.  The object was too far away to discern any details.  Tried to get a picture with my digital camera but was unable to hold the camera steady enough for the exposure.  The object started moving slowly toward the south then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/15/03 00:00|Moe (Australia)||Light|5 mins|a moving object seen in the distant stars|3/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35078.html|247|ndxe200311| Object appeared just below the Big Dipper. Colors were red,yellow,green and blue.  Seemed to descend as we watched it.  Began to ascend after about 20 minutes.  I watched it through my telescope until 00:30.  As it ascended it left a flume or wake behind.  It eventually stopped and was in the shape of a ball with low burning lights pulsing from it.  More objects have begun to appear over the last week.  Last night, my friend and I counted six objects, all with the same colors, red,green,blue and red.  There was one object located on each side of the Big Dipper, both seemed to be on the same parallel.  There were also four obejcts in the western sky.  One of the objects near the Big Dipper was in the shape of a triangle.  As these objects ascended, they took the shape of a ball, with low burning lights pulsing from it.  It almost seems that each comes to a rest as if they are awaiting orders to move.  I was reluctant to file the first report but with so many last night and the fact they have been present almost every night since the first sighting, I felt this was the right thing to do.  The witnesses to these events has been myself and two different neighbors.  I tried to photograph one of the objects but it was too far away.  I know this is not something from this world as no sound has ever been heard and they are very distinct in the heavens due to their brilliant collors and pulsing lights.  It would seem to me that you all should have the ability to see these lights due to their distance from the earth and appearing in the same general area nightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/15/03|Selcuk (Turkey)||Diamond|2 HOURS|FLOATING  LIKE A CHURCH FLASHING RED.LIKE LIGHTENING. COM&#304;NG FROM 3 SIDES.SEEN SAME FOR 3 NIGHTS.CAUGHT ON VIDEO CAMERA.FRENDS CAL|11/26/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33181.html|248|ndxe200311| bright white light shot down below treeline<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 9:00 PM when my girlfriend and I was walking out of her house, she lives on the country part of Lake Butler.  There was no street lights or any sign of reflective light, so the sky was very visable. Leaving her door as she walked with me toward my car I had this feeling of something was going to happen, I always watched UFO doc on Travel&amp;Sci fi so I always been excited about seeing one, but never really wanted to. We are walking and as I keep looking in all the sky in all directions in good detail I see nothing. As I mentally let it go in my head I sat in my car saying my final words and starting my enginge, I happen to oddly glace behind behind her staring into a sky seeing a bright light, not LARGE but bigger than a start fall straight down below the treeline. Shocked by this I still wasnt certain if this was a falling star ( which I believe does not fall straight down that far)so I kinda freaked out wondering, &#39; what was that?!&#39; My girlfriend pondered but knew I was not kidding from my expression so I asked her to go inside and drive down her long driveway because its very very dark, and you have to open and close the gate.  So we went back inside grabbed her keys then walked back outside.  While walking back to my car we searched the woods where I showed it went straight down.  As we kept walking the woods would be clear from walking between the trees in the distance, therefore a BRIGHT white light would appear every 10-15 steps. The whole time I&#39;d say walking to my car we each saw the light in the woods 3 times.  My girlfriend became very uncomftable. I inquired why she was, she replied &#39; My whole time living here I&#39;ve never seen a light like that there night or day.&#39; we hurried to our vehicles and I left her house in a hurry.  As I got home she quickly called my cell saying &#39; when I was driving back I saw that same light just above the tree line move from an upper-right point all the way to the lower-right point she said it was as fast as an old clock tick. She was ve! ry very scared and I assured her it was okay that it would go away. That night lets say I couldnt sleep very well, I waited to the sun came up to go back to sleep. Early tonight she has called (11/15/03) and says something very bright is still in the sky, larger than a star in the spot she believed I saw it in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh during this whole time it made no sound, I would believed this was not an ufo except from what I saw walking by looking into the woods and what my girlfriend swore she saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/14/03 23:34|La Canada Flintridge|CA|Other|8 minutes|didnt see object very well but saw a HUGE amazing yellow light covering my WHOLE window and saw only one of its lights from the object|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49748.html|249|ndxe200311| flashes and power failure in florida<n> <n><n> <n><n> While relaxing on a clear evening sipping a cup of coffee, I was gazing almost straight up into the sky when I saw what appeared to be a white flash...The flash dwarfed any of the stars in the sky and was obviously not an airplane headlight.  A few seconds later, a smaller, less intense flash appeared about 2 degrees to the left of where the original flash had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I probably would not have given the incident a second thought, except that later that night (about 4:00 am) I observed what appeared to be a helicopter approaching my car.  When the aircraft was almost directly overhead, the headlights on the car went dead.  I was not able to get them to come back on until after the aircraft was out of sight (about 15 seconds).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was about 1000 feet up and the flashing red lights were about 50 ft. below the bright white light.  The craft was traveling right above I4 approx. 50-60 mph without making any noise.  The sky was quickly cluttered with planes and jets.  As one jet approached the light, the light quickly accelerated and was out of sight in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Niles is a subburb of Youngstown, Ohio. Jamie is a legal secretary by profession and single.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Novemeber 14th, 2003 between 5:30-6:45 pm Jamie took one of her dogs for a walk.  This is rountine for her every day after work.  She has two dogs and walks one at a time.  She takes a path down from her home to Lincoln Elementary School.  There is a small wooded area in a field that is off to the side of the school.  Its about a 10 minute walk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this day she happened to notice two lights in the sky above the trees.  She described the lights as grayish-blue in color.  One was round and one was more oblong in shape.  When asked if she thought these were just lights or if they could be solid objects, Jamie expressed she felt these were &#34;objects&#34; rather then lights.  She first thought they may be search lights or spot lights or even planes but then noticed they did not have a beam from which light could radiate nor were there any sounds of engines.  The shape of these objects could be seen though the thin clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first Jamie stopped and watched as these objects would come close together and then move away from each other.  She felt as if they may of been playing tag. At one point she thought they were going to crash into each other.  I asked if there were military planes in the area on a regular basisthat  did maneuvers?  She said that,yes, there were but she knew what they looked like and could hear the sounds of the engines.  The color of the plane lights were also totally different from what she saw.  She said that she finally stopped watching the objects and began to walk her dog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She immediately noticed that the objects began to slowly follow along about 30 feet away and about 50 feet above the tree line and behind the clouds.  As she walked they kept pace.  She got to the end of her walk and came back with the objects still keeping up with her.  She did not mention how the objects turned to follow her back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When Jamie got to the house the objects seemed to &#34;park&#34; themselves above a weeping willow tree in the side of her yard.  This tree is about 40 feet from the house and about 60 feet tall. The objects hovered about 50 feet above the tree.  Jamie said she ran into the house and began crying.  When she explained to her family what had just taken place, all 5 members of her family went out and looked up at the objects still hovering above the willow.  Jamie explained these objects were there before she went out and was gone by 8 pm so she speculates they had to to be there for at least two and half hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jamie went on to state that she and her parents decided to walk the second dog to see what would happen.  As soon as they stepped out the objects took up postion above the tree line once more and began to follow along.  The pattern was repeated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: There was no adverse reaction from the dogs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once back to the house the lights again took up &#34;sentry&#34; watch over the willow tree.  By now the parents were also frightened and they called the Niles City Police to report what was going on.  The dispatcher said they would send an officer out to investigate but no one ever showed up. Jamie said her father did ask if spot lights were being used in the area where they lived and the repsonse was &#34;not to our knowledge.&#34; Family members would ocasionally check to see if lights were still over the willow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point Jamie says she went to the National UFO Reporting Center website and began to send in the report while the objects still hovered over the tree.  No one saw the objects leave the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five days later on Novemever 19th around 7:30 pm, Jamie was getting ready to walk her dogs.  When she went outside the one round grayish-blue object was back.  Jamie and her mother walked the dog.  They took the same path but this time went to the left side of the school and back around to see if the object would follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object kept pace even going around the building with them.  By now there was no tree line so the object stayed behind the clouds.  Jamie stated the object would jump from one cloud to the next without coming into open space in the sky as if it wanted to stay concealed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time Jamie called the news room of the Tribune Chronicle in Warren, Ohio. The gentleman who answered asked about the object in ths sky and said he would check witht he weatherman to see if anything unusual was going on with the weather.  He did not call back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Comments: Jamie sounded to be a credible witness and while speaking to me by phone she would ask her parents who were in the background several questions.  I could hear their respones to the questions.  We have multible witnesses to these sightings.  No one could supply an answer to what the objects/lights could have been.  The dispatcher stated no spot lights were being used at the time.  Military aircarft exercises could be ruled out for the fact that these objects stood staionary for long periods of time and seemed to leave their positions over the trees to follow witnesses. Even if it was search lights or spot lights, I do not believe they would have hovered for long periods of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional notes: I called Jamie&#39;s residence again on December 20th to find out if the relative at the airport would speak to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time Jamie&#39;s mother answered the phone.  She said that her brother who works at the airport did not have addtional information pertinent to the case.  She also expressed how frighted her and the family were during the time the objects were present.  She stated that she and Jamie both felt that they were being &#34;watched&#34; by these objects.  She went on to say that Jamie stated to her that the hair on the back of her neck stood up as they walked the dogs as if someone was staring at them from behind. Jamie&#39;s mother also stated that Jamie had forgot to tell me that when Jamie went to the bathroom window to look out, one of the objects seemed to sense her presence and moved quickly to an evergreen tree about 20 feet from the bathroom window and hovered there about 50 feet above that tree. She says that Jamie got the distinct impression the light was trying to see into the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Niles City Police Dept. and asked about an incoming call made on the date in question.  I was told that no call was placed to the staion on that date about lights in the area.  I find it strange that the call was not on file.  The officer I spoke to was very dismissive of my call and acted like he did not have time to talk to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Filed 1/05/04 Donnie Blessing Southern Ohio Section Drector MUFON<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mrs. Donnie Blessing, and Ohio/MUFON, for following up on this report.

They did not make any sound, hovered and frequently criss crossed each other as well as taking seperate flight patterns of their own.  Both were first seen in a field hovering together until I began walking my dog in the field then they began to follow me all around the trail and continued to follow me up my yard to my house.  They hovered over my house until I came out with my other dog and my father and continued following us down the yard.  They appear to be looking or searching in a particular area, not straying far from the field.  Currently I am viewing airplanes going towards and near the area of this phenomenon, and the objects do not go away.  They are still hovering as I am typing this which has been now over an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background of observers:  We are a family of four adults and two school age children and we have all witnessed the above mentioned matter.  We have also notified the police but have not found out if they have gone out to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a relative that works at the Vienna Airport who has heard of sightings before, but we have yet to talk to him to see if anyone at the airport has reported the same sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were driving in the northern direction. We saw what appeared to be a very slow moving plane or a very large star. As we drove closer we realized it couldn&#39;t be either. Next, a helicopter came to mind. Though none of us had seen any helicoper with such a style and wing span. It was triangular and there we blue lights on the far sides and in the center a large white light ... accompanied by a small red light right below it. It stayed completely still until we drove past. At this time we looked behind us and saw it moving in our direction. We continued driving north in the direction of our homes. As we turned the last curve we saw it coming over the hill side. Later my friend reported that it disappeared shortly after she dropped me off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had just ran across that subject on the net and waas surprised  the first time I looked up at the sky and saw what I had just been reading about. There was only one other car at the park and I asked the lady in it if she had binoculars or camera, but she didn&#39;t. She got out of the car and as we observed the 3 planes apparently spraying, we noticed a small flash of light right at the junction of 2 trails, where the trails made a large X in the sky. The flash was only momentary and we couldn&#39;t perceive what it was, it seemingly ddisappeared.  We turned our backs on that spot to follow a certain plane as it was preparing to swing back around for another flight over the city.  Then we saw, at our left field of vision, a peculiar object. It seemed to rather glide, and it maitained a consistent altitude, and it came our direction.  I became rather frightened as it approached. It was not too far away, not so high. (I have difficulty estimating distance and altitude, as I&#39;ve never had a reason to do so before) At first I thought that whatever it was, it was the same thing as I&#39;d just seen, ie. that &#34;flash of light&#34;, though it may have been a totally different thing. As it got closer, I  could see that it appeared metallic silver, and it was perfectly spherical.  Also, completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it reached a point that was more or less in front of us I noticed that it seemed to be exuding a purple or violet haze.  I asked the lady with me if she could see the color, but she couldn&#39;t see it. I know that as an artist I am more sensitive to color that the average, non-artist.  The color was not solid, the substance seemed to be a vapor, a mist, or like a gas.  When it just about had made a complete 180 degree parade across our field of vision, it began to ascend, rather quickly, and straight upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occured on a relatively clear day. I don&#39;t use drugs or alcohol, and don&#39;t take any medicine that would interfer with perception. I can&#39;t speak for the other witness, but I did find out that she was a Christian also, and after this incident we were both frightend and we prayed together before leaving the park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two days later, over my house, I watched similar planes apparently spraying.  Another silver orb seemed to appear at the X mark of the trails.  This orb I saw through my binoculars and it was at a high altitude. I maintained sight of it for only about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported these incidents to the local Air Force Base, and to the local FAA district manager but no one wished to take a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were approx. 1/3 of a mile west of the Fairchild airport in Lincoln Park.  A wooded area that I always walk my dogs through. I grew up here in Port Angeles and have been in this park at least 100 times over the last 30 years. Also the runway at this airport is not large enough for what we heard. It was the sound of a large, (very large) aircraft.  I say aircraft because it sounded as though it was right on top of us, and my two dogs stopped in their tracks and began to crawl; something I&#39;ve never seen them do.  I have never been behind a jet engine as it decelerated or accelerated but I thought, actually I dont know what I thought. But I do know this: I did not hear anything prior or after the initial encounter, and it sounded as if steel was being drug across the asphalt. Similar to an excavator , or a cat when their bucket is drug across the roadway when doing road repairs,  Except this was a 100 times louder.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My house is high on a hill and my deck you can see the woods far away. I woke up, to get the door, since my mother in law went country line dancing and was returning home. Something had me look at the window in the family room and I noticed that something with Blue, Red, and White Lights was surveying (the only words I can use to describe how it was moving) the woods. The distance was about 5 to maybe 10 miles from my house, it was hovering over the wooded area just either circling or going back and forth. When it would move in the west direction, the lights red and blue would appear. Then when it returned movement back toward the east a bright white light would shine down, like it was surverying something. I noticed it first, then went upstairs and grabbed my mother in law, and we both went on the deck to watch this happen. It would not stop and there was no noise coming from the object. I watched it for about 10 minutes, then I noticed that another object was flying across the woods, and went in the west direction, this object was a solid red color, like a ball or something. Still watching the bigger object, another object that was white in color and long (cigar shape) went in the west direction as well. Both secondary objects disappeared from my view. It was weird.

It had bright red-green-blue-yellow lights,all seemingly to occur in some sequence. At one point a bright ball of light came from the object and descended into the woods and eventually disappeared.  I followed the object with my binoculars as it moved slowly to my left.  It moved in an &#34;up and down&#34; short pattern, yet still moving forward.  The lights changed to a red/white pulsing and the  flight pattern changed to a smooth pattern as it moved toward the north.  As the UFO moved between me and the light of the moon, I could see it from the backside and it appeared as a boom-a-rang shape.  It continued to move slowly until out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then it proceeded toward us and stopped again, then it went to the right of us and then darted out on an angle to the rear of the ship and came back into the rear of the ship and the whole time we were watching this lighted object I was telling it to come back don&#39;t be afraid, then it dissapeared right out of sight as quick as it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My grandaughter also went out, so there were 3 adults and 1 child watching this object high in the night sky. It seemed to have various lights on it-two were yellow and the third appeared to be a bluish tinted light. The cradt was definately not a helicopter, or an airplane as it made wide loops and then sudden &#39;jumps&#39; straight up and then moments later straight downward. It would stop suddenly and hover and seem to spin, revealing a change in the lighting. At these points when it would stop-it almost appeared cylinderical, however it was difficult to see the actual shape as it&#39;s altitude was rather high. We could also see to the South east planes on their takeoff pattern from Seatac. The planes elevation was at least 2 - 4 thousand feet lower than the craft we were all observing. We were transfixed with the object. I then remembered your web site as I heard it on George Noory&#39;s Coast to Coast AM radio show. While my family continued to observe. I found your website and asked my husband to report it, however, I beleive he was a bit nervouse and left out a little information, that is why I called again and left a seconf message.We are interested if anyone else in the Kitsap County, Pierce County, or King County areas may have reported somthing similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So smoothly it was very strange. We didn&#39;t see what happened after that. I hurried up &amp; drove into our garage. When we got in the house, we looked outside to see one object bigger &amp; closer to our house now. We could actually see lights colored red &amp; green going around in a circle. This is the 4th time I have seen these lights. Nobody believed me until this night. The other 3 times It is always 4 lights in the same spot on the horizon, low &amp; in the south south west.

I was letting my dog outside and I noticed a bright light to the south. It was still dark outside at this time. At first I thought it was a plane but it was not on a normal flight path. I know this because I watch the sky quite often. Also it was moving too slow to be a plane. After about 30 seconds of watching this light move to the north I decided to get my camcorder. I began to record and as I zoomed in I was shocked. There were three bright lights in the shape of a triangle. I taped it for about 30 seconds before my battery went dead. I have watched this tape a dozen times and can see the faint outline of the triangle. Unfortunatly it is on a actual hi-fi mini tape and I cannot zoom in on the object.

I had gone to bed early and had awoke to get a drink of water and to check on the candle which I had lit earlier. I had walked over to the balcony and notice a series of bright lights over the water maybe about 150 feet. The object looked either triangle or egg shaped with the small end at the top. I woke my husband up, because it was so unusual, because it was not that far above the water. I decided to lie down and watch it, and it appeared to be, imitating my candle on the coffee table, with the changing of colors, so ((name deleted)) my husband suggested I blow out the candle, which I did, but the colors continued to change but much differently this time. I went back to bed but lined my body in such a way that I could size up if it moved by the lines on the balcony windows, It stay positionary for 3 hours, only one time moving unbelievably fast straight up and back down. After that it appeared to have 3 smaller lights move towards it, and just as they disappeared in it, it light up on the my right side with a bright orange color which reflected off the clouds. It appeared to stay in front of the clouds because I could see it at all times. Then again 3 smaller lights that would have appeared to be stars, again moved slowly towards it, and appeared to melt into this thing, again sending off a bright orange color on my right, illuminating the sky this time. Then it suddenly disappeared, I watched every night afterwards and nothing at all, no lights even close to that what I had seen, this thing was very bright, it didn&#39;t move except that once, and it had lights flashing into different colors. Believe it or not I had a feeling come over me that it wanted me to see it, maybe it was just my imagination, but I was unbelievably calm. I also forgot to say that it did emit some beams from below this thing, like it might have been looking at t! he water or something.<n>

It was too high to be a helicopter and too low to be a star.  (I am also a pilot so I am 100% sure it was not a plane or helicopter.  The object was pulsating a greenish hue with a red flashing light similar to a strobe on the bottom of the cone.  I obtained video and still pictures (not developed yet) of this object. It hovered and pulsated for at least one hour, and then disapearred in less than one second in an upward motion.  It was very clearly a cone shape, as I also viewed it with high-powered binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am posting this only  because I need to tell someone and do not know who to ask about it. Around 10pm I was out on my deck. As far as the background, the sky was off &amp; on cloudy and the moon almost full. I have to call the shape of this thing serpentine, like 1 &amp; 1/2 letter &#34;S&#34;s, and because it moved snake-like as it went across the sky at a good speed. Definitely was no type of airplane, helicopter or blimp. There were approximately 10 windows lit up. I cannot imagine how any kind of &#34;weather balloon&#34; or kite could travel in this pattern while the windows maintained level throughout the entire path like it did. I have never seen or heard of anything like this. Please tell me if anyone else has.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have seen very bright, red objects slowly gliding through the nights sky (approx 2000 ft), to slow to be human.  These objects have a very bright white light that seems to orbit around them, clearly giving them a disc shape.  They will move across the sky slowly, sometimes then shoot of into the stars, sometimes stop completely, sometimes manuever in a different directions.  Lately ( the last week), every night I have noticed a couple ufo&#39;s in the same spot that to the naked eye appear to be VERY bright twinkling stars, but when further observing, I looked through binoculars, and was AMAZED at what I saw; Clearly, they where white/yellow objects hovering/still in the sky with BLUE, GREEN, RED, White, etc.  lights flashing all around.  They are clear as day that they are within our atmosphere, and obviously some type of space craft.  They are fascinating to watch, and I told my friends who didn&#39;t believe me at the time, but I showed them as well, and they are now shocked and amazed that they actually are there!  I believe they may be watching/observing, and that them BLENDING in with the stars, is actually a form of CAMOFLAUGE for lack of better words, and this is how they stay virtually are unseen by most.  I am getting a telescope this weekend, and I will take pictures and send them in, but until then all I can say is LOOK CLOSER.  I would also very much like to know if there are others in Maine that can say they have seen something similiar, or any ufos for that matter.  I will soon get back to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that &#34;twinkling&#34; stars are, indeed, the cause of the sightings.  PD))<n>

Normally I would cut across at AR 14 or take US 412 east to I-55, but decided to go north on Rt 67.  At 6:30 pm with the sun being down and with no &#34;light pollution&#34;, I decided that the drive might yield a look at the solar flare via the Northern Lights even at this southerly latitude.  I believe I did see the northern lights or some reflection of the solar flare off of the ice cap.  However I saw some very bright white clouds that appeared to change shape and brightness, unlike the northen lights which danced around these clouds did not change shape or move as rapidly as the northern lights.   The clouds whiteness intensified several times and could be easily masked by the lights in a town or a yard light on the farm.  I had observed several times a changing light(s) colored red, then green, then blue then an intense whitish-blue color.  This light and several others were very slow moving, but nonetheless moved and always disappeared when reaching the large Fertilzer barn facilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Something caught my eye that at first glance looked like a street lamp from atop one of those long poles. However, when I looked again, I realized it was not attached to any pole, so I looked very closely at this object. It was suspended in the air - not moving. So immediately I began to see if it were a blimp. It was not. It was gigantic. It was a metallic dark blue on the top two thirds of it with black gigantic rectangular picture type windows on it where the narrow part of the rectangle was at the top and the long part was down the sides insetted into the craft a bit. The bottom one-third of it was a silverish-grey color with no markings. The object was shaped similar to a street lamp and tilted down slightly toward the ground. It was about a mile off the ground, but seven miles from my location. It was huge. Everyone on highway 580 must have seen it.  I drove my car to an area to so that I could view it better which was about three minutes later, I saw what appeared to be this craft &#39;shimmer&#39; for a second and disappear right there in mid air. No movement was recorded and no sound was noticed at this great distance. I drove to the nearby airport to see if there were any blimps of that kind in and around that area and viewed none. I drove a distance of seven miles looking for this craft, to no avail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I got home I came in to the house and went to tell my sister about it we looked out the window to compare its brightness to a stars and we saw three very bright red lights in a horizontal line it appeared to be just behind the trees behind our house and we shouted to our mom to come see after see got there it stayed it the exact same position for about 15 seconds, this sighting was about 1 min. after the first, also it took a object about 2.75 in. across to cover up all three lights it also appeared to be about 10º above the horizon this time. After this my sister and I ran out behind our house to get a better look at it so we ran out about 100ft. from the back of our house and again about 1 min. later we saw about 5 lights arranged in a circular shape this time it appeared to be about .75 in. at arms length we saw it for about 15 sec. then it vanished. In all these sightings there were no stars visible between the lights and there was no sound at all and there was also no abnormal animal activity. The second sighting it appeared to have traveled north a fair distance across a 5 mph W to E wind, the third sighting it was again further south.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After further discussion, two of the other students saw it as well. We believe that it was a UFO because of its flying nature and odd shape that didn&#39;t look like a plane. It had a definate haze around it, but one could make out three standout areas that were more luminous. It was like a triangle, but one that is very long and not very high, almost like a semi circle with ends.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It definitely had a green color to it but didn&#39;t seem to have a tail or anything. It was big and did not seem to get smaller as it went down.It lasted about 4-5 seconds before going out of my view behind some trees. I would estimate that it was about 10 - 15 miles away. I live near Tyndall AFB and called our local sherrif dept. to report. They called the Coast Guard who called me back and questioned me. They were going to check with Tyndall and see if they had anything going on, he did say that the green color was unusual for flares. Of course, I&#39;m sure there will be a good explanation for this as usual!!<n>
11/11/03 20:50|Paddock Lake|WI|Sphere|2 seconds|Silvery sphere, glowing white, headed southwest very quickly from Paddock Lake, Wisconsin|11/26/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33022.html|295|ndxe200311| Low, slow, nealy silent delta wing &#39;airliner.&#39;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location:  Suburban Philadelphia, PA USA  Environment:  Mostly clear sky, after sundown, light breeze  Witnesses:  (2) Male - 25, Male - 55  Aircraft:  One triangular/delta wing shaped object of airliner size at an altitude of not greater than 800 ft (more likely below 500 ft) making very little noise and traveling very slowly (150MPH estimated).<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Shape- Triangular in shape, although not a &#39;triangle.&#39;  The outline was distinctly a delta wing configuration and there was a clearly visible fuselage.  The best example of the shape is the old F16 Delta Wing concept.  No rear mounted horizontal stabilizers and a clean, straight trailing edge to the main wing.  No forward mounted horizontal stabilizers were visible either.  Two vertical stabilizers were visible, ruling out many possible aircraft types that fit the &#39;basic&#39; shape (B2, etc).  The total wingspan of the &#39;delta wing&#39; was longer than the totall length of the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Lighting- Very familiar lighting pattern.  Red, white, and blue lights on the wing, nose, wing, respectively, as one would see on a normal airliner, but the lights were in the wrong places.  The wing tip lights were &#39;too far back&#39; to denote a typical airliner.  No other visible running lights.  No strobe effect or color changes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Size- Large.  737 size at least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Position- Altitude between 500 ft and 800 ft AGL.  Traveling from ENE to WSW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Speed- Very, very slow.  Best guess is between 150-200MPH - if that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Sound- Astonishingly quiet.  The exhaust note was more similar to a constant gust of wind than a jet engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of Event:  Standing outside home talking.  During the converasation, the lights of an &#39;airliner&#39; were visible approaching from over the roof of the house across the street.  Initially, the size, speed and altitude through me off.  The aircraft traveled in our direction, although very slowly.  As it came nearer, its outline was visible against the stars and moonlight.  The aircraft resembled a typical airliner in lighting patterns only - and only at a distance.  It was apparent when the aircraft flew overhead that the lights were in the wrong positions as the wingtip running lights were at the trailing edge of the aircraft - too far back.  The delta wing shape became visible at roughly the same time, which sparked my interest as I moved a few feet down the driveway to keep the aircraft in view longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other obervations made during this time (~30 seconds from initial view to passing over house) were the flight charectaristics.  The altitude of the aircraft was very abnormal for my area.  Philadelphia Int&#39;l airport does not have traffic patterns over my area and even if they did, an approaching aircraft would still be well above 10,000 feet as the airport is a good 45 miles away.  The local NAS operates mostly C130&#39;s, A10&#39;s, and the occassional F18.  The altitude of the aircraft was almost enough to make me duck - it appeared that the aircraft would be landing no more than 1000 yards away based on this as well as the speed.  The speed again reinforced the idea that the aircraft was landing somewhere very close by.  At rougly 150 odd MPH, you would expect an airliner size aircraft to be seconds away from touchdown, full flaps, etc.  Except this aircraft kept on going straight and level until it disappeared from view over treetops 500 yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound was the last abnormal charectaristic of the aircraft - there really wasnt any.  The aircraft engines sounded more like a sustained gust of wind than a jet or prop engine.  At that alitude, one would expect even a civilian airliner to drown out the conversation, let alone a military aircraft, but the aircraft was so quiet that we were able to speak to eachother while observing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reason for reporting: Was advised to do so.  There is no single aspect that stands out about this aircraft - but the sum of all the aspects made this an interesting experience.  The combination of &#39;way&#39; too low, &#39;way&#39; too slow, &#39;way&#39; too quiet, and shaped like the old British Avro Vulcan were enough for me to question what, exactly, the aircraft was because I know of no civilian or military aircraft that exibits this combination of charectaristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then it returned to its previous size and gradually began to get lower in the sky until it was below the treeline near me and I could not see it anymore.

The craft was a combination of a barrel and teardrop shape. Several colors shining very bright. The craft climbed at a very slow rate. Slower than any plane with out stalling in flight. This craft had very distintive colors red, blue, white, yellow or amber. The reason I noticed it was the lights where shining so bright and the absences of sound. I could hear birds calling and also see other commercial aircraft in the same area just at much higher elevation. At first the craft was at tree top elevation. I was talking on the phone at the time of the sighting and noticed a failure in the cordless phone to a cellular connection. This craft elevated at a very gradual rate at the same angle of acent about 75 degrees. This craft was not the average. I have lived on several Military Bases around the World and this was byfar the best design I have seen to date. This would include any Stelth 111 or even the SR-71. The ability to see this craft for at least a half an hour climbing at a steady rate up wards and still be able to see the changing colors of the lights in full day light at a distance of some 50,000 feet is incredible. I gage my distances by the tree top elevation when I first saw it to the elevation I saw the Commercial Aircraft to the elevation of the High Cerrious Clouds it went up into.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two identical reports from two different witnesses.

But just shortly after I noticed it, it stopped moving, started moving fast in opposite direction and then back the original direction, very slow this time yet noticable. It didn&#39;t flicker as much either, it became a steady light. That definitely caught my attention. Two jetliners passed in the sky and they didn&#39;t look anything like this object. The jetliners also flew lower than this object, excluding the possibility it was a distant helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was staring at this object for a long time, making sure I wasn&#39;t looking at a planet, star or a &#39;roid. It was much brighter than any object, except for the moon and those jetliners. It appeared the light was not generated though, but rather a reflection from a spherical object - maybe caused by the bright moon. The reflection was brightest in the direction of the moon and then faded away sharply around a sphere-like edge - a faint crescent similar to a 1% new moon, with a bright spot like that sometimes seen with a solar eclipse. The color at its brightest spot was an off-white/yellow. The crescent was darker, almost turning into a dark red before it completely faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crescent, albeit faint, was rather large. About half the size of an actual crescent moon, which kind of dazzled me because this object must have been rather large if it were fully exposed. That really convinced me it couldn&#39;t have been a planet or star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside because it was getting too cold for me, but when I came back outside about 1 1/2 hour later out of curiosity, it was gone. Spent a good long time staring at it though and it certainly got me amazed!<n>

The Sun had gone down and the Moon was on the rise it was very bright that night. I had brought some glow sticks with me and I had tied them to the end of a 6&#39;string, a red one and one blue, one at each end. I started to swing the string with light on it in circles around me, going from big circle to small ones, I did that for about 10 min. or so and my friend did the same for about the same amount of time. We put the light sticks in my truck and we split up to do our own thing. I walked up to the top of a small hill thats was on the edge of the water, and when facing the water you would be facing South and if you turned 180 degrees you would be facing the volcano Mauna Loa and North. As I go to the top and looked up towards the volcano I saw what looked like a couple police lights (red and blue) come toward us very fast I watched them for a few min. trying to figure out what they were.  After afew min I ran over to one fo my friends who was just 50 yards down the hill from me and told him that I thought the Police were on there way over to see what we were up to. My friend said that maybe they think we were UFOs and that someone had probably seen us swinging thoughs lights around and called in. So I walked back up the hill to get a better look but the lights were gone. I looked back to the ocean for a few more min and when I turned back around I saw my other friend had gotten out the lights again and was swinging them around and instead of just two police lights there were now 10 police lights come from the mountain, as I watched in amazement more and and more light started apearing.  I ran back to my friend and told him he had to come see the lights.  We saw now 50 lights, forming a large circle about 200 yards away.  The three of us watched and I tried to videotape it but only got a few minutes.  It was nighttime and I couldn&#39;t tell if it ! was working,but I did get something.  I decided to walk towards the lights, swinging my light sticks around my head.  I got to within 50 yards and could see the lights moving in the trees.  It was very disconcerting.  I turned around and ran back to my friends and told them it was too scary, they had to come too.  We walked towards the lights, to within 20 yards and they appeared to take the shape of trucks backing out and pulling around.  One of my friends said, &#34;They&#39;re just trucks.&#34;  My other friend said, &#34;yes, they kind of look like trucks.&#34;  At that moment I turned around and heard a sound behind me, and when I turned back around my friends were gone, the lights were gone, and I was 1 1/2 miles from where I had been standing.  I looked at my watch and about 20 minutes had passed.  I was disoriented and could not remember where my truck was, so I just headed towards the water to find it.  When I got back my friends weren&#39;t there, so I went to the hill to see if I could see them, and waited for another 20 minutes or so before they appeared, coming from the opposite direction from where we had been.  When I ran down to them and asked them if they were trucks, they both said, &#34;They weren&#39;t trucks.&#34;  They had run into the middle of the lights and said the last thing they remembered was the lights swirling around them, and then they were 1 1/2 miles from where we were in the opposite direction from where I had gone.  We stuck around for another hour and the lights came and went, but never as many as the height of the experience.  I know I left out some stuff but that&#39;s basically it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had gone outside onto my patio which faces eastward and was observing the moon.  I then glanced up to Mars and saw it clearly.  But about 5-10 degrees from Mars toward South, (nearly in line with Mars) was a brighter object that immediately caught my attention.  My first thought was it was a star, but brighter, whiter, and larger than Mars, and so close to Mars, and I wondered what star is that?  It appeared stationary, and then in a second it pulsated, with the white light becoming brighter, more brilliant, then pulsated again, slightly dimming some of the brilliance, then pulsated-enlarging again, to even larger than my original sighting, and then in another second or so, it began to fade and then I was aware of its movement away (southward) and slightly upward, and it faded out to a pin light before disappearing from my view.  My observation from beginning to end was approximately fifteen-twenty seconds.  Except for a few clouds scattered in the eastern sky, the sky was completely clear in that direction, around and above the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was not within the normal airplane flight pattern, which I often observe evenings as planes go into Sacramento from the North, (I observe those to the North of my position) or other planes that fly over.  I have never observed a plane in that position.  I heard no sounds, except some ducks, and because of the geography here, sounds normally carry far, whether it be a plane or helicopter in the area, the train several miles away, or coyotes, or cattle.  I believe what I saw was not a normal aircraft of any kind.<n>

I saw 3 objets flying in a circle.  My first reaction was to think they were birds.  I quickly realized that was not the case.  They were much too high to be birds and at that altitude, birds could not be seen.  They were moving in a counter-clockwise rotation in a circle and silver in color.  Their path was not perfect or even eliptical.  They moved in an erratic motion going closer and farther from the center of the circle.  One moved away from the rest to the West and then disappeared.  The second one did the same.  The third one moved in the same direction, but went much slower and slowly faded out.  About 30 second later another object appeared to be the size of the first 3 put together.  It was silver at the top and went to bronze at the bottom.  It stayed stationary for 30 seconds and then went straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared.  We did notice military jet in the area.  I couldn&#39;t tell what they were doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was this that stirred my memory about that evening. I was DJing a benefit for a local soldier injured in Iraq and finished packing my gear about 11:45 pm on that night.  I stayed for a drink afterward and headed out about 12:15-12:30 AM.  While at a stoplight I looked up at the moon and saw a light, which I thought was a plane.  I did a &#34;double-take&#34; because I then noticed the light was part of a &#34;V&#34; of very faint lights, maybe 7 or 8 on each &#39;wing&#39; of the V. The V was not too wide and appeared nearly as a single line.  It was very difficult to see against the ambient city lighting.  The traffic light changed to green and I proceeded, I looked up again but could not locate the lights.  I thought it was odd but since there is a major air reserve base in the next town- which happens to be fairly active at this time of war- as well as an international airport close, I passed it off as an odd reflection or trick of the eyes.  I was heading in a southeasterly direction at the time.  As I said, had I not heard the Coast to Coast piece, I would never had thought any furthr of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Family. Plus Green Lights Return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Continuing Abduction Problems For Kelowna, B.C. Family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date: November 8th and 9th, 2003  Since July 31, 2003, after an UFO encounter, missing time and disturbing episodes which followed, one of the women has continued to have some medical problems. Cynthia continues to have a constant feeling of pressure on her head and is becoming worse as the days and weeks go by. This feeling of pressure has now moved into her neck. On November 8, 2003 Cynthia, while at her home, became cold as her body temperature dropped to 35.2 C. She immediately called the hospital and talked to a nurse who informed her that it sounded like hypothermia was setting in. The color of Cynthia&#39;s skin started to change, to become almost whitish/grey. She was freezing to the point where she felt paralyzed and had major problems moving or walking. Also her heart was beating really irregularly and she reports it was down to 44 bpm. Cynthia&#39;s daughter is also experiencing an irregular heart rate as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Research Note: The average normal temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Cynthia&#39;s temperature dropped a little over 2 degrees and no explanation has been given as to what has caused this to happen. If your recorded rectal or ear temperature is less than 97°F (36.11°C), you have an abnormally low body temperature (hypothermia). If your rectal or ear temperature is 95°F (35°C) or lower, call a health professional immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Information on taking your heartbeat measurement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Your pulse is caused by your heart beating. As your heart beats and forces blood through your body, you can feel a throbbing sensation (the pulse) by putting your fingers over one of your arteries at any point where the artery comes close to the surface of your skin, such as your wrist, neck, or upper arm. Counting your pulse rate is a simple way to estimate how fast your heart is beating. Pulse rate measurements are often done by a health professional as part of a physical examination or in an emergency, but you can easily learn to measure your own pulse rate as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A pulse is usually described in terms of its rate, which is the number of beats per minute (bpm). However, the rhythm and strength of the heartbeat can also be noted, as well as whether the blood vessel feels hard or soft. An irregular rhythm, a weak pulse, or a hard blood vessel may indicate a medical condition that needs further evaluation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pulse rate is measured by counting the beats in a set period of time (at least 15 to 20 seconds) and multiplying that number to get the number of beats per minute. When you exercise, have a fever, or are under stress, your heart rate usually speeds up to meet your body&#39;s increased need for oxygen and nutrients carried in the blood. As a result, your pulse rate normally varies from minute to minute. Unless your pulse rate is being measured to check your fitness level or in an emergency situation, it is usually measured after you have rested for 10 minutes or more. This measurement is called a resting pulse rate. It is an accurate and simple assessment of the health of the heart and circulatory system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always recommend to people if they feel there are medical problems that they seek out a health professional.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday night Cynthia&#39;s daughter went to bed, after a short period of time she started having an unusual and vivid dream about being in some type of vehicle with two beings. She felt that they were there to take her somewhere. The young girl felt that where ever they were going wasn&#39;t the place to be. So in her &#34;dream&#34; she jumped from the vehicle and landed on the ground hitting her right leg and rolled along the ground for a short distance. Cynthia&#39;s daughter, who also has been a victim of these unwanted visits by beings from elsewhere, woke up Sunday morning, November 9, 2003 with extreme pain in her knee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Actually as she climbed out of her bed her leg folded up right underneath her. She was fine the night before, hadn&#39;t been involved in anything which may have caused the injury that I have reported below. Cynthia&#39;s daughter&#39;s cartilage in her right knee is ripped/torn and she has to be on crutches for a while until it heals up. The doctor asked the girl if she had took part in any sporting activities, or goofing around with friends, &#34;she replied no&#34;! After they left the doctors office and some time later the pain moved up into her thigh and is getting worse. Cynthia is taking her daughter back to the doctor, or the hospital to have her checked out again. Cynthia told me blood tests will be done in hopes of determining what caused the drop in Cynthia&#39;s body temperature, also checking to see if there are any problems developing with her daughter. She also mentioned that both her and her daughter are craving salted products and are extremely thirsty. Both mother and daughter are totally exhausted, as if the two of them hadn&#39;t slept for days. Cynthia said, how can a person who is sleeping soundly in their bed wake up in the morning with a torn cartilage in her right knee. I have to agree with her. Very strange indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: I telephoned Cynthia Monday night to see how both her and her daughter were feeling. Cynthia sounded extremely tired, like she had no energy even to carry on a conversation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must say I find this to be very upsetting for me to hear what has...... and is ....taking place with this family. I also am going to try to get down to see them if the weather holds. There is also more which has taken place, but due to this information being of a personal nature, &#34;I will not&#34; be adding this to any of my reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cynthia mentioned that a couple of nights before November 8, 2003 her daughter woke up at 3:00 a.m. to a loud and very strange and unusual sound coming from the orchard behind their home. And the dogs in the area were making such a noise. She was so frightened from hearing such a loud and weird sound that she pulled the covers up over her head. She couldn&#39;t even give me an example of what the noise sounded like as it was so strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The very next night after Cynthia&#39;s daughter heard this crazy noise, Cynthia said she got woken up at 4:05 a.m. to the same sound, or at least something she could not make any sense of. Cynthia said the dogs were going crazy, the cows in the area were acting up, so she got out of bed and moved onto the balcony and looked toward the orchard. It was dark and she could see nothing but could still hear the sound. She told me she started clapping her hands, making noises herself and the strange sound eventually stopped. Although the dogs still were acting up in the area but since the sound had stopped, Cynthia decided to go back to bed. However, no sooner did she get back under the covers than the noise returned. She rolled over and tried to block out the sound until she ended up going to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: I tried to find out if abductees have even experienced hypothermia after an encounter. After searching and reading all kinds of matter I came up with nothing. So I contacted Mr. Derrel Sims and Mr. Whitley Stieber to ask if they had encountered anyone reporting hypothermia right after an event. They both were so helpful. Also I contacted other abductees but they also said they had never experienced hypothermia after an abduction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course this raises some questions which people were interested in. From what I was told a lot of discussion has not taken place on the idea of hypothermia after an abduction, mainly because no one has reported this phenomena as taking place. Some abductees report feeling very cold leading up to the actual abduction, also feeling very cold just after it took place. Many report a coldness when inside a craft to the point they were shaking. Some of this I am sure is due to the fear one must go through when being taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So why is this woman reporting hypothermia ? Is it due from being in a very cold environment (on a craft), plus the fright of the whole situation. Did this occur because she was dropped off outside in a cold environment, which it was at the time of this incident. Or was the hypothermia condition caused by a medical problem no one is aware of right now. There always seems to be more questions than answers. Maybe the blood tests, etc.. will show something. We will have to wait and see and pray for some answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will leave this off here for now. I would like to say this is the end of this story, but I have my doubts. The good thing is I keep in contact with Cynthia on a daily basis and have told her if she just wants to chat, then call me anytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More News That I Just Received:  I just had an email from a lady who resides in Vernon, British Columbia. She has informed me that a couple of business owners were in Kelowna, British Columbia on November 8, 2003 and watched green lights in the south west sky&#39;s over Kelowna. This event took place the very same night problems started again for the Kelowna family. I hope to have a full report on the sighting of the green lights. Also I want everyone to know, no information had been given out to anyone about what took place on November 8, 2003 with Cynthia and her daughter. So again we have green lights showing up and strange events taking place with a close friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can honestly say, in my opinion, there creatures that take folks from the comfort of their homes are not here to give humanity a gift, as some may suggest. They are here to experiment, degrade and frighten everyone who comes in contact with them. No one will ever convince me other wise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Take good care out there, and please if anyone who has been involved in an abduction and has ever experienced hypothermia after the incident, I would really appreciate hearing from you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

They appeared to be fairly close to the ground, they were moving without sound, and they reflected light from the street.  Our first thought was that we were seeing a flight of geese, but then we noticed that the objects were reflecting light.  My girlfriend thought they may have been fireworks, but there was no concussion, streams of light, arc of trajectory, or anything else that would indicate a typical firework pattern.

I believe my comments, along with some of the others, were: &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34; &#34;..that triangular shaped thing? &#34;Do you see that?&#34; We were all mystified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This V-shaped object was extremely high up in altitude, higher than any plane I&#39;ve ever seen flying, and moved just under the moon, towards it, then disappeared. It had about 8 round Shapes (probably lights, though it was too high up for me to see the illumination of these lights).  There were about four round shapes on each limb of the &#39;V&#39; shape, and the whole shape seemed somewhat translucent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many planes had passed through the crisp crystal-clear sky as I was viewing the moon for a duration of about 15 minutes. All of the other planes had very bright lights, took routine pathways and were easily identified as planes. This V-shaped, triangular object was quite different from the planes. It had more lights on it than a plane and the lights appeared transparent or translucent. And, it was so high up that it appeared as if it was the same distance as the moon!  Then, it disappeared  as it seemed to fly towards the moon. This triangular, V-shaped object was something else!  I remember thinking that possibly a V-formation of ducks could be traveling (but in the dark at night).

I asked him if he was getting ready to tell me about the v shape object or flock of geese formation since I had allready read about it in here. He then asked how I had known so I told him of this site and told him he should look into it and maybe report exactly what it was he saw. Incase he didn&#39;t this is why I am reporting what he said to me. He was out in a wooded area just outside of Bearlake PA on the PA NY border. He was watching the eclisp when he noticed a dark object just under the moon. To him it looked like a flock of birds. What seperates his account though is that he says he also noticed what looked like dim shooting stars coming from underneath the formation. I personally am not sure what this would have been. Please if anyone founds out more on this event let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The road that I was traveling was the same road that Fountain Powerboats Inc. is on, so I thought that it was the lights from the parking lot, but I didn&#39;t remember seeing them there before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, as I was closing in on the lights, I noticed that they were starting to move. At first I thought that it was just an illusion because I was driving in a curve, but then I was on a straight stretch and I realized that it was not an illusion. There were two lights that looked about like street lights and they were about 50 -75 feet apart from each other. There movements were simultaneous which led me to believe that it was one craft, but I could never make out a shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I closed in on the object it seemed to increase its speed and I was trying to keep up with it as there was another car in front of me who was also trying to follow it.  Due to the trees and the curves in the road, we would loose it for a few seconds and then it would re-appear.  I was trying to make it to the end of the road were it opened up to the river where I would have a wide open sky to view the object, but by the time I and the other driver had reached the end of the road the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other 3 people in the other car confirmed that they had seen the same thing that I had seen. We were all in disbelief. I tried to make sense of what I saw, but nothing added up. My house is in  an area that I watched the object fly over. When I got home I asked my wife if she heard anything; a jet, airplane, heli-copter, blimp? She said she heard nothing. The only thing that I thought it could have possibly been was a blimp, because noone heard it, but that doesn&#39;t explain why I couldn&#39;t keep up with it in my car running 60mph. Or why it disappeared out of sight over a river that is 1 mile wide. I heard nothing about this sighting in the news or the paper so I assume that we were the only ones who saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was alone, and pretty much freezing to death. I saw a shape moving from north to south towards the downtown area which I, at first, thought was a VERY large bird. The craft was completely silent and moved in a perfectly straight line towards the downtown area. It was black and shiny, probably about 50 feet wide, boomarange shaped, and about 100 feet up with no lights (I could see the light from the spotlights around the field shining off of it). The whole sighting lasted about 3 to 4 seconds as it moved quickly, but not fast, towards the downtown area. It seemed to be lined up with the ABC building (which has an electronic bilboard around the top and it the tallest building in the city). I heard a group of others yelling and clapping in the distance and I can only assume that they had seen it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At that moment, my husband took one last look up at the moon and suddenly blurted out &#34;what&#39;s that?!&#34;  We all gazed up to see what appeared like three distant, yet large, luminescent objects flying across the night sky.  Each was somewhat arrowhead shaped, and all three were together in a chevron formation... one at the head and one on each side.  These were not geese.  These objects were large and ethereal in nature- almost as if translucent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;re certain that they were not commercial jets- nor did these objects follow a flight pattern that we&#39;ve ever witnessed in these parts.  Moreover, they were totally silent which really amazed us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband ran quickly to the front gate of our property as he tried to follow their flight path which seemed to be heading west by northwest towards Manhattan.  However, a large tree on our lawn was obscuring his sight; nevetheless, within moments he reached a clearing... yet, they had already completely vanished.  My daughter and I could not tell, either, how they had disappered so quickly... all within, I believe, 10 second or less.  We were all left with the distinct impression that we had just witnessed something supernatural.  We were very glad to have witnessed it together; otherwise I, for one, might have doubted my own eyes.<n>

I observed both of these objects with Leitz 7x35 Trinovid Binoculars. All of the reports in the metro area are similar to what I observed. 10 to 15 glass like globes no lights moving in a triangular shape. They were not birds. Balloons, not quite filled to capacity, tethered by lose wire maybe. What throws me however, were the distances involved with some of the similar sitings. The other thing was not being able to really judge the distance, size, and altitude of both these objects. I spot airplanes, birds,satellites, all the time at night. The speed of these objects was leisurely.  I had three of the greyish globes close up in my eyes. It was very hard to estimate size, altitude and the specifics closer up. I don&#39;t know why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before this, there was a triangle, glider, space shuttle shaped object moving at high speed from the northwest to the southeast.

My family and I were outside looking and taking some photographs of the lunar eclipse just above us in a northward position when just under the eclipse I seen a really strange object that apperaed to be just drifting out of a hue of clouds. It appeared to be a hand glider &amp; drift as a hand glider but it&#39;s shape was like the formation of wild geese flying. Like a giant silver or dark grey colored boomerang. You had to really focus &amp; concentrate in order to really see it because it almost appeared to blend into the sky. It was big, and you could tell it was really high up. I then shouted and pointed it out to my family who consisted of my 17 year old sister and my 58 year old mother and we began to wonder what in the hell it was we had just seen. Keep in mind we live only a few miles from a very well known NYC airport so we can differentiate what is a small single engine airplane to a giant 747 because they fly right over our house. The object appeared to be at an altitude just guessing of say 9-10,000 feet up. There were no lights, no sound... just a steady drifting object moving southbound and then turning widely eastbound. With-in a few seconds the object dissapeared and we were all left stunned and amazed at the incident. We discussed what it might of been &amp; we just chuckled at the idea and all agreed it might of been some soft paper that just might be lower than what we thought and we couldnt tell because it was just to dark. So we continued to watch the lunar eclpse when again for a second time, I had seen the same object but this time moving from west to east and I was still facing north. A close friend of mine came walking by and I stated look!! look!!! There it is again!!! and he looked up and he too was also amazed to see this strange and weird object. He stated what the f*$@ is that. Now for the second time with-in 5 minutes we seen the same thing and now we had another witness to confirm what we saw. The object only appeared for no more tha! n 60 seconds and I started along with my family saying it was a UFO. After the object disaapeared we just all looked at one another and we looked up again. No more than 3 or 4 minutes later you could hear &amp; see a fighter jet or a some type of jet airplane with what I can recall blue and white lights flashing under the wing tips. It was moving at great speeds and at a higher altitude, also moving in the same west to east direction.<n>

I had propped my elbows on a rooftop ventilator to hold the binocs steady--when I suddenly saw, coming into the left of my field of view and holding an absolutely straight lateral line, a very dark object, cylinder-shaped (really it was more like a segmented caterpillar, with &#34;bumps&#34;). It was tilted at an angle of about 30 degrees to the horizon, and held that attitude. What the heck is that??? I wondered, and followed it with my binoculars, thinking that I&#39;d see it better when it crossed in front of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it did not cross in front of the moon--it disappeared then reappeared on the other side! which was really mind-blowing, and rules out aircraft, flights of geese, loose helium balloons, and any other hypothesis I can think of. Also, it stayed at exactly the same 30-degree angle, Very dark against the night sky, no nav lights or any other kind of lights. Utterly silent. It wasn&#39;t something on the lens of the binoculars, either, because it moved independently. I took the binocs down to try to see with my naked eye, but couldn&#39;t see it, then couldn&#39;t find it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t even believe in these things, so the joke&#39;s on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then it turned and did a figure 8 and proceeded into a circular motion.it was red then faded to white Then it turned too the left and shot strate backwards off into the distance.  Earlier this Month i was looking outside from my home and noticed a white light in the shape of a circle. I was looking at it for approxamately 5 seconds and it immediately stopped glowing and disappeared. I was a little shaken by this event but didnt think anything of it until tonight ( the second sighting) You must get a lot of these Sightings. But im telling you right now this is REAL!!! I&#39;m a highly intelligent person. And never thought anything of this sort before, i saw these two objects. It wasnt a plane,or a shooting star. It was a outside object that i have NEVER seen have so much control if itself. It was almost like it knew that we were looking at it, and wanted to let us know and understand that it WAS there. And that it knew that we were freaked out.<n>

My partner counted 2 sets of three lights. It seemed to have some sort of rod sticking out the front. My partner called to me to see if I was watching it. He kept exclamining aloud and it seemed almost to sense us and fly away very fast and very smooth. It headed south and then curved west. It seemed to change shape and texture when it curved.

I dismissed it as a very unusual flock of birds until I read the posts mentioning the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked as if it was &#34;blending with the night stars and dark sky&#34;. It glided from northeast to southeast and then disappeared when it got to the treelines. I knew it was not a plane b/c I&#39;m in the flight path to the airport and this was not a plane.

As I looked to the West, in the the direction of New York City, I saw several orange to white lights just about the horizon. With my binoculars they seemed rather luminous.  My first though was helicopters serching for something between New Haven, and Long Island.  But after hearing the report on the Rense Show I felt that I must of been seeing something rather different.  Being that the lights were so far away I could not make out very much except they would loose and gain altitude, and seemed to have a light (similar to a search light)aiming downward.  Over 30 min period the whole show seemed to move in a NE to SW direction. At times the lights were bright orange, and at other times soft white.  The orange lights would of been very intense of one was close to that area. Thats about it, sorry I was not closer. Ha.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was in the final of eclipse. I had been outside in a dark area of the yard, I had been observing the moon, mars in the south, air traffic, and was looking also for sattelites by this time, which i have several times seen after my eyes get adjusted. Looking east at the moon, at a point 10 degree south and 1 o&#39;clock high to my position i detected movement very far up, at first i filtered it out cause it was unlike any other movement i have seen in the sky before. I had nothing to compare this too and initially dismissed it. It came from very high up, outside the atmosphere i would have to say. It moved oddly..a translucent trail..it shifted/wobbled/fluttred its way to a point se at 30 degree altitude and settled a few degrees lower. I have observed aircraft since a child at boing feild in Renton, seen the harrier, sr-71, f-18&#39;s tail dance on the tarmac at airshows, and i recall being unable to identify what i was seeing cause i had no real world anything to compare it too. I was thinking..thats not civilian, and then out loud to my partner I said &#34;Is that military?&#34; Can you see that thing, Can you see it? and she responded to an affirmative, and she asked what is it&#34; and i replied i dont know, keep your eyes on it. I was standing all this time and i forced myself to move so as to take bearing on it. I was having difficulty judging its size. It was either footballs feilds in size about a mile away or Really big farther away. I noticed two things right away. the whole area...just lost sound and when i made sound it went into the direction  of the craft. WHat I saw was the Back end of a craft. There was a length to it forward that i was unable to get clear veiw of, but the back end of it showed as a wide thick rectangle. there were three round areas spaced evenly apart where light of changing hot colours emitted on the extreme ends, twinkling. I could see detail of the ! structure. the surface showed no indication of conformance to aerodynamic principles of smoothness, intead it showed angular extruded surfaces. It was white surfacing. The craft reminds me of battlestar galactica craft it was flatish white and some areas were highly illuminated. The whole craft semed to shift and then it could be seen sitting where it was, or its lights went off, like it blinked or the light was bending/flashing around it. There was more than one moment where everything was black and just the six round hot lights in the sky and I thought of ballons when i realized this craft was floating in the air stationary. It took over a minute for it to come down from up high and settle where i could see itlike this and I got to see it like this for about 10 seconds at least. It did a wiggle quite visibly and it started to ease forward and then it darted ahead, I called out behind me &#34; It&#39;s leaving&#34; to my partner and sked if she was seeing it taking off and she said yes. this craft was big, very big for us to have observed it as it travelled across the southern most/east, or south portion of the sky. It increased speed in  jerk and I exclaimed verbally how fast it was and got a ya from my partner. It sped south and then angled/deflected west into clouds or ?. About a minute or two later a thing i have also never seen before came flying at low angle from the east. It was bright, lite yellow/white glowing object in or out of the clouds the light of it showed, it was not round but an angled shpe of &#34;glow&#34;. it travelled in a straight line. I was moving accross the horizon so fast i puzzled if it was up close, I accept the fact that this was a large object far away travelling at very high speed. I felt rather than heard its passing, it was radiating but not at what my ears pick up maybe. i think,it too did something to the sound. It travelled from east to west like the first craft and was gone.. We waited outside listening and looking. The moon was gone and the area was now clouding over and after anothe! r 10 minutes went inside to warm, my partner started to talk about it and i said stop, you go draw what you saw and ill go draw what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drew and  had saw the same rectangular object, we both agreed it had fluttred down. She clearly recognized it to be machinery/craft,  but was unsure initially of size and distance. we both saw the same set of three lights and the rectangle backend of the craft and some structure forward. When the craft moved forward the pair of three round ligt areas remained constant in spread apart and facing direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept asking ourselves if we had just seen what we had seen. And the answer was always yes, we were not intoxicated and the drawings proved to us we had both seen the object, which I cannot deny was clearly an intelligent or purposeful moving craft that I SAW come down from very high up hover and do a systems check or something and then move south in quickening/blink/shudders/hops forward. My Partner is a Doctoral Candidate in information sciences, I am a late 30&#39;s software consultant with a background in oilfeild exploration and commercial diving. I have good eyesight. I know that what i saw was big, came from way high up, hovered so i could see the round engine ports of some sort, and that after a breif time, it moved out at very fast speed. It was soooo obviously a space craft that i was left knowing somehow that I am primitive, stuck on a planet of socially primitive beings.  Additional details and impressions. I saw or had sense that a number of things or objects were moving around in the air, but got no clear site of them if there were, but feelings that i get when bats or birds or bees, mosquitos, came up at the time and i tried scanning a bit with my eyes, the returned to trying to focus on the craft, which could be only for a second before it twinkled, blacked out or twisted light around itself. I also felt scanned, or as if i was being watched, that is a clear unmistakable fact that i felt that, and we both expressed the fact to each other of having felt it..being looked at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the second craft, the glowing object, I gotta confess, I was all senses lit up and very spooked and ready. I kept us outside, quiet for long enough to establish that there wasnt imediate nearby detctable action then went in and did best to establish to myself what i had seen. After we agreed that what we saw was a spaceship, we both got quiet, she went onto the internet, I made some more checks on the night sky that was now cloudy, then sat down and went over everything I had just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am known to have a photographic memory. We both know what we saw and we are both wondering what kindof peoples are we that interplanetary society is ignoring us, or blatantly moving about so. We are evaluating everything we know in respect of implications on our ...human society with respect to why a clearly advanced society or intelligence is not being acknowledged in our common daily understanding or is about the planet and ignoring us. Are we observed to be unsociable?   Clearly this planet was visited by a spaceship on the above date and time, it is now a fact that I am going to have to live with. Being as I am relatively young something tells me that this is not the last time that I will have direct knowledge of these objects, and the implications will some how be made manifest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also realize now that the object moved in such ways that my brain kept trying to interject that it was not there, as it moved in speeds/shifts that i had no prior knowledge to confirm it too. I am confident now that having the experience that i can anticipate the movements of these objects and tune an movementy awareness for them, much like training the eyes to see sattellites as opposed to aircraft or stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the date of the alleged sighting was in the year 2003.

I paid no mind, thinking that it was an Air Force plane, since I live near a base, going for a landing of some sort.  Then after a couple of minutes or so, either it, or one just like it, was moving northward, but it was losing altitude at a gradual pace.  After it disappeared behind some tall, thin trees across the street from my home, I waited for it to come out again, but it didn&#39;t.  Then I saw a light off to my far left (NorthEastward) that seemed to be moving, but it was much slower than the first one (two?).  I kept watching, and it didn&#39;t seem to be moving at all after a minute or two (maybe it was twinling?), but the light that disappeared behind the trees never reappeared either.  The mosquitos loved me that night, so I bid the moon and the mysterious stars goodnight and went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I didn&#39;t think anything of it, until I heard tell on the radio show, and then going on your site and seeing all the folks telling of their different sightings that night.

I thought it will be cool to videotape the eclipse session which it was a beautiful cold night. I observed on the TV screen while recording something flying by enough to watch it on TV (Monitor) passing the eclipse, It seem closer to me than next to the moon. I could not see it with naked eye, which I am near sighted and wear glasses, they were not glowing or shining, nothing blinking that I could see. I know colors don’t show up on B/W cameras, I’m not saying that it was UFO’s but it drew my attention and excludes the fact that there were not airliners. Where I am the airliners fly low pass my home heading to Newark Airport, also there is La Guardia, JFK airports in NY as well. Here is the clincher; these objects were almost one after another, within 3 to 8 seconds apart passing the same direction approx. 8 that I saw on the TV Monitor. It was spooky at first then I could not see the objects anymore. Since I had the window open I was getting really cold so few moments later I stopped and shut the window. I then rewind the tape and sure enough there it was on tape. It may be meteors or debris or I don’t know. What made me write this today was I saw the other post from Parker town NJ which is about 75 miles south East and Bridgewater NJ is about 18 miles North West from me. Did they see the same thing as I did? I cannot make an accurate decision as what shape these objects were. There were passing slow enough to see something passing by (Very Obvious). The time maybe off a little and yes the video was date time stamped. The view of the moon that I saw the passing objects was lower right meaning if you look at the moon it will be around 4:00 in direction. Oh well I have it on video so I will show it around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This Is a great sight!!!!<n>

My boyfriend and I were standing out in a field in Bridgewater, NJ.  There was very little ground light and you could see a lot of stars.  The sky was very clear and there was very little cloud action.  The moon was about 80-90% covered and he and I were looking around.  Then he points up and says, &#34;Do you see that?&#34;  I saw a very faint point of light.  It wasn&#39;t emmitting it&#39;s own light though, it was as if it was reflecting.  The light was a dark red.  The moon at no point during my watch turned red from where I was.  From what I understand, my cousin was watching from the next county over and said that the moon was an orangey-red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, the light was traveling away from the moon quite swiftly, I would saw about 40-50 mph from the ground.  Much faster than any plane that flies around here.  It was moving quickly and I lost a couple times, but it was zig-zagging.  When it would move sharply, I would pick it up again.  It was unmistakable.  The movement was very much like a bat, but it was up way too high to be a bat.  Well above cloud level.  The light zig-zagged away from the moon heading south, I believe.  It didn&#39;t come any closer towards the earth, it traveled on the same plane, you know.  It was very faint though.  And we both saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said it was a UFO, that he&#39;d seen a lot in Long Valley.  I know it wasn&#39;t a shooting or falling star, I&#39;d seen a lot of those in the Caribbean.  He speculated it was a satellite, but I don&#39;t think those would be large enough to see from Earth.  I saw this with my naked eye and I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before.  It was definitely not a plane, and I wonder if it was because of the eclipse, and the decreased amount of light that allowed us to spot it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What first caught my eye was it looked like the stars were moving and as I looked closer, it appeared as a boomerang shaped flying object, possibly the size of a football field.  It seemed like it was like a chamelion and taking on the stars patterns overhead, but we could definitely make out a shape.  It was totally silent, just gliding overhead.  It was headed toward the full moon.  When it got probably a couple of miles away from us it stopped and appeared to flip on its side and one end of the &#34;boomerang&#34; folded in on itself and it stayed there the entire time during the eclipse.  The three of us who witnessed it, 2 are registered nurses and 1 is a computer programer. All of us are older, 42, 45, and 55, and we had not been drinking or partaking drugs.

I gave a short look and didn&#39;t notice anything, then I caught site of a &#39;boomerage/chevron&#39; shaped object, it appeared to be very light grey/silver in color and I did notice lights running along the front perimeter of the object.  I told my girlfriend to look, she did but couldn&#39;t locate the object as I tried to point it out.  The object seemed to disappear like a sci-fi ship using a cloaking device.  I was able to make a good visual contact that I am certain of what I saw, but it happened for only a 10 second time frame.  I did not hear any noise, nor could I accurately determine the size but other to guesstimate it about the size of a small passenger jet,i.e. Canadair CL-600. I believe it was only illuminated due to ground lights from area homes, business, street lights, other wise, it was impossible to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate, although the eclipse did occor on November 08, 2003.  Hence, date probably is correct.  PD))<n>

It started out extremily Big and bright almost firery about the size of the moon. It streaked across the sky and about half way across it started to break up disipate as it crossed under the moon and it fadded away. We thought it might be a metorite coming in and breaking up or maybe space junk, but who knows. To me it is a UFO I don&#39;t know what it was. I hope this was helpfull.

I first took one photo and reviewed the picture on my camera to see how it looked.  When I saw the photo I thought it was a bad photo, all it showed was this orange streak thru the the sky ( which I didn&#39;t see while taking the photo). So I proceed and took three more pictures. In those three last photos I took, the first two had the same orange streaks in them.  But there was three object that appeared to be moving downwards.( again I didn&#39;t notice this while taking the photos.)The last photo just shows the eclipes.I noticed that another person made a similar discription the same night,so thats why I checked my photos again and sent this in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably not UFO&#39;s.

The eclipse was nearly complete with just a sliver left of regular lunar reflection, around 6:40 Mountain Time. We both saw the boomerang shaped object which was backlit by the eclipsed moon. It appeared in the lower right-hand quadrant of the moon, slightly inward on the radius between the 6 and 5 o&#39;clock positions and moving in a slight arch downward and out of the moon&#39;s light. It took at least a minute to traverse this space. In size from side to side of its shape, we estimate it to be around 1/6 the moon&#39;s diameter. It was impossible to tell where in the viewing space the object could have been located. It could have been anywhere in our upper atmosphere or in the space between the moon and ourselves as we viewed. The outline of the dark object was more fuzzy than starkly defined as well. After at least a full minute of viewing as the object moved extremely slowly, it disappeared into the surrounding blackness of the night sky. Our atmospheric conditions on that night were absolutely crystal clear and we are located at above 7,000 ft. altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could it have been an owl we saw backlit by the moon? The movement was archlike so it may be a possibility. The lines were so diffuse around the edges of the object, however, and the shape of the object so consistently formed that we doubted an owl could have produced such an image. The curved longest side of the boomerang had an unnatural curvature totally unlike that of an owl&#39;s lines in flight and the speed was too slow to account for an owl&#39;s closer distance in our viewing field. Could it have been a plane? No, unless our government is working on a new class of secret boomeranged shaped craft. Always a possibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former teacher and my husband owns his own business. We were clear of mind and had not imbibed any alcohol or altering substances.

I find it very difficult to describe.  There was what appeared to be light clouds surrounding it. It was fully dark outside.  The sky showed a dark cloud bank to the north and east and partly cloudy conditions with lots of stars visible to the south with what seemed to be a light low drifting cloud cover to the west. What I saw I can only compare to the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It seemed an object made of clouds was approaching from the west, approximately a mile away judging from the landmark it seemed near.  It was round, apparently flat and very large.  Holding both my hands at arm&#39;s length would not cover it.  The outside of the circle appeared to be moving very fast with lights in the pattern of a circle, blinking somewhat in strobe fashion, and the entire circle of cloud seemed to be moving in the direction of the lights about as fast as a fan blade would move on a box fan.  Inside the outer circle of lights there was another circle of lights also moving in a circular motion, but not as fast.  The object slowly approached were we were standing.  It made no noise whatsoever.  When it was almost directly overhead I could see that the very center of this cloud phenomenon was clear and stars were visible through it.  At the point it was almost directly overhead it turned on it&#39;s side (like a tire being picked up from being flat and put into a position of function)and took off at a tremendous rate of speed, disappearing into a heavy cloud bank to the north and east.  Immediately after it did so, the sky overhead became completely clear with stars visible to the west and south, as though the thrust and/or heat had disippated the clouds behind it.  This lasted about 15 minutes from first sighting to disappearance.  I don&#39;t know how many people actually saw it, as a friend had called my neighbor and told her about it. It was so quiet that we (my husb! and and myself) would never had known it was there if we had not been told.  I find it very hard to describe, but I cannot think of any natural phenomenon to accout for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Around the area of Cactus Rd. I noticed a &#34;flash&#34; in the upper part of the windshield, I believe there was a left to right motion to it, (east to west). As I leaned forward to see what had caused it, my wife said, &#34;oh, it was a shooting star.&#34; I told her that I doubted that because Phoenix had a solid cloud layer all day, and I had never heard of a meteorite still incandscent 8,000 feet,(est.), above the ground, traveling in a horizontal path. (I work for a large aerospace company and am an amateur astronomer.) As I told her this, she replied that she had seen a similar &#34;shooting star&#34; about a week before in the area of New River, a town about 30 miles north of Phoenix. She said it occurred early in the evening, while it was still very light, and, again, had been an overcast day. She said the &#34;shooting star&#34; disappeared from view behind the mountains north of New River. The details stuck in my mind because November 8th was my birthday. I also investigated several websites dealing with meteorites and found that smaller ones are usually only traveling a few hundred kilometers per hour that low in the atmosphere. If it had been one large enough to be incandescent at that altitude, it should have made a large hole somewhere in west Phoenix, but there was no report of any such event the next day. I have debated with myself for months about submitting this report, but I am a regular visitor to this website, and as such, feel guilty about not reporting, if only to add this to a database.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky&#39;s clearer tonight than usual, and there&#39;s supposed to be a lunar eclipse soon. So we&#39;re out there just looking at stars and whatnot, and my brother sees what looks about the same size as a star, only reddish orangish, and its moving. It&#39;s going straight, and very fast. Like, there are a lot of low flying planes that go over our house, and they move pretty quickly, but this thing was very high and moving just as fast. We looked through some binoculars, and it just looked like a star.. we couldn&#39;t see the form of anything around the light, like you usually can even with really high flying planes. The light wasn&#39;t blinking at all either. It went straight from over our house, north, over our backyard and out of view. A few minutes later we saw another of the same type of thing, this time from a little right of where we saw the first one come. Then a few minutes after that, another, from left of where the first one came. No more after that, but we&#39;ve been in and out of the house since then. Hopefully when the eclipse happens it&#39;ll darken the sky enough for us to see more.<n>

I called to my husband to come outside and look.  He was as spell bound as I was.  He witnessed the same thing.  We watched until they stopped flying over.

There was an airplane in the sky at some point when they were flying over, the objects were traveling at a much greater speed than the plane.  I know he had to have seen them!!

There was also a white light that circled the object through the middle.

We had been fishing most of the afternoon while waiting for the sunset. This was day 6 of a three week vacation. We had been to the beach for the sunset about every evening. It was just after the sun had gone below the ocean. The sky was clear. My wife pointed and said can you see that bright light? It&#39;s moving. I looked to the southwest in the direction she was pointing and immediately saw a light at an elevation of about 30 deg above the ocean horizion. It looked like the landing light of a large airplane. It was as large or larger than Mars was at it&#39;s closest this summer. The light was white, steady, and unblinking. It moved from the south toward the north parallel with the horizon. It looked like it could be a fast moving airplane. We watched it for about 10 to 15 seconds. It came to a complete stop without slowing, it just stopped almost due west of us (about 260 deg). We watched it for another 20 minutes and it did not move anymore. We talked about how far it had moved as we watched it. If you held up a yard stick (3 ft) in the middle at arms length, it traveled about the length of the measure in only 10 or so seconds. We looked around the clear sky and could see other lights from planes moving both high and low. All were blinking and all were closer to us than the light and moving much slower in comparison to the speed of the light. We watched two aircraft pass between us and the light in the approach to SouthWest Regional Airport at Ft. Myers. We have taken that flight several times ourselves. It was impossible to tell how big or how far the object was except it was far beyond the normal path of the aircraft and much bigger than the lights of the commerical airliners we were looking at. We finally left after half an hour and it was still there. The following Monday (11/10/03) we went back to the beach at sunset to see if the light was still there. During the same time period on the 10th, no ! light was present. We went again on the 11th (Tuesday, 11 November 2003) and after sun set, suddenly the light appeared in about the same location we saw it in on Friday after it had stopped but just a little more to the south of west (about 250 deg). We had watched the sun set and had a sense of time of setting objects. A while after the sun had set, it was completely dark, the object began to slowly sink toward the horizon until it went out of sight below the ocean level. It did not sink as fast as the sun did. The ocean horizon at a standing elevation is about 12 miles away. We did not see the light any more. It could have been in space for all we could tell. It looked like a big bright flood light. I have followed UFO reports for some years. Except for an incident in 1954 when I saw 5 silver disk the size of a new dime, at arms length, in a V formation, go over in Kentucky, I have never seen anything I could not identify. I read several other people have seen very large bright lights recently. Perhaps something similar. My wife and I are both college grad professional people.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The day had been overcast and rainy. but at that time the sky had begun to clear and the sun had started to set. The still-heavy clouds were a brilliant array of orange, pink, purple, black and white, with some spots of clearing. I was standing facing south. preparing to go down the steps and into the parking lot when I noticed a sparkle of light emerge from one of the clouds, and pass through a clear spot of sky blue. The shape of the object was like a crystal, shining and with multiple facets from which the sun reflected. The object was spinning very fast, and it quickly passed through the clear patch of  sky and on up into another cloud. I did not see the object again after that, but felt disoriented and lightheaded, and had experienced about 10 minutes of missing time. The shining object was near Mount Cheaha in the Talladega National Forest, which is easily viewed from the back steps of the business where I am employed (a historical landmark) That same night I had an array of strange dreams about being taken up into a spacecraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Shortly after this thing was gone NASA&#39;s planes started flying around.we have a small NASA training center here they have those zero gravity traing jets and a couple of what look like f-15 jets camoflauged in light blues these are the ones i saw flyin around right after that thing disappeared<n>

It caught my eye because it looked like a short contrail very high up in the sky, but was really bright white.  Then as I watched, the &#34;trail&#34; became increasingly long and bright.  It was traveling from N/NW to S/SE, away from the Strait of Juan de Fuca towards the Olympic Mountains.  At this point, I pulled my car over to observe it more closely.  There were a few other cars pulled over as well, with the people inside craning their necks like I was.  By this point the &#34;tail&#34; was getting longer, and appeared to grow longer as the object made its way across the sky.  It seemed to travel like a missile, on a steady course, but with this tail behind it that was absolutely stunning.  The tail was brilliant orange by this point, and seemed to sparkle and wave, almost gossamer in appearance. This continued on for a few more minutes as it proceeded on course towards the mountains, and then disappeared from my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home to my husband and described what I had just seen, he said &#34;that must have been a solar sail.&#34;  From his description of what that is supposed to look like I agreed, but cannot find anything on the internet about a solar sail having been launched on or near that date.  Perhaps this was a fireball or meteor?  Whatever it was, it was absolutely incredible and I&#39;ll be shocked if no one else from the area reports it (I&#39;ve heard nothing yet).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a professional in the health care field, and work at the hospital here.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had the keys to his car and shined this blue LED into the hills to enhance the visibility as to what was happening.  A few moments later, I heard odd crying-distress sounds as if they were from a child or cat, etc. I assumed it was an animal, but however was shaken by the experience and ran inside the house.  After I told my cousin of the sounds, we went outside with his camera to see what we could find.  We heard the sounds again, which were shortly followed by odd electronic beeping sounds, not tones that would be musical, but microtonal noises.  We became frightened, and got in the car and drove to my house, which is 100 ft up the road.  We loaded the keyboard into my garage because the house was locked and we forgot the keys to the house.  We relectantly stepped outside again and heard more rustling.  Oddly, his steering wheel had become very sticky, like a film of slime, (this might be condensation, but could be related).  This was a truly odd, crazy experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> EXTRA NOTE - My cousin, who is now 19, saw an unidentifiable creature in the hills when he was 10 or 11 years of age.

Had no tail, no blinking lights, absolutely no sound, and way too low to be a plane. We live in the desert outside of the city, our view of the stars is wonderful, I can always see the satellites pass over. This was not a satellite.

It just &#34;materialized&#34; and did not show as a meteor or anything.  It was a definate &#34;round&#34; object that went &#34;straight down&#34; behind the mountains, doted with small cabins. Its was a clear night and the moon a full.  It had a flame, above the round green sphere.  It went down straight.  No, fireworks, or show, but a weird glow.  There was a few trucks on the why94, at the time.  It was large, as big as a two story home, at arms leagth it was as large as a nickle.  The flame was, white, and the green object clear. It went down, very fast, not at an angle.  I was alone, and it did not, come into the air, like a shooting star, would, this was very different. I live in North Dakota, and see these things but not, like this one.

First of all , I want to get this clear, I don&#39;t fully believe in U.F.O.&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am simply a victim of being at the right place at darn near the wrong time.  I was on my way to the bathroom, and I heard the dogs in the neighbor hood all going crazy. I sliped on my pants and went to check on my dogs. while on my way to the back of the house, I began hearing this noise, like a big airplane or something,so I then thought maybe it was some truckdriver coming by, but anyway, I went outside stood in the back yard and of course looked for the source of the yard, finding nothing. Although the noise was still there, well more like pass over, so I walked around the side of the house to the front yard and still I saw nothing (BUT STARS!!, It was clear as day) I didn&#39;t waste no more time.  I wrote it off as alow flying plane and sarted up the steps,Looked back one more time and this time I saw about 6-8 helicopter type things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the noise was still there but it sounded like it stopped,not the noise the noisemaker. the heilcopter things had a blue and red flashing light and if they were indeed helicopters, they where to high to be heard but the flashing lights could be seen good enough to tell it was a light in the front and one in the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now back to the big noisemaker that has stopped or landed,well first of all I knew that an airplane couldn&#39;t stop in mid air, and also there are no airports around my house. I went into the house to get my girlfriends opinion and we both came back to look.  now about two of the flashing lght things appeared to be going towards the noise and the rest are moving around like helicopters.(just hovering, but still together). then about maybe 30 sec. later and one of the flashing light things came back towards the other flashing things but this time it was moving much faster than at first. Then the group started to break up and it look like two of the flashing things stayed in spot and just flashed.  Now for someone who could give a hoot nanny bout the whole outer space subject, I can say that for last night I spent about 40 minutes of my life trying to fix a good view at Hell,I guess Either nearly dead stars or helicopters and I heard the first airplane that landed in N.W. Moultrie, Ga. I couldn&#39;t explain then and I can&#39;t explain now, so I wanted to  share that with everyone.<n>

Because it was dark, the actually craft could not been seen, but there were a number of red lights that give off the apparent shape.  There were two large lights at the base, one on top of the other that did not blink at all but just were on.  Then two separate red lights would stream from the top red light upward, kind of like a kid&#39;s toy laser gun would have the red lights stream from one end to the other when the trigger was hit.  Now this object was huge. From my backyard I watch planes and helicopters fly by as I relax in my hot tub at night.  If a plane would be a spec in the sky about a half an inch big, this thing was 50 times that size.  Because it was a full moon last night, I did notice that it left a stream, or line in the sky, same as what a fighter plane would leave.  Shortly after the object disappeared over the mountain, a small craft came chasing after it.  This craft was a straight red light, not blinking like most planes do and it was fast.  No noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A bright white light almost directly above me and to the east a bit was moving slowly north, northwest.  It was roughly the size, maybe slightly larger, than a full moon, but the moon wasn&#39;t up yet at that time, and this was moving.  Not knowing the actual size of this object, it&#39;s difficult to say how high up it was, but if I had to guess, I&#39;d say  between 500 and 1,000 feet.  (Since I live in the mountains, I&#39;m already at approximately 5,000 feet.) There was no sound or noise of any kind.  I watched it for about  ten seconds, then it suddenly shot straight up into the sky and in less than one second, it was the size of any average star in the sky, then gone. Being a former Air Force brat and having spent 18 years growing up on various AF bases, I&#39;ve seen and heard just about anything the AF flies, but I&#39;ve never seen anything move at a rate of speed like that. I&#39;d like to know if there were any other reports of this sighting from Reno or Sparks that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the date of the alleged sighting was in the year 2003.

It was really bright, which caught my attention because normally Portland at night is really cloudy and you can&#39;t see much. Anyway, I noticed the object and I got an &#34;eerie&#34; feeling, for lack of a better word. It was just one light, no blinking. It came from the west, not terribly fast, then it seemed to slow down, but was still moving. No sound. There is lots of airplane activity around where I live, so usually it would be no big deal. I know what the commercial planes look like at night, and it wasn&#39;t one I am used to seeing. Just when I was ready to brush it off as a weird plane the object began to move erratically, &#34;jerking&#34; in strange ways. I turned around and shut the trunk of the car, which caused me to face north and then I turned back around and it was gone. I got a weird feeling and started walking back to the apartment. Just as I reached the door I heard military jets do a fly over, it was weird though because I couldn&#39;t see them when I just saw the light a moment ago. I have no idea if it was just one plane or what but it was really loud. I then went inside my apartment and told my husband, who seemed unimpressed.

I witnessed a cluster of red blinking lights. These lights blinked on and off.  And with each blink the cluster appeared to change shape. It went from a vertical zig-zag, to an upside down v, to snake like line of red lights.  The total size of the cluster was about as wide as the interstate.  The size of each light was about the same as a red light on top of a tower.  There was no visible shadow or background. It was a misty dark evening.  The total cluster drifted from the north side of the interstate just above the tree line, to the south side, back again, then back to the south, it dipped down below the tree line, to slightly rise, to dip again.  I got to a point where the trees cleared, and could not spot it again.  Very uneventfull, but definately unidentifiable.  I can be contacted at ((e-address deleted))<n>

One night when we were out the back, I glanced up at the silhouette of Mt Ngungun and saw a light flash near it&#39;s highest point.  I first assumed it was some campers up there, so didn&#39;t pay much attention.  Then when I next looked, it flashed in a completely different area, this time I could see that it was a fair distance above the treeline.  I pointed it out to my roomies, and we watched as every few seconds it would flash in a different area: sometimes well above the mountain, other times in spots that I knew to be halfway down 50 metre cliffs (I walked and abseiled that mountain quite a few times, so I knew it well enough to pinpoint where the lights were flashing from).  Occasionally the lights changed from white to orange, and once red, and at one stage I thought I saw it split into three, although it was back to one a few seconds later.  Just for reference too, I realised that my initial thought of it being a camper was ridiculous, as the intensity of the light we saw could never have been produced from a torch, camp fire, or even a spotlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually the &#39;light show&#39; slowed until it was a flash every few minutes instead of every couple of seconds, and in the end it just stopped and we went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Sonic booms were reported in the Forrest City, Wynne and Brinkley, AR towns.  I was travelling through the area north of where the sonic booms of the meteor(s) were heard.  While that evening turning on to AR Rt 14 at Payneway, AR and looking west to Weona (unincorporated town- has store and abandoned cotton gin)the sky was clear and I saw a falling star, or at least what I thought was a falling star but this was going much too slow until it stopped! And there were 3 lights bareley visable as I and other vehicles travelled west to Weona, these lights moved in a stationary rotating position.  The lights/object was below 10,000 ft in altitude (closer to 2,000 ft), it was black and triangular, there was a faint rewd light in the center of the triangle, these lights wre yellow in color.  This triangle seemed to move slow and in a north south pattern as if it were searching for something.  After crossing crowleys ridge and coming into Harrisburg, I stopped for gas and mentioned to the cashier who indicated that their was some talk about the metereor shower the night before and that it occurred on both sides of crowleys ridge.  At eight miles due west of Harrisburg, AR., I saw another one of these triangles with the same lightfomation.  There was a loud hum that sounded like a transformer and my vehicles voltimeter went into the re-charge area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were to the south of me.  They looked to be moving away from me and I thought they were two c-130s headed to a local airforce base (Rosecrans AFB) in Elwood, KS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got on the highway I noticed them coming towards me, then loop quickly around almost in a figure 8 and continued coming towards me.  As they got closer to me they got lower to the ground.  I could distinguish a few red lights on each one.  They didn’t flash or anything.  One of them came over the top of the car about 50 feet above me and a very, very bright white light shined down on me.  It seemed like I couldn’t even see anything but the light.  One of the things that scared me the most was that it was completely silent.  I couldn’t hear any plane engines at all.  I was scared and I started swerving on the road.  I thought they were going to drop a bomb on me or something.  It was the most terrifying experience I have ever had in my life.  As I was swerving the lights disappeared.  I looked back behind me and they were gone.  I called my husband right afterward and told him about what had happened.  Before I got to my destination the car started making a funny noise and my husband told me to just come home.  I was very upset when I got home and I called Rosecrans to relate my story to them and to see if they were flying any planes tonight.  The man I talked to laughed and said no.  So either he laughed at me because they are doing stuff tonight that they shouldn’t be doing or he thinks im crazy. My husband had me try to draw what I had seen.  I would like to know if anyone else has seen this sort of thing.  My husband also found this website and told me to report it.  He is very excited about all this.<n>

At first, I didn&#39;t know what it was because it was blurry, but then when it flashed up and towards me about 800-1000ft in the air, I knew exactly what it was.  I started crying because it scared me.  It took me awhile to even want to get out of my car when I reached my destination.  I wouldn&#39;t be suprised if anyone else would have seen it from another part of town.  I was the only car within 2 miles or so. The funny thing is that I didn&#39;t really see any lights on it, it just seemed to have a yellow glow around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Shortly after leaving the house I noticed a strange, bright light shining through a section of clouds. About the same time I was wondering what it was, my husband made the comment, look at the landing lights from a plane reflecting on the clouds. We stopped to watch, waiting to see the plane emerge as the light was moving in our direction. It was like watching the light from a flashlight and as the person moves toward you, the cone-shaped beam gets larger and brighter. This beam was getting VERY bright and I kept thinking that the clouds must really be reflecting that light because I&#39;ve seen planes in cloudy conditions and they&#39;ve never even remotely resembled this. We kept watching and waiting and when the light finally reached the clouds edge, it just seemed to melt away leaving only a line of cloud/smoke that continued the same direction of movement. There was no plane, no craft or any evidence that anything was there except that line of cloud/smoke that kept drifting in the same direction and slowly dissapated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While looking up at the traffic light, I noticed a series of white lights (maybe yellow). Maybe 6 or 8 in a tight line. They were heading north/northeast. Between the overcast and the distance, it was to difficult to make out a distinct shape. If I had to guess, I would say that it was cigar shaped.  I&#39;ve lived in the area for a couple of years. I&#39;ve seen 100&#39;s of airplanes take off and land at Regan National Airport. Airplanes are pretty easily recognizable at the elevation you see them coming and going from an airport only a few miles away.  It was extraodinarily large, and moving slow.  Coincidentally (or not) as the object moved out of sight, sirens begun blaring and in the intersection behind me I could see (through my rear view) a couple of black Surburbans (tinted with the dashboard police lights) fly through the intersection. They were escorted by a couple of city police. They too were heading north. That in itself isn&#39;t too alarming. I also worked in D.C. for a couple of years a grew accustomed to the Secret Service/FBI (whoever) Surburbans speeding all over the place. But in Alexandria, escorted by police, it seemed a little out of place. I would urge anyone reading this, who might have seen the same thing to file a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We live in Burlington, VT near the Winooski river. I was inside the house when my son who was outside yelled loudly &#34;Dad come outside&#34;. I ran out onto the deck to see my son pointing up in the sky &#34;what is it?&#34; My wife who was in our yard with our dog was looking up in the sky too said &#34;It&#39;s a UFO&#34;. First I thought they were joking until I Looked up and to my amazement saw a flying silver metallic disk navigating in and out of the clouds, it was turning upside down then right side up. I said &#34;that&#39;s a flying saucer&#34;. We had a visual on it for no longer than 1 minute at which time it disappeared in the clouds headed east over Colchester. Too bad I didn&#39;t have enough time to get my camcorder. I wasn&#39;t at all scared but my heart was beating fast from the experience.

It was like a white spot in the sky moving northward and at a slow to steady pace.    I stopped and got out of my car only to lose sight of it.     About two weeks later upon dusk, again I saw a similar object but this time it seemed much lower, white and moved over my house.  It moved about the same pace as in the first sighting of this object.   As I scrambled the kids to look at it, by this stage it was gone.

Your other witness saw the object as she was entering I-5 southbound near Lombard St., about 4 miles sw of the tower at PDX.  My wife saw a white, circular object hovering in the direction of I-5 &amp; Lombard, but she saw it near the intersection of 102nd &amp; Sandy Blvd., about 3 miles se of the tower at PDX.  Could you verify the date with your other witness, because my wife is absolutely certain she saw this object at about the same time on the 5th (it was her day off work and she was running errands)?  Unlike you other witness, my wife did not see any fighter jets in the area, but it sounds like your first witness saw the object almost directly overhead, whereas my wife&#39;s line-of-sight was more like 45 degrees above the horizon.  Thanks and if I can answer any other questions, please feel free to contact me or my wife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kind regards, ((name deleted)) Gresham, OR  Please note that I have completed the rest of this form based on what the witness (my wife) told me.  I haven&#39;t checked any of the boxes, because none of the characteristics apply to the object she saw (she said it was a brightly lit white object that never changed colors) and although she wouldn&#39;t be opposed to speaking to an investigator and having her name released, she doesn&#39;t necessarily require that one contact her.<n>

I was standing facing due north but staring straight up watching the stars as I waited for the dog. Out of the corner of me eye I noticed an object &#34;speeding&#34; (faster than any jet) from the southeast to the northwest in a straight line.  It was oval shaped, about the size of a pea held at arms length.  It was not brightly lit like a star, but had a dim glow, sort of close to what a flourescent light looks like at half strength before it flickers completely on.  The color was brownish red. I almost thought it may have been a balloon, but the speed it was travelling at -against the wind, which was blowing the clouds around quite a bit at that time- and the straight line it travelled in, discounted that theory.    I also thought of the possibility of a goose, but I&#39;m not sure they fly at night and would think if a goose belly would be that visible at night then so would its wings. It looked to be roughly several hundred feet in the air, though I&#39;m not a good judge of altitude. I watched it for about a minute until it disappeared into the swirling clouds to the nw. The entire incident was over with before I could have run inside to get a camera. The dog displayed no odd behavior, and after scanning the sky for a few minutes to see if there were any other objects, I went inside. Loveland CO is nestled just east the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. In town you might need to crane your neck to see the mountains over your neighbors roof or fence, but it&#39;s fairly close. The terrain is flat and grassy with sparse groupings of trees, so much of the sky is visible anywhere you might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

By the time I ran inside, got the binoculars and came back out that object was gone. Still, it had looked unusual so I decided to stay outside for a bit and continue looking. There were several conventional aircraft in the sky and it was calm and clear. It is dark out here in the desert away from town and to the west there are few lights- it is mostly ranch land. I didn&#39;t see anything else and was getting ready to go back to the house, but all of a sudden there was a bright flash in the sky to the northwest but nothing more, then a few seconds later a very bright orange light appeared about a hand span above the western horizon- I still had the binoculars and took a look at it. It was a large glowing orange disk. It was glowing like a burning ember in a wood stove or fire place. It was moving fairly rapidly and it seemed to wobble a bit- sort of rocking back and forth. It was moving south and then it seemed to go to the west away from me. It had no discernable features except it color and shape. When it looked like the object was heading west I ran to get my husband who was working at the computer- I wanted a second witness to this sighting. By the time he got to where I had been standing all that he could see with the binoculars was a glowing orange spot that eventually dissappeared. From my vantage point this sighting was over very flat open country just south of Red Mountain. The object could have been 10 miles away. What is interesting is that it may have been moving in the direction of I-10 so others may have seen something in SW NM or SE AZ as this object was big and bright. I think I watched it about 15 seconds and it was probably visible for about 60 seconds. We stayed outside for awhile longer but saw nothing else unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The size of these would vary from tiny or almost minute to extremely large and I could see them from anywhere from inside my house to outside in the atmosphere. The only other person who can see them is my sister. Since then I have seen strange lights and aircraft in the sky and now I see actual beings amongst us. I guess we are not supposed to see them or they are in some sort of invisible mode, because noone else seems to see them. I get very scared when they start to do thjings to me like I am not supposed to be able to see them. I can see them and I feel it when they do stuff to me because it is painful. I know I&#39;m not crazy.I see this stuff every day everywhere now. Thank you for at least taking a report from me, and being open minded. Anyone who doesn&#39;t believe me, please consider just for one second that I am telling the truth, please.<n>

We were looking around at all the darkness and of course the sky drew our attention.  I noticed a plane-like object darting wildly back and forth across the sky in short flight patterns.  As I looked at this object I then noticed more of the same type of objects in the sky that were arranged in a circle just sitting there.  One by one they all performed the same jerky movements and then just disappeared.  There was no sound at all during these movements or flights.  Very weird!<n>

I called my wife on the cell phone and I asked her if she can see the lights, she said yes, we have never seen anything like this before. I was on the way to Edwards AFB where I work and am fimiliar with aircraft lights. The lights seemed to hover but were not stationary to each other. After watching for about 3 minutes the lights started to vanish one at a time starting with the long end. After the 5th light went out we kept watching and the 5th light appeared 2 more times withought the others then after a couple of seconds they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking East and saw it about the time it either began glowing or came out from behind some trees. It went south and descended slightly, I could see it for 5 or 6 seconds. It seemed to be moving slowly, and it brightened as it went, (got venus-like in brightness, but a sharper point of light) so it might have been vectoring towards me as well.  It was 2 to 2 1/2 hands up off the horizon, and traversed 3 1/2 to 4 hands left to right. It seemed to be fading and slowing before it disappeared behind some other trees. Also, it clearly broke in two pieces about 3/4 of the way through the sighting. Seemed like a slightly smaller piece separated and took a slightly slower and lower path. Obviously I can&#39;t gauge the distance, but it seemed like it was near, maybe over Lake Washington. I hope you get other sightings to triangulate this.

Just as we got out of the town of Harrisburg and headed toward Waldenburg i noticed the wierd lights in the sky. at first they looked simalar to an airplane but as they got closer i knew they were different. I woke him up and pulled over to the side of the road. the night before we had a sighting in the same place but the objects were not close enough to get much detail.  this night we had my home video camera with us in the car just in case we seen it again.  when i got the object in sight and seen it was heading over the road, i stopped to where i thought it might cross and pulled over to the side to wait.  he grabbed the camera and i was turning it on when it went over the top of my car. he said &#34;look at that&#34; and when i looked up i seen a large triangle figure that was a little higher up than the pine trees to our right.  the object was CLEARLY not a plane.  it had a large white light on the front tip and a blue flashing light on each of the back two tips.  when it went over our heads we could see a small red light in the center on the bottom, but by the time i got the camera on and got out of the car it had already passed. i got the back of the object as it went away and then it appeared to sort of travel up like it wanted to fly at a higher level.  i recorded from the time i got out of the car untill you couldnt see much detail anymore. the video will be very useful if it could be still framed but i was so scared when i shot it that its kind of jumpy where i was shaking.  these objects are in that area every time that we pass through there but we never have stopped to wait on them to come closer.  the night before when we witnessed a similar sighting they didnt come that close to us.  we called his parents to tell them what we were seeing and my phone kept cutting out with static sounds (which has never happened in the two year period that ive had that phone). as we pulled off my car lights lit up and beeped and then stopped and went ba! ck to normal. and the next morning when we woke up it was all over the news about a sonic boom heard in a town that is about a 25 minute drive from there.  there was even metiors hitting in some parts of arkansas. the only other thing we saw that night was something that appeared to be a falling star but we didnt think anything of it untill the next morning when we heard about all of the other activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found her to be both sincere, and credible.

The area has lots of radio antenae in the area, but what I saw seemed to be an airplane heading North as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched (from the backseat), through the front windsheild, I saw two white lights perfectly opposite from each other, and two red lights.  One was to the left of the leftmost white light, and the other was in the middle, a bit more forward (sort of in a triangle formation) than the two white lights, sort of taking the &#39;point&#39;.  The red lights would alternate between which one was on an off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my boyfriend what it was, and, knowing that I was a stargazer who often mistook things for UFOs, he said it was an airplane.  I looked again, and saw that it seemed to be descending (like an airplane would).  I asked what it was doing, and he suggested landing.  However, I know that there are no landing areas anywhere near where it was (for those familiar with the area, it was northwest of the Gannette/Florida Today office building).  He suggested Orlando, and I said that it&#39;s too low and it wouldn&#39;t make it to Orlando before it landed.  Then he suggested Merritt Island, and it was headed in the wrong direction.  Then he suggested Titusville, which was northward of where we were, and I conceded...<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the low flying plane seems to slow down, because now I could see it through the driver&#39;s side window.  I couldn&#39;t see any body at this point, but now the white lights were gone, and the red lights were there, still alternating between on and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I guess we caught up with it so it was by the rear-driver&#39;s side window.  I looked out and saw a very vague black/gray triangularish shape.  I couldn&#39;t locate any wings, however, and at that point, the red lights were both on at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked forward and told my boyfriend something, and when I looked back to look at it, we drove past an area that blocked the &#34;plane&#34; with lots of trees.  When we broke free, the craft was no longer there.  When the road curved to the northwest a bit, I looked again, and still couldn&#39;t find it.  I looked every direction and still couldn&#39;t find anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I might not know a lot of aircraft, but I was under the impression that that a) had blue lights as well as red, and b) couldn&#39;t disappear suddenly.  I like looking for UFOs, and my boyfriend doesn&#39;t exactly disapprove of it.. but he does make fun of me for it sometimes.  I think it probably would take something extraordinary for him to believe that what I saw was really a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A story about what was happening in the county that night:  There was a hostage situation abotu 20-30 miles south of where I spotted the UFO.. but it had ended  at 7pm, about 4 hours earlier than when I saw the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It traveled from south-east to north-west and I followed it until it went below the horizon. I have witnessed many different earth orbiting objects as well as Comets and meteors. There was NO trail behind the object. Like I said it looked like a satellite but moved far too fast to be that. (Maybe it was an asteroid)?<n>

I looked straight up and saw 3 round lights moving in unison from the West to the East horizon.  The circles of grey light were located at each end of the triangle shape, and I estimate this triangle was about 100 feet across.  I looked away from the lights several times to make sure I was really seeing what I saw.  I was able to locate this moving object over and over again.  It took about 30 seconds for this object to move to the Eastern horizon.  This was no illusion!  I went to bed and dreamed of UFO&#39;s darting in and out of the clouds and across the sky.

I check your site daily for updates and it&#39;s fascinating reading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed a ufo November 2, 2003, and reported it to you and it is posted in the database.  Since my sighting I have slowly come to realize that this ufo departed/exited in a very distinctive manner.  At around 9pm I saw three circles of gray light that were much higher than the typical commercial air traffic around Charlotte, NC.  They were in a triangle formation moving west to east.  I strongly believe they were separate from each other as I remember seeing the stars between/behind them as they progressed across the sky.  They were much larger than any star or commercial airline lighting.  Using the thumb measure, each circle was size of a pencil eraser.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the three circles approached the eastern most horizon the first circle appeared to curl up like it was going through an evelope slot or like it was curling upward around a cylinder or wringer of some sort.  I remember watching it curling and then all three lights went out or disappeared.  I wonder if this could be some sort of portal these crafts use to leave earthly dimension.  Forgive me if this account is of no use but I wanted to report it just in case you feel it truly is distinctive.  I also attached a rudimentary picture of the ufo that I drew on my Dell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Graphic image shows three white circles in the sky, oriented in a triangular fashion.

When it came to the moon edge, it did not come out the other end as it should of, thought maybe nothing. About 15 mins later, I was still looking up and a little bit east of the first one I noticed another faint star move a shorter distance and then faded off.

I then realized that it was not like any plane that I had ever seen before.  It was more of an egg shape with the egg lying on its side.

It soon became apparent what they were:  The lights which illuminate Spaceship Earth shine up from the ground, and portions of the beams miss the building and continue into the sky.  This light is impossible to see, unless something in the sky enters a beam and is illuminated by it.  For reasons I still don&#39;t understand, sea gulls and bats make a habit of flying around this area after dark, entering and leaving the light beams continuously.  From a distance it appears as if small, brightly lit objects are performing impossible acrobatic maneuvers in the sky.  I&#39;m not surprised to see the few reports in your database that seem to refer to this phenomenon--I&#39;m an amateur astronomer used to observing the sky, and I found it quite startling the first time I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates the date of the sighting is approximate, even though the report is submitted on the date of the alleged sighting.

It soon became apparent what they were: The lights which illuminate Spaceship Earth shine up from the ground, and portions of the beams miss the building and continue into the sky. This light is impossible to see, unless something in the sky enters a beam and is illuminated by it. For reasons I still don&#39;t understand, sea gulls and bats make a habit of flying around this area after dark, entering and leaving the light beams continuously. From a distance it appears as if small, brightly lit objects are performing impossible acrobatic maneuvers in the sky. I&#39;m not surprised to see the few reports in your database that seem to refer to this phenomenon--I&#39;m an amateur astronomer used to observing the sky, and I found it quite startling the first time I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still Confused?<n>

Sky was clear and I was taking a walk as I usually do. It was just after sundown. I was walking East towards home and I saw a bright meteor flash above me heading from West to East. I merely thought I had seen a brilliant meteor. A week later while taking my walk and almost at the same time I again saw a brilliant meteor heading again West to East about the same brightness as the previous one. I thought &#34;how unusual to see two in about a week. About a week and a half later I didn&#39;t take my usual walk and was sitting in the living room and glanced out my picture window which faced East, and again saw a brilliant meteoric flash leaving a long trail and dissappearing over the roof of some distant houses. All three meteors were of similar intensity in brilliance which I thought very unusual. Especially to see 3 the same month and all were traveling West to East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  It is not unusual for three meteors to be seen in the same area over such a short period of time, but it is unusual for meteors to fly from west to east.  We do not know what the witness observed.  Note that several similar meteors have been seen in Washington State during the same time period.  PD))<n>

I soon asked my wife to come out and confirm what I saw. After getting binoculars we noticed that the light flashed with red, blue, and green lights and remained stationary. As we began to look around, we noticed 5 other of these objects and none moved for the first few minutes. One to the south east began to move erratically and after about 2 hours the object appeared to move further away. I don&#39;t know if it means anything, but almost every cow, mule, horse, and dog in the area was very upset  and this is nt normal. We looked again tonight and only saw one in the northeast sky. We also checked the lights against stars and planes....obviously they don&#39;t match up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Again, I was in an incredibly well-lit area, near the Lovers-Greenville intersection, and it was very bright.  The driver saw the object out of the corner of his eye.  I would say it was a shooting star, but it was different, much brighter, and just didn&#39;t look like any I had seen, and had no trail or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/3/03|Lake Buena Vista (Epcot Center)|FL|Unknown||How many time must I say this?|3/1/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35013.html|445|ndxe200311| Saw a triangular shaped craft that emmitted a beam directly at us and then followed over the top of our vehicle for a short distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday, November 2, 2003 my husband, my fifteen year old daughter and myself were coming home from a housewarming party we had attended for a co-worker of mine who lives in St. Paul.  We left her house that evening around 5:15-5:30 PM and drove our vehicle heading north on HWY 61 from the eastside of St. Paul to our destination in Forest Lake.  We had so much fun at the party that I turned off the radio in my SUV so we could talk all the way home about the good time we had.  There was a slight chill in the air that night, so I had the heater on blowing out heat, but the skies over us were dark but very clear.  As we approached Forest Lake on HWY 61 I was driving and my husband was in the passengers seat had reached over to turn off the fan for the heater.  We just started to reach town and had driven almost 26 miles now and our vehicle was quite warm on the inside.  The only sound was our discussion and the sound of the tires on the road.  At this time my daughter had taken out her prizes she had won from playing games at the housewarming party.  She won some nice jewlery and wanted my husband and I to look at it.  I turned and took a quick coutesy glance because I was driving and my husband began to examine her prizes.  We could see because we had now started to come into the out skirts of Forest Lake and there were street lights that some what lit up the inside of the vehicle.  I turned my gaze back to the road and off into the distance and coming from the east towards the west I saw some blinking lights.  At first I thought nothing of it, it must be a plane because we have a small air field on the south edge of town.  But on further examination the lights seemed to be different somehow.  They were different colors and seemed to be blinking faster than a plane would, almost in a sequence or pattern.  This had captured my attention and I could not take my eyes off of it.  I said to my husband and daughter, &#34;look you guys, over there up in the sky,what is it?&#34;  My husband said, &#34;where! ?&#34;  I said, &#34;over to the right.&#34;  &#34;It is coming from over by the chain of lakes this way.&#34;  I slowed my speed way down as I drove because we were approaching the south end of town.  I had noticed the lights blinking in the sky as I just passed the first set of stoplights on HWY 61 coming into Forest Lake.  I said to my husband, &#34;what is it?&#34;  He said, &#34;ah,it&#39;s only a plane.&#34;  But we all continued to watch it.  As we headed up to the second set of stop lights I had notice the  blinking lights became closer but still far enough away up in the sky for the shape to be unreckonizable.  The lights no longer were moving from east to west, but were now hovering to the right of HWY 61 above the homes behind the businesses that line HWY 61.  When we reached the stop light it was red and all three of us saw the lights stop blinking but they were still lit and the object quit hovering.  It proceeded from east to west so that it was above HWY 61 and then all of a sudden went in reverse and backed up very quickly, almost like it was lining itself up for something.  At this point my husband looked down to push the button to make the power window go down because I had said to him, look it just went backwards!  He said, &#34;I saw that!&#34;  That is why he wanted the window down so he could hear the sound that propellers make if a helicopter is overhead.  I said to my husband,&#34;that is no plane!&#34;  I asked him again, &#34;what is it?&#34;  He said, it is a helicopter, but I do not hear any sound.  He was busy pushing the button to make his window go all the way down, my daughter was putting her prizes away and I was looking straight ahead as we sat at the red light at the intersection of 11th and HWY 61.  I was in the lefthand turn lane to go west on 11th towards our home.  As I pondered what this might be for that split second.  All of a sudden this so called helicopter flashed a large beam of light down directly at us.  It flashed me right in the face.  I said to my husband and daughter in the back seat that object just flashed us. &#34;WH! Y?&#34;  My husband who had his windown down by now said, &#34;that is a search light, they must be looking for someone or something.&#34;  I told him, no.  This was different.  It was a light like a camera flash but as bright as fireworks, but only aimed directly at us in a beam.  My husband at this time stuck his head out of the window to hear for the sound of a helicopter.  He said, &#34;what the heck?&#34;  &#34;I do not hear anything!&#34;  So my daughter had pushed the button to make her window go down and stuck her head out the window too and she could not hear anything either.  But the object was too far up in the sky for us to make out the shape and form.  We only seen lights and at this point they were no longer blinking.  My husband noticed in the car next to us was a family looking at the same object in the sky.  They were not in the turn lane like us, but heading north on 61 into town  He said the father was on the drivers side and mother on the passesngers side in the frontseat.  They were looking straight ahead as if frightened, but there were two teenage girls in the back and they were looking out their side windows up at the object and he thought one was rolling her window down and was sticking her head out to get a better look at this thing that just flashed us.  At this point I said to my husband and daughter maybe it is one of those experimental government planes and they are taking it out for a spin and trying it out, but it bothered me that they flashed this light down right in our faces.  Well, at this point the stoplight finally turned green,it is a long light.  We could finally go and we thought we had seen the last of this object for good.  Both my husband and my daughter still had their windows down trying to hear for some sound, any type of sound.  There was none. As I made the turn they started to make a rukus about something.  So I turned to look in the direction they were looking and what I saw out my husbands window was this object come from the sky where we could only see it as lights and it wisked ! its way down to tree level.  &#34;Oh, my God!&#34;  What is it?  My husband stuck half of his body out of the rolled down window and my daughter stuck her head out the window and I peered through the front window upward driving very very slowly.  What was now directly above us we could not believe our eyes!  We were all seeing it very clearly.  Looking upwards we could see the underneath of this object.  What we seen was a large triangular craft.  The top point of the triangle was in the front and pointing the same direction as the headlights on our  SUV as I headed west on 11th Avneue.  This tip had a light in the point, maybe a couple feet wide.  The two other points forming the back (base of triangle) of the craft had also had the same lights in the tips.  When it first hovered above us these lights were a light yellowish glow.  Glow meaning the lights did not illuminate on us or the road beneath the craft.  This triangular craft was an equal lateral triangle, all sides the same length.  The craft hovered directly above us and followed us down the road a short distance.  It was just above the tree tops as it followed us.  The craft was as wide as the road from shoulder to shoulder and was approximately a school bus and and half large.  My husband is better with measurements than I am, but I am the one filling out this report so bear with me.  As the craft slowly moved along above us, I was going about 25-30 mph it changed the color of the lights underneath located in the tips of the triangle.  The front one was now red and the other two, green and blue.  The outside edges were glowing with a yelowishgreen light all the way around the outside perimeter of the craft and also the same thing aprox. 2-3 feet inward.  The middle of the triangle was dark against the night sky, but could not see the stars through it so we knew it was solid.  My husband has good eyesight and does not wear glasses he saw the underneath with half of his body stuck out of the window.  My daughter her whole head was out of the window look! ing up.  There was absolutely no sound!  I said to my husband and daughter this is awesome, kind of like being in a movie because this is something you do not see everyday.  My daughter got scared.  She said, &#34;you guys, I think this is a UFO we are seeing and it is really scarey!&#34;  I tried to assure her, but did not know what to say.  I told her maybe it is just a government experiment we are seeing, knowing it could be something more.  My husband said, &#34;well all I know for sure is no one can tell me this is a weather balloon.&#34;  As the craft followed us a short distance it went a little faster ahead so it was right infront of us still at tree level.  At this moment I noticed that I had this trucker without a load and just his rigg behind me right on my back bumper and he was practically running me off of the road.  But I held my ground.  Then the craft shot straight up directly over us and higher than the trees so it could navigate over them. Once it was up in the air it shot very quickly south over the trees and then down again.  At this point we could only see the red light and it seemed to skim across Clear Lake and disappear.  We could no longer see it through the trees.  The trucker behind us was going hysterical all over the road.  We finally turned off of 11th and the trucker drove fast and furiously down the road toward the other side of Clear Lake.  We think he was either following it or trying to get away from it.  When we got home we were so amazed by what we saw none of us spoke about it until the next day.  When I went to work I told a co-worker who was at the housewarming party.  She knew me and I felt she would not make fun of me for sharing this expeience with her.  Later that evening my husband and I talked about it, asking each other what was the flash and could there possibly be any explanation for what we seen.  The next morning at work I spoke with the same gal and told her we could not forget what we seen because it made such an immpression on us.  That morning I got on the internet! and looked up planes to see if there were any shaped like a triangle, not really expecting to find any, but had to look none the same.  Then I thought about what my daughter had said and I typed in the acronymn UFO for &#34;unidentified flying object&#34;.  My search engine brought up this site and on the home page as I scrolled down was a rough drawing of what I had seen.  I grabbed my co-worked after she hung up the phone and brought her over to my computer to show her the drawing on the web page.  She could not believe her eyes that it was there exactly how I decribed it.  I confided in a few others as they too overheard our discussion.  They know me and can vouche for my character.  This is not something I would make up.  I spoke with my husband at lunch that day and we were concerned about the flash we received.  We wanted to find a way to get in touch with those present that night.  I called one of the local newspapers and asked the gal who answered the phone if anyone called in to report something strange or unusual in the sky over Forest Lake Sunday night.  She laughed and said &#34;no&#34;.  I then called the competition newspaper and was able to speak with a reporter who to print the story and wanted our names and possibly picures.  He said, sounds like you seen a UFO and having our names will make it seem legitamate. This way if someone saw it they could call the newspaper and get in touch with us.  I told him, not with out my husbands permission, I would call him back the next day.  When I did he never answered the phone so I left a message.  After talking with my husband he did not want our identity given out since we live in such a small community and we are active members in one of the larger churches in town.  He did not want us to suffer harassment or to be humiliated by those not believing our story.  We both however are concerned about this beam of light flashing us and are concerned about what it could do to our health.  We were wondering if others who may have had similar experiences could somehow ! get through to us through this website and contact us to let us know if there are any side effects or long term conditions that arise as a result to being exposed to this beam of light.  At his point I want to say to the readers of my report that all three of us, my husband, my daughter and myself are church attending Christians.  We live in a small, but growing community.  We are respected members of our community and church and live busy lives.  My husband and myself both are employed and hold responsible full-time positions and my daughter has been in classes for gifted children and currently in advanced classes.  My husband and I are both educated and above average intelligence.  We have no need to make a fraudulent claim and waste our time and yours reading this report.  In our busy lives up until now there has not been a lot of time to spend contemplating the existence of what we have seen.  This sighting has changed the way we view things and we will never be able to look at the night sky the same way.  If there is a logical explanation for what we saw we want to find it.  If there is not we will realize that this is probably a once in a lifetime experience.  Thank-You for reading our story and if you have any experience with being flashed with a beam of light from a triangular craft we would like to know about it.  Please contact the wonderful people who dedicate their time and energy to maitaining this site.  Hopefully they will put you in touch with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;The three of us&#34;<n>

I fed the baby puted back to bed and watch the sky full of stars. First I saw bright light by the signal tower, it was very strong reflected in the mirror in the bedroom, it was on for about 2-3 min. and dimmed away slowly and I could see something flying away small red and green light south. I wake up my fiance and explained what happend, he smilled and went back to bed, at this moment another light came out (fiance got up and watched with me) same place by tower, no movement, another light came out, so we have 2 bright lights for another 2-3 minutes, slowly fading away and flying away south. Next that light coming again but closer and it looked like a huge triangle with lights on top, no sound going north direction above the houses. Next light by the tower again this time going towards our house, fast, looking like a boomerang, v shaped 3 lights on top, past our 2 story house, by the window, could see under dimmed brownish lights and when it was above the roof it started the engine sounded like motorcycle trying to start. we had a feeling like it knew we are watching and it made us aware of it self. I called local police departament to find out if there was any military action or helicopters flying by the tower-negative!!!! I didn&#39;t belive in ufo&#39;s until today, I am scared they gonna come back and then what call 911?  Why we have no protection from government?  I would like to know what flew over my house tonight!!!  No one is going to belive me anyways.<n>

The car in front of us approximately 1/4 mile ahead slammed on their brakes and turned and sped off the road quickly.  My husband asked me if I saw the strange lightening in the sky. I didn&#39;t think it was lightening because it was white pulsing flashes. I thought it must be from a tower. But neither of us had ever noticed a tower on this road before. As we drove closer to the light I looked up out the passenger car window and witnessed 5 or 6 circular blue lights in a semi-circle. Underneath the blue lights were a red and white ring of pulsing lights. The pulsed white light illuminating from the object and flashed across the sky. The light pulsed every few seconds. I couldn&#39;t see the shape of the object because it was too dark. I only saw it for a couple seconds and it was gone. The white lightening was also gone. All my husband saw was a flash of blue lights within the white light then nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Today is the 28th I believe, of november and this all happened last week. I have had my own encounters and sightings in the past, but recently I have had a lot of odd dreams about them. My mother as well(in montreal)has been having dreams of the same sort. We seem to have a heredity problem of the alian sort. I hate to talk about it but we both have marks. me on my foot, her the head. I only met her when I was 25 (I was adopted) you could imagine my surprise to find out That I wasnt nuts or alone(the family I grew up in did not believe in such things).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was barely discernable because it&#39;s glow was so dim, but it looked much larger than I would expect any craft that high up to be.  If my estimate of its height was in error it should not have been so dim or silent.  I see planes in the sky all the time because I live near the Honolulu airport and I have even seen many helicopters in the night sky flying without their lights on, so it was startling to see something so very different in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I looked south and noticed a bright pink-orange stationary round light aligned over a tall building in Portland&#39;s downtown.  I had a camera with me so I stopped on the overpass.  Trying to zoom in to the object, I saw in the viewfinder a very bright &#34;burning ember&#34; uniform light over the full visible area of the object.  However I was unable to snap the picture due to underexposure.  I reframed at less zoom factor and was able to get the shot, emailed separately, PICT0145-1.jpg.  By the time I got the shot, the object had dimmed considerably while shrinking in size, and I was not sure I even got it.  The picture has a 10x scaled up blow-up of the object.  It was not an airplane or helicopter, the light was too large for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I see things like this, I wait to report to see if anyone else reported it.  Turns out between 11-1 and 11-8-2003 there were several other western U.S. sightings of spheres like this object from New Mexico to Seattle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As i got closer It wasnt moving. I tried to get even closer by turning down some roads that would get me under it, but I was blocked by a couple trees and it then vanished.  I was on my way to a local resturant to meet my wife for lunch.  I told her about the event.  Once we departed she headed back to work (approx 40 min later) she got out of her car, and when she looked up in the sky she witnessed a red streaming like objectmoving quickly across the sky.  Others in the parking lot witnessed this as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a very cloudy day. I saw this medium grey object through my windshield. It was moving right to left (north to south) and It looked like something descending through the clouds. As I watched it move across my windshield I was waiting for it to break out of the clouds but it never did. I believe it was traveling away from me and not descending. It moved very fast from right to left and then it made a sharp turn to the right and then back to the left agiain then disappeared behind some trees on the horizon. It seemed to kind of change axis when it made its turns. I would estimate it was probably 3 miles or so away when I lost sight of it. It was medium grey or a dark silver color and was about a half an inch long as it appeared through my windshield. At the speed it was traveling, and the abrupt zig-zag pattern it took, there is no way this could have been any kind of airplane. It was skimming through the clouds and did&#39;nt appear to be very high up in them. This was my first UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 2-3 minutes apart in length.  I at first looked up to see if there was an airplane in the sky - but the noise went away much too quicky to be an airplane.  I was outside smoking a cigarette and my five year old son had followed me.  He kept asking me what that sound was and his interpretation was that it was a volcano with hot lava :-)  We heard it 7 or 8 times - and I finally decided to go in the house after not seeing anything.  It sounded like something hovering and then speeding away real fast.  There was cloud cover but I didn&#39;t see any lights or anything.  I have seen things on past occasions but just chalked it up basically to being crazy.  I wish I would have taped these noises however.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They saw a small ball of light rise from the ground to the sky. The color of the light was a yellow-white color. It was very bright and making very rapid movements! They also said that it left a trail behind it. My husband and his friend are in the Navy, and there is a Navy Airstation very close to their siting. They are convinced that it is not from the government! The light reappeared, turned red. They said it seemed to vanish as if leaving the atmosphere. I have never seen my husband so disturbed! He couldn&#39;t sleep!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have checked for launches from Vandenberg AFB for this date, and our data show that none occurred.
