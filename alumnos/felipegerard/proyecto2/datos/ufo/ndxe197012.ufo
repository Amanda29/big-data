Like i could feel it observing me<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was around 7 years old, we just came back from a Christmas event for kids at the vfw in a nearby town.  I was outside on the front lawn playing with a boardgame I got at the event and had a strange feeing something was looking at me.  I looked up and approx. 20-30 feet above my head was an object that I thought was falling toward me and I scrambled into the bushes near where I was sitting,  I turned around from beneath the bushes and looked up and there was a cylindrical object, looked kinda like a duffel bag painted silver with some what looked like smoke stains near the bottom and it was hovering.  I ran in the house and got my mom, she came out and when she did it had slowly risen and was gaining altitude and proceeding across the street.when I pointed it out to her it was at least a couple hundred feet away and slowly gaining altitude and speed, though still fairly slow.  It then started to tumble as it gained altitude and proceeded over the field across the ! street still gaining altitude till it was no longer visible.   it traveled fairly slow and tumbled in a controlled fashion.  I thought it made some kind of intermittent beeping but with a good pause between tones.  About all I remember, was just a kid.  My dad made fun of me later  But my mom always told me not to worry about him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>
12/24/70|Colorado Springs (50 miles west of)|CO|Rectangle||Growing-up with aliens|2/22/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41849.html|2|ndxe197012| Growing-up with aliens<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting that I am about to report took place many years ago when I was 16, the date was Christmas Eve 1970. My grandparents owned a very large and remote cattle ranch and our family had enjoyed a wonderful evening togather and all had long since retired for the evening. I was awakened out of a dead sleep for some reason. I had fallen asleep in the living room on the couch with a huge picture window directly behind me. It was a winter wonderland outside with nearly three feet of snow and a thin cloud bank that was draped over Pikes Peak off in the distance and magically lighted by a full moon. Feeling totally awake, I turned around to really take in this enchanting scene. Then, I saw something that I couldn&#39;t believe, a tiny cloud moved away from the moon and fully lighted the valley where our ranch house was nestled. Not more than four football fields out from the house I noticed a big black shadow being cast down onto our meadow. What made me take notice was that the shadow had perfectly straight lines on the snow. I then realized that this cloud which I couldn&#39;t see due to our overhanging porch had straight edges. Impossible, I thought! so, at 2:30 in the morning and 20 below zero, I step outside on the porch in my longjohns and gazed up. what I saw, I&#39;ll never forget, a massive black rectangle shaped object just floating over our meadow! I ran back into the house, jumped into my coat and snow boots and took off running across the meadow toward the craft. Within a matter of four minutes, I was standing directly under it and realized it was less than 300 hundred feet above me. This craft was silent and it had no lights or windows that I could see. It must have been 1500 feet long and 400-500 feet tall and 300 feet thick. I stood under that thing for as long as i could stand the cold. It did nothing. So, I finally just went back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was very strange about this was that the entire time I was looking at it I &#34;felt&#34; safe and somehow knew that &#34;They&#34; were mining for minerals. As I was growing up on the ranch there was an area on the ranch that you could not go to. Horses would refuse to go into this area and if I forced the issue they would go crazy and start bucking. I never could walk into that range of small mountains. If I did a very strange overpowering fear would sweep over me until I turned around and crossed that invisable boundry and instantly it would go away.I learned from the  horses where the boundry line was and it never changed. For all I know it&#39;s still in place. I had numerous encounters with beings and craft on the ranch growing up. The most beautiful craft of all that I saw twice, was a golden teardrop shape. Always, coming or leaving this area that was around 3000 acres. It was common knowledge on the ranch about that location. It was a family joke that we always knew where the cattle and the horses weren&#39;t. When I was a kid I would take friends to the borderline and we would run into the area in an attempt to try and tease the aliens. I found out in short order that they weren&#39;t amused. Because, I began having terrible nightmares. I knew it was them so I went back to the boundry line and shouted to them that I was sorry and I wouldn&#39;t bother them again. That night the nightmares ended and so did my trips to the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You might say I&#39;ve grown-up with aliens. I&#39;ve seen them. Some look like us, others, the old wise ones are on average 7 feet tall with elongated skulls with blue translucent bodies. They are trillions of years older than we are and are very gental and loving. I have had two of them appear before me from time to time to check-in on me. They watched me grow-up as an only child on our huge very isolated ranch and I always could feel them protecting me when I was alone in the forest. They love us and consider us their children. They have come back now to help us through what is coming. They will soon introduce themselves to the world. That is why you are seeing so many ships. The blue beings don&#39;t need spacecraft, they are far more advanced. They travel by thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They have showed me what is coming. A global nuclear war that will distroy nearly all of America, Europe, Russia and China. There is an alien faction that is running the New World Order. But, they&#39;re no match for the &#34;Blue Beings&#34;. They aren&#39;t here to stop it. They are here to pick-up the broken pieces and help us start to rebuild once again. The new center of growth and knowledge will be Venezuela. During the war that entire country will be covered by a protective dome of energy. If you want a good time-line watch very carefully what happens between Venezuela and the NWO. More and more there&#39;s going to be agression aimed at Venezuela by Bush and the NWO. Everyone will think it&#39;s for the oil. Not so, it&#39;s about &#34;The City&#34; There&#39;s a massive underground city built by a confederation of aliens hidden in the southern jungle of Venezuela preparing to re-build mankind. Tesla,Marconi and Fulcanille were involved. I have met personally, two high ranking Venezuelan officers who interface with &#34;the City&#34;. The NWO knows full well about this city but, are powerless to do anything about it. My entire life has been about what I&#39;ve just related starting with my first trip deep into the Venezuelan jungles in 1989 exploring for gold and diamonds. That is when I first learned of the city and was once again visited by the two &#34;Blue Beings&#34; who showed me what is coming. There is much more to this story, I&#39;ve just hit the highlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can only state that what I was shown in 1989, appears to be falling in line with what is now taking place. The NWO is looking for something, something that would give them power and control over the &#34;Blue Beings&#34;, what they&#39;re looking for is hidden in the jungle. However, they will never find them and that is why they are doomed and there time is running out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Thinking I had perhaps instigated a traffic violation, I pulled over. I looked rearward and saw nothing, no police car, nothing. I then looked to my immediate right and saw an immense ufo hovering over the tree tops. It appeared to be about 50 yds. or more in diameter and was oval in shape. It seemed to be made of a shiny metal similiar to aluminum. The craft was very luminous. The object just sat there,no noise or any sounds. I looked for approximately five minutes and left. I looked backward to see if it was still there but it had vanished. My feelings were that they wanted me to see the craft. It was so close that I could have hit it with a rock. I&#39;ve never had any sightings since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

12/15/70 21:00|Newton Centre|MA|Other|3-5 seconds|Vertical trapazoid having a glowing pale yellow cloor and gliding across the sky with a wallowing motion.|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76949.html|5|ndxe197012| Vertical trapazoid having a glowing pale yellow cloor and gliding across the sky with a wallowing motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am recounting this sighting because of a reported UFO landing that came to my attention through a Coast-to-Coast radio show a year or so ago.  During that show, it was mentioned that a UFO reportedly touched down in Dover, Massachusetts, in the early 1970s, with reported ground sightings.   As such, a friend and I may have seen the UFO entry as it approached Dover.  The following it what we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were setting up a telescope to begin some experiments with astrophotography.  It was during the late fall or early winter of circa 1970 in Newton Centre, Massachusetts.  The time was about 9:00 p.m. and it was a clear moonless night, no wind but cold.  As I was adjusting the telescope mount, my friend said, &#34;Look at that!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and between a large clearing in the trees was an object silently gliding across the sky at about 45 degrees above the horizon out of the NNE heading in a southerly direction<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had the shape of a pie pan being viewed from edge on or in other words a trapezoid geometry.  It was tipped up almost vertical (maybe leaning 10 degrees to the right) with the shorter base of the trapezoid on the right and the longer base of the trapezoid on the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The length of the longer base was about the diameter of a nickel held at arms length.  The entire surface of the trapezoid was a pale yellowish color, which appeared to deepen to a yellowish-orange as it passed out of our site and behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no noise nor emitted any visible exhaust trail as it glided across our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly, it did appear to interact with the air as its movement was one of a wallowing as if it were spilling air as it moved along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of us had seen anything like this before or since and cannot explain it based on anything we can account for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

12/15/70 00:40|Flisa, Solør, Hedemark (Norway)||Disk|10 minutes|3 disks with firetails,moving quite fast over a mountain, went vertically up in a flash and diseapeared.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03555.html|6|ndxe197012| 3 disks with firetails,moving quite fast over a mountain, went vertically up in a flash and diseapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure of the year or date, it was after midnight, somewhere between 1969-72, I was very young maybe 8-10 years old, parents withnessed. We came home from my aunt and uncle and it was no other vehicle around. When I saw it, I told my parents to stop the car and shut the lights off. I felt instinctivily it was what we had to do. We wached the objects flowing over the small mountain range for maybe 3-4 minutes. It was absoluttelly silent. They were quite distant, but anyway, the winter night and cold had brought sound if there were any. SInce this wasn&#39;t any fantasy objects, and no outrageing things beyond this happend, I believe it is a trustworthy sight, and not some exagerated nonsens. No big deal, but we saw them. They were not aviation or other. Just three ufo, that&#39;s that. No sound, clear winter cold sky. --  --  -- formation, firetails which started somewhere in the midle of the crafts could have been from a jet, but it wasn&#39;t. The speed of diseapearance was to fast, and they just went straight up to the universe in a faster than eye flash. Well, it was not a special thing beside of I saw what I saw, and can&#39;t denie the fact, but we was a little stunned I remember. I wonder if there were more sightings in norway that time around that area, close to the Swedish border, about two hours drive from Oslo(pretty deserted at that time, forests). I do not believe in anything before I see it, and I saw it. The crafts moved from the right to the left at the nightsky, and all held the same tempo. They also vertically went straigh up in the same formation, but this time the first one at the first, and the next one , and the next, like a neckless. It looked like they took of upwards without changing the horizontal position of the crafts, like that modern airforce jet which can lift veritcal stright up. The crafts was never landing, just flying (flowing) and then svishh....I am sure no planes ever have been built to have that speed of accellaration in just less than a second, then or now. Well, this isn&#39;t ! a big record to remember, but I thought I just mention it. I am a sceptic so I really never speak much about such things, but I know we are not alone anyway. Any intelligent non arrogant person should understand that. The color was light yellow glowing like any distant light for instance from a strong light and not changing, so was the fire tails but you could clearly see what was the firetails, since the object moved. I dont know if to call it disk, or oval horizontal eggshapes, pancaces whatever. Thank you for reading my bad english grammar. Sincerelly ((Name deleted))<n>

I spoke to my mom about it and she reminded me of a story of when i was only six months old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Grandmother was driving, my father was in the passinger side and my mother was in the back seat with me. They were by Kirtland Air Force base late in the evening.  I was just a baby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The surounding area was not built up yet, so most of it was field.  By the field there was this huge object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom said it was one shape than it transformed into another, almost like a crown.  She said that they lights were moving down the side of it were brilliant and colorful and we still don&#39;t have any technology like htis.  She said that all three had gotten out of the car to look at this object.  She said it was huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were very phospherious and then it was just gone. She tells me this same story all the time, but she is afraid to talk about it publicaly.  Especially because at the time my father was a military man.<n>
12/1/70 16:30|Union|NJ|Disk|30 minutes|UFO over 5 Points, Union , NJ|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93305.html|8|ndxe197012| UFO over 5 Points, Union , NJ<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were 4 professional young adults, ages 22-25 ou on a quick grocery run to the A &amp; P in a very busy location known as Five Points.   We parked in the lot facing the store.  One of us ran in to get the item, the rest remained in the vehicle/VW Camper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting quietly waiting when suddenly the person in the front, passenger seat exclaimed, &#34;Holy s--- , I see something coming up in the side view mirror and it ain&#39;t no plane!!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all said, &#34;Huh, what?&#34;   Then, by that time we saw it, it was over then behind the store several hundred feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We can best describe it as a perfect, seamless, metalic saucer with sequential white lights, almost like strobe lights flashing.  The object was quiet, and hovered for quit a while. One of us ran into the store to get the 4th person. We checked people in the lot and saw many looking up too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point the craft/UFO &#39;s lights went off, another time ir flew up , high fast, then came down low. We actually thought it may land, but it always remained above the store roof, actually behind, but up,  We watched it oo up and down, figured they were testing the craft by now....finally it just took off, went north east toward the Garden State Parkway, very low, then took off like you see in Star Trek.  We were able to view it in the night sky though because of it lights.  We could see it move east toward Newark Airport then in 3 sec west, it was like a star moving across the sky, making all sorts of sudden stops, right hand turns at 90 degree angles.  Definitely seemed as if they were checking it out. We left the parkway when we no longer saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
