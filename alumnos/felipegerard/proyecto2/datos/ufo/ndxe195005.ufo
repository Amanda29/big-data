I lay on my back and looked straight up to see two triangular craft manuvering as if they were having an aerial dog fight.  They would turn at sharp angles.  The sky was very clear.  They were so high they looked very small.  After manuvering around for awhile overhead they went off in a straight line so fast they were gone within a second.  This was a couple or three days before I was discharged on May 15, 1950.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
