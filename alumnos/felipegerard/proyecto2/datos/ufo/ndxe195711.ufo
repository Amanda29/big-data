Ground speed about 25000 kt, altitude at least 30000ft. recorded on scope camera. observed by other radar sites across Canada<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was an early warning radar operator in the USAF on St Lawrence Island. We observed a target, unidentified, in Soviet airspace heading east at high speed. Our first thought was that it was some type of missile. We turned on the scope camera and notified the site commander. The object was estimated at 25000kt. The first contact was at about 200 miles, which would make it very high or very large.<n>
11/10/57 19:00|Corpus Christi|TX|Light|10 minutes|UFO over Corpus Christi near naval yard on November 10, 1957|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32615.html|2|ndxe195711| UFO over Corpus Christi near naval yard on November 10, 1957<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, my mother and myself we on our way to a baseball game. As we were passing the naval yard a brightly glowing ball of light came down and almost hit our car. I pulled off the road. We were terrified. The light was like magneseum burning it was so bright. After a minute or so it shot up into the sky so fast we could hardly track it with our eyes. My mother suggested that we leave and notify the authorities. While driving the craft was following us at a high altitude. The first house we stopped at would not let us use the phone. We stopped again and made our call. The people that talked to me said what we saw was a weather balloon. I told him ((word deleted--equivalent of &#34;No!&#34;), I know what I saw and it was not a weather balloon. To this day I remember it like it happened yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  He indicates a precise date for the event.  PD))<n>
11/10/57 17:00|Teaneck|NJ|Cylinder|2 minutes|Cylinder UFO followed by disc seen in fall of 1957 over northern New Jersey|2/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42071.html|3|ndxe195711| Cylinder UFO followed by disc seen in fall of 1957 over northern New Jersey<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing in my parent&#39;s front yard in the fall of 1957 when I observed a gold colored cylinder shaped like a cigarette moving in an easterly direction toward New York City.  It was a clear blue sky.   Our home was in the town of Teaneck in northern New Jersey which is just 3 or 4 miles west of Manhattan.   The cylinder was traveling in the direction of its long axis.    It was blunt or squared off on both ends.   It gave the impression of being at the altitude of a jetliner (Boeing 707&#39;s were just beginning to fly around 1957).     But of particular interest was that the cylinder was followed by a gold colored circular object that was about one length of the cylinder to the rear.   Both objects traveled in tandem.    The circular object was no wider than the width of the cylinder.   At first I thought it might be Sputnick and the booster that put it in orbit.     Besides the fact that the round object was following the cylinder, I also knew that Sputnick was too small to be seen by the naked eye.   I knew it wasn&#39;t an aircraft since it was not tapered in the front and rear and in addition there were no wings visible.    Years later I read that cylindrical shaped UFO&#39;s had often been observed with disc shaped UFO&#39;s that were sometimes seen entering or leaving the cylinder UFO.   I&#39;d guess this was one of those cylinder &#34;carrier&#34; UFO&#39;s with an accompanying disc.  It would be very interesting if others also observed this cylinder UFO in the greater NYC area in the fall of 1957.    I come from a family of scientists and engineers (my dad was a MIT grad) and I love science myself so I believe I am a reasonably objective observer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
