It was a windy night and I actually had to get up in the darkness to put rocks inside my tent to keep it from blowing away. (I had tent stakes for earth not for sand). I got up early since I wasn’t really sleeping and decided to leave early in the predawn to drive back home to Santa Fe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove in the darkness on Hwy 180 north through Reserve and past Datil to catch Hwy 60.  On an open flat stretch of highway where there were absolutely no other vehicles and as the dawn gave some light to the land I caught the flash of silver in the distance to my front/right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a silver object flying in the sky parallel and low to the land but headed for the next set of mountains to the north. As I look now at Google Maps I see a section of the Cibola National Forest that rises up from flat valley where I was driving. Once again, it was on Hwy 60 just past Datil. I was driving north and the UFO was flying north. I would say that the UFO was at least 10 miles away and of course in the New Mexico desert you can spot things over some distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I have been an amateur astronomer since my youth in the 1960s and I’ve seen all manner of natural, normal sky phenomena including weather balloons and also identifying Venus and other planets. And I’ve often observed planes, jets and helicopters. But the way this UFO approached the mountain was unlike any earth based flying machine I had ever seen before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not gain altitude in advance of the mountain which I would expect a jet plane to do but rather stayed low, hugged the mountain and then quickly flew out of sight. I found a safe place to pull over about a mile or two later and just waited and looked to where I’d last seen it but it didn’t reappear. I continued my drive and passed the Very Large Array Telescopes and a few months later I read in the Santa Fe Reporter that other folks had reported UFO activity near the VLA.<n>

I followed it as it moved similar pace to my 60mph driving speed as I watched off and on while driving (no shoulder to pull over on) the wierdest thing,and I never heard anyone ever descire this one before,my vision changed to everything having a green tint to it the road signs the road other headlights from on coming cars! as if I was wearing a green filter over my eyes,It really scared me for a while it started to wear off after about a half hour or so, but the only thing I could think of was that bright light I was observing!<n>

Why I want to tell someone now is beyond me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a b.s. story.  I imagine you get many, even that open with the same line.  I do not question whether it really happened because it wasn&#39;t something I just saw, but it had a physiological effect on me that I somehow subverted its purpose (I will explain), and I even felt that I had some kind of telepathic communication with.  Please forgive runon sentences, but it is easier to just run with it because at first I thought that I didn&#39;t want to waste my time writing it for fear that the written account would loose how I would recall the event verbally because there is no doubt that when I tell the experience it is more meaninful due to whatever it is that makes verbal incantation actually take you there again and visualize and feel it all.  I will however try to be inclusive as possible so you can do what you will with the data. I can&#39;t remember the year exactly, definitely not the month or the day.  I do know however that I was having a good semester and it was warm outside which leads me to thinking it was the spring of 1990 or 1991, making me about 21 or 22 at the time.  I lived at mom&#39;s house then and my bed was situated such that my head was directly below the window.  The window had one of the first model of storm windows that were marketed about 20 years ago which I think is significant because it was partly responsible for waking me up at I don&#39;t know what time but it had to be between 1:30 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. I woke up because the window was vibrating and I heard a sound coming from somewhere.  I gathered my senses enough to really wonder what the hell that low humming sound was, I for a second thought it was a semi tractor trailor idling out in the street of our neighborhood, but I knew the sound could not be that.  So I sit up to look out the window and can&#39;t really see anything, but I know that from whatever the sound is coming it is close by.  So I stand up and feel kind of like I&#39;m hazy-sleepy, like when you fight getting out of bed in the morning, stand up and feel kind of a head rush, sort of.  But I AM very aware at this point, just going against some resistance.  I walk out onto the deck behind our house that is directly attached to my room.  I look left, down the street, to the house where the Mort family used to live before the people that live there when this event occurred.  I can&#39;t remember their names now, Lothman maybe, but they had two little children and we practically never saw them in the several years they lived there.  It is a good sized house about 250 yards down the street, sitting up on a hill, a three story house that really sticks up from where it sits.  Above that house, I saw it instantly, was the space ship.  It was saucer shaped I guess, but not pointy.  Shit wish I could draw it for you.  Since I can&#39;t...it was fucking big, but not too big.  The house I&#39;m guessing is 60-70 feet wide looking at it from the front which I was, and the ship was at least 50 feet wider, and I&#39;m guessing about 30-40 feet thick.  It looked like a fat saucer, like you take a rubber ball, the size of a tennis ball, and squeeze it by pressing it on a table untill it is 3 to 4 times longer than wide, but with a slight bevel leading up to the center consol on top.  The top and bottom were distinct.  It was hovering about 20 feet directly their house.  It was definitely using caution because it had all its lights off except for a row or two that were very dimmed, all the way around, plus up at the Cabin I gues! s for lack of any better word.  I could not see it doing anything.  I did know that the sound was coming from the ship.  And when I stood there staring at it for about 1.5 minutes I could really tune in the sound and feel it stronger now that I realized it was really there.  What I felt was that it was very low frequency, and it had an almost intoxicating effect on me.  I thought that this is what they are using as method to ensure that everyone in the neighborhood remains sleeping.  Especially since it was actually quite a soothing feeling, such that I now realize that I was just standing there staring at this thing for 3 or 5 minutes just amazed and nothing else.  Then I realized that they knew I was looking at them.  And I remember thinking to myself and to them, &#34;I don&#39;t care what you&#39;re doing here, just please don&#39;t do anything to me.&#34;  Then the craft raised up silently above the house about 100 feet, then it just took off like you would expect from an advanced ufo.  So fast that it just left a streak.  When it left on two vectors.  First to the right slightly, up and away for about an inch of streak, then back slightly to the left and straight away at an upward angle out of the atmosphere I imagine leaving a big streak. I have no other evidence than this story.  I would certainly like to investigate that family who lived in the house the ufo was over.  This is the only written version of this event, although I have told a handful of people over the years since it happened.  You can call me for a drawing if you want.  I&#39;m no artist but I can try.  Thanks for your interest.  Let me know if this experience is worth anything, I would appreciate the kickback.  But don&#39;t get me wrong I am honest to God writing this as it happened to me, and its certainly not for any other motivation other than to present the story to someone who will actually find it yet another piece of evidence to support that there really are ufos.  I guess I have to believe there are.  I just hope to God there is never an Independence Day.  Thank you.<n>

It was a clear night. As I was walking out of the gas station with my cigarettes and back across the parking lot I had this funny feeling to look up. When I looked up there was a star shaped craft flying right over the Exxon sign. The craft was about 60 feet up flying about 15 mph, I immediatly knew it was a UFO and ran to the sidewalk to get a better view, it flew right over my head, travelling east to west, the street lights on Magnolia lit up the bottom of the craft. It was star shaped, 4 pointed, approx 35 feet long, 30 feet wide, highly polished grey metallic, the points appeared conical, curving from point to point, it appeared thicker in the middle approx 5 feet thick, it had no lights flashing, no windows, no landing gear, no engines, no lettering or numbers on it and it made absolutly no sound as it flew down the street into downtown Knoxville. It had just turned Easter at the time of the sighting. I watched the craft go down the street untill it vanished into the darkened sky. I felt totally in awe seeing and watching the craft. I dont use drugs or drink and am a professional artist with 5 years of college training in the arts. I went back to my apt and told my roommate of the sighting and he laughted in my face, eventually I told my parents and they as well thought I was nuts. I was 27 at the time of the sighting. Thats it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Those &#34;lights&#34; were far from us, above a dark hill next to my neighborhood not that high in the sky, exactly aligned to the front of my eyesight. I was puzzled and I asked my BF who was facing me to take a look and I asked him what it was. He took a quick look and told me those were helicopters. I quickly answered back: &#34;unless there are two helicopters next to each other just standing there....&#34; and then I noticed it couldn&#39;t be because there were 3 lights forming an obtuse triangle and helicopters just don&#39;t stop in the sky NEXT TO EACH OTHER.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to believe my BF, so I said goodbye, came inside the house, closed all the windows (that my parents would always keep open) and went to bed shaking. I calmed myself down and fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next morning I called my best friend as I usually would do every morning and the first thing she says is: &#34;do you remember last night when you dropped me home and we saw the guy&#39;s cars outside but the guys were not there?&#34; Since my best friend was a quiet, smart girl the way she was trying to tell me something was wrong made me feel as scared as the night before. I asked her what happened. She said that when she went inside her house the guys (her brother and his friends) were inside, scared, and told her that minutes before they were out in the street as usual when they saw a round light standing there in the sky and then they saw smaller lights coming into the bigger light and then separating away. They went up to the roof of the house saw the lights for a couple of minutes and then the lights flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I believed what I saw was a UFO but I tried to supress the memory of it until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FYI, I lived in the rural part of town, SouthWest of &#34;downtown&#34; Cabo Rojo and my friend lived East of the center of downtown Cabo Rojo, which is a 5 minute drive away. All of the witnesses were older than 20 years old and College students.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

THIS OBJECT SCARED ME BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET OR LOWER FROM THE GROUND, IT WAS JET BLACK AND THREE ANTENA COMMING OUT FROM ITS SHAPE AT DIFFERENT ANGLES, ONE AT THE TOP AND THE TWO OTHERS FROM THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES OF THE LOWER BOTTOM. THE UFO WOULD ONLY MOVE WHEN THE ATENA WERE OUT STRETCHED, AND STOP WHEN RETRACTED. NO SOUND,NO COMTRAILS JUST MOVEING SLOWLY AND BOUNCING UP AND DOWN SLOWLY AS THOUGH IT WAS HAVING PROBLEMS MAINTAIN ALTITUDE, I DID SEE A COMMERCIAL PLAN AT A DISTANCE BUT THIS OBJECT WAS NOT CONCERN. IT STOPPED JUST IN FRONT OF OUR EASY VIEW AS THOUGH IT COULD SEE US WATCHING,THEN SLOWLEY MOVED ON. I HATE THAT I HAD NO CAMERA IT WOULD HAVE BEEN  AND END TO THOSE BLURED UFO PICTURES PEOPLE SHOW.<n>

((name deleted)) and Me went out back in the pool area and I first saw a Bluish/Green area in the clouds looking towards North. At first I thought it might be a plane or something but it didn&#39;t move.  I pointed this out to ((name deleted)) and Me . Calling ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted)) out they saw it too.  Staring at it((name deleted))and ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted)) ou said &#34;It&#39;s a Laser beam&#34; After following his directions, it was a Bluish/Green beam going from North to SouthEast. It was curious because it did not angle Down or up from the earth.  We concluded it must have been transversing the sky in space. We called every organization we could think of and no one else reported anything and they tried to suggest that it was from Disney land?? It was not from there, it was in space cutting across our atmosphere.  It was there at about 8:35pm or 9:35pm four about an hour. After awhile above us there were 4 or 5 giant orange flashes, no sound. Our conclusion after some more investigation; The space shuttle just happened to be in orbit at these times and the above occurred for about 3 day&#39;s after our initial sighting.  The flashes however were only seen by us that first night. This happened almost 10 years ago and we are reasonably sure that it was some test by the government in our space shuttle program. I heard you on Artbell and decided to get this off my chest since you sounded sincere in trying to collect data on sightings of various events. It was a laser beam tested 10 years ago. No doubt in our minds. What it shot at? What were the large orange flashes? Somebody knows but not us.  Thanks for letting me post this in your database. I hope the truth someday comes out about these things. Sincerely and with Kind Regards, -((personal data deleted))<n>

Then three light balls appeared less then 30 feet from me appearing as multishaft lucite stars with rods emanating from center 15 feet in diameter floating one foot above ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired air traffic controller and I have an airline transport pilot license. I&#39;ve been trained specifically to see and interpret correctly what I see in the sky and on radar. Technically speaking, people like me are the most credible of witnesses. Not that that will convince the people with their heads in the sand but for what it&#39;s worth, I saw three UFOs and they were, at their closest approach, no more than 20 feet (not less than 15 and not more than 25 feet) from me. I was parked in a tourist attraction parking lot in Ponce, Puerto Rico at a place called &#34;El Vigia&#34;. There were at least 30 other people there with their friends listening to music from their car radios or portable radios. Some were drinking. I was not. It was April 9, 1990. I got to the parking lot right after dark. I watched the moon rise. It was a lovely night and I was enjoying the full moon. At about 9:00 P.M. the moon became obscured by clouds. Then the clouds began to boil just like in the movie cucoon. This thunder cell of clouds or whatever it was (it made no sound) began moving from east to west towrds the city of Ponce. I was somewhat worried but just kept standing outside my car and watching it move. It was lighted from inside with a white glow. I could here the gasps and oos and ahhhs from the people around the parking lot. After about 15 minutes of this two lights shot out of this cloud formation I estimated to be at about 6,000 feet maximum altitude at 2000 plus miles an hour and moved south, made a hairpin turn and went north and disappeared. Then I heard this poof sound and three 15 foot diameter light balls appeared in front of me at about 20 feet away (one poof sound for each ball), floated across the parking lot about 2 feet above the gound  for about 3 minutes and disappeared with the same poof sound. These &#34;light balls&#34; as I call them looked like giant sea urchins with clear lucite rods  extending fom the center in a star burst design. Another similar item is a fiber optic lamp with straight fibers bristling ! out of it. The rods all came from a compact center. They were basically all glowing with a white light and rotating slight lightly and lazily as they floated along.I observed that the black asphalt beneath the light balls was lit as the balls passed over. A couple of 4 year old children practically walked into the leading light ball. The children turned away towards there parents with their arms above their heads and ducking their heads as if something was bothering them (similar to what a child woud do if a bee was buzzing around him). They quickly got away from the light balls. I clearly saw each ball disappear with a poof sound. To someone who didn&#39;t know that stars are huge infernos in the sky such as the sun, would assume that these were stars. The boiling cloud slowed to a normal cumulus formation. It all happened in about 20 minutes. I left about 30 minutes later but spoke to nobody else there about what we had all seen because I didn&#39;t know anybody there. No one approached me either. It was all very pretty but I saw no purpose in it. Has anybody seen anything like this ?<n>
