8/31/05 23:30|St. Louis (Mehlville)|MO|Disk|20-30 seconds|Saw a strange hovering object move across road.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45952.html|1|ndxe200508| Saw a strange hovering object move across road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling west on Forder Rd. in St.louis, Mo on August 31st, 2005 at approximately 11:35. As i was driving, I noticed an object traveling across the road at a very low and smooth pace.  My first thought was that it was a helicopter, but as i approached the object, it became very clear to me that it was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the object not more than 200ft from me and my windows down, you would think, had it been a helicopter, the sound of rotating blades would be more than enough to assure me it was in fact a helicopter.  The bright object which consisted of very familiar colors (red, green, and white) where blinking in a consecutive pattern which in someways was reasurring me it must be something of human construction. But as the object continued to move and i traveled closer, the shape appeared to be disc-like. I know this sounds very typical and familiar, but this is what i saw. The object continued to move in a northeast direction and as it slowly disappeared over the tree line, i made a quick right turn onto Lemay Ferry Rd. which put me in the perfect line of sight to see an object that had just flew over the tree line and all i saw was an empty sky. I now sit and type this report as i was instructed by some person on the other end of the phone from which i called the number for reporting UFO sightings, with tears running from my eyes, chills all over my body, my heart is pounding so hard i can hear it throughout my entire body, sick to my stomach, and a set of shaky hands that are barely allowing my to type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, i am a person of somewhat respectable integrity. I hold a very good job at a very reputable company. I am not one of fairy tales and fictitious stories, but what i saw tonight will remain in my mind for the rest of my life. From what i know of modern aviation and man-made flying capabilities, what i saw was not of this planet. Im an advocate of discovering life beyond ours and look forward to the day that all of the world sits in aw of another intelligent being not of this planet, but after my experience on this evening, im not sure im ready, more less the rest of the world.<n>

It then proceeded to duplicate to it&#39;s exact left. The duplicate ball of light continued to glow where as the other dimmed out of sight and then the other dimmed as well then where the first ball of light was seen another brightened out of nowhere perhaps the same as the first ball of light. Each had a duration of about 10 seconds or so, they weren&#39;t really high in the sky but just over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about a hour later that same night I was sitting with two of my friends who had seen the previous even as well, a bright silver-blue light hovered in the sky for a good 5 minutes making no movement but only radiating. It was similar to the size of a large star, it then proceeded to move to the right keeping on a straight path I followed it for a few moments, then lost sight of it for about 30 seconds or so because of the village buildings obstructing my sight, and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To the north, at what appeared to be a high altitude, we noticed a single, very bright object moving from E to W at average speed.  It was a steady, white, brilliant light, then after about 30 seconds of brilliant illumination, it dimmed and changed directions to a NW bearing.  No flashing or colored lights were visible. We wouldn&#39;t have rendered the object unusual had it not changed directions so rapidly (an instantaneous, sharp directional change).  The aurora boealis became visible a few minutes after the object had passed out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The time was a little over one o’clock in the afternoon local time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting half a sleep in my seat looking out of the window when a strange object passed in a distance besides the wing of our plane.  My brain was at 50% capacity.  A strange kind of &#34;bug,&#34; I thought.  A &#34;bug&#34; in the sky?  The &#34;bug&#34; slid parallel to the plane and was in sight for about 5 to 7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it got to me.  It was no &#34;bug,&#34; but a dark silhouette of a rectangular object that looked like a coffin with a zigzag halo around it that was darker in color then sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The TV  monitor showed the ground speed to be about 800 kmh and 40000 feet above ground  (I could not remember exact data).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no reference point so it was impossible to determine the size and distance of the object. The question is now, what did I saw?  A balloon at a ground speed a little lowers then the plane or a new secret flying device of some kind patrolling the airspace over the US?   It is everyone’s guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If the pilots have been awake in the cockpit they to must have seen the object passing by. Has someone else on this flight seen the object.  Please come forward, if you have?<n> <n><n> <n><n> The attached photo is manipulated in Photoshop to illustrate my observation.  The clouds are part of the storm that hit New Orleans so bad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object could be the same that was observed on Wednesday afternoon, July 13, 2005 in the Seattle area. It has the same memo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never expected to see a UFO look like as described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yours truly,   ((name deleted))  Computer Tech  57 years old male and no dreamer  ((address deleted))   Norway  Telephone: +((number deleted))  Cell +((number deleted))<n>

I was watching the sky when I saw a red colored,bright,oval spot. First I thaught, that it was a big star,but than it moves. I am sure that it wasn&#39;t a plane or a something I&#39;ve ever seen-it movement was too fast and...unlogical, left and then right. The pilot might be drunk, right!

It was sighted on open park land, so no perspective to measure by.  As it went overhead, it blocked out overhead clouds, which made me think it was quite low. The only way I can describe it is it was like an air craft carrier in the sky, it&#39;s presence was huge, no outline could be seen to ascertain shape - but it seemed to be like an arrow and looked grey and &#39;industrial&#39;. Also there was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Tam when a white/yellow disc appeared from the pacific ocean directly travling west to east, its altitude was around 100,000ft the disc passed directly in front of us the discs speed was around 8,000mph the disc then exited our atmosphere turning a red orange upon exit, reddish flames could be seen engulfing this disc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Marin County seems to be a entrance and exit portal for UFO&#39;s as I witnessed a craft entering over Marin airspace that was reported in March of 1997. There is also alot of activity up Hwy. 29 in the Napa area with other friends seeing disc craft over farms within the last 2 months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen satellites and the space shuttle travel over and this disc was not from here.<n>

My wife and I were sitting in our driveway and I walked around the side of the house to check to see if anyone in the neighborhood had generator power.  All of a sudden a bright flash , such as a flashbuld, caught my eye .  The flash was in the South Eastern sky at about40 degrees in the sky.  The night was cloudless and the stars were so visible everywhere.  The light put a flash in my eye , such as a welders flash, and it still is there. When I walked back around to my wife, the first thing she said was, did you see that flash.  She was facing North at the time and only saw the sky light up for a split second.  It did not affect her, since she seen only the flash from behind her.  It lasted a split second and this is Friday and I still have the spot in my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were moving around in a way to seem they were playing or chasing each other. The movements and speed was of no explanation. They appeared to be very far away, like I said they looked like stars at first. Imagine seven people in a dark room with laser pointers twirling them around on the wall. They would come and go as to disappear, or move so fast to be going out of sight for brief moments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with these witnesses via telephone, and found them to be seemingly quite credible.

Could discern what apeared to be red and green blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Retrieved binoculars and telescope. Binoculars confirmed the twinkling light, but unable to see much else other than the slow movement S to SW. 21:45 set up telescope and targeted object.  Clearly saw what appeared to be a planar ring shape glowing modest white/yellow light, with bright white lights flashing around the diameter in an orderly counter-clockwise direction.  Ring did not appear completely rigid, but could have been as it may have been &#34;wobbling&#34; or deforming.  Object appeared to remain planar, and did not expand or contract.  Looked much like what you would see under a microscope looking at a small bacteria or sea animal.  Green and Red lights would periodically flash from what I can best describe as directly perpendicular to the ring plane.  Looked like a donut with an imaginary center post kind of like a spinning top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object moved to the SW, it fell below the house and tree lines and I gave up watching about 22:15.<n>

We were standing out in front of the building which faces west, the sun had gone down below the horizon. At this time we noticed a very bright light above the hill about two miles away, appx. altitude was 2000 ft.. My first thought was &#34;Venus&#34;, but the object seemed to be moving away from us and to the North. My comment was &#34;It must be the atmosphere making it seem to move&#34;. As we watched, another light appeared about 1000 ft. above the first. The second light started moving to the North as the first continued Northwest. The one moving North was slowly pulsating from very bright to the point that it was not visible. We watched both qbjects for about ten minutes until the one headed North finally dimmed and was gone. Suddenly another bright light appeared approximately where the second one had been sighted. By this time, the first object had continued Northwest until it was no longer visible. The third object followed the same path as the second Northbound object. It also slowly pulsated at the same rate and brightness. As it moved to the North it also dimmed from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First suspicion was that it was a satellite, or a helicopter.  It was neither unfortunately.  The starshaped light (had vertexes like a star) starting moving to the left very slowly, and then blue and red lights started blinking that were much smaller than the yellowish light, not in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light moved up, and fast to the left and stopped, then went up a little, and then the light transformed into a small ball of light that was not as bright, the blue and red lights stopped, and then it disapeared.  Immediatly following this another starshaped light moved into the scene, and did almost the same movements, but then we saw two objects that looked like planes (because of the lights planes give off) move EXTREMELY fast parallel under the starshaped light and keep on flying past. Possibly fighter jets sent out to investigate or scare off the crafts?  As this was happening we saw no commercial planes, just the lights, and the fighter jets which only went by the scene once.  Then, the startshaped light number 2 disapeared, and for another minute nothing was going on;  then to the far right of the sky another light started, moved to the left, and then went into a ball of light, but not as small as the previous two, and emited a blue misty/cloudy/lightning type string in the sky. The final light went left like the others, stopped, and then vanished but without turning into a ball of light. After this I was shocked, frightened, and positive that these were ufos, and i&#39;m very glad to see that figher jets were sent to make them go away.<n>

I looked up and saw what looked to be a star, the sky was still bright and no other stars were out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A plain at 34 thousand feet just passed overhead heading North leaving a trail behind it. The object was in back of the trail. I have Video. The UFO stayed in one spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was odd is that when the plain passed by leaving it&#39;s ice jet trail, the trail broke where the UFO was however the rest of the trail was still there. Like I said I have Video to prove this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The neighbors where out next door and also saw this. We used binoculars and a telescope to get a better look. It was a Bright different type of white light coming from this object. Then my neighbor spotted another one to the left of the first one we saw. I don&#39;t have video of that one because I was to busy looking through a telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving extremely slow heading West. Both UFO’s  stayed in formation until It ended up on the horizon and lost sight.  The UFO was right above us when we first saw it at 7:40PM, it took only 30 minutes for both UFO’s  to get to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1977 I saw UFO’s and reported that also.  The only difference was the speed the UFO went. In 1977 the UFO&#39;s started off going as slow as this one seen tonight. however they took off at great speed then stopped and took off again at great speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two we all saw tonight kept going slow west. If you were out and just looked up you could have easily thought they were stars. I new it wasn&#39;t a star because of the different brightness of light coming from it, the light was bright but not the same temperature as a star. A star is more of a yellow light, this was a pure white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just keep looking up and you will also see one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of three seemingly high quality reports from same witness.

I see something bright in the sky. It looked like a flying disc that had a white glow around it and it also had maybe two or three lights around it. My friends were amazed. We went walking towards it. Two of my friends said it was just a blimp but the others believed it was a UFO. I have a camera phone so i took a picture of it. It couldnt have been a blimp because of the way it was twirling and it slowed down then went faster till it lowered down n we couldnt see it any more cause of a building in front of us. The next day i told my other friends about it and they said that everybody from our town were getting out their cars to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They looked like three black triangle shapes that were flying close to one another. They made no sound. The three objects came from the north, flying south, and then went toward the south-west. I estimate their speed at around 30-40 mph, judging by the speed of the cars below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute after the three objects were off in the distance and no longer visible, a fourth object was observed. This fourth object took the same flight path as the first three, and traveled at the same speed, only this object was shaped differently. This was like a black dot in the sky. There were no lights nor any sound to this object. I took a snapshot of this one, and am courious to see how it shows up on film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, this flying black dot went into a south-westerly direction.

At least 100 of them dancing across the sky silent,graceful- making all kinds of formations and designs. We continued to watch in awe for about ten minutes until they were were lost to our vision by trees blocking our view. They were a shiny, metalic, disc shape. About a minute later, a jet appeared and seemed be chasing the group. This event has puzzled us until this past week when we watched a program on the History Channel titled &#34;Mexico&#39;s Roswell&#34;. THERE THEY WERE!!!

If it had been a landing light it would have disappeared as the &#34;nose&#34; was heading away from me.  I am at 3,500 msl, and it appeared to be between 5,000 and 6,000 msl.  Just before I lost sight it appeared to be emitting very tiny sparks which seemed to swarm around the object.  My observation of the sparks was very brief, just a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Initially we saw three lights that were lower in height than the overpass and they appeared to be heading south along the freeway, making a sharp turn to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached the object it had turned around and was heading northwest along the freeway.  At this point we saw strobe lights on each side. It turned around again heading straight for the traffic and we thought that it might be a plane making an emergency landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I began to brace for the worst believing that it might crash land into the cars, but it crossed right in front of us just skimming above the cars on the freeway.  I craned my neck around to get a closer look as it passed overhead and to the south east behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It maneuvered incredibly quickly around almost as if it had flipped over (inverting itself),throughout performing extremely tight turns and came back at full speed to make a quick pass overhead again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I saw two blue strobe lights on its back outer edges.  We were travelling at approximately 65 miles an hour and it kept up right with us.  A number of cars had overtaken us by this time leaving us alone to observe this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had become quite nervous by this time and did not feel safe being around this object.  My brother wanted to stop to take a closer look, but I felt uneasy because of its erratic behaviour and because I did not want to cause any more traffic hazards myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three large round lights that were spaced evenly across the front of the object cast subdued lighting rather than bright headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We estimated the size of the object as approximately four car widths across, having a black (triangular shaped?) main section.  It performed aerobatic movements with ease at very low height and we heard no sound.<n>

It was approx. 1:30 AM, my daughter was asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was an overpass in the distance maybe one half mile ahead when I saw an amazing acrobatic display of three lights (all attached to one flying vehicle, I could not see the structure of the vehicle itself but the lights were attached to something triangular).  The lights were a blinding white and bluish color, almost like the headlights on new european import cars.  The vehicle was flying very low turning rapidly and banking east to west then north to south along the freeway.  I had the window down on my vehicle and was traveling approx. 75 mph, I heard no destinctive sounds.  I was surprised that other cars were not stopping ( I did not stop either), I thought that this might be routine for local drivers.  I thought that I was possibly seeing a helicopter crop dusting the citrus trees to the east of the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am the type of person that would normally stop on the side of the freeway to see what was actually out there. I did not do so in this case, I was in awe,rattled, and honestly a little scared by the display.  I have been to many air shows and aircraft events, but I have never seen this kind of performance in an aircraft at such a low altitude.  The airspeed was a little faster than my driving speed of 75 mph. I estimate the aircraft&#39;s speed to be somwhere between 80 to 110 mph, but I am not quite positive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the event was over and I continued along the freeway I began to question what I saw: Was this a crop duster? Why would a crop duster be doing these displays over a busy freeway, and if so was he or she drunk and pulling a prank?  Was this a military aircraft, and why would the military be so ignorant to pull a stunt like this over a busy freeway?  Was this a sighting of a UFO?  I still do not know what I saw that night and I felt the need to report it.<n>

Mind you, the area i live has a small wooded mountain in front of me so the object passed below the mountain height level and was highly visable due to the white light contrast against a black backround. The object was approx. 6-7 stories high in flight and traveling at a 100+ mph rate of speed..it was fast but not fast enough for the naked eye to catch. Shape was hard to determine but a close guess was it was shaped like a cup or cone (size like a beer bottle) and emitted a white trail in its wake. No sound at all but it passed in front of me(30 feet away)and navigated through some treetops towards the ocean. (Sandy Hook area) Once i looked at the area it traveled too i noticed that the cloud formation that had just been formed but wasnt there a minute ago. There was one very large cloud with 9 smaller clouds ascending/descending from it in tight formation, all equally the same size and distance from each other. One minute later they all disapeared and the sky was totally clear again. Im a military veteran so im familiar with logical earthbound craft and wasnt drinking, or on medication, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was the moon at first, but it did look very strange so I kept staring at.  I noticed that it tended to slowly move left and right.  By the time I saw its behavior there was no dought in my mind that this was indeed a UFO.  My girlfriend also witnessed the object as well as my brother.  Both admit that it was not the moon, it was moving, and it did have an oval/saucer like appearance.  I recorded three short vids of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to turn inside it&#39;s self and back out then it emitted a red beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all I am an educated women, so is my partner and our friends.  Some of us were non-believers and some were.  While, some of us were frightened, some thought it was cool.  We are just ordinary people that saw something extraordinary.  Our age range is 18-58 and we come from many different racial, ethnic and financial backgrounds with an array of sexual orientations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from a meeting about 10:10 pm and my partner said what was that white streak that just passed over the car.  I said what streak.  I did not see anything.  I said it must be a falling star.  She said ok but I do not think so and she made a wish.  We approached the house and we saw a white solid but with weird halo like object moving in front of us in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we pulled into the driveway, we notice it was moving to the right of us.  It was moving east towards the direction of NYC.  After we parked the car and started to walk to the side of the house, we could see just a small portion of the white flat oval shape hovering between the treetops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We proceeded into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner had to go to the bathroom and I said I am going to go to the bedroom and look out the window.  We live in a two-story duplex.  We are floor two and three so we have a pretty good view of the top of tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went to the window, I got excited and called for my partner to hurry up in the bathroom; the object is outside our window.  She came running in the room with her pants half pulled up and said oh, ((deleted)) it is a UFO.  I ran to the closet and grabbed my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I look thru the binoculars, I could she the define white flat oval shape object moving back and fourth, moving and stopping on the drop of a dime.  It also had blue/white, white/purple and white/red lights at the top and middle of the object.  My partner grabs the binoculars and saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were so excited and she started calling people.  She called her sister but she was not home.  She then called her job and the night crew was just getting off.  She said, &#34;there is a ((deleted)) UFO at my house get on the roof and see if you can see it.  There are also helicopters and planes flying around it as well.  Look in the direction of NYC and you should see it.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> In about 3 mins. She called again, &#34;Did you see it,  No, and then come to my house. You have to see this.  Come now.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She then called our friend and she said she was shopping at the food store but she would be there shortly.  It had been floating, hovering, changing shapes and just moving around for 20 mins now.  We kept asking the object to stay just long enough for our friends to see it.  Every time we asked it to come back form behind the trees, it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I went upstairs to our daughter&#39;s room to get a different view.  I could see it better from here.  I could tell this was not blimp or plane.  Then I started to chant a Buddhist mantra and the object got closer and began to change shape.  It seemed to turn inside it&#39;s self and back out then it emitted a red beam.  It was unbelievable.  My partner was still at the bedroom window down stairs, she was also doing the Buddhist mantra and saw the beam as well.  We both yelled to each other did you see that.  It was incredible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, our friends arrived.  It was about 11pm.  Everyone ran to a window, upstairs or down stairs and could not believe their eyes.  They took turns trying to figure out what it was but nothing man-made made sense.  We watched it for another 25mins then it went behind a tree and did not come back.  We could still she the other aircrafts flying around the object but not quite approaching it.  By the time our friend that was shopping made to our house. It was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the other witnesses to the alleged event to submit reports, as well.  PD))<n>

I watched the balloons drift to the west with the parking lot attendant, who after a few minutes turned away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the balloons when I saw a round sphere shaped object appear to the left of the balloons.  The sphere had sharply defined edges and appeared translucent and seemed to turn various shades of grey.  It began to move in an arc downward and to the right, as if circling the balloons.  I called the parking attendant to come and see this but before he returned the sphere, after completing a quarter circle and being below the balloons, simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened next was strange in that both the attendant and myself had this unusual visual effect like hundreds of bright particles flashing around in front of our eyes.

It seemed to be traveling way too slow to be a shooting star , but way too fast to be an aircraft. Now, I&#39;m a pilot and I&#39;m aware of the fact that altitude has a lot to due with how fast something seems to be moving, but I think whatever this was remaned in the upper atmosphere the whole time I saw it.

Although, I still watched them fly.  Two were moving from the right to the left and one was moving from the left to the right.  As they passed each other, one of the two lights did a quick 180 and flew after the other light.  The turn put me in awe, because it turned faster than any fighter jet or helicopter is even capable of doing.

8/25/05 18:00|Henderson|NV|Disk|5 minutes|Three stationary saucer shaped objects over Sunrise Mountain, east side of Las Vegas, NV, August 2005.|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61327.html|68|ndxe200508| Three stationary saucer shaped objects over Sunrise Mountain, east side of Las Vegas, NV, August 2005.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Towards the end of August, 2005, I went out in my backyard to look at the thunder clouds about 5PM.  My backyard was high, faced east and had an unobstructed 180 degree view being forty feet higher than the rooftops to the east.  Thunder storms were developing and cumulous clouds were building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I enjoyed the view, I noticed a dark spot in the sky over the south end of &#34;Sunrise&#34; Mountain to the NE of Henderson.  Facing east, the object appeared to be at 11 o’clock.  It was against blue sky in a large break between the clouds and it was stationary.  It was roughly above the flight path along Charleston Street that helicopters use for McCarran Airport.  They travel a a couple thousand feet.  This was much higher than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the naked eye it appeared to be large and round.  My first thought was that it might be a helium balloon, but logic told me it was in the wrong place for that, the wrong time of day, and the wrong sort of weather.  The south end of Sunrise Mountain is about five or six miles from my house.  I estimated the altitude of the thing to about 10,000 feet more or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped into the house and retrieved binoculars.  The object had not moved.  When I focused on the object I saw it was actually three round shapes fairly close together.  A large round plate was partially hiding another slightly smaller plate behind it at about one o’clock to the first, and a third round plate, appearing smaller yet, at about 2 o’clock to the biggest one.  The relative sizes gave the impression of three objects each at a slightly increasing distances and slightly different altitudes.  They appeared to be dull metallic silver. There were no lights on the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for about a minute, maybe less, and then, through the binoculars I saw all three objects “keel over” in unison by about 90 degrees at which point they appeared thin and flat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife and son and, with a second pair of binoculars, tried to help them spot the objects.  However, they wear glasses, are not used to spotting small objects, etc and they never saw them.  In between trying to help my family to see them too, I watched for another couple of minutes.  Finally, the clouds intervened and hid whatever they were from further view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My house was about as half mile South of the flight path into McCarran Airport. Commercial aircraft continued to land during this time, basically following Sunset Rd into the airport with landing lights on below about three thousand feet.  They and are a common sight.

8/25/05 14:35|Atlantic City|NJ|Other|less than a minute|Strange metailic object over a NJ shore community bay.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46770.html|70|ndxe200508| Strange metailic object over a NJ shore community bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First off the craft looked like a circle with exteremly thing wings, when we first saw it we were traveling down Rt.40/322 past the A.C. High School.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a local man&#39;s plane that has been designed to look like it&#39;s flying backward. It was flying roughly over Wellington ave. over the back bays going westward, it was a grey metalic color and was shining in the mid-day sun, while the mans plane had a red color on it and a very pronounced proppeler. It wasn&#39;t going fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it while my fiance concentrated on driving while periodicly looking up at it.  As we turned off of Rt.40 and onto wellington I looked away from it to see if there were any cars coming as is my custom since i&#39;ve been in many near accidents.  I looked back up to where it was, and it was gone.  Now the area where it had been flying was completely clear of clouds, and it is over marshes and bay, so there is no way it could have gone behind a building, now short of crashing in the water, which i&#39;m sure we would have heard, there is no way it could have gotten out of sight at the speed it was going. This isn&#39;t the first time i&#39;ve seen something in the sky, i&#39;ve lived here since I was little and have seen many a U.F.O. and I beleive i&#39;ve also caught a conversation about one on my scanner on a frequency used by the air force, I think if there is anything here in this particular area, it&#39;s because of the air force base close by. My background is a highschool dropout and i&#39;ve been working steadily sine I was 17, and my fiance is a student at a school in philadelphia, we both have no history of psycosis or hallucinations, we&#39;ve never taken any drugs with hallucinagenic traits that may be lingering.<n>

It flew downwards at a 45 degree angle, came to a sudden stop, shifted upwards and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object took 2 seconds to stop, shift and vanish. The entire incident took place over 5 seconds.<n>

By this time the lights had stopped blinking. Then the last of the lights dropped off and moved away from the group.  This light stayed pretty much in the same area for the whole time and blinked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other group continued in an E/SE direction when suddenly it transformed again into a glowing red/orange ball.  The glow was like nothing I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we noticed a trail behind it. The trail was not like the ones created by a jet, it was wide, but was more transparent.  It was moving faster than anything else in the sky.  All of a sudden it made a right turn toward the ocean and then another heading south.  Then it appeared to stop, giving the impression that it was heading away from Earth.  It then suddenly diminished in size until it had disappeared.  The last bit happened in less than a second and it was definitely moving away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had lost track of the blinking light and it was not visible in the sky. Seemed like it was a reconnaisance mission to deploy or drop off some sort of probe.<n>

Inside of that, my friend works for the US Coast guard and informed me 3 nights ago that on August 8th when he was on duty, him and several other coast guard officials got a report of a &#34;plane with no wings&#34; was heading there way. He stated it flew over head very fast, apparently plunged into the water and shot out to sea. He stated some form of the government came hellicopters and all and ordered everyone off the beach, park rangers, by standers, police officials, and the coast guard. Every police station was ordered to destroy every report they received about an &#34;Unidentified Flying Object&#34;. It was ironic because I was telling this story to my friends when we saw what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I do this every night and watch the sky all the time just hoping something out of the ordinary will happen. This night, it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking up at the sky I noticed a light in the corner of my glasses so I glanced over my shoulder to the east. What I saw, from POV can only be desribed as what looked to be a single red light, that split two more lights from itself. These light moved from the middle light to the sides; one to the left the other to the right. They went out a certain distance and held that possition for a brief moment then vanished. The shape of the object is unknown to me, but from my POV it looked like just a straight line, which could mean I was looking head-on to an number of flying crafts, which makes it hard to tell, but it seemed way to think to be a normal jet-plane. It actually looked thick enough from the lights to maybe have been a large rectangulare structure, but I only wander how something like that could fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t sure what I had seen, but I knew it wasn&#39;t any form of plane I had seen before, seeing as how I live close to Davis Monthan AFB and Tucson International, I am always seeing planes and helicopters flying by at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked my dog for another few steps and stopped again to clear my head of what I had seen, but then as I was looking where I had seen these lights I saw the same form take shape again. The only difference was that they were in a different spot, but in the same general direction. At this point I knew that this was not just a radio tower or something of that nature that I may had over looked the previous 100 or more times that I had walked my at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason I decided to post this is because I was looking to find more info on the same type of thing I saw just to see what it was so i could dismiss these thoughts like I usually do, but only one problem: I didn&#39;t find any documentation that fit my desription right. This wasn&#39;t a triangle, nor were they/it moving in any direction. Nothing was flashing, just a solid red light the split two more off of it in a smooth demeanor. Maybe someone will be able to answer what this may have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The Center of the object seemed transparent but the speed and silence of it was unreal. To this day my roommate still thinks im a kook but I swear I saw it. The factors he threw in my face were it was late summer and the Canadian geese were Taking off before the cold hit...My argument to that was they go South for the winter not North and they make a whack  of noise when they are flying around. Not a single sound of a turbine or anything that you would normally identify an airplane with, If you think im kidding..Whatever but so far in my life my eyes havent failed me yet. Just checking out recent stories on MSN.Com lead me to this site....If it was some kind of Hi-Tech Aircraft then I couldnt tell you what it was doing in Alberta.

I was driving at this time when i witnessed the one that was in motion move towards the stationary one.  At that time i pulled into a carwash so I could get a better look after I stop the moving one was gone.  I dont know if it had entered the other light or had disappered I had turned my head when pulling into the carwash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching for about a min. I decided to head south on andresen to see if i could get a better look from the top of the hill. once i got up there i only seen it one time through the trees. they were fairly large and very bright. I have lived next to portland airport must of my life I have never seen plane lights that big or bright. I have also never seen a airplane approach from south of the airport before either which is were these were.<n>

In no way did it appear to be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in the sky for a good minute when our friend fell down in the water, and we took our eyes of the craft for no more than 5 seconds. Then we look back and it had dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before we had turned away it was a fairly close distance and no plane could have dissapeared that fast from how close it was to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This day there were absolutely no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10 min later on the way back to the dock, we were all scanning the skys when suddenly the same craft was directly above us!  It had appeared there in practically an instant. Then it moved toward the damn at a faster speed.  We eventually lost sight of the craft until it was too far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also saw a helicopter in the area that appeared to be head in the direction of the craft.  We also saw plenty of passenger planes that were instanly identifiable as planes.  This craft shared no resemblence.  None of the plane were moving at the speed of the craft.<n>

I was using 12x binoculars and still could not clearly see any detail in the craft except that it was without wings and completely silent. It was as big as a commercial plane but flying just above the mountain top. The object had ligts like an aircraft but they did not blink. The lights in front were red and orange as were the lights in the back. The lights and the outline of the object gave the impression of being a helicopter because of the speed and the strange position of the lights but it was huge and low and silent. The object travelled at steady speed from east to west and my wife and I watched it fly out of sight. It was so slow that I had time to run in the house and get my binoculars. I see a lot of military aircraft and medical helicopters but I have never seen anything like this. It is impossible for me to accurately describe the object because it was too big and jet black. Except for the lights it just seemed to blot out the stars as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving towards it in my car and noticed it was too close to be mars because it was growing in size with regards to my approach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled towards it and noticed some blinking lights... but it was not moving or not moving much.  I pulled into the CompUSA parking lot on Hopkins Crossroad and 394 and observed it some more... it seemed to be about 200 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a plane, but it wasn&#39;t moving quickly enough.  It was very close.  I considered a helicopter, but it didn&#39;t seem to be the right shape or light configuration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I parked my car, grabbed my camera, and stepped out into the parking lot.  As I grabbed my camera, it started to move.  Outside of the car I could hear a slight whirring sound like the sound of a jet, but it was way too quiet to be that close to me.  In addition, the sound was not shifting like a Doppler effect would cause.  It was constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been taking photos of the moon (or trying to), so my camera was set to accommodate the brightness of the moon against the night sky.  I was not thinking straight enough to realize this until after around five photos taken... probably over the course of 10 seconds.  Still too shocked to think straight, it traveled past me and I stopped taking pictures to get a better look at it with my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It definitely had lights and looked like a very triangular plane of some sort.  It looked closest to the F117 shape if it was a plane.  It had two white lights and a flashing red light in the middle... again, like a plane  might have.  But it was much closer than a plane could have been, was traveling too slowly, and wasn&#39;t loud enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I changed the settings on my camera and, by that time, the object had passed by me (this is around 15-20 seconds since I stepped out of my car).  I started taking some pictures that actually turned out.  The lights kept the same spacing, more or less, despite the angle from which I was viewing it.  It was black and when the red light flashed, I could see a slight outline of the thing.  The two photos that came out best show it against a building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved across only 15% of the viewing area between the two photos and my digital camera stamped the times five seconds apart.  That seems far too slow to be a plane.  The object seemed to be pulling over the highway when I noticed another set of lights to my left.  I watched those for a moment... but I realized that those were just a normal plane.  I turned back to watch the original object but it was nowhere to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got in my car and tried to follow approximately where it seemed to be headed but I didn&#39;t see it again.   I have those photos and they mostly show the two white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove to a hill where I saw a UFO zipping around in the distance around six years ago and I saw what might have been it quite a bit further out.  It was moving slowly, again, and it was moving in the opposite direction.  Over the course of two minutes it made its way across the whole horizon.  It might have been a standard plane... the camera was having a hard time snapping photos that showed any detail.  The only thing odd about it was the trajectory... it was moving in an arc instead of a straight line.  But it never came much closer.<n>

There were 2 lights in the sky that looked like 2 very bright stars, then all the sudden they split into 4 lights each and flashed or pulsated about 4 times, each time moving across the sky a little more, then disappeared, sky was black, then the 2 sets of 4 lights appeared and started again flashing and moving across the sky.  At first it almost looked like when you see a fireworks show, how a large ball of light goes across the sky and then when it reaches so high, it bursts....but these didn&#39;t burst, the lights just flashed and moved accross the sky, and then disappeared.   Also, about a month ago my son and his girlfriend were on old hwy 40 by Brookville Kansas (about 20 miles from my sighting) and spotted what appeared to be the tale of a very, very large aircraft with a set of verticle lights.  It appeared to be turning and they just saw the tail end of it, and then it suddenly flew away at unexplainable speeds (he described it like what is shown on scifi tv programs as going into hyperspeed, where it just flashes and shoots away) and he feels certain there is nothing he&#39;s ever heard of existing that could move that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the show Unexplained Mysteries this morning, one of the sets of lights it showed looked very much like what I saw last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I grabbed binoculars and followed in my truck. I lost sight of them because of trees. At the southern end of the lake I spotted 6 in a group, silently gliding through the sky just above the trees on the Belmont side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The group had split up and these 6 had reversed direction and headed north.  I observed them for 10 minutes until they were out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:30 PM, 3 blinking white lights, in single file but close together, slowly flew over Lake Winnisquam from Meredith, down the Sanbornton side.  At the exact same time, all 3 stopped blinking and turned orange.  The 3 orange lights continued slowly just above the wooded areas of Sanbornton and Belmont, until out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I dont think i need to stress that this was NOT a meteor, plane, satellite, comet, weather baloon, and DEFINITELY was not swamp gas or ball lightning.  It reflected the sun as if it were metallic, and was changing orientation, there was a &#34;glinting&#34; effect. It had it&#39;s own luminescence in daylight, and got brighter as it sped up, dimmer as it slowed.  Also, it seemed to be emitting a field, like a wavy aura, that also got brighter and dimmer, but on a lesser scale than the object itself. I called out other people to look, and they confirmed that my eyes were not playing tricks on me, they also saw the object, witnessed it&#39;s deceleration, and the strange &#34;aura&#34; that fluctuated between light and dark. i hope this is useful to someone...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As the two got closer to eachother, they became brighter orange and cone shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the two met, there was a burst of very bright orange/red light, almost like a fire.

It was hovering alone for about 5 mins when another less bright light appeared slightly lower and to the right of the original light. The second light to the right then began to glow far brighter and then changed to a pale orange colour, whilst the 1st light remaind white. Then a 3rd light appeared on the horizon vey small and only giving off a faint glow. It was in between the 2 existing lights it rapidly grew larger and became brighter as it approached. They all 3 hovered in a line for approximately 5 mins before the light to the far right very slowly started to fade until it was undetectable to the naked eye. Then the light to the far left slowly started to move across the sky to the right then just appeared to vanish. The final remainding light then started to fade until it too finally vaished from sight. 21:45 A lone light suddenly appearred in the same place as the previous ones for about 2 mins when a 2nd brighter light joined it. They both remained stationary for about 3 mins until the one one on the left again began to fade until it disappeared. The last remaining one then moved off slowly to the right before vanishing completely. Some of this activity was captured on video camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were marveling in how you could see it,s path so clearly. As I turned to walk into the house my wife said she saw a flash of light just of the route of the satelite. I asked her to point out the area and said maybe she just saw a star flame out billions of miles away,when it flashed again. Now our interest was peaked I told her to get ouyr bonoculars to see if it was an aircraft of some sorts. It flashed again roughly in the same area . We stood watching for the fourth flash ,when my wife noted that it had started to mve to the southwest. over the next five minutes or so it dropped striaght down toward the horizon, looking like it might intercept with a commercial flight going east to west . after the plane passed it webnt hard right for 3 flashes( flashes accourded probably every 30 seconds), than it dropped stiaght down to the horizon behind the treeline . We commented on how strange that could cover the ground it did and how it would flash or doubleflash, but with out rhyme or reason . at this point we were going to head out sid3e when it reappeared over the tree line and then we tracked the flashes for anther couple minutes as the headed east across the horizon and then after acouple minutes it was gone<n>

After a show, we stopped to look at a light that was an odd color to be an airplane or a star. Many people leaving the Shamu show stopped to look as well. It was a bright orange light 40 degrees above the southern sky. It flashed like a bright star would, but was much bigger and maybe within 20 miles or so at least 40 thousand feet up. We realized it was not an airplane nor a star, so we continued to watch it move very slowly northbound at maybe 20 knots. After two minutes or so, it flashed much brighter than before , then it shot straight down as fast as a shooting star. Within a couple seconds it slowed down then broke apart into two bright flashing lights. The light on the left shot off farther to the south, and flashed as it faded out. The other light flashed a couple times and fell farther down towards us. It flickered once and went out, then flashed once more then was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned around and over the house saw a triangle shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear with lots of stars and this thing was clear as can be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only noise it made was a low pitched hum (very low) There were 7 dull white lights on the bottom 1 at the point of the triangle then two lights on the next set then three lights then one at the back. This things was only about 20 feet above the trees. It moved slow for such a big object and i would estimate that to be 30 feet long 20 feet wide. It reminded me of the ship in star wars with the same triangle shape. The one oddity that still sticks with me is the fact that when you looked at the edges of this thing the stars in the back ground seemed to distort. And over the last couple of months i have noticed some high flying objects that look like stars normally in pairs but moving much to fast and when they turn they turn together like they are attached. I have seen jets at night and these things are way to fast to be jets.  Last set i saw and timed with a stop watch they went from horizon to horizon in 36 seconds.<n>

It was a chilly night so I was closing a window before retiring for the night when I noticed an unusually bright star (so I thought) in the sky.  As I looked at it, it seemed to grow even brighter still, and then just as quickly it grew dimmer.  Soon it dimmed completely out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought this was very odd as it was a perfectly clear night.  I decided to investigate it further so I went and found some 10x binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon examining the spot in the sky where the object had been I found nothing but stars, but looking a bit futher north I found something in my sights that took my breath away.  The object was comprised of 3 lights a larger blueish/green light in the center with two smaller reddish/brown lights on either side.  The larger light in the center was slightly elevated above the two smaller red lights, otherwise the 3 lights would have formed a horizontal line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately, my mind connected the 3 symetrical lights into some kind of or attached to some type of aircraft.  But, this craft was motionless.  I soon discovered a second object beside the first, then a third above that one, and fourth, all of identical size, color, and shape and all motionless and not blinking or pulsing.  As soon as I had counted the fourth object the lowest object began to move, slowly at first, but then accelerating rapidly straight up to the outside of the other 3 objects which remained still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I wanted someone else to see what I was seeing, so I went to get my parents.  Upon returning just seconds later all of the objects had vanished, we ran outside to search the rest of the sky and found nothing.<n>

At first I thought it was lightning until I saw it repeatedly flashing in the exact same areas.  Over and again, tremendous lights reflecting amber and blue  circled in the sky.  The size and power of these lights had to be enormous and great respectively.  Why do I say that?  I will exlpain in a moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched from Sunoco&#39;s lot for almost twenty minutes, wondering if someone would noticed a muscle bound Black man hanging halfway out of an SUV staring in to the sky at almost ten thorty at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To avoid potential harassment fron the police, I pulled into the next parking lot-Bank One next door-parked, and watched for almost another fifteen minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking the phenomenon would go away any time, I ventured home and told my wife.  From our backyard we could see the lights in the distance flashing again and again.  The boys were sleep so I told my wife no to trouble them and that I was going to drive towards the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove slowly down mainstreets, backroads, and even dirt roads as it took me towards Ypsilanti.  Along the way, the flashes became bigger and the size of them more awe inspiring.  Thinking that since I went to Uof M in Ann Arbor even though I was lost on the dark backwood roads, eventually I would find my way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I saw the lights better throught he clouds, I noticed the were reflecting upwards off something.  The reflections, I estimate, were fifty to eighty feet and reflected almopst violently over and again like they were atop something spinning.  It was somewhere close to Ypsilanti that I realized that the sky was discolored.  Having gone camping numerous times, I know that the lights ina great number makethe sky reflect a deep violet and makes the stars hazy to see.  In the country setting, the sky had a slight violet tint to it because it was not so far removed from townships, cities, and the like to have the untainted skyline.  As I watche dthe lights become larger and more brilliant, I noticed that the violet-black was off-colored for at least five square miles.  The color was deep, dark grey instead of violet-black.  Whatever was in the sky also was displacing the clouds-the clouds being pushed is something I think added to the dark greyish hue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt-I distinguish between feel and think because there was nothing logical about assuming anything-that there was some physical activity beyond that of immense, rotating lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove after it for long minutes until, even in Ann Arbor, I became lost.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights seemd to become fewer in flashes and more dim.  I rounded a bend to enter a freeway-a freeway that showed me that whatever it was had been moving because I was very, very far from where i thought I was heading.  Then I say trees and long grass sweep forward and globular lights reflecting a flash of red and blue shoot inot the sky from  what I could tell was an empty field.  Immediately it began raining on par with the power of a tropical storm.  I actually had to pull over and wait for the rains to calm which is no small thing for a seasoned Michigan driver.  Within a few minutes, the rains stopped as if they had never started.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw something in the sky that night, a year ago, that has stayed with me and changed my view of the world permenantly.  Worldly things beyond keeping my family fed are so insignificant compared to the mystery of what I saw.  I have no explaination of what it was but there was something there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have told a few people about what I saw but in the age of liars and attention seekers, people who own up to seeing UFO&#39;s-yes UFO&#39;s not alien starships but an UNIDENTIFIED flying object as in something I could not recognize/identify-typically ar elabelled crazy, mocked, or ruined by negative attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other than my wife, I have no one to share this with and therefor, I have written this finally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date in late August 2005.  PD))<n>

They Can, and Sometime&#39;s DO!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Son and I had been visiting My sister in Prescott, AZ.  With the thought in mind of moving into the surounding area!! I tought I would check out what AZ. had to offer!! Due to the type of work that I do Prescott couldn&#39;t give me what I was looking for so I decided to look into Phoenix and I found that I could Transfer from my current job to a site in Glendale!! I looked into the Transfer and into apartment&#39;s and found what I was looking for and decided to go ahead and make our way home!! I was on Vacation and didn&#39;t have to make it home till late that night so we (my son and Myself) set to the road at about 6pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took our time and didn&#39;t hit Gila Bend till about 7:30 and to us it seemed unnaturally dark!!(But we&#39;re from Cali.) We stopped and ate dinner at MC Donald&#39;s, I think we were there maybe all of 45 minute&#39;s..  We left Gila Bend and kept driving going toward&#39;s home, lol... Not 30 minute&#39;s out of Gila Bend my son said &#34;hey mom look, that&#39;s kinda wierd&#34; I said &#34;What?&#34; Again he said &#34; MOM LOOK AT THAT&#34; and I looked to my Left and said &#34;Yeah that&#39;s kinda wierd&#34; Then I looked again and kept watching what he had been talking about!! At First all I saw was a single light! Then 2, then 3 but they weren&#39;t regular light&#39;s!! They flashed 1, 1-2 1-2-3 dark and then 1, 1-2, 1-2-3, &#34;I thought that it might be because we might be beside some military base or maybe they&#39;re was a Prison Facility close by!! But then we were talking about what we were seeing and how high those light&#39;s were off the ground, I told My son to get my camera!! Now, my camera isn&#39;t anything special, but the first couple of picture&#39;s that we took of whatever the thing was that was hovering I would say some 30 to 35 feet off the ground we got a good flashback of it and whatever it was didn&#39;t stop there!! The first Picture we took, the thing seemed to lightup, glow even!! It kept it&#39;s sequence up 1-2-3- and then blank but then it was 1-2-3--4-5 blank 1-2-3-4 blank 1-2-3-4-5 blank and then we thought that it was gone!! it disapeared no sign, no light&#39;s nothing!! Then it was at the side of the road!! All we could see was light&#39;s!! Not on the side of the Road that we were on but right across the highway hanging on the side of the Road!! the  traffic going east was minimal and only a truck or 2 was there but they had to have seen what we did!! I Know 1 blew his horn like to warn someone they were in the way!! And then it disapeared!! I know this sound&#39;s incredible but it&#39;s true and It Did Happen!! I have Picture&#39;s!! I have showed them to some people but I don&#39;t want to seem foolish!! But I did show them to a specialist at my going away party in S.D.,CA. and she said she wanted to see more, but it&#39;s like I said it was a going away party!! I just want you to know that there is other pic&#39;s! and If you would like to see them they are available!! Just let me know!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You for Your Time ((two names deleted))<n>

However, the sound was so loud; it was shaking the windows of my house.  So, I went outside to see what it was, and I saw this massively large triangle shaped aircraft flying over my house.  There were multicolored lights on the bottom scattered across the entire aircraft.  The brightness of the lights was probably as bright as the red lights from a plane or helicopter after it blinks.  There were no lights on the top, sides, or back.  The size was at least 5 times, most likely larger, than the shape of a plane flying low over my house.  I live in multiple airplane highways, so I know what the planes and helicopters look like when they are high and low to the ground, and I know the paths they take.  This was not following a flight path that I am familiar with, and I lived in that house for over 10 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

8/20/05 18:45|Seattle|WA|Light|45 minutes|White, small lights seen in the clear day sky.  Objects seem 5 times in various locations over 45 minutes.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45693.html|117|ndxe200508| White, small lights seen in the clear day sky.  Objects seem 5 times in various locations over 45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi, we live in the Olympic Hills neighborhood in north Seattle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:45PM, while soaking in our backyard hottub, I saw an object in the bright, cloudless east sky that was a light/white &#34;dot&#34; in the sky, almost like a bright star, but it was pretty small.  I was sure it wasn&#39;t an airplane.  I thought it was more likely could be a mylar balloon that someone had let go.  It was pretty small and far away and my wife actually couldn&#39;t see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for a minute, my curiosity got to me and I jumped out of the tub and ran upstairs to get the binoculars.  On the upstairs back deck (also on the east side of the house), I observed the object through the binoculars but there still wasn&#39;t much detail to be seen...it looked like a bright white dot, only larger.  It was sort of like when you look at stars at night with binoculars... you can certainly see them better that with the naked eye, but they still are basically white dots.   The sun which was getting ready to start setting in the west was casting it&#39;s light eastward and was illuminating this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object which I had initially seen straight east, had been moving to the north and eventually I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. I dismissed this object as a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back down to get back in the hot tub, leaving the binoculars upstairs.  Then 10 minutes later, I was surprised to see what looked like the same object, but it was a bit brighter and appeared due east of us, just between 2 tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out again, and went back upstairs to grab the video camera and binoculars.  I very quickly headed out to deck, but even though only 30 seconds had passed, the object which had been quite visible was gone again.  I turned the camera on and filmed in the same area where I had seen the object, but it wasn&#39;t visible.  I looked through the binoculars but couldn&#39;t see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So this time I took the video camera and binoculars back down and set them on the table next to the hot tub.  About 10 minutes later, the object appeared again and this time both my wife and I saw the object through the binoculars and I took a video of the object which lasted about 30-40 seconds before the battery on the camera died.  With the camera running, I zoomed in on the object, and you can see the trees underneath it in the forground.  The video captures what we saw reasonably well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the battery in the camera dead, we passed the binoculars back and forth a few times for a few minutes, occasionally losing sight of the object.  My wife had the binoculars and said &#34;Oh, there&#39;s 2 objects now&#34; which was something I could also observe with the naked eye.  I took the binculars and what I saw was a bit odd.  There were definitely 2 distinct objects/lights in the sky that were close enough to each other that both appeared in the view of the binoculars.  But then I noticed that the one to the left actually consisted of 2 lights that seemed tethered together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a top light and immediately below it was another light that seemed to be swinging under the top light left to right and back again like a pendulum.  The two objects didn&#39;t stay visible for long and we lost sight of them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 8-9 minutes later, a single light appeared again and I watched it for about 4 minutes through the binoculars.  It was far enough away so that I really had trouble finding it with the naked eye, but could find it eventually if I scanned around using the binoculars.  At this point it was just a single light and I didn&#39;t see the pendulum behavior anymore.  Again I lost sight of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 8 minutes later, again I saw another light that was directly east and about in the same position of the initial object that I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So over a period of about 40-45 minutes I guess we same this object about 5 different times in various locations in the sky.  They were not conventional aircraft, and certainly were not a single balloon.  I supposed it&#39;s possible it could be explained by multiple balloons/weather balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t a mind-blowing event, but was still pretty unusual and getting it on video is kind of nice.  You may phone me if you wish to.<n>

They were flying single file, one behind the other.  They did not appear to be any kind of aircraft; they were moving very fast, and they seemed almost to glide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were too far to get a good description but they definitely did not look or move like aircraft, not even military. I&#39;d never seen anything like it before!<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be moving south or southwest, away from us - we were beginning to go northbound into Bellevue so we only had visual for a few seconds.<n>

The weather was nice and the sky was clear. There were very few clouds. I was looking down the road when a very bright light drew my attention upward and to the right. A very big bright light, like a reflection of the sun from a mirror, appeared in the sky. I tried looking at it but it was like looking at the sun. I slowed the car down and stopped the car at a stop sign. I looked up again and it was still there but was smaller (less than half the size) and had moved to the left. It looked like it was farther away. You could look at it now without hurting your eyes. It was oval in size but almost as wide as long. The light was still bright but it vibrated. After about 8 seconds it appeared to the right and was alot smaller (again less than half the size). I did not see it move to the right, it just appeared. It seemed far away. After about 10 seconds it was gone. It could had been an airplane but it went from closeup to far away in just seconds. There was no noise. I had the windows down. It seemed to appear to the right, then appear to the left and then appear to the right without moving. I saw an airplane about 10 minutes later and it reflected the sun but wasn&#39;t that bright and was a long oval shape. What I remember the most about it was the size was huge and it was very very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Usually I go outside to do this to save water in this arid area.  I had gone outside, looked toward the San Pedro Mountains and saw a small moving light.  I observed it very carefully and listened to see if it was some sort of aircraft.  It was moving much too slowly to be an aircraft, no noise, and there were no blinking lights. So I surmised that it was a genuine UFO...my first one!  I also supposed because of its position that it was about 3 miles away when it disappeared from view behind South Mountain. I had not really had given much credability to UFOs until I met with a man that is a neighbor, and prominate in the UFO community, 2 years before my sighting.  He told me that he reversed engineered a UFO at S-4, 15 miles south of Area 51.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We thought it was a helicopter at first but it made no sound (which was weird) and took off to full speed faster than any helicopter or jet or anything could.   When it took off, it just went straight up really fast and then changed directions to go speeding off southwest over Chicago and slightly up.

We were observing the view of the land and then this lighted object caught our attention,it made very swift but fluent movement across the valley, it traveled atleast a mile then stopped suddenly and came back to where it was, it then went up and back down but stayed below the tree line. it was approximatley 40&#39; off the ground, it then went from right to left,then left to right with a lot of speed, it made no sound nor did it have a beam of light, it came very close to us becuae it seemed to get alot bigger and had a greenish orange glow, the whole light flashed like it pulsated,it did this twice,  then continued flying around as if it was looking for something. we went to the bottom of the hill to get a witness, there were a few kids partying around a bon fire, we interrupted this party to and begged them to come to the top of the hill and witness this with us. they were not interested in what we were expirencing and did not witness this. i have never in my life seen a object fly in this pattern, there is no way a human being could handle the g-force of this object&#39;s flight pattern.We watched this light for 30 minutes. i no longer go riding at night without a video camera, i know i dont have proof, but me and my wife both witnessed something that has changed our way of thinking. i will continue to search for whatever we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One light seemed to be apart at a distance from the group of lights. It changed light formation several time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying very low and slowly over the golf course and I could see it as I approaced my home over the neighbor&#39;s yard.  I live on a golf course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived in my driveway, I quickly ran to the back of my house/golf course to see up close what and where it was and it was gone in seconds.  Also gone was a large cloud in the sky.  The two disappeared around the same time. The cloud after the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From initial sighting to disappearance was no more than 3 minutes at approximately 8:30 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter was with me in the car however she is only four and I don&#39;t know if she saw what I did.   Craft approximately 50-75 feet (wide) x 100 -150 ft.(Length). Unually quiet evening with some clouds and lightening in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There wasn&#39;t any noise and it was gone as soon as I parked my car in the driveway and ran to the back to see it up close almost as if it knew it had been spotted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be moving in a southeast direction.<n>
8/19/05 19:45|Centennial|CO|Cigar|1 minute|Bright Cigar-shaped Object in Centennial Sky Moves Slowly then Disappears|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45687.html|131|ndxe200508| Bright Cigar-shaped Object in Centennial Sky Moves Slowly then Disappears<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7:44 PM MDT  I had just come out from the East side of a low office building (in a complex of low office buildings) at Dry Creek Rd. and I-25, when I saw a bright object directly to the South at approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.  The object appeared to be white or silver and was roughly the size of a commercial airliner, or perhaps larger.  It was somewhere between 1 and 3 miles distant, at an altitude of perhaps 3,000 to 8,000 feet.  It appeared to be moving to the South-West, travelling much slower than would be expected for an object of that size.  At first glance, I assumed the object was a large airplaine, such as a commercial airliner, reflecting light from the setting sun.  However, as I watched the object, it became clear to me that there were no wings and no tail, as would be seen on a large jet, and it was moving too slowly to be a jet.  Then, I thought it might be a large helicoptor, so I continued to watch.  After a few seconds, the object changed it&#39;s heading slightly and it became obvious that it was not a helicopter either.  It was simply a giant cylinder shaped object.  As I said before, it was moving very slowly, and as my car was right there, I thought I might be able to drive closer to get a better look.  (This is not something I would even think of doing with any aircraft I know of.  Even small aircraft move much too fast to follow in a car.)  I kept my eye on the object as I walked quickly to my car, noticing that it was now directly reflecting the sunlight in a bright glare.  It was still in the same general area of the the sky as where I first saw it, about one minute earlier.  In other words, although it was clearly moving to the SW, it had not moved very far in this time.  After getting in the car and starting the engine, I looked to the sky again, and could not see the object.  I backed the car out and headed around another building to get a better view.  The object was still nowhere to be seen.  There were a few clouds to the West, but nothing but clear sky in the area where I had seen the object.  It had simply disappeared or moved away very very quickly (during the few seconds while I started the car).  The sky was still bright, and other objects in the sky could be clearly seen as silhouettes--birds, bugs, planes in the distance--but the large bright object I had seen just seconds before was simply gone.  Is it possible for a UFO to be visible only as a function of reflected light?  Maybe I could only see it for a brief time while it was reflecting sunlight in my direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While driving east on Cumberland Blvd a black or very dark object, rectangular object appeared in my front about 30 deg up and 15-20 deg. right (south) of the sun.  It was not moving horizontally or vertically but definitely was rotating very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First impression was that it was a strange kite,  Next thought, maybe an airborn, floating piece of plastic or paper but there was definitely no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed to a crawl,  got a good look and it had very sharp corners and was in sharp contrast against the sky...definitely a rectangle.  There was definitely no wobbling or any movement that would indicate that it was teathered or suspended.  It was slowly rotating and changing shape or showing a more angular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My last impression was that it was rectangular but with an arrow shaped point on each end of the rectangle.

I would estimate the height of the to be approximatly 750 - 1000 feet.  I thought it may be a firework of some sort up until it made a slow turn heading in the oppisite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The tail of sparks stoped and I saw what may have been the light of an airplane, although it was just a single small amber light, the size of a star. It continued on for a moment then the sparks started agian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am telling you it was the strangest thing.  It was manuvering in the air and I could have mistaken it for a firework if it had not been manuvering and turning on and off. The strangest thing is it started to drop small sparkes which exploded and appeared to be just like a 4th of july arial firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know whether aircraft preform these types of fireworks shows or what, but whatever it was was under control and definatly manuvering in such a way there was a craft behind the whole thing.  I have never seen an airplane fly over and drop a comet like tail of sparks and fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend was witness to all this too and I got a terrible video of it on the digital camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n>

There may have been a stray cat around, but I didn&#39;t see anything.  I glanced up at the sky, which was still dark except on the eastern ridge of Manoa valley, when I saw a bright light with what appeared to be a lit cone area in front of it, like how a car with headlights on at night would appear from high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assumed it was a helicopter overhead to survey traffic, but there wasn&#39;t any sound at all.  I couldn&#39;t tell at what height or distance it was at since it was dark, but it was overhead and to the west, and I was facing west.   As I looked at the object, the &#34;spotlight&#34; in front of it dimmed, and the light faded to the size of a large star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about to dismiss it as an airplane, but the light suddenly stopped in midair, where before it had been moving towards me.  As it stayed there suddenly a faint light colored haze burst around it from all side, like smoke from a candle when its blown out, or the aura of the sun, only larger and more faint. It disappeared just as suddenly, making me second guess even myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry if my description was vague.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the light, it seemed to separate into two smaller, dimmer lights, and then into three. The lights were the color of the stars and I would not have noticed them if I hadn&#39;t seen the larger light earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights then moved to the northwest and stayed equidistant from each other, and although it was hard to tell in the dim light, I believe the spaces in between the light was a paler color then the surrounding sky.  The lights continued moving lower and lower on the northwestern horizon of the western ridge of Manoa valley.   The lights moved at a somewhat fast speed, but were observable for about four or five minutes since they stopped intermittently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before they disappeared from view, I believe i saw the lights separate, veer away in arcs and then join together.  The time when I lost sight of them was 0542 HST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should note that I was not up all night.  I had just woken up for work 2 hours before and had gotten 6 hours of sleep the night before.  I am not superstitious, religous, and do not believe in ghosts or UFOs, or at least I didn&#39;t.   I have never hallucinated or fainted, and am not on any drugs, medications, or other physiologically or psychologically altering substances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around during the sighting repeatedly and when I looked back up the lights were still there.  Unfortunately, no one was around to bear witness to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pardon any misspellings or grammatical errors; my hands are still trembling half a day later.<n>

After watching these aircraft move off to the north and the east respectively, I turned my focus up to the stars directly above the backyard.  I saw a bright flash (as bright as the surrounding stars) which I assumed was one of the many aircraft which fly at high altitude which I have seen many times.  The flash appeared in the center of a triangle of stars directly above me. This flash was brighter than normal, and caught my attention.  I continued to watch the point in space, looking to see which direction the aircraft was headed.  A second flash, not as bright, appeared in the same position as the first - in the center of the three stars.  It was approximately 2 seconds after the first.  2 Seconds later, another flash in the same position, only smaller and not as bright.  At this point I could assume that the source of the flash was climbing straight up based on it&#39;s position in relation to the 3 star triangle. Additionally, each flash had gotten dimmer, and smaller.

There were 3 lights on the craft: white, alternately strobing lights in the front and back and one green light that completed the triangle.  The strangest thing about this craft is that it covered the WHOLE SPAN OF THE HORIZON in less than 2 minutes.  To my knowledge, no plane can move that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 minutes later, I was still outside and another of the same crafts appeared.  As this was happening, my little sister was walking outside to get something out of the car.  I pointed to the sky and she screamed to her friend on the phone, &#34;Holy sh*t, there&#39;s a UFO in the sky!&#34;   Again, this craft traversed the whole span of the horizon, again traveling from east to west as the other craft had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

A bit long ago but I hadn&#39;t got any needs back then to share the world with my and my two friends&#39;s story. I have told a few people about my sightings but they wouldn&#39;t believe me and I don&#39;t want to realy talk about it either because the most people will think I made this up. Wich I realy don&#39;t. That night it was a bit cold but the sky was clear so I could see a beautiful lot of stars. I realy like to look at them because they make me feel so small in this world. Suddenly I saw a vague round shape in the sky. It was a sort of brown O with in the middle a red light a sort of dot. The object was realy small and I could not determine the distance. It could be realy big and far away but also small and just some miles away. I realy had to look good because I could see it hardly, even though it was a realy clear night. It flew from the south when it was heading North in a straight line and realy fast. Then it stopped and just stood still in the sky. This was the time I called my friends to look up. I pointed at the object so my friends could see it too. In a fraction two others just appeared and joint the first one. Not in a straight line this time because these two seemed to play with eachother. These two circled a bit around and then just dissapeared. The first one was still hanging there and faded away to the north. I realy don&#39;t know what it was. It could not have been an airplane because they don&#39;t move this fast and certainly they can&#39;t and play. The seem reason why it was not an satalite. I&#39;ve seen satalites often and they look like a small star that is moving slowly in one straight line. I&#39;m realy glad my friends saw it too because I was thinking that I was going crazy. I have never seen this strange sight again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is then one of a billion stories of an UFO sighting. I realy hesitated to place this story because of these lot and I think the larger part is made up just to get some attention. Anyway the reason for sharing is that I would like to know if somebody have seen a comparable sort of apearance, nothing else. I do not believe in alien invasions or hostile creatures that want to take over the world. I don&#39;t believe in alienmade circles in cornfields or that some people are taken hostage by aliens. I would not exclude it all because I&#39;m openminded and I live in harmony with myself and others allthough I&#39;m not religious. I do believe in life beyond earth but I think we&#39;re not ready yet to meet up with an alien sort of life because we can not even accept our own species. A matter of time I think that would reveal life from somewhere else then earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for reading my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the investigator; I don&#39;t have any pictures or other proof of my sighting exept for my two friends. I hope I have given enough information but for further explonations please send me a email with questions I will answer as well as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kind regards,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Within one or two full rotations the lights shot off in opposite direction and vanished about 25% across the horizon each.  This leads me to believe the craft had reached or exceeded the speed of light at the point which they has vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time the maneuver was performed, to the time the lights disappeared; the duration was less then 1 second.  The lights (suspected to be stars) remained in what I believe now to be a Geosynchronous Orbit above the earth’s atmosphere.

My brother in law stepped onto the back deck to smoke a cigarette.  I went with him, just to talk.  While we were there, I noticed a satellite passing above, and asked him if he had ever seen a satellite.  He said no.  So, I pointed in the direction straight above us and we watched as the satellite moved from north to south and was soon out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was impressed that he had finally seen a satellite.  I told him there are a lot of them in this area and that another one should be visible within a few minutes.  Sure enough, there came another satellite heading from north to south.  It was not as bright as the first satellite, but we had no trouble seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I handed my automatic adjusting binoculars to my brother in law, while I observed with my regular eyesight.  As we watched it approach slightly south of overhead, it stopped!  Both of us lost track of it within the background of stars.  However, we stayed focused on the general area.  Within about a minute, it moved again, very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched as it gained speed to about the normal speed of a satellite.  Then, it stopped abruptly and went into a zigzag direction, east and west.  It repeated this several times, and then went into an expanding circular pattern and repeated that several times. It returned to the zigzag pattern several more times before it resumed a straight line southern direction, picked up speed to something extremely fast, (much faster than the speed of a normal satellite), and disappeared out of view to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never heard of a satellite that can stop or change direction, and mentioned that to my brother in law.  Whatever it was, the &#34;star-like object&#34; was flying high enough to reflect the sun’s light like a normal satellite.  We both knew what we had seen, and, both of us had not consumed any alcohol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We are both forty years old and niether of us really had much of an opinion about UFOs until the night of our sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had traveled from Effingham, Illinois, to Mermet Springs, Illinois, in the southern most part of the state to go scuba diving at an old rock quarry which had been turned into a scuba faciltiy.  We had ran into some severe storms on our way down but it turned of quite clear once we got to Mermet Springs.  My son and a friend of his had come along to camp out with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we arrived we sat up our camp, grilled some brats and ate. We then took our chairs and sat them so we could see the sky clearly because there was supposed to be a meteor shower that night after ten o&#39;clock. We sat and talked for a while and were looking up at the stars waiting for the showers to begin. I was sitting to my friends right with my head leaned all the way back looking up when I noticed a light &#34;pop on&#34; in the sky to my right. I thought perhaps it was the north star but it was not. I kept my eye on it trying to figure out what star it was when it made a very sudden and tremendously fast move accross the sky moving to my left. It stopped as suddenly as it had taken off. The light sat there for about five seconds, flashed off then back on one time and then took off at a perfect right angle from the direction it had first moved. It traveled extremely fast. It was moving away from us this time. I could see what I would call a &#34;light trail&#34; behind it. After it made this move and took off it vanished and we did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time that the light was visible during this event, neither my friend or I had said anything, moved or alerted the other one as to what we were seeing. Once it was gone I simply turned left to look at my buddy. He turned to look at me and simply said &#34;yep, I saw that.&#34; We then talked about it for a little while basically trying to rationalize what could move that fast and stop suddenly and then take off again at a right angle to it&#39;s previous path. We could not come up with anything that made any sense based on our experiences. We both finally decided that we had seen a UFO and thought that was amazing! To describe the object all I can really say is that it appeared to be a bright light which very much resembled the North star except for this was much brighter. I could not see any shape at all since this object appeared to be very high up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my friend or I can say what this object was but we both know for sure taht it was not a meteor, aircraft, reflection, star, or any other object known to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I knew it was not an airplane, I see airplanes in our area all the time, and this was forsure not an airplane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could only see the light when in was in the clouds, when the light moved to the blue sky it vanished. Then I thought, well maybe it was someone down below shining a light in the sky, but saw no beam. The light travelled very fast, up, down around, left and right, sharp movements. It would disappear into the sky, then resurface in the clouds. It was an orb shape, not circle, nor not like a tear shape.  Very strange, I have never seen a ghost or a space craft in my life, I was amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could this be a alien?  Or a gosht?  Or was it something else?  I have no clue, this was the second encounter. The first one did last as long, but the light split into two and vansihed into the night sky.

Much larger than a blimp. The shape was like taking two pie plates and putting them together. It had oblong lights 6. The craft was some 300yds long and 80 yds high or so. This craft made no noise and hovered just over the tree tops. I have never seen anything that large fly let alone be only 100 yds away and not hear a thing.  The Swiss Airline reported to Logan the next day I heard on the news about a near run in on it&#39;s way to or from Logan Airport.  My vision on the craft&#39;s shape differs from the one discribed on tv as a rocket shaped one.  I went to get my neighbor and returned but it had disappeard. This was near the quarry in Taunton, MA..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

One even came to a complete stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could hardly believe my eyes as I watched several of these objects slow down, speed up, stop, and even change directions.

I had the impression it was a deminsional gate.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is morning pre rush hour traffic.  There were many cars that could have seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was approximately 1000 ft up or less.  When I first saw it at a distance(2 miles), my first thought, was that it was a helicopter and there was an accident up ahead.  Because the craft was not moving across the sky like a plane but staying in place like a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer I definitely new it was not a helicopter and it was moving extremely slow heading northwest.  It was triangular shaped with two large circular lights centered across the craft.  The outside edge was clearly visible due to these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was moving with the front of the craft being one point with the other two points trailing.  So, it was not leading with a side but the point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled the window down as I was driving to see if I could hear anything, and did not hear anything.  Just the noise of the air rushing in.   But as I approached the craft from 2 miles away it definitely was moving slowly huvering it seemed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also made it a point to look for commercial air craft since this is near the airport and Boeing (formerly McDonnell Douglas).  I saw no other aircraft in the area.<n>

And while i was on the floor in panic i could smell something that i can only describe as &#39;insanity&#39; , but not like an odor in the room but rather way up in my nose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I crawled to my recliner cause i did not have a bed, thats what i slept in every night, and i lied there in panic, still unable to use my legs and my heart racing, i have never had a harder time trying to keep my eyes open, but i was afraid to fall asleep. While im laying there i reached for my cell phone, i thought about calling my other sister who lives in the same neiborhood, i even thought about calling 911 or screaming so my sister in bed could hear me. Fortunatly i was able to maintain my composure and just sit there and suffer through it and wait it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually after about 20 minutes my heart slowed back down to normal speed, and i could slowly but surely walk again, and open my freagin eye lids. I was just glad to be OK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I soon fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up the next morning fine for the most part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ive been thinking about that night ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The anxiety of the experience is long gone by now, however i still think about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To be honest i think about it and &#34;them&#34; all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know why the hell that happend but it did. Sometimes i think that i was not supposed to see them, but i did, and maybe they demobilized my legs so i could not run outside and and get a closer look or something, i really dont know, all i know is what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ive told my experiece to one very well known website, ive never heard back from them, i think they think im jokeing but im not. thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/15/05 03:00|Bellingham|WA|Fireball|15 minutes|Amber lights on trail.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85636.html|181|ndxe200508| Amber lights on trail .<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the woods along a trail in Bellingham, WA (connecting to Alabama St). I was almost to Alabama st, coming from the direction of Haggen on  the trail.  It started with a bright ORANGE (amber) light (like a fire ball) way down the trail.  This was about three am back in August of 2005. I thought  what I was seeing was another person or(two to three people -I thought) with head lamps on their heads (looked like a ball of fire or orb of  light 6&#34; wide -from way down the trail).  I was by myself and thought -I&#39;ll walk towards the lights, they were @ the same level as a person  walking on the trail... but way down about a 1/4 mile from me.  I walked towards the lights and they became blurred -the closer I got, the more  they became one light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were gone when I got to where I thought they&#39;d be -couldn&#39;t find them on the trail.  I went to the left of the trail, over a slight  levee like hill that runs along the trail and there it was in the middle of a field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was a beam of plasma lights in a column (went every other beam was yellow and then orange -yellow, then orange)  The column  was 1 1/2ft wide and 30ft from the ground to the sky (vertical in shape) and it went every other beam, ea. beam about 1 1/2 inches wide and  30ft long -all condensed (fit tightly together) -no spaces between the beams of plasma or lasers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -orange and yellow plasma beams of light all bound up in a tight column reaching 30ft into the sky and touching the earth  (the column was  about 1 1/2 ft wide -I believe it was plasma beams of light, yet I don&#39;t know -I was afraid to go near it or touch it) I think it was scanning the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole column of light(s) was slowly rotating clockwise.  {About fifteen ft up (some of the beams) while still attached in the middle would fan out about 3 ft from the base of the light (as if scanning).} I could not see where the lights were emanating from as if that part were not visible to my eyes but I feel there was something more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I don&#39;t know was WHY or HOW I had even been up at that hour or how I had even been walking on that trail that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was I was seeing frightened me.  I as far as I know only watched the lights for about 45 seconds... then crept backwards to the trail, and walked very quickly home. (Home was about 2 miles from the incident -@ that time I lived at the top of Alabama hill) I kept looking back -and even up to make sure whatever it was?   Was not after me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told one person, my bf what happened when I got home my bf was asleep, to this day I don&#39;t know if he believes me. I remember it like yesterday.  I strangely, remember NOTHING before it happened or why I was there -in the middle of the night.  For some reason -I was walking down the trail and I don&#39;t know why -I should have been asleep (I was dressed in a shirt and shorts and had a backpack w/me).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this before somewhere on line (may have been here) but feel this is a more complete account of the occurrence.  There may be more that happened.  Perhaps one day I will recall the whole incident.  I no longer live in Bellingham.  One other odd thing is that sometimes I feel as thought if I were to go there to the site where I saw the incident that it could happen again.  I&#39;ve been told I talk loudly in my sleep and have nightmares which I&#39;ve never recalled.  I think I&#39;m fine and am not scared of anything (so far).  I don&#39;t mind being contacted by an investigator.  I don&#39;t need to prove it to anyone -I know it was real.  I could submit a illustration of what I saw if requested.  I did draw a picture of it a while back (can re draw it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My wife says, &#34;hey, what&#39;s that?&#34;  I look up in the sky and we all saw about a dozen or so bright neon green-colored lights moving high across the sky.  They appeared to flutter somewhat and moved in what appeared to be a distinct tight formation, although they did move in and out around each other like birds -- the first thought I had was that birds is what they were because of their proximity to one another and the way they moved, but that didn&#39;t make sense.  We did not think that they could have been planes, either, because we actually saw a plane flying across another part of the sky at the same time and there wasn&#39;t any similarity whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them until they were out of sight, about 2 minutes.  None of us had been drinking and we all saw the lights.  I kicked myself afterward because I had been holding my camera in my hand the whole time but I was so astonished when I could not figure out what the lights were that I had forgotten about the camera, and so, took no pictures.  I have always been a skeptic and was rather disturbed when I couldn&#39;t figure out what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Moving at speeds unlike that of any anything ive ever seen,  it was incredible. to this day im still baffled, but i defiantly realize we&#39;re not the only ones in this big freezing vacuum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Ouah !<n> <n><n> <n><n> then moved much much faster ( faster than you would see an airplane move).  After about 35 to 40 sec (here also difficult to tell the amount of seconds elapsed, didn&#39;t look at my watch, you only want to follow the thing) the thing changed from white to yellow dark, made a kind of half turn, like a half loop almost not complete. then the light faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Great sight indeed. when the thing faded was located North, nearby or in the charriot.

8/14/05 22:15|St. Petersburg|FL|Cross|3 minutes|White Cross composed of 4 lights down and three across ocer my home in St. Petersburg Florida|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60573.html|188|ndxe200508| White Cross composed of 4 lights down and three across over my home in St. Petersburg Florida<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had numerous sightings with witnesses in my life, even a close encounter one with a witness one without.  I&#39;m aware many have trouble believing this especially if they themselves have never seen anything.  I&#39;m glad there has alway&#39;s been soemone next to me!  I have had less then a hand full of occasions in my life actual telepathic communication involving a sighting and other encounters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular night I was sitting in my living room and all of a sudden heard the words &#34;Eric ! Come out side we have something to show you !&#34;  I told my two Son&#39;s to get their shoes on as we need to go out  side and see a UFO !   they did so did I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I for what ever reason knew right where to look exactly   I don&#39;t know how I knew this,   I told the boys one 16 at the time the other 14 to look right up there and watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My youngest Son for some reason walked back toward the house and looked up at the sky and toward the home away from the scene.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly  four huge round lights proceeded to turn on  all straight down then three across turned on,  it was sort of like a flicker as it came on i.e.  a florescent light that is aging .   The lights were the size of a nickel held out at arms length possibly a dime.    They made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Son watched it just as it was happening and we both had drawn exactly what we saw when we returned to go inside.     Then all of a sudden this light which was the shape of a thumb nail and the same size at arms length had illuminated directly to the left of this cross just as it has illuminated completely  !  This light was about one finger size length away from the cross to the left of the object and it was very bright as if a old style blue flash cube had went off !     Just then the cross began to shut its lights off just as fast as it turned them on in different order .   My Son for what ever reason did not see this part happen,  he may have looked down,  however I never looked away and saw everything !  The Cross was in the Eastern sky and almost directly overhead of my home.    The color of the circle  shaped  lights was white and it was perfectly inline and appeared to be in space , though I really do not have any reference to go by at the time,  only that this is what it looked like.    I would assume if this was a craft it would have to be miles long ! and left us with a sense of Aw  !  This cross was filmed by a Gentleman in South St. Petersburg on the same night as I heard about it on the radio,   he has refused to release the video from what I heard.  He said he was standing out front drinking beer with friends as it appeared and he happened to have his  camcorder.         I had a one plus a digital camera but did not have time to get them out of the box on the ground and did not want to take my eyes off of the cross as it had just finished lighting up and I was waiting for what it would do when the light next to it forced it to shut down .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had immediately walked back up to the house and as I reached the steps I was hit with a really bad feeling as I felt much disbar about what happened   as if the feeling was sent down to me,.    What I felt like.  there was panic where the cross was and just then a second telepathic message came.  As I walked up my steps I stopped and heard  &#34;Eric,  we just cannot return  until this has been resolved &#34;    I remember distinctly hearing my name again as the first word.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still today trying to figure out the meaning of this and why it was shown to us or me,  and since it has happened I have not seen or heard anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> * I have no photo,  although my Son is good with programs and he did a photo shop reconstruction and it is perfectly accurate.<n>

(Ravinia Festival in Highland Park, IL.)  As I was looking up at the stars, I saw a red hazy sphere of light travel across the sky, from the NE to the SW.  This object travelled at a speed approximately twice that of an airplane, but about half the speed of a satellite.  I use these two as a judge, because I had also observed a passenger jet fly over (the place was on a flight plan for O&#39;Hare airport) and a satellite pass over (polar orbit) earlier that evening.  I was watching objects across the sky, such as balloons, planes, and satellites, and it matched none of these objects, because a balloon travelled much much slower, a plane had flashing lights in addition to the red and green wing lights, and a satellite would appear as a point of light travelling faster than this object across the night sky.  In addition, this object was clearly not an asteroid, as an asteroid would appear as a bright green flash.  I watched this object cross the sky - when it had gone behind trees, I checked my watch and it read as a minute or two before 9:00 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object travelled across my field of view (about 140 degrees, I was laying flat on the ground, with my head looking straight up) in about 5 minutes.  Again, the object in my estimation went twice as fast as a passenger jet at cruising altitude, and about half as fast as a satellite.  The object travelled at a steady pace, and did not deviate from a straight-line course.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My uncle told me that he was wishing on the first he saw in the sky,<n> <n><n> <n><n> after a couple of seconds he started watching it closer, it was moving very slow. I then saw it and started talking to him about it. It was like a star only a little off color and it was moving, I knew it was moving because we were fixed with a tree line and saw that it was moving closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went to grab a chair and sit down, (My uncle still fixed to the light) I told him to grab a chair and we will see together. within a matter of a split second that I and my uncle turned to sit down it vanished as if they were watching us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a very bright flood light shining toward the direct of the light so maybe they noticed us. Maybe.<n>

In fact the video tape with a duration time over ten minutes seems to be espectacular in some parts of the same recording. there are plenty of reference points such as clouds, buildings etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This recently sighting will be promove in local tv ufo program.<n>

For the past week, the weather has been sunny with big white pre-storm clouds, up until around 2 or 3pm, then the monsoon (storm) clouds roll in.  We were floating on our backs in the pool, my husband had on his sunglasses and he said, &#34;What&#39;s that shiny spot?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and to the south and saw, in the blue sky, between the clouds, a shiny object, not moving, and if you closed one eye, it was about the size of the head of a pin.  Right then, a jet airliner flew out at an upper left angle, from behind the cloud, which was below the object.  The jet had contrails and at this point there was no doubt about it, that the object was stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before, my husband first saw the object, he commented on the beautiful cloud formations around the sun and that I should go get my camera.  I said, nah, I already have similar pictures.  Then right after he said that, is when he and I noticed the object. I jumped out of the pool to get my camera and right as I got into the house, he said the object started moving to the right (west), still viewable against the blue sky but at times crossing in front of the clouds.  When it was stationary, it was almost like a &#34;little sun&#34;, I&#39;m sure the sun was reflecting off of it, but once it started to move it was white, then when it was in front of the clouds it was dark or gray.  It was almost like we were being watched and once it knew we were aware of it&#39;s presence, and that I was going for my camera, it took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a Sony DSC-W7 7.2 pixel camera, I zoomed in and was able to get 5 shots. (Too bad I haven&#39;t figured out how to work the video feature yet!) I was disappointed that I didn&#39;t listen to my husband and get my camera sooner; as I would have gotten quite a crisp shot of the object while it wasn&#39;t moving.  I uploaded the pictures on my computer and zoomed in, the shape then appeared horizontal/rectangular/cylindrical and considering enlarged pixels, each time I zoomed in, it also may have been saucer shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observing the object crossing the sky, I actually got a &#34;feeling&#34; that this was definitely not a aircraft.  To me, the best way I can describe it, is the feeling you get when you see a helium filled latex balloon released and then caught in an air current.  Which you are only able to view from the ground for about 1000 feet, then it gets to tiny to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to say, this object was no balloon, it was higher in the sky than the jet aircraft that crossed the sky below it and we watched it cross the sky in a westerly direction for a good 30 seconds before it went behind a cloud and out of our line of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jet aircraft was not coming in for a landing at McCarran Airport, it was enroute elsewhere.  So if the jet was at cruising altitude, this object had to be at least twice as high in the sky.  Maybe I should listen to my husband more often!<n>
8/14/05 13:00|Claremont|CA|Light|30 seconds|Three moving lights of planetary brightness.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46362.html|193|ndxe200508| Three moving lights of planetary brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to say any scientist who saw what I did would have written down the day and time, but lately my personality has been a little flat and I just said to myself casually &#34;well there you have it, we have been visited&#34;.  O.K. that out of the way, it was definitely within the last two weeks or week. I went outside to have a cigarette in the wee hours, was listening to flamenco and working on a science project, I sat down and looked to the east at the constellation Orion and I thought, are those three stars the belt or the sword? They were in the configuration of the sword, but much brighter so I thought the belt? Then I realized they were too bright for the belt too. They infact did not blink as stars do, and I thought they looked like planets. They were somewhere between the brighteness of Venus and Jupiter at their brightest. But planets aren&#39;t typically that close together, and are usually more to the south. It was then that they started to move like a swarm of bees that have been aroused, slower than a bee though, faster than an airplane, in crazy paterns like circles, about the apparent circumference of the moon, allot tighter even. I thought nothing man made can move like that, so I thought is what I am seeing here is out of the noramal, could I be seeing a UFO. Before I could decide they stopped moving in circles and ellipses, or something like a path traced out by scribble, moved toward the horizon in a straight line and vanished beneath it. Orion was about a good three or four visual feet above the horizon. I used to work at an observatory, hence the accurate description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> GUFOG Report of Minor Observation During MUFON of Georgia Skywatch<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 13Aug05 GUFOG&#39;s friend and associate, Georgia MUFON Director Mark Ausmus, was holding a Skywatch atop Brasstown Bald (BTB), the highest point in Georgia at 4,784 feet. BTB is located within the Chattahoochee WMA directly on the boundary separating Union and Towns Counties. BTB is located appx. 82 miles NNW of Atlanta.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This writer arrived on BTB at about 10:00PM and met with Mark and four of his MUFON staff. This local surveillance began from the large parking and picnic area atop the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier in the afternoon and evening there had occurred an EXTREMELY HEAVY period of rain which began to clear off by 7:30-8:00PM. Mist and light clouds remained down below, but the top of BTB was far above this and offered almost crystal clear dark skies overhead, with the Milky Way in plain view. Some light mist would occasionally show on the distant horizon, but it would clear off or shift, not much interfering in any way with the excellent visibility and ceiling. The moon had set by about midnight or so. Conditions for a Skywatch seemed to be mostly perfect. The wind was calm and temperatures dropped into the 60&#39;s at that elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The post-peak Perseid meteor activity was consistent and rather &#34;busy&#34; at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 3:57PM, the group was facing more or less to the west, with frequent 360 degree scans and a check of the rear (east) horizon. This writer had turned toward the east for just such a scan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This writer, looking toward the east, observed what appeared to be a light approaching from the NNE appearing to be traveling generally south. It appeared LARGER and BRIGHTER than the starry background. Observed with the naked eye, this light made an obvious swerving motion which seemed to make it EVEN bigger and brighter AS IF coming closer, i.e. seeming to quickly and briefly veer SW TOWARD our location. It is estimated that this light was about 20 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The writer quickly trained 7X50 binoculars on the light and alerted the other members of the party. Upon viewing with magnification, the light appeared to be a TINY PEARL-LIKE GLOWING ORB that was proceeding quickly on a generally N to S course, it&#39;s movements being several rapid &#34;swerves&#34; upward and then levelling off, then repeating this......swerving upward and levelling off, as it traveled N to S. This N to S course was parallel to the large parking/picnic area on top of BTB. This swerving motion was OBVIOUS and seemed almost looping or &#34;snake-like&#34;, especially in the first few seconds. As the ORB continued past, it seemed to get smaller and dimmer and this writer had the impression that it was veering off to the SE, AWAY from the Skywatch&#39;s BTB location. This continued until the ORB vanished among the LOW background of stars. Event duration is estimated at about 10 seconds. Even with the difficulties of determining range or distance at night, this writer had the impression that the ORB was definitely MORE than a mile away and DID in fact come a bit closer to the BTB location for a very brief period during it&#39;s N to S transit i.e. the first few seconds of observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards, the group discussed a satellite, but the DEFINITE swerving observed by this witness was SURE and DISTINCT. This ORB was also low down toward the horizon and seemed to be traveling MUCH faster than any satellite (or even commercial aircraft) previously observed by this writer.  The horizon was noted to be crystal clear at the time of this observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though this observation seems A RATHER MINOR EPISODE, recent reports of unusual and unknown aerial activity from this same mountainous region makes it advisable to describe the event for documentation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An effort to identify this event as PROSAIC was initiated by this investigator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The database of the &#34;Heavens-Above&#34;  (HA) site was consulted.  It revealed that the closest &#34;known&#34; and readily visible satellite to the time period in question (3:57AM 14Aug05) was the ISS.  The HA database indicated that the ISS would appear at about 3.0 magnitude at 4:10:24AM at 10 degrees in the NE........maximum altitude for the ISS at that time would REMAIN at 10 degrees in the NE......the ISS appearance then ENDING at the same 10 degrees in the NE at 4:10:28.......being visible for ONLY four seconds. This is 13 minutes AFTER the observation described above by this writer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This writer, as former MUFON of Georgia SD, ISUR Board member and founder of GUFOG, has utilized the &#34;Heavens-Above&#34; (HA) database for numerous years. It has always proven accurate during many case investigations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One glaring example of HA&#39;s accuracy would be a central Georgia investigation from a few years ago.  While interviewing a witness, she was pointing out the sky movements of an unknown craft observed the night before.  A BRILLIANT flash, almost like some high, fiery pyrotechnic device, surprised both the witness and this writer as we looked up. Upon returning to the office, the writer checked with HA and found a predicted Iridium flare AT THE EXACT LOCATION AND EXACT TIME as the aforementioned flare.  Precise information indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As described above, this writer&#39;s observation from BTB at 3:57AM was 13 minutes EARLIER than the predicted appearance of the ISS.  It was also higher than the predicted ISS and TRAVELED at least 40 degrees on the compass before vanishing appx. in the SE.  Said travel seeming FASTER than previously observed satellites or even commercial aircraft.  Lastly, the movement itself was unique....seeming to &#34;swerve&#34; closer to BTB during the first few seconds, then with &#34;snake-like&#34; motion and swerves, moved NOTICEABLY UPWARDS, then leveling off, upwards then leveling off, repeating several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This writer is continuing with the effort to identify this MINOR unknown observation, but at this time ALSO considers the &#34;Heavens-Above&#34; information to be true and correct. Probably indicating that the unknown observation and the predicted appearance of the ISS to be separate issues.<n> <n><n> <n><n> W.T.

At first I thought they were birds until we noticed that they were emitting light and not reflecting it. No running lights, no sound, moving at an incredible speed. They were pin-points of light, no way of knowing their altitude but I&#39;m sure it was over 150,000 feet. I would approximate their speed at near 24,000 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They described perfect distance between each other, flying in a straight path then once they passed right above us seemed to converge into just one light. I realize now that they did not converge but that the craft were leaving the area and moving straight out toward the northern pole-star area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As if they moved away in perspective. It was an awesome sight indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Birds usually don&#39;t converge on each other like that, satellites are not visible by reflected light at that hour either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Were were in awe by what we saw.

I am clarifying some information a little. I was thinking about it again today (this weird event pops into my mind every once in a while still.. it really impacted me) and wanted to just clarify info a little bit.)---<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three of us in the car on the road going out for the night.  It was early August on a Thurs or Friday night, somewhere between 10-11 pm. We were in the city on a street driving Northeast, and there were buildings on either side of us on the road, restaurants, mini mall, parking lots etc, all lit up with typical lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly in a split second, all lights went OUT and the sky lit up in a bright flast of light.  There was not an apparent point that this light radiated from, rather the entire half of the Southeastern sky was lit up like daylight. ie, the sky was sky blue.  For that split second it was like daylight (although the extreme opposite direction, the horizon was still dark). before you could blink, everything was back to normal lights back on and everything.  Literally, it occured in a split second. It was VERY WEIRD and paranormal..<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of us in the vehicle screamed and the driver STOPPED the car in the middle of the street. Before we were through jumping/hollering/car stopped it was over, though, leaving us to wonder if it really even happened.

Witnesses: 2(could be more;public)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were just leaving from another friends house. We came to an intersection which headed west to Boulder, Co. We headed straight. Then all of a sudden out of no where like a shooting star. A bright. I mean BRIGHT blue light shot downward towards the north like it was traveling and we were just seeing it above the clouds. When it went across the sky it was only at first like it was surveying our city. Then as my friend and I realized maybe what this was in the couple seconds it was there. It slowed down almost to a stop then shot at even twice it was going when we first saw it. And that was all we saw. It was a duration of about 6-10 seconds in length. It was no shooting star. It wasn&#39;t the space shuttle that was coming back to earth either I will tell you that. I know what I saw. I grew up in Montana. I have been living here in Colorado for about 5-6 years now.

For that split second it was like daylight. before you could blink, everything was back to normal lights back on and everything. It was VERY WEIRD and paranormal.. all three of us in the vehicle screamed and the driver stopped the car. Before we were through jumping/hollering it was over. No sound whatsoever. We all looked at each other in disbelief... in fact we all asked each other &#34; did that just happen&#34; at the same time.

As it passed over us( which was right over the tree line) we began chasing under it ,As I was looking up  the light was so bright but you could kind of make out little lights on the sides of it I was running under it but triped and fell over a rock ,while my friend was helping me up  we both looked up and it was gone<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We each had our cars so I decided to follow her. It was a pretty clear night. While driving on the 60 fwy going east bound a few miles after the 710 fwy.I saw this continous beam of green neon light coming from the sky.  It would have blinded me but the rearview mirror blocked the light from my eyes. I thought the light was probably a cop for some reason I was kind of confused. So I braked lightly looked throught my rearview mirror and my side mirrors, I looked around but there were only cars and I couldn&#39;t find the xource of the light. So I looked up through my windshield and saw it once more then it disappeared. I thought I was the only one who saw it. So I immediately grabbed my cellphone and called my girlfriend which was driving infront of me and I said &#34; DId you see that!?&#34; She said yeah. We wondered what it was. I was relieved cause maybe I was seeing things or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At approx. 11:11 pm  I, the mother, saw three white lights in triangular  formation moving slowly and silently above us.  I pointed it out to my son and he pointed up then his friend saw it, too.  I wanted to go into the house and get binoculars but my son grabbed hold of me and said, &#34;No, something might happen.&#34;  We watched as this very large triangle moved from north to south.  To my surprise , after about 5 min. it stopped its movement looked as if the lights were pulsing then it disappeared just like a switch had turned them off.   All three of us were still gaping at the sky for a moment or two then I went into the house and saw the time was 11:17pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/12/05 05:20|Reno|NV|Light|at least 20 minutes|I saw three strange lights moving erratically over the foothills behind my house, departing in different directions at different times.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45583.html|213|ndxe200508| I saw three strange lights moving erratically over the foothills behind my house, departing in different directions at different times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside in the early morning watching the end of the meteor shower when I noticed two very unusually bright lights near the mountain behind my house that I at first dismissed as stars.  One was located to the West, the other toward the Northeast.  As the sky grew lighter,  I noticed that the lights had not moved from their positions, but the rest of the stars had.  Upon closer observation, I saw that the light in the Northeast was rising into the sky very very slowly, and was also darting slightly from side to side.  I then noticed a dimmer light a little below it also start to rise in the same manner, but almost immediately moved in an Easterly direction, disappearing shortly afterward.  Then the brighter light seemed to stop rising and just hovered, still making small darts from side to side.  I then started watching the other light to the West and noticed it was moving side to side as well.  This one, however stayed closer to the ground, only rising a bit, then sinking down again and again.  The movements were subtle, but it was undoubtedly moving. I have never heard of or seen any kind of vehilcle that moves like these lights did.  Both the lights I saw made no noise, and flickered at an irregular rate.  Each time they flickered, the color seemed to change slightly, from white to blue, to yellow, and I think red, too, but each color was so bright and blended together it was hard to tell.  I&#39;m also pretty sure they changed shape slightly as they flickered.  The lights stayed like this for a while and all I could do was stare and try to process what I was seeing.  Eventually, the Northeast light seemed to move away East across the valley and I lost sight of it, so I kept watching the one to the West.  Almost as soon as the other light left, this light&#39;s movements became more pronounced, rising higher, then sinking, and moving back and forth along the hill.  Each time it sank lower and lower until I lost it behind the hill.  I immediately ran into my house, put on some shoes, and raced out into the desert to find it.  I ran around the hill I saw it disappear behind and saw the light again, still moving in the same manner, but it was moving away over the mountain at a steady pace.  All I could do was watch it zig zag farther and farther away.  It appeared to stop a few times as it did so, but it eventually rounded the side of the mountain and I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always believed in UFOs but never actually thought I would see one.  I was raised in a good family, I get along well with my parents and sisters, and have never been known to lie about something like this.  I am not on drugs and do not have any mental disorders that would cause me to see this.  I still cannot believe what I&#39;ve seen.  I have no rational explanation.  I feel like I must sound completely crazy since I&#39;m the only person who saw this, especially on the night of a meteor shower.  I am absolutely positive, though, that these lights were not stars or meteors or airplanes or anything I&#39;ve seen before.  I am absolutely dumbfounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was too cloudy, but I spotted a single oval object moving rapidly across the sky.  It was heading toward the north side of town, and it had lights on the underside.  It seemed almost to be shiny or have a haze or glow to the sides, but I can&#39;t be sure.  It could have been a trick of the lights on the object.  It did not look like any aircraft I had seen before, and I heard no noise at all.  The object seemed to maintain its speed while overhead, though as I was losing sight of it the object seemed to slow some.  This however could have been due to my perspective and line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My husband is a general contractor/mostly new homes. I currently work at home doing his bookkeeping etc. We are both 40 years old. I went out to my deck shortly afer midnight to watch a meteor-shower which had been predicted by our local news weather man. I was interested because he said as many 60 per hr. could be viewed. As I watched I would also see an occasional plane go by, at usual speed,with flashing lights, etc. But then,around 1:00 a white light came flying by which I noticed was going much faster than a plane.  I thought it must be a faster military craft or something that I&#39;m not familiar with.  It continued to fly up into the sky and I noticed it seemed to slow down,and hover, but I thought, &#34;No, that would be weired&#34;.  It then stopped and looked like it blended into the sky as one of the stars.  I continued to watch it since I had just seen it fly by, I knew it wasn&#39;t a star. For the next 3 hours I watched it as the bright,white, light would move in random directions.  It was similar to a search light, but it would move suddently to the left, or right, or up or down, diagnal, and even zig-zag at times. It also seemed to bounce around. I was very intrigued at first but became frightened. My husband was asleep on the couch and I was reluctant to tell him, thinking he would not believe me if he did not see it move,(since it looked like a star). I woke him after watching it about an hour and being certain that this was nothing I could identify.  He came to the window and watched it until he too saw it moving in random directions. We agreed that we didn&#39;t know what it was, &amp; that I would look into it in the morning to see if there was some explanation. I continued to watch it through my window until a little after 4:00 a.m. I was afraid to go back outside.  It continued to do the same things but it came in closer at one point, as I focused on the movement of the light I could then see that it was not just &#34;a light&#34;, it was attached to something much larger. It was shaped like a tubular light bulb and the light was on the end of it. There was a dim light on the other end. What was happening, was that the bright light part would scope out from the larger part and sort of look around in all directions as though it was searching or surveying. Then it would scope back in. (coming out to the left and back in, to the right).  The light would become brighter as it moved around then dimmer when it was stationary. I could clearly see that the &#34;bouncing&#34; would happen when it moved a certains ways, then stopped. It reminded me of the way a turtle&#39;s head moves around. I don&#39;t know what it was, or what it was doing, but I&#39;ll never forget it, and would love to know. I will never look at a star the same way again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up at the sky, it was a clear night and you could see the stars. All of a sudden I saw this bright white shape, I guess you could say it was in the shape of a tear drop, but very large with a large white tail, moving very fast. Faster than I had ever seen anything move. It lite up the sky, and unlike a falling star that goes downward, this bright white light, with a large trail of smoke behide it. Or what seemed like a trail of smoke was moving upward very very fast. Then it was gone. I had never seen anything before like it. But the stranges thing was the tail of smoke seemed to disappear with it, as though it was attached to it.I can draw it, but having trouble discribing it. We do not live near any airports, airfields armybases or anything that could of caused it. It was very dark out side and this lite up the sky, it was so big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.  PD))<n>

They couldn&#39;t have been an airplane because the lights where exactly parallel the whole time and a little too fast.  They stopped and looked like they were coming forward. There was a little bit of discernable shape around both lights, so I&#39;m unsure if this was an illusion or if it was two objects seperate or one together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I then noticed a second point of light, traveling in unison with the first point of light.  As I began to think this was unusual, I noticed the third point of light, forming a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were all moving perfectly in unison together.  The area between the points of light was black, but it was definitely a solid mass of some sort as it was covering up clusters of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it turn--it appeared to be entering our galaxy from another dimension given how it turned.  As it banked to head SE, the perception of the triangle shaped craft changed.  We watched it as it headed over our house, disappearing behind a large tree.  We ran out into the street but due to the street lights (or perhaps it just disappeared), we lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to my husband, the back end appeared to be square.  An amazing AWESOME experience!  It was obviously very large given how far up it was.  It was absolutely silent.  If you were to measure it holding your hand up against the sky, using your fingers, it was a good 6 inches by 3.5&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is even more amazing is that we saw the very same shaped craft at the Oregon Coast (Yachats) in the early spring of 2001 (approximation), only this time the craft was much lower and we could see a flash of light in the center of it as a red ball of light flew out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And as it flew overhead, the streetlights flickered and briefly went out until the craft literally just vanished as it headed due east over the coast range.  You could feel a strange sensation as it went overhead--it was like massive amounts of electricity crawling over your skin--like we were in a giant electrical field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So to be blessed not just once but twice is totally cool!  With this last visit, we were standing outside, calling for it to land and pop in, have a visit......share a coke or something.  :)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  At first, we wondered whether the witnesses might have observed the three satellites that are seen, from time to time, to fly in formation, thought to be part of the U. S. Navy &#34;NOSS&#34; satellite system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, if the triangle of lights indeed blocked out the stars inside its periphery, then the formation could not have been caused by three orbiting satellites.

We were lying on our backs on our trampoline in the back yard of our Simi Valley, CA home.    At approximately the same time, we both noticed three lights, no brighter than the brightest visible stars, moving from West to East.  I first thought them to be satellites, but they did not move in a straight line and I did not think satellites would travel together in a set of three.  Next, I thought they might be a high-flying formation of military aircraft.  The middle one was out in front of the other two.  However, they were jostling around and did not remain in a tight formation.  We watched them for about 10-15 seconds.  Then when they were at about 80-85 degrees from vertical, the lights simply vanished.  I cannot explain why the lights went out if they were standard airplane lights.  It is possible that the objects were at high enought altitude to still be catching reflection from the sun and then passed far enough to the East that the sun went under their horizon.  I am not sure how high they would have to be to still be catching rays from the sun at midnight, however.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(They were going South from North). Most of the time I can see them for a long way off from were I&#39;am standing but when these went just past the top of my head I lost view of them I should have been able to see them for a long way off they were pretty bright. There were no color lights or blinking, that&#39;s about it. And I couldn&#39;t see them any more, if you put a dime with your arm streched out they probably could all fit that&#39;s how close they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We figured the best place, away from the Kendall area (and bright city lights) was Homestead. We headed down Krome Avenue towards Homestead, but didn&#39;t go down that far. We pulled over on a side street and saw a few meteors. The sky was cloudy so we waited while the moon faded. Then my friend mentioned that she was watching a strange shape between the clouds and that it was flying in a strange manner. I told her it must be a plane. Then my other friend said she was looking at it too. When the clouds dissipated, I saw it. It was coming in closer and then would go backwards. It would then fade. When it got closer, I saw green and red lights and mentioned it out loud. My friend said she saw the same lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed two more smaller objects at a farther distance doing the same thing - flying from center to left, to right, and around in a circluar pattern. I have never seen anything like this and was wondering if anyone saw the same thing tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/11/05 21:00|Mayland|TN|Light|5 minutes|8-11-05 Objects pass in the sky, then play chase!|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45579.html|225|ndxe200508| 8-11-05 Objects pass in the sky, then play chase!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally saw the &#34;dancing&#34; lights I have alway&#39;s heard about. It was awsome! Tonight, I went out side about 9PM to see if the meteor shower was visible yet. I looked straight up and noticed something moving. I live out in the country, under a fly path, and almost alway&#39;s see something moving in the sky&#39;s above me. Most flights are at maximum altitude above me (30 K feet, I believe it is). Anyway&#39;s, looking at this movement in the sky, which seemed to be much higher than normal flights...... much higher, and not the normal path I usually see,heading more south than southeast, when all the sudden I saw it zig-zag. I thought my eyes were playing tricks with me. I kept looking and it happened again. It zig zagged to both sides, several times. So, I ran inside to get my binoculars. When I got back outside I pointed my binoculars towards the area in the sky, where I believed the object should have been by this time and somehow, almost instantly had this object in view. At the same time I saw another object, coming from the opposite direction , in the same view. The paths of both did not look very straight, but definately on the same paths. Their paths looked so close that I thought they were going to hit. As soon as they passed each other, the northbound object immediately turned around and followed the other object, like it was nothing.......kind of like playing a game of chase. The turn radius had to take less than two seconds...... kind of like a kid turning his bike around in the street and heading back in the opposite direction, in one smooth motion. I was awstruck! I have never seen a plane make movements like that, includine jet fighters I have watched on tv. The turn radius was way more severe than anything I have ever seen on tv. I don&#39;t see how someone could withstand G-forces like that, the way the one turned. The objects looked like solid white lights (not blinking like planes usually do), kind of how planets look through a telescope, and they may have even been a little oblong.... not a perfect circle. I watched these until they went beyond the tree lines to the south. I have probably seen thousands of planes in the sky&#39;s, above my house , but have never seen anything like this. This was amazing!!!! I wanted to tell someone, but didn&#39;t know who I should contact. So, I at least wanted to find a web site and get out my enthusiasm of what I had just witnessed. So, here I am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do believe in UFO&#39;s, and do analyze everything I see in the sky that looks suspicious. I alway&#39;s conclude that what I see is a plane, helecopter, weather balloon, or a satelite. I ruled out everything on this list. This definately was odd. These things looked like they were moving faster than the jet&#39;s I watch. I have no idea what I just witnessed. I have to call them unidentified! Not the normal sightnings I usually see in the sky. I just hope someone else saw them. I am so excited!! I almost forgot..... I didn&#39;t hear any sounds coming from these objects.... they may have been too high to hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/11/05 20:40|Edmonton|KY|Triangle|around 3 minutes|On August 11th 2005 my son and I seen a large triangle UFO with 3 lights, with the broad part of the tiangle moving forward.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45623.html|226|ndxe200508| On August 11th 2005 my son and I seen a large triangle UFO with 3 lights, with the broad part of the tiangle moving forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son, and I were coming home from work. It was right after dusk, around 8:40 P.M. We were about 3 miles from Edmonton on Highway 68 &amp; 80 going east. At the top of a hill I seen two lights in the sky. There was a red light an a green light. I said to my son look at those lights. They looked like they were about 300 to 500 yards in the sky. The lights were not flashing. I drove a few hundred yards, then pulled my truck off the road onto the gravel. We both got out of the truck. As we got out of our truck, My son said &#34;look it&#39;s a triangle&#34; I said &#34;yes it is.&#34; When I first looked up, it was right over our heads around 300 to 500 yards off the ground. I could see the triangle shape by seeing the outline of the UFO, and not by just connecting the lights to see the UFO, the bottom of the object was a dark color, maybe black, and There were 3 lights on each end of the triangle. The wild thing about this UFO was the broad side of the triangle was going in front. There was a yellow light in the back. The UFO moved west away from us, with the broad side of the triangle moving forward. I tried to listen for noise from the object, but the cars that went by us interfered. My son said for a few seconds when the cars past he couldn&#39;t hear anything from the UFO. I didn&#39;t hear any noise from the UFO during this whole event. When I got home. I drew a picture of what I seen. I didn&#39;t show my son, who is ten years old. The next day after school. I had my son to draw what he saw. Both pictures were the same, except for the color of one light. I had the green, and red light in front on the broad side, with the yellow in the back. My son had the red, and yellow in front on the broad side with the green in the back. Everything else was the same, including the color, shape, and the broad side of the triangle moving forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got up and went to the back door with her to see what she wanted.  The whole yard was a bright orange / red color; It looked like you had a red spot light on the yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife to come see.  She said get the camera we need to take a picture of this!  After I got back outside and looked up the sky was glowing red and looked like what I had seen in pictures of the northern lights. Red glowing and streaks of dark and light red moving across the sky in kind of like waves. It moved from NW to SE over the house in about 5 min.  It was like it was being pushed across as the sky it turned back to dark blue behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took pictures off the back porch and some more from the side yard as we live in the woods we wanted a better view.  There were some clouds in the area about 25 to 30 miles away and it had just started getting dark but the sky over us was mostly clear but no stars could be seen yet.  We can back inside after it was over to put the pictures on the computer as we had never seen anything like this before.  I have lived here all my live (40 years) and never seen anything like this!  We put the pictures on the computer and started looking at them.  It was then that we found we had not only had taken a picture of the red weird glowing sky, but also something (looks like a triangle craft in the blowup of one of the pictures) moving with the red glow.  I have 3 -4 pictures taken with a 5mp digital camera SVP type that shows the craft as it moved closer/larger in each picture.  The last one you can see it very well as it is glowing yellow in the red glow.  We went back out to see if it was a star or something but no stars could be seen.<n>

8/11/05 02:00|Roseville|CA|Changing|3 minutes between the two|I saw two objects with multiple orange lights (in two seperate patterns) moving  across the sky.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45572.html|232|ndxe200508| I saw two objects with multiple orange lights (in two seperate patterns) moving  across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 2:00 am this morning (August 11th) I was laying on the ground outside watching the annual meteor shower that goes on this time of year.  Then I noticed a moving orange mass that looked like a cloud at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked closer I noticed it was it was five or six orange circles that were in the shape of a dividing rod (one straight end with two ends diagonally coming out of it.  It was being led by the two diagonal ends.  Here is an illustration. The blue arrow indicates which direction it was heading in.   I was facing East and the object was heading West, right in my direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://s88311880.onlinehome.us/pics/UFO1.jpg  It got out of my line of vision, so I got up and ran until I could see it again.  I saw it for another couple of seconds until it disappeard over the horizon of my house.   I scanned the sky everywhere trying to look for it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, from a completely different direction (North),  I saw another moving mass of about six circular orange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time they were in the shape of an arc, as illustrated here: http://s88311880.onlinehome.us/pics/UFO2.jpg Once again, it was moving in the direction of the blue arrow from the angle I saw it (Me facing North, the object heading West - Northwest.)  As it moved more to the left,  the lights got closer together like this: http://s88311880.onlinehome.us/pics/UFO3.jpg  This mass of lights stayed in my line of vision for a good twenty seconds before disappearing over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both objects didn&#39;t make any noise from what I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before the sighting I was quite relaxed just laying back watching for the occasional shooting star to send a white streak across the sky.  (By the way, I am 100% sure this was not a shooting star or anything like it.)  When I saw the first one shaped like the dividing rod,  I was confused.  I knew it wasn&#39;t a star or any type of airplane that I&#39;ve ever seen. It also didn&#39;t appear to be a &#34;light show&#34; produced by a machine or anything.   After I realized that it wasn&#39;t a normal object in the sky, I was shocked.  That&#39;s why I ran around looking to see if I could find it again.  When I saw the second arc-shaped one I was even more shocked because it was completely different than the first one, so I figured it was a completely different entity than the first one.  The lights were the same reddish-orange color as the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In both instances, the orbs were moving faster than an airplane or jet.  They weren&#39;t moving extraordinarily fast,  but definetly faster than any airplane I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I don&#39;t really believe in aliens or extraterrestrials.  Normally when I see someone talking about a UFO sighting,  I figure they were either intoxicated or saw an ordinary object (like a plane or light show) and misconstrued it as being foreign.  So for me to actually see something that *I* couldn&#39;t identify as something you&#39;d normally see in the sky,  I&#39;m just in shock and disbelief.   I keep thinking &#34;I&#39;m not one of those crackpots.&#34;  But I know I saw *something* up there.  Something strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure there is some logical, &#34;Earthly&#34; explanation for it.  But I can&#39;t for the life of me figure out what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best bet is that maybe they were some military planes that aren&#39;t really known to the public.  But if they were, they sure had a strange flight pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope I was thorough enough in my explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Neither of us have ever seen a UFO previous to this occasion, and have only heard stories. I was out on my apartment balcony which faces south, just after night-fall, when I noticed a orange looking star-like object slowly streaking &#34;down&#34; the sky in the west. The character of the object was that of a comet. The object began above us and to the west of us, and was slowly streaking down in the western sky. The object was moving at an angle so that it may have been only reaching the western horizon, and not actually falling. As the object neared the horizon, it disappeared into the clouds. Six main points of interest that may be helpful to anyone reading this for investigative purposes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1 - my wife and I both agree that the object had a tail (comet like tail).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 - my wife and I both agree that the object was shifting horizontally in the sky, and that the tail was not effected - the entire tail was shifting with it (jumping to the left and right).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 - My wife and I both agree that there was some sort of activity around the object, appearing as dancing blue specks of light to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4 - Upon calling my brother who lives about 50 miles away in Greenville, TX he confirmed the same comet like light with a comet like tail, in the same part of the sky, headed the same direction. He saw this briefly before it disappeared into the clouds. (Brother is a religious conservative who would never believe he saw a UFO - he felt this was a comet).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5. My wife and I researched every website we could find on the sky that night, and found no reports of a comet. The Perseids meteor shower was scheduled for within the next couple of days - but this object moved much much slower than any shooting star/meteor that I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6. Both my wife and I agree that the object was an orange ball of light, looking about the size in the sky that a planet looks like when we see mars, only it was moving with a tail streaking behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself (age 26)- Open minded individual, who has shown intrest in UFO/paranormal activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wife (age 24) - Not open minded, does not show intrest in UFO/paranormal, and pokes fun at these types of things (feels there must be some logical explanation for what we saw that night, like a sattelite or something).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brother (age 29) - Definately not open minded, very conservative (also feels there must be some logical explanation for what we saw that night, thinks it was a comet).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note - just found this website months later from the incident - the date of occurence is exact - the time may be off by minutes.<n>

In our search for adventure, we cruised through a grave yard on the edge of the city limits and near the local airport.  I was the driver, and as we explored the maze of graveyard lanes, my friends began seeing glowing white and red lights.  One of the girls in the back seat was nearly hysterical in directing me which way to drive so as to avoid the lights they were seeing.  I believed their sightings to be the late-night imaginations of ditsy teen-agers. I never saw what they were describing until, as I exited the cemetary, I stopped the car to &#34;call them on their bluff&#34; of seeing strange lights.  I parked along the road&#39;s edge after turning out of the cemetary driveway.  It was then that I saw, through my open drivers&#39; side window, a red, soupcan shaped, glowing object - the color of a reflector for driveway entrances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was positioned about three feet above the ground, over the grassy ditch portion of the corner area where the cemetary driveway met he road. It didn&#39;t register for me that it was glowing of it&#39;s own power - not reflecting light from my car&#39;s lights. I thought that a reflector was exactly what it was and opened my door to prove it.  As soon as my leg moved to step out, the objct took off.  It moved quick and silent. The cylinder shape was traveling so that the cylinder was verticle in relation to the ground (like a bar glass slides accross the bar to the customer - not horizontal like a thrown spear).  It moved parallel to the groud and to the road. It glided at a steady and fast speed remaing about three feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so startled and frightened, I slammed my car door closed and drove away as fast as I could.  Even though I drove in the same direction as the object traveled I did not see it again. I wasn&#39;t looking for it. I was watching my gas gage at nearly empty and was trying to drive to get away from it.  I have wished ever since that I had not been so hasty in my get-away.  I wish I had taken more time to watch it and find more clues about what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends tell a longer version of this event, however, they saw more than I and I feel that I can only speak for what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Thats when i seen 3 triangle shaped ...Things in the sky. At first they looked like a plane ( i wear glasses) but i thought why would 3 planes stay together? I got my glasses and I looked out the window. There was a bright green flash.It started to hover over the houses. I thought i was having a dream. So i went back to sleep. Then later I heard the sound of the triangles before.Then a green light.So i went over to my camera and took some photos.Thats when i noticed something under the ship that was the source of the light. I seen it moving toward my friends house. Then it switched to my house then it went away for like 20 min.Later I heard the noise again thats when i seen a bigger shape. A sphere in the air! It was like 46 yards long. then it beamed down at the triangles. Then the dissapeared. Thats all I remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Possible bolide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 23:45 my friend and I were on the boardwalk at New Smyrna Beach watching lightening over the ocean. A storm had just passed through an hour before and was off shore. We noticed a large turqouise-colored ball of light, surrounded by a haze, streaking silently from north to south over the ocean, in the direction of the Kennedy Space Center about 14 miles to the south. The object was the size of a quarter held at arm&#39;s length and had a long, hazy, bluish tail. What was curious was the object&#39;s bluish color, unlike any colors of comets or meteors I have seen, and that it seemed to move slower than a comet. Our observation time was about 3 or 4 seconds before the object vanished. I would surmise that we witnessed a bolide and that atmospheric conditions were responsible for the odd color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I did not see the object myself, my camera captured the UFO in one of the photos I took of the boys in my community.  The two shapes that I saw after down loading them in my computer.  I still don&#39;t believe because I did not see it myself.  But it is in the picture I took that day.  There were no sounds that day so we never heard any sounds to make us see the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sick with the flu and awake on my couch in the complete darkness.  Light filled up my backyard (like a helicopter spotlight).  The light was bright and stayed for a second then went away.  I went to the backdoor to look into the sky looking for a helicopter.  Then the more lights began shining down.  Red lights.  Then the went away.  I open the door and stood outside looking for a helicopter.  It was dead silent when I stepped outside.  no helicopter sounds or airplane sounds.  The lights seemed so close I should have heard the helicopter if that&#39;s what it was.  Later that morning I heard the sonic boom of the space shuttle which landed around two hours after this event.  I wonder if the lights could have been associated with that?<n>

It looked like a circle of green light.  Much like a star would but with a more green hue.  It was much much larger then a star, and apeared to be an extremely high altitude plane height or higher (I would say on the higher side).  I saw it, and I had a split second to notice that it was weird, then it shot off.  It went from left to right.  I only had a split second to see it before it flew off.  It covered 25-35 degrees it about 3/4 to 1/2 a second.  For comparision, it would take a plane about minute or more to just get to where I lost sight of it.  There may have been a small redish orangish center to the light, but I saw it only briefly, and the green stood out far more.  I flew off not as fast as a meteor or comet, but so much faster then any plane I have ever seen.  It flew behind a tree.  I had been walking my dog, right outside my large apartment complex, so it took me a second to think, then I knew that was pretty weird, so I went to see, around the tree that it had shot around (the tree blocked my vision as to where it went, but this object was very high, not near the tree at all, we are talking plane height or far above.)  And it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was in nearly due west.  Past a freeway in california called 280.  The SF airport is due east.  But this was miles away from that.  I saw it at 10:38 (I check the time) give or take a minute, or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like it.  I grew up in the country, in a spot off the coast of california where planes fly all the time.  So I have seen allot of planes night and day.  I now live near the SF airport, so I know of course what flying planes look like.  This was nothing a plane could have done.  It could have been a meteor or something like that.  Or a space shuttle.  But that would not explain why it moved so fast.  It is a UFO to me, but there deffinately could be a logical explination (that is really what I am looking for)  I have never seen anything I would call a UFO before.  I am pretty skeptical about anything like this.  I really just want to know what it was, or if someone else saw it (the bay area has allot of people, and anyone looking into the western sky would have seen this.)  I never would file a report like this, but I am really curious, as to what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But on those occasions we couldn&#39;t really pinpoint anything contacting back in Rockford. How ever on or about the date I saw it I could say differently now about the contact back. On that night I wasn&#39;t even attempting to signal anything but always studied the skies. Any ways that night I looked up and saw what appeared to be a flashlight type orb similar to someone flashing a light just beaming, so for about 10-12 seconds I looked at it and all I can say is to my eye view  it was about 10-15 yards wide. And after the few seconds elapsed it went from being on to off, and judging by the brightness of the sphere when it shut off so signal like I never forgot about when I was trying to signal them in a similar fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s just one of my sightings in Rockford Illinois and probably the strongest case I have here to instill my belief in a higher existence. I don&#39;t need anyone to believe me but to those who have seen something similar just be careful what you wish for and be aware of your surroundings, because I have seen other ones.

It was directly ahead of me, maybe 1,000 feet in altitude. It had a shadow in the middle of the body that was kind of triangular-shaped like a wing might make, and I kept trying to make out a wing from it, as I see the large commercial jet airliners flying over daily. But it didn&#39;t conform to anything I could recognize. It had no windows, stripes or any features on the body except for the shadow shape. I realized it didn&#39;t taper at the tail as jetliners do. The long shape was perfectly even, and it seemed to be stationary in the sky. A few buildings blocked my view for a moment, and when I looked for it again it was gone. I looked very carefully but it just wasn&#39;t there. It was too high to have gone behind anything on the horizon. A mile or two later, still traveling east I saw it again, at the same altitude but a half mile or so south. It appeared to be stationary , as before. I see blimps flying around here and this was definitely not a blimp. Again my view was blocked by some trees and buildings, and a moment later when I got a clear view of the sky it was gone. I parked by Lake Union, with a wide open view of the sky, and tried to see it, but it was just gone. I did see a smaller plane in the distance flying from north to south, and it was easy to see it moving, compared to what I had just observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(i wonder if that person was me, leaving a message during my initial excitement of seeing the shuttle.)  i turned the news on and then learned that the space shuttle was still at high altitude and was certainly not the the space shuttle we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> as i continued to make phone calls i was referred to &#39;the tower&#39; at the airport in eugene.  they had had some special planes in over the weekend, but the woman i spoke to in the tower said their last plane had left, its departure time did not coincide with our sighting of the space shuttle, and the plane did not resemble the space shuttle.  the woman in the tower referred me to &#39;seattle ufo&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i wonder if we had seen a &#39;secondary shuttle&#39;, which may have been checking out weather conditions over edwards air force base because the shuttle was not going to be able to land in florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> my husband is an engineer.  my career was in the legal field.  we both felt that we were very clearly looking at the space shuttle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> did anyone else see the space shuttle at this time and place?<n>

It was too far away to make out any shape, but after looking at my star software, I ruled out any planet, star or other celestial object.  It had caught my attention because it was so bright, like a bright Mars in the sky, or a tad brighter and larger.  But it was white, like a star and it was flashing red.  I needed to know what it was, but after viewing my sky astronomy software and finding nothing even closely matching, I realized it must be something else.  The object could be seen looking into the western sky at about 11:30pm, and finally going out of vision (very small spec by this time but the flashing red still visable) at about 2:00am, traveling very slowly in a west-ward direction.  I grabbed my camcorder to see if I could zoom in any closer on this object.  While I did record the flashing red, you can&#39;t make out anything else.  Please let me know if you have any questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Up above the sun every so often I would see the sun shine on something that looked metallic for 30-40 seconds then the object would dissapear. I first noticed the objects a few miles before Herlong and all the into Susanville I saw it. So I stopped at my moms shop on main street to see if my driving was causing it to go in and out of focus. As I was standing out on the side walk I saw it again and yelled for my mom to look but by the time she came out it was not visible. So I am wondering if it was a satellite, planet, star, or whatever. I have seen something similar a few weeks ago but it was about 2:30 in the afternoon and off to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Thinking it odd that the northern lights would be in the east-- during the summer-- I pulled off the road, turned off my headlights and rolled down my car window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a shimmering light that was behind some low cloud cover. The shimmering was similar to the way sunlight filters through clouds in distinct rays-- or sun rays at sunset when they are distinct and moving. The light shimmered from right to left and another layer from left to right simultaneously. Then, what looked like a search-light moved across the clouds from right to left,hesitated, jerked back, went above the clouds, moved from left to right above, and then repeated the movement under the clouds. I could not discern whether the light was touching the ground or just the clouds. I listened for aircraft but only heard insects. I then continued driving south on 287-- stopping occasionally to attempt to understand what I was seeing. Although I was moving fast, the lights were still on my left as if they had also moved at 80 mph. I stopped, looked, and they came closer. I thought maybe there was a search for a missing person and they might think  my turned off headlights were suspicious. Then there were two searchlights in front of the shimmering background. Then there were three and one came close enough to me that I could see the source of the light better. It was round. (sorry). I became really frightened and confused by it all and sped into town. The next day I traveled 287 northbound along the same stretch. I looked for evidence of three towers, an airport, something, but there was neither a road nor electric access in the area. I&#39;m not a ufo ish person but I had my finger on a speed dial to my family just in case. Does anyone know what that was? ,p h Location: Between 60 miles north of Medicine Bow and 15 miles north of M B WY Date: August 7, 2005, Sunday morning at 3:34 a. m.<n>

While standing in my yard you can see the plane traffic lanes going from west to east and ease to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well that night I was looking at the sky as I always do.  I picked up on a star in the North, North West moving.  Well it looked like a star.  It was as bright as a star.  I watched as it moved to the South, South East.  I first saw it at about 25 degrees in North sky and it disappeared at about the same in the south.  This thing was way higher than any plane I have ever saw.  It had no flashing lights just a constant white, like a star.  It went with the curveature of the earth and left no trail.  So I know it was not a shooting star.  It only took 30 seconds or so to travel from one horizon at 25 degrees up to the other horizon about 25 degrees up. Trees got in the way to the south and I first saw it about that degree to the North.  I thought, maybe a satalite or Space Station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I thought glowing like a star, maybe the sun was lighting it up, but the sun is on the other side of the planet then and it would not make it look like it was glowing.  This is the first thing I have ever seen that made me think that it could be a UFO.  Also, there was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do believe in UFO&#39;s this is why I go out back with the dogs every night weather permitting around 1 AM to 3 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was really fascinating.  I will keep my eyes looking to the sky, hoping to shoot a 7 mm. magnum at one that is up real close.  If it ever happens.  Bringing one down is the only way one could prove they are here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know whether this is intended to be a serious report.

Well the more I looked at it the more I thought it wasn&#39;t a star.  When I arrived at my work, I got out of my car to look at it more closely.  It wasn&#39;t too high in the sky just about where planes would be at and it moved very strangely.  It would make quick little jerks just about in any direction and zig-zag like movements also. It changed into different colors very rapidly.  It was almost like it was a color strobe light in the sky. It lasted for about an hour.  I went back out side around 1 am and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My husband, brother and buddy went to the drive in over in Marysville to see Dukes of Hazard and Stealth. Both *OK* movies, fyi.  First of all, I know that we were damn near facing Beale so, so much is possible right there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But any how, during stealth, I see above and just to the left of center of the screen a big almost see-through like grayish oval/roundish deal.  kind of looked mechanical (remember the Borg ship on star trek TNG??...sort of like that).  It wasn&#39;t a whole object...i mean, it looked like there parts you could just see right through.  It only appeared in my direct line of vision for as long as you can take a deep breath.  it seemed to fade quickly toward the right.  I was shocked as hell and yelped *did you guys see that??*  a bunch of *huhs??* was the response so I shut up because it was an important part of the movie.  Maybe my mind is screwing with me, i thought and kind of let it go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, after the movie i brought it up and before i could say *grey* *see-through*  or  *oval shapped*  my brother pipes up with  &#34;yeah, i saw something too.  Kind of yada yada yada. &#34;  I about crapped myself because I wasn&#39;t alone on this one!!!  woo-hoo, one for the home team! but he said that he saw it in the corner of his eye off to the right of the screen.  i know that the &#34;corner of the eye&#34; descriptions prompt a lot of skepticism, but I saw that same damn thing.  There has got to be something to it, don&#39;t you think?  I had never seen anything like this in real life - unfortunately the only thing I can relate it to is a tv show alien craft.  lol.  go figure.  Nevertheless, I wasn&#39;t alone and to hear my brother (mr. mellow, never gets upset or weirded out about anything) describe the same WEIRD ASS thing, kind of gives me the willies.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/6/05 23:00|Loveland|CO|Light|30 seconds|Flashing light with no running lights inbetween flashes over NE Colorado|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45498.html|272|ndxe200508| Flashing light with no running lights inbetween flashes over NE Colorado<n> <n><n> <n><n> While stargazing last night (8/6/05) approximately 10:55 MT, a lady friend with me pointed out a white flashing light in the NE sky travelling to the north.  The light flashed once like a bright aircraft light but after the initial flash there were no visible running lights like a conventional aircraft.  About 10 seconds later the light flashed again in an apparent northward movement, and repeated once more about 10 seconds later further north again.  There were no lights or shapes visible inbetween flashes. It was then obstructed from view in the distance by trees and buildings. The light appeared bright and close enough that normal aircraft running lights would have been easily visible inbetween the long delay between flashes.  Also the light first appeared in the NE section of the sky, it was not visible coming from the south. We had been skygazing continuously for approximately the past 20-30 minutes prior to the sighting, were actually looking up when the first flash occurred, and would have seen the light if it had been approaching from the south. The only other events of note were that we did notice 3 or 4 meteor streaks spaced out over the time we were gazing, and the only possible way for me to explain the light conventionally might be a small meteor travelling too slow to create a visible streak but fast enough for some material to have heated during reentry and ignited intermittently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Note to NUFORC personnel: I&#39;ve submitted a number of reports over the past few years and mentioned this to the NUFORC hotline, which I called just before entering this report.  I realize one can go for years or never at all without seeing a ufo, and receiving yet another report from me might create suspicion, but for the record I maintain that all I do is look up, and that these are all legitimate reports that describe events that are just not conventional enough for me to dismiss as such.)<n>

At first we thought it was an airplane on fire about to crash. After crossing over I5, object hovered over the fields next to Southbound I5. At closer observation object had two round bright white lights. Object separated into 3 objects, each with two bright round white lights. 1 object changed color to yellow lights. One object changed color to red lights. Yellow lights flew back over I5 to fly over the fields next to Northbound I5. Objects were flying over the fields to either side of I5. Observers in car kept driving and eventually lost sight of objects behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Detailed Version: What driver saw: Driving north on I5, having passed the stockyards on the right side of North I5 and maybe 5 minutes further (doing 70-80 mph). Near Exit 33 (Coalinga). Driver saw a very bright white object flying very fast from the right side of the sky. She said she knew it wasn’t natural, because it was a clear dark starry night, and it was too low for an airplane. She said it was a very bright white light. She said as it crossed over all lanes of I5 (from right to left) a half mile in front of the car, she could see in profile that it was a thin wedge shaped object that was so bright she thought it was an airplane on fire, about to crash. But it crossed over all lanes of I5 and hovered over the empty fields to the left of us, next to Southbound I5. Her impression was that it was about the size of a jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw (Passenger): The driver had just seen a bright white object fly low across all lanes of I5 and then stabilize, hovering above the fields to the left of us. I missed this because I had my eyes closed, resting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said, “What was that !” and I opened my eyes to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked across the highway ahead and to our left. What I saw looked like two round bright white lights (bright like halogen lights) at about the height of a medium sized radio tower (Note – I did not see any tower). My friend, on the drivers side, had a better view, and she described it as super bright and was illuminating the field below it - bright and white as a search-light. She said she could see the leaves of the vegetation in the brightness of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She asked me again what I thought it was in the field on our left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the object appeared to me like two horizontally aligned round lights close together, as if connected or mounted near each other but not touching. I saw the bright lights but did not see that they were attached to anything (I have poor night vision and was wearing old eyeglasses). It was too dark for me to see anything in profile, all I saw was lights. I said, “Its just a radio tower&#34; (I had NOT been looking ahead and had not seen the object flying across I5 in front of us). She insisted I was wrong, that it had flown there and was hovering, and asked me to look again. So I twisted in my seat to watch it as we passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first as I stared at the bright horizontal dual-lights they were stationary in the air. Then suddenly, they tilted in the air to slant downwards at an angle (30 degrees). As I watched, a second dual-light object slid out from behind the first one (at the same angle), so that now there were two, and then a third slid into view so now there were 3 distinctly separate dual-light objects. They paused, then object3  oriented back to horizontal and flew to the right and up, away from the other two. At the same time, Objects 1 and 2 separated further from each other. It was VERY Dark, I5 has no lights. I kept my eyes on object3 so as not to lose sight of it. Suddenly, with a bright Flash, object3’s lights changed from Bright white to Bright yellow. In the peripheral of my vision I could see that another of the objects changed from white to Red at the same time. I believe the original object 1 stayed white. I confirmed this later with my friend who was driving – she had taken a glance at the object(s) as it separated and changed colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all happened very quickly (maybe 10 seconds from separation to color change).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Objects moved smoothly (not in jerks) and flew smoothly while I observerd, clearly fast but did not move at jet speeds, more like fast helicopter speeds. The driver said she thought they where a little higher than an overpass, which is consistent with my observation that they were about the height of a medium sized radio tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Yellow object now started to fly across I5 again, passing overhead. I looked up through the glass sunroof as object3 (the Yellow lights) passed overhead. I did not see any “shape” of an aircraft – just the yellow lights (but I was wearing my old eyeglasses). I also did not hear any aircraft engines or noise – and even though the car windows were closed, I think I would have heard jet engines or helicopter blades at the height it passed over us, if it was that sort of craft. The yellow lights (object3) hovered over the empty fields to our right, as our car drew further ahead of it. Object3 must have been also flying parallel to our direction, because it maintained its distance behind us, moving around a bit over the fields, and we were not leaving it behind as quickly as if it had been stationary. This spooked both of us, and we drove faster. It was perhaps a minute before we finally lost sight of it behind us (which is a long time when you’re doing 70-80 mph). I finally lost sight of it when it started to cross over I5 again. I twisted around in my seat to look across I5 to the fields on the left of us, looking for the other objects. I briefly saw a bright white lighted object on the side of I5 south, then lost sight of it in the dark behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the time, it was 9:18 pm (pst). I estimate the duration of our sighting was from 3 to 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no headlights of traffic behind us (there had been at the start).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am assuming other drivers slowed down or stopped to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were too spooked to stop. Traffic on Southbound lanes of I5 was becoming heavy and slowing down – I suspect due to people slowing down as well, to watch this phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was standing in the doorway of the business I work at catching some fresh air and watching people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 blocks further North of us is a condo.  As I looked in this direction I viewed what I thought at first to be a plane emerging from approximately 1/2 to 1 mile from behind the building.  As I watched this &#34;plane&#34; I thought it to be moving too slow to be acting like an average small plane like a cesna type.  I kept watching this object as its flight path took it due South over N.W. 4th Ave over Downtown Portland Oregon.  My store is located on the corner of 4th Ave. and West Burnside Street and it took this object approximately 6 minutes to travel 1/2 to 1 mile behind the originating building which is located at N.W. 4th Ave. and Flanders Street (which is about 5 blocks North of my store) to being above my store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was circular in shape.  Silver in color with a darker underside possibly black in color.  The top half appeared to be dome shaped and the underside was tubed shaped.  At the point when it was above my store it appeared to extend the &#34;tubing&#34; that protruded from the underside and then retract it.  The object emitted no sound or lights of any kind.  It was approximately 1000 feet in the sky and smaller than the size of a dime.  When viewing it from the street it was about 2 inches above my store which is a 2 story building.  The object was viewed by five other people including one co-worker of mine.  Several pictures were taken of the object as it approached my store and I am waiting for the film to be developed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/6/05 18:55|Wheaton|IL|Sphere|45 minutes|Sighting of bright orb in sky, following an unusual path, reversing directions twice|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45495.html|277|ndxe200508| Sighting of bright orb in sky, following an unusual path, reversing directions twice<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:55 PM on Aug 6th, in a sunny, cloudless sky, I noticed a white speck of light in the Eastern sky, rising up slowly at about 2 o&#39;clock arc due East, but heading due West at about the speed of a jet or a sattelite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it might be a jet, since it was moving at about the speed of one roughly at 25,000 feet--but this looked different from a jet or conventional aircraft of any type: I could see no appendages, it appeared to be internally luminous, not like the reflected light off of a plane, and though high up, appeared round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it continued rising, about 30 seconds into this, I noticed that there was another pinpoint of light in the sky that was also roughly 2 o-clock east, but reddish in color like that of Mars (except of course this was daytime, and it was a bright blue sky at the time)--and this one was standing perfectly still. I watched as the first orb continued on in its path and by passed by the other reddish orb, fairly close by, and which also seemed to be internally lit, like a soft glow, rather than reflective. I lost track of that second one as I continued focusing on the first orb,which gradually made its way almost directly overhead, though about 1 o&#39;clock northward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By about the time it reached zenith (or a little bit north of that), which was a few minutes into the sighting, it had slowed down, and now remained completely motionless for about five minutes straight, almost directly overhead of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, at about 7:00 or 7:05 PM, it began slowly backing up and going *backward* in an easterly direction, roughly along the same pathline from which it came, but somewhat more northeastly in arc this time. It was continuing very, very slowly, and about five or ten minutes into this movement, it stopped once again and remained motionless in the sky at about 2 o&#39;clock NE. It seemed to be getting smaller as if it were ascending higher, and it was hard to keep track of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, at around 7:20 or 7:25 PM, it began going Westward once again, slowly climbing back as it had the very first time but in a somewhat more southwesterly arc this time, but more or less to where the same general area spot it had reached and reversed direction at earlier. This time, it finally reached the zenith of the sky at roughly 7:30.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I continued watching as it moved very, very slowly further West, but covering only a small arc of sky as it grew smaller and smaller in size, and I lost track of it around 7:40. At last sighting it was located about just a few minutes in westward arc from zenith.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting lasted almost exactly 45 minutes, as I looked at my watch both at the beginning and end of the sighting. (The other times cited are more iffy.) In short, the overall trajectory formed a kind of &#34;Z&#34; pattern (but more as begun from the bottom right of the Z and up, rather than the upper left and then down, if you know what I mean.) I have no idea as to its size, but I would guess just based on various factors (see below), this object was anywhere from 50 to 100 feet across; if so, then it&#39;s safe to say that it was roughly at 30 to 40 thousand feet high--or more--especially towards the end. (By way of reference, at one point a jetliner flew across the sky, heading in a Westerly direction, coming close to crossing the path of the orb, probably at around 25 or 30 thousand feet--and the orb seemed much higher to me, based on its luminosity and the atmospheric haze over each body. Pure guesswork, of course, but worth mentioning. )<n>

We checked the GPS heading and the direction was South West which is only hundreds of miles of ocean, thus that ruled out any reflection on any buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, it could not have been a ship because it was 100 feet off the ground with no structure below.  It seemed to be 4 to 5 miles away in the distance but that was our guess. It had no sound of blades on a helicoper as it stood there for 10 minutes hoovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we noticed it started to get closer and bigger and some friends were getting a little freaked out but I felt only positive from it. Its strange for me to explain but that it what I felt. I knew we had nothing to be worried about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it stopped and hoovered for another 9 or 10 mintues at that moment I got 1 picture of it(not digital) :(.<n> <n><n> Then finally the object reversed in the same direction and speed it came from and then just faded out and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded quite credible to us.

It stayed in front of the clouds and never moved from what we could tell. Five photos were taken with a Sony DSC-717 using 10x Precision Digital Zoom. The first photo shows the object in full length but until looked at on computer, another object appears below it which looks like a circle or something. The second and third photo only shows the first object. The fourth photo shows the object change from a straight line to something that looks like this( ~ ), down on one end and up on the other. All photos were taken within one minute. It hung out for about twenty minutes and disappeared. The sad part is we didn&#39;t see how it dissappeared. A friend and I were trying to fix a sprinkler head and glanced up every now and then not seeing it leave. The object was sighted from Spring Valley, CA. on August 6 2005. The pictures were taken at 1:05 P.M. After observing the object for 10 minutes or so the pictures were taken. Looking at the object, it was pointing in a southwest by northwest direction and remaining still as we watched it from the north. It appeared to be hovering at approximately 1000-2000 feet; it was hard to tell due to the lack of comparison against another object at a fixed altitude. It was definitely at an altitude too high to be a kite.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The camera on the space shuttle was focused over the eastern Pacific Ocean west of California. It was still dark over the eastern Pacific Ocean but the sun had already rose over much of California. I noticed what appeared to be two Satellites flying past the space shuttle in the distance about 1 minute apart heading in the same direction. Then a very bright object heading in a different direction and moving twice as fast as the Satellites came into camera view. The bright object abruptly stopped and did a 180 and heading back in the direction it came from. This took place within minutes of the space shuttle entering daylight over the California coast on August 6, 2005.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another note: I believe the space shuttle was in sleep mode at the time of this event so the light was not caused by the space shuttle thrusters or waste.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The whole sighting lasted approximately 45 seconds.  Did anyone else see it?  There were several distinct &#34;contrails&#34; in the sky all around it left earlier from passing jets.  The sky was blue and the weather was clear with just some high feather-like cirrus clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While viewer records it all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of August 6th between 7:00-7:30AM My wife and I were watching NASA TV from our Direct TV Satellite dish.  I was also recording on my tabletop VCR and while we were watching NASA&#39;s broadcast of the STS-114 Discovery mission.  The Shuttle had undocked from the International Space Station and passed between Australia and New Zealand on it&#39;s orbit and was now half way across the Pacific Ocean south of Hawaii and west of Chile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The TV camera located at the back of Space Shuttle Discovery&#39;s cargo bay was trained on the Earth&#39;s darkened ocean and horizon showing stationary bright and dim stationary lights with some blinking on or above the surface and what appear to be stars in the sky at the bottom of the frame.  With the curve of the Earth visible.  The view is upside down because of the orientation of the Shuttle (flying upside down).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly one dimly lighted object appeared around 9-o&#39;clock in the frame and quickly traveled down to the lower right around 5-o&#39;clock in the frame and slowing to a stop at the curve of the Earth.  A few seconds later a large bright object appears around 4-o&#39;clock in the frame and swiftly travels left across the frame at an upward angle and slows to a stop around 9-o&#39;clock then reverses direction and retraces its path across the frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around the same time you will notice a dimly lighted object from around the 1-o&#39;clock position in the frame travel straight down and exits at the bottom of the screen.  Also at the same time there is another dimly lighted object around the 8-o&#39;clock position in the frame traveling from left to right at an upward angle across the frame to around the 2-o&#39;clock position in the frame and exits the frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the large bright object approaches the 4-o&#39;clock position the camera is panned to the left away from where the object is traveling and clouds appear from the top of the frame and dims half the screen.  Then the down link is cut off by NASA TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The programming comes back on showing the computer grafic of the orientation of the Shuttle and then changes to the Shuttle bay camera again showing the Earth as it&#39;s orbit brings it into the lighted part of the Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I counted a total of four moving objects.  Three dim and one bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The VHS tape I was recording the broadcast with was recording in the SLP setting (not the best quality) but I converted the footage to DVD format and the video is very clear on a computer monitor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have sent a copy of this DVD to The National UFO Reporting Center for evaluation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also e-mailed stills from the video to the Director.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have reviewed the DVD sent to our Center, and we agree with the assessment provided above by the witness.  The footage is so interesting that we have decided to post it to our website, for visitors there to be able to review.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have no ready explanation for how an object, seen moving across the sky, would suddenly slow, and then reverse its motion.  Its direction and velocity can be determined, given that the object of interest can be seen moving, relative to the star field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We invite comment from anyone who can determine what the object is, or may be.

There were no clouds in the sky and the stars and what I assumed to be Mars were quite visable as I live way out in the country with no city lights.  I never saw the Space Shuttle but continued to look and look.  Then I saw a very small &#34;star-looking&#34; object that stayed basically in the same location way overhead, almost straight overhead, but slightly west.  It moved in an isolated area making circles and less that 45 degree turns and weaved back and forth.  It could not have been a helicopter because they are unable to move like that.  This object appeared as a faint star with no flashing lights.  There was what appeared to be a regular airplane closer and to the NW that seemed oblivious to the object I saw.  The airplane seemed close, the &#34;object&#34; seemed like a far away star by comparison. I was reminded, by it&#39;s movements, of a paramecium under a microscope, the way one would randomly move about making strange, almost frantic movements.  I would step away and change my angle of veiw to see if it were something close, a moth perhaps, or a bat or bird, but no, it was way up there.  It never left it&#39;s limited area of movement. I watched it until daylight and I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were amazed &amp; thought quickly to get the video camera.  Got a few good shots of it, but it is so fast that it is hard to get good detail.

It shook the ground it was a not a loud sound but a low roar like thunder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there a looking up to the sky for any sighn of lightning but it wasnt even cloudy . A few moments later the sound came again this time louder and with bright grey lights . The sound shook the ground so hard that you could feel it in your head .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We realized that the sound could not be thunder of any kind . We could not see through the trees where the gray light was coming from.  On the oppisite side of the tree line was a large cattle field.  We all figured thats where the light were coming from .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have one old woman that lives down the road and she does not make any noise  so it couldnt have been a neighbor it was to loud and to powerful for a machine or anything of that nature . We all kind of started to worry so we went in the house after the second time we saw it .<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we got in we felt the low roar and felt the floors in the house shake . I was standing by the window and it shook the house so hard a picture fell off the wall .  Again the lights were very bright and could be seen over the tree line and throught the windows of my home . The tree line was a ways off from my house so it was unbeleavible that something that far away could make enough energy to shake the walls and be as bright as it was . You could hear the cattle running behind the house to apparently get away from whatever was out there .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We considered calling the local police but did not because we thought it would be made fun of . This contiuned for another 30 mins or so then stopped . It would light the woods up like the middle of the day and shake the house and suddenly stop then do it again . This went on for about an hour .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to see if i could find anything the next day but i found nothing . For nothing to be there was suprising because something was in the field that nigh! t . After that night i have contiued to see strange lights in the woods but no sounds . It always happens in the colder months for some reason . I havent asked my close neighbor about that night or if she ever see&#39;s lights or sounds coming from the woods but she never asked me so i suppose she was asleep that night Plus i dont want to worry her she lives alone and im sure it would scare her . I will post what i see from now on to let you when i see more lights or hear anything .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They changed directions several times in a bit of spiral action (sometimes close together and then moving apart). They disappeared after about 5 seconds, sort of into the clouds. There was no sound<n>
8/5/05 22:44|Omaha|NE|Light|3-4 minutes|Apparent intercept of unidentifed 'satellite' by second object.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45484.html|291|ndxe200508| Apparent intercept of unidentifed &#39;satellite&#39; by second object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside watching night sky last night and at 22:42 I spotted what I presumed was a satellite moving in a west to east direction. Apparent magnitude about 3-4. As it reached the zenith I checked my watch to note the time so that I could check its identity on the Heavens-Above.com web site, which catalogs satellite and ISS tracks over my location on a nightly basis.  As the object moved into the eastern half of the sky, a second object, moving at what appeared to be at least twice the first object&#39;s speed suddenly appeared to its south and intercepted the first object and then disappeared.  The first object continued on at its original speed and eventually became to faint to follow.  I looked in vain for the track of the second object, which I thought might be a second satellite, but its speed and trajectory suggests to me that it wasn&#39;t an ordinary earth satellite with which I am familiar.  It may have been a meteorite, but again, the odds of a meteorite appearing to intercept the original object would seem to be way too long to be probable. As soon as the first &#34;satellite&#34; disappeared from view, I went into the house and looked up possible candidates crossing my area at 22:42 on a similar orbital flight path.  There was only one object, a Cosmos rocket, in the sky at that time, but its trajectory was wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the transit of the original object lasted several minutes -- which is the normal passage time for an earth satellite -- the &#34;interception&#34; episode last perhaps a second or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In fact the event took place so quickly, that I have the distinct impression that there were actually several objects that intercepted the first, coming from different vectors, but I am only sure about the one &#34;intercept&#34; which is the one that caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very excited about seeing this unusual phenomenon, made more so when I learned that there were no publically-cataloged satellites operating on this trajectory (orbit)at this time of the evening over my location in East Central Nebraska. While the first object could be an unlisted spy satellite, the second object is a complete unknown.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Around 22:30 for about about 15 minutes we all noticed a faint glowing pulsing yellow lights real high in the sky. We could not make out any shape.  The yellow light would zig zag and often show up in another part of the night sky. With all of us having star gaizing experience we knew that this was something that any of us have never seen.  Soon after loosing the yellow light in the sky we where told to go back to camp because we where out after curfu.  All of us went back in amazement relizing what we might have seen.  We had no camera at the time to take a pictural account. This acount has been recorded by the Adult leader and his son that was one of the boys.  What ever caused this all four of us just want to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then my girlfriend who just got out of the pool told me that there is a satellite above, i look don&#39;t see a thing. Couple of seconds later i was searching to find it and she says that it as changed direction and picked up speed. I then spotted the objet, was a little light (about -1 in magnitude) going full south but arrived from north-west. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this and i&#39;m used to spot satellites.

I pulled over to the side because what we saw seemed like three pretty large comets falling from the sky (not really lined up). It was about SE far from downtown. Another car pulled over to see what we saw, so we were not the only ones who witnessed this.  There was an airplane flying what seemed past these figures so we wondered if they were burning debri or something of that sort. We were convinced that they were ufo&#39;s when two of the three started slowing down and at this time they look like balls of light moving around then side to side until they stopped right next to each other and stood still for one second. Then, all three started slowly moving down, once again with their tail of fire, now moving side to side as they were heading downward. They were disappearing and reappearing until they dissapeared behind the buildings. At this time, my mother and I noticed several airplanes flying about. I wondered if maybe we were not the only ones who witnessed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

8/5/05 21:35|Atwell|NY|Cigar|30 min. day 1, 10 min. 2|Five friends camping see four UFOs in one evening, and one the next night.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45509.html|297|ndxe200508| Five friends camping see four UFOs in one evening, and one the next night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four friends and I were camping at North Lake, We were doing some stargazing when from the southeast we saw a slow moving object that looked like a star that moved from southeast to northwest, we thought it may have been a satellite, or a jet with no flashing lights like a spy plane, but then we saw another object on a different path, going north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object moved the same way.. slowly, but changing speed at times, and almost in a straight line. the second object was viewed through binoculars and appeared to glow bright blue, and had a slight cigar shape... Just when we were starting to think things were getting strange, 10 minutes later we saw another craft flying in the same direction as the first craft, again it was a blue rounded cigar shape. I got up into the middle of the clearing to get a good view of the sky at this point, just as the 3rd craft floated out of view I saw another craft flying VERY CLOSE. It appeared blue and sometimes had an orange gleam, it was moving across the sky like a helicopter but made no noise at all. I yelled for all my friends to take a look and they got up and all saw the object, several of them said it appeared to be spinning, as we all watched it move across the western sky an airplane was flying from the opposite direction and it looked like they could possibly run into each other. The pilot must have saw the object and climbed quickly as the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that things seemed to die down and we all agreed we saw something that was out of the ordinary. Even my girlfriend who has always been skeptical of UFOs was convinced the 4th object we saw was something strange. The next night we all looked in the sky at the same time as the night before, and sure enough we saw an object flying high in the sky, this time from northwest to southeast. We saw it stop at the horizon, and seem to stop, but the object was actually getting closer. it stopped short of actually comming right back at us, and floated southward across the east side of the lake, once again all of us saw the object up close. After the object disapeared, we saw four or more airplanes flying toward where the UFO was last seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would really like to know of anyone else in the area saw this, or if it can be explained naturally in any way. This is my second time ever witnessing a UFO, The first time was in april during the daytime in Utica, NY. I&#39;m very interested by them and am going to get a camera to get some proof of my sightings!<n>

Thinking it was nothing more than a helicopter or a plane I didn&#39;t pay too much attention to it. The more we drove up north I started to notice it was still in the same spot, so I thought &#34;ok, it must be a star, because its pretty bright and it ain&#39;t moving&#34;. Then finally when we got closer and closer, I started to noticed it wasn&#39;t even far off in space but just a few ways up in the sky. I was in the passenger seat so I witnessed this more than my friend did who was driving. Finally when I got a close look at it I notice there were two shining lights in front of the object and two red lights on each side. I could barely make out the shape of this mysterious craft which was rectangular. It didn&#39;t hit me that this was more than an airplane or a star when we actually drove underneath it and it was obvious that it was staying completely still and only a few hundred feet up in the air. But mostly I want to know if anyone else has repoted anything similar and  in this area on that very same night and time.<n>

Poor lighting, sky blue as best as we could see. It came about 200 feet from impacting the field, and made adjustments.  And began to head west at about 60 MPH I repeat it made adjustments, not unlike a cruise missle. Spycraft? For a craft to withstand re-entry, and make adjustments, and continue on a path horizontal to the ground, It is obviously man-made technology. We were 9 motorcycle riders heading south on 359 from Mathis Texas. Russel at the Alice Newspaper, one of the riders, also witnessed this sighting, and was a topic of our discussion shortly after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe any reports were made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were approaching our turn west on hiway 44, at 9:25pmwhen we witnessed this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just F.Y.I..<n>

The setting sun reflected off of the jet. Approxiamtely 5 or 10000 feet below the jet was a small silver looking sphere that also was reflecting the sun. I pointed it out to my husband and as we were watching it the sphere turned black and then turned into a black replica of the jet overhead!! I still could only hear one aircraft. Both objects flew to the east out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/5/05 12:30|Seattle|WA|Circle|20 seconds|I saw a silver ball in the clear blue skies above the Blue Angles flying routine in Seattle on 8/5/2005 at Seafair.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45501.html|302|ndxe200508| I saw a silver ball in the clear blue skies above the Blue Angles flying routine in Seattle on 8/5/2005 at Seafair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with a large group of people standing on a dock watching the Blue Angels over Lake Washington while they were performing their stunts during Seafare.  I was watching one of the jets flying straight up at a high altitude when I noticed a silver ball north of the Blue Angel jet.  It appeared to be very high in the sky well above normal flight of commercial jets flying on long trips.  I pointed it out to my 16 year son and another man who was standing next to me.  After I watched it a few seconds and pointed it out, it began moving in a NW direction and it only took about 10 seconds to travel out of sight.  The man I was talking to suggested that it was the space shuttle.  No way can we see that from land.  But, this carft was in our our atmosphere for sure.  I know that airplanes are directed to stay away from the Blue Angels while they are practicing their stunts.  I must believe that they are dissallowed in the area even if they were at 20 or 30,000&#39;.  I had my new digital camera in my hand &amp; I took a photo in hopes of capturing it.  However, my lack of experience with the camera and the slow spped failed to catch it.  This happened about 1/2 way through their routine.  It&#39;s my hope that others saw this and have reported on it.  I have heard nothing.  I have been a believer for years.  However, I had never had an encounter in the past.  This object moved so fast that it could not have been a baloon or a plane.  I think that if this was a true event, it was probably there to watch what the B. Angels were doing.  There was not a single cloud in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It arose in the night sky, headed south toward the direction of my house.  I got my glasses and binoculars from inside my house to get a better look. Aside from a closer view, I could not observe any more detail. It was a glowing and disfused orange light in my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point it flashed/pulsed a white light for a few seconds.

Two of my friends and myself were down the road from my house, lying in a field, looking at the stars.  A little solid white light caught my eye, so I pointed it out to my friends.  Both of them acknowledged it and were just as amazed as me.  They at first thought it was a plane, but I pointed out there were NO flashing lights or red lights. On top of that we all agreed that this thing was NOT in our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They then decided it was a satellite, but were proven wrong when it made a 90-degree turn east. After its turn it shot stage right really fast and made another 90-degree turn north. It is hard to tell how far it traveled but from my perspective about four inches across the sky. After its second turn it came to a sudden stop, and started to flash slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flashing lasted about 7 or 8 seconds and increased in speed until it shot outwards away from earth leaving a white trail behind it that slowly dissipated.  It was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate.  PD))<n>

He drove very slowly and he had his headlights off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of hours I went into bed, with them still out there and watched through the window as the porchlight pulsed, as if power surges and then dimmer.

It seemed connected to another light,or star, not as bright, which was down and to the right, which would appear, then disappear.

My friend snapped a photo of the darkened image of the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw nothing between us and the plane except mist. Later, we saw the photo and quite clearly there is a large, what I would decribe as a lit candle sitting on a translucent dish.  The photo shows six distinct balls of light: a red with a bright yellow center on top, a white and another white beneath (these three form the &#34;candle&#34;), a green to the left, an amber on the bottom center, and a white (with light green) on the right side of the craft, all very symmetrical and clearly indicative of an intelligence and purpose.  It appears to be moving upward and is leaving beneath it a very clear vapor trail.  Incredibly clear photo.  The craft appears to have a deep blue glow faintly surrounding it and two small windows with faint green light coming from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 50 year old father of four, have been practicing law in Houston, Texas for 25 years and up until 8/4/05, had no interest whatsoever in UFO&#39;s and the like.  My friend who took the photo is 48 years old and is a classical musician and the conductor of a chamber orchestra.  We have no agenda of any kind, but we do have proof.  Very clear and convincing proof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have an appointment at NASA on Tuesday 8/30/05 to have the photo analyzed.<n>

When I got to the first bridge after passing the Longfellow Bridge I decided to head back from the other side of the river. I crossed this bridge (passing by the Museum Of Science) and started walking back down south again sticking close to the riverside on a small pathway for runners and bikers. It was when I was around the proximity of Memorial Drive when I saw an black flying object that was shaped like a disc, floating in the distance over the Charles River. At first I thought it was a kite that someone was flying but the way it was flew wasnt convincing enough. It flipped on all three axis and it was flying only in one direction. The altitude never changed (it was flying pretty low already but could fly over 10 story buildings) and it flew way to far to be a in a kites flying range. It flew pretty slow. I stopped to watch it fly by until it flew over the buildings out of my sight over memorial drive and up north. There were people around me at that time of the event but most were runners who were out for an exercise and didnt see the flying object. I looked around to see if anyone else is pointing or looking skywards at the object but I couldnt see none. I was pretty depressed that day (hence the long walk) so I didnt bother talking to anyone around me about it. Also, at that time, I have already walked for over an hour, and it was around dinner time and I was a bit hungry. I was also listening to my i-pod all the time druing my walk. But I am pretty sure I did see a tangable object fly over Charles River that day in the fashion as I have described above. Im just not sure if I was the only one to see it or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were just lights as headlights look to be and it was shocking to see them flying toward us if they were jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say military jets because I had enough time to ponder if they were helicopters but they were moving too fast.  They weren&#39;t falling but seemed to be flying down and forward at an angle toward us.  At the time, it didn&#39;t occur to me jets make lots of noise and there was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just at the top of the treeline, the first light blinked out and shortly after, the second light blinked out. There was a faint dark cloud left behind and I watched because I wasn&#39;t sure if it was from that or just clouds. It disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what this was but I would hope there is a reasonable explanation. It happened over a large acreage of land used for trail riding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter and I were alone when we saw this.  The horses were grazing and apparently oblivious.

8/4/05 14:00|Brazil|||10 minutes|Small Gold Flat Chip(s) Extracted From Mouth|9/15/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45972.html|314|ndxe200508| Small Gold Flat Chip(s) Extracted From Mouth<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s a play by play of exactly what has transpired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m an American living in Brazil with my girlfriend of 5 years. About three months ago I was driving back with her from the town where she grew up in Brazil. We were conversing, passing time, and she happened to tell me this story about how she and her sister used to expell metal pieces out of their mouths when they were kids. I was nodding my head and acknowledging her, but inside my head my thoughts could frankly be described as, &#39;mmhmm, oky doky&#39;, like &#39;yeah, sure, I&#39;ll just forget my girlfriend ever mentioned this crazy story&#39;. She continued to say that her mother had the last piece extracted analyzed in a lab and the results were that the object was not &#34;from this world&#34;. I naturally probed with a few questions, but I wasn&#39;t convinced so I honestly let the story in one ear and out the other because the mother or sister wasn&#39;t there to back the story and I need proof to believe something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday August 4th, 2005 - The Proof  My girlfriend decides to come home for lunch, a rare occasion. I made her a sandwhich, she ate, then had to rush back to the hospital (she&#39;s a doctor). She went into the bathroom to brush her teeth and I remained on the couch with our dog. All of the sudden she came out holding her finger out at me with a gold piece on it and said, &#34;Remember when I told you me and my sister were getting these metal pieces out of our mouths? Well, here&#39;s one&#34; (very calmly and confidently). She came out and showed me this thing like this wasn&#39;t the first time she&#39;s shown someone else these objects and she handed it to me and told me to keep it. She also had this air about her like, &#34;You believe me now?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I inspected it. I was really curious. I asked her if it had come off her necklace and she said, &#34;C&#39;mon (my name), no&#34;. Then I made her swear on my grandmother&#39;s soul that she wasn&#39;t lying and she did. My grandparents who are diseased mean the world to me and she knows it. Then I started thinking, was it in the bread, egg, salt, onion, tomato, cheese, ketchup, or lettuce that I made her? Was it in the grape juice she drank? How about the toothpaste? So I went into the bathroom and pointed out the toothpaste tube we&#39;d been using and asked her if this was the toothpaste she&#39;d used and she confirmed it was the one. So I squeazed the remains out on the bathroom counter and mushed it around with my finger to see if there were any more chips, no chips.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then she left, she had to get back. I got curious having this thing in my possession and wanted to check online to see if anyone else has had this same strange phenomenon happening to them. I wasn&#39;t having any luck. I started putting in on Yahoo, &#34;coughing up metal&#34;, etc. I was clicking around with no luck until I happened upon this website, reading this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.ufoinfo.com/filer/2000/ff_0003.shtml  &#34;STRANGE GOLD IMPLANT FOUND Bill Bean writes that, &#34;In July of 1997, I became mysteriously ill and couldn&#39;t swallow, because there was a pressure on my throat.&#34; I felt I was choking, just drinking water. It was the most horrible experience of my life, and I wish it on no one. I saw eight different doctors and many tests were done and nobody gave me an answers. I was rushed by ambulance to the hospital, three times in three weeks. I truly thought I was dying. I noticed a pattern of red circular marks on my back that I felt was a reaction to the medication. My wife photographed them. I could not eat and my weight went from a muscular 240 lbs. to 198 lbs. On December 16, 1997, I was in the bathroom with my wife, brushing my teeth when felt a bristle came off my toothbrush causing me to cough. I reached in my mouth to get the object with my right index finger and found a gold - square - flat - chip. Our first thoughts were that it had to come out of the toothbrush. Something told me to save it and I did. The next night, while brushing my teeth, I started coughing again and expelled two more of these things in the sink. After expelling the first piece, I felt like some pressure had come off of my throat and the next night a lot of pressure had come off. I began eating normally and felt much better. Last year, I sent one piece to Derrel Sims who had the object analyzed. Bill says, &#34;My piece matches a piece that was surgically removed from a person four years ago in Brazil. An isotopic test to determine if the piece is alien is being accomplished.&#34; Thanks to Bill Bean bllin@erols.com. Editors Note: Derrel Sims and I feel this may be the most significant implant case thus far. derrel@holman.net&#34;   When I read that line, &#34;On December 16, 1997, I was in the bathroom with my wife, brushing my teeth when felt a bristle came off my toothbrush causing me to cough. I reached in my mouth to get the object with my right index finger and found a gold - square - flat - chip.&#34;, a surge of fear shot right through me. I felt like I was in a movie suddenly or a bad dream. How could this all be some weird coincidence? It&#39;s possible sure, but I have a hard time formulating a hypothesis. Is some company having a food processing flaw allowing 20 some odd chips to fall into vats over the years and these three people in different countries happen to consume?   There are so many possibilities! Could it be the government somehow tracking people? Why the two sisters? Why the man, if he&#39;s telling the truth? Could extraterrestrials be abducting and experimenting on us? My girlfriend, seems to think they are coming from her nasal passage, not travelling up her esophagous and surfacing in the throat. Or perhaps if it is a food consumption flaw perhaps it&#39;s getting caught in the back of the throat in the tonsuls or skin. In 2002 after she extracted a chip, she moved with me shortly after to the US in 2003. Coincidently, she had a bad nasal infection and smell emminating from her nose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another oddity related to this: both sisters have a benign cyst in the same location in the cerebellum in their brains. My girlfriend two months ago was feeling immense migraines and motor skill loss, so we went a diagnostics center here in Brazil to have an MRI done. I saw her holding up the large X-Ray looking sheets into the light and she said, &#34;Weird, I have the same cyst as my sister and in the same spot&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after I read that similar story online, what did I rashly do in a panic? I called SETI. I got their secretary in California and she couldn&#39;t help me, all she said was that she was sorry, but she didn&#39;t know where to guide me in this appologetic voice. Then she advised me that my girlfriend should see a doctor. I told her, &#34;the person who is expelling these is a doctor&#34;. And she didn&#39;t have anything to say, but that she didn&#39;t know how to help me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I started emailing as many UFO researchers as I could. Everyone seemed to refer me to A.J. Gaevard here in Brazil. So I contacted Mr. Gaevard and he was very nice and helpful and directed me to someone here close to home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I do know is that when the mother of the two sisters had the piece in 2002 analyzed, from what I gather, they basically took it, said it was not from this planet, and didn&#39;t give it back and the family didn&#39;t hear anything back. So the girls weren&#39;t extracting anymore chips and the issue subsided and nobody talked about it, until now. I had my girlfriend call her mother in front of me and ask what happened exactly to the last chip. So her mother called her contact and this is what her mother explained to my girlfriend, who explained to me: The first lab didn&#39;t know what it was or what it was made of, so they sent it to another lab where they said it was somehow composed of quartz. That&#39;s it. And it took three years later for the mother to find this out in 2005.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Update: We have since remained in contact with A.J. Gevaerd and his close friend and colleague who is an esteemed doctor and publisher, which we met in person last Monday (8/29/05) to drop the chip off for analysis. They are conducting research on the piece now. Results will be posted in Gevaerd&#39;s magazine sometime in the near future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with this witness, and have seen photos of the tiny, gold-colored object.  At this time, we have no specific reason to suspect that the object may be of extra-terrestrial origin.  It is being analyzed, under the direction of Mr. A. J. Gevaerd, well-known UFO investigator, and publisher, from Brazil.  PD))<n>

I was out at Kalae-loa Harbor (locally called Cambell)night fishing for Papio etc...while squatting next to my dunking pole, I was fishing with a small bamboo pole to try to catch live bait(small goatfish or whatever i could...at the same time i was looing toward my left and up at the tip of my big dunking pole to see if it was bending.  While looking up at my dunking pole, I saw a giggantic flash towards west side of island that seeme to be over Kaena point area.  It was like the sky opened up and a bright flash much brighter and intense than halogen came out, but the flash moved from right to left in the pattern of the shape of a weak or lazy letter n. kind of like an eyelid shape, like a small hill icon shape. The thing that made it unusual besides the brightness and movement, was that it wasn&#39;t tiny like the hundreds of shooting stars we have seen siince childhood, a shooting star looks comparitively like looking at a small grain of rice in the distance, this flash that I saw was like looing at a D-battery or like if I was looking up from the inside of an old stlye overhead projector(flat glass drawing area) as a teacher dragged a piece of thick chalk maybe 2 inches long sideways across the whiteboard drawing area of the projector in the shape of a upper eyelid  or letter n.  I just happened to be looking up at the time this occurred and I immediately looked over about 60 feet to the other guy who was fishing by hisself to see if he saw it, but he was looking at his poles in the water.  This other guy was to my right alongside the boat-ramp section of the shoreline there.  Anyway, I went over to him and asked if he had saw that flash and he said he didn&#39;t but that he had saw a similar flash about 2 times before but a little more inland towards the sky over the Waianae Mountain side. Needless to say, we talked from that point on about what the hell is out there, and I kept saying I would call the morning talk show to see if anyone else had saw that flash in the sky (eerie), but instead I just telephoned my best friend here and told him what I had saw.

He saw many lights and huge dark shapes in between.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason he is so frightened is that his property is very remote and last September, in the very early morning hours, he saw more lights on his property for many minutes a couple of nights in a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He laid in the grass for a half an hour with binoculars and looked at a round craft with many light on top and around it. He gave me a photo he took with a cheap camera and it shows the bottom outline near the rear where the lights appear to be propelling the vehicle away into the night sky.  He drew me a picture of the craft.  As I watched him draw it, I could tell he had studied it very carefully. He said after it went up from behind the trees he studied it at abou 800 to 900 yards up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The top was covered with round lights of a light bulb color and around the perifery were blue flames or jets going down and a red flameing jet in the center. He tried to think to them that he would not shoot at them if they did not harm or bother him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He wishes he could find someone to talk to that lives near by that saw it too. He came to one meeting with me to share with my friends about it, but refuses to talk about it with them again. Since they have returned, talking about it freaks him out.<n>

I know what we saw. The other guys were just as astonished as I, but less reconciliable about WHAT exactly these lights were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 02:15 I began my nightly exterior perimeter patrol of the building, insuring all doors are locked, the cyclone wire fence hasn&#39;t been obviously breached anywhere and that the site is basically safe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somewhere near the southeast corner of the building a light in the sky caught my eye. Though an airfield is nearby, it doesn&#39;t operate at night; still though, at first the light was nondescript and creepy--like the way a jetliner looks head on from a distance. Anyone who knows what I mean knows the lights of these are bright, there is no or little sound and the illusion of hovering or slow moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought nothing of it really, just another jet. . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made my way around to the building&#39;s northeast corner as usual, and had forgotten about the jet. As I approached guard post at the facility&#39;s main traffic gate, I saw my guard outside, looking at what I thought was the jet still. I looked again and knew why he was so stupefied; the light was a lot closer now, and was definitely bigger than a jet&#39;s headlights. We both mumbled something to the effect of &#34;What the heck is that?&#34; and watched the triangular?--shape as it drifted toward the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The intensity of the lighting made it&#39;s exact hull outline impossible to see. I am guessing that it was no farther than five or six hundred feet away, over an area of woods and highway (I think. I know beyond the cyclone fence is just woods).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, the triangularish craft jerked to the left, then back some, and then to the right. It&#39;s light was no longer so bright, or not pointing in our direction anymore, and we both made out what appeared to be a bank of &lt; shaped lights that pulsed a dark red from dim to moderately bright and back to dim again. Shafts of white light seemed to poke out from the underside of the craft occasionally. At several points during the &#39;flight&#39;, it had maneuvered so that we could see that indeed the shape was triangular and a brighter or more intense light lit each of the triangle points&#39; underside. An inbuond vehicle stopped at the main gate and the driver got out, watching just as we were. Though I only counted once, the others said they saw twice, maybe three times, small red spheres falling to the ground, spiralling in a slow descent like oak seeds would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for some minutes until finally something seemed to explode on the ground below the craft. But not like an explosion you&#39;d expect. It was a loud crackling zap accompanied by a brief white light. After that the craft slowly hovered around in the area some more, as it had been before the small red spheres came down. After only a few more minutes the thing took off and disappeared out of sight. My guard began processing the driver and I decided to go back around to the corner where I first saw the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have one fear in life and it isn&#39;t UFOs or aliens, but I must admit as I approached the building&#39;s dark backside I became very nonsensically afraid. The fence was not breached anywhere that I could see, but it didn&#39;t make me feel much safer. The last detail I have to report is a strange staticky noise that overcame my radio as I approached the corner closest to the incident, and after only a few moments drained the nearly full battery (8 hours of charge left). It also broke my watch which I found later had stopped at 02:52, which is approximately the time I&#39;m guessing I was in the area. People inside and at other guards posts had complained about an abundance of static for a few minutes, though it hadn&#39;t lasted very long. Two hours later, as the sun was beginning to lighten the sky, I went back around the building with a newly charged battery and experienced what I believed to be a small bit of excess static, but nothing like before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three of us have decided not to tell anyone at work, and I only tell you know because the truth should be known.<n>

As we were talking, I saw a glowing green substance or object coming horizontally in the air, just in my view over the main office building across the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon seeing, I asked my friend to take notice.  We just set there and watched it go through the air until it disappeared.  After discussing what in the world it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The prospects for explaining it as a shooting star or falling space debree were impossible.  I promptly told my friend I was going inside and calling our local radio station to see if they were getting any calls about this sighting.....they were.(about 4-5 calls the DJ said)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The DJ is calling around different places trying to find an explanation, however he is not finding one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have looked through some reports of UFO sightings on reporting sights and found one explanation of a sighting that sounds like a possible match since we only had a side view.

I went to my stairs on the right side of my deck to get a better look.It was right above the tree line in a north west position, im guessing it was about 20,000 feet up. At first i thought it may be a planet and stood there watching it for about 10 minutes and it kept blinking red and also other bright colors like white, orange, green. It also was moving, kinda like a swaying, it kept going down and back up again.My bf was standing there looking at it with me,He also couldnt figure out what it might be.I then decided to go inside and get my dad to come out and look at this object and see if he could figure it out. He came out and looked at it and also thought at first it was a planet, but then he noticed it was really bright and flashing all those colors and told me to go to his truck and get his feild binoculers. I gave them to him and he took a look and almost automatically after veiwng his words where &#34;wow&#34; its got lights on it. I took a look and  it had three white lights in the middle and red blinking ones on the outside and the rest looked green,orangish whitish, it looked sparklie.I made a drawing of what it looked like through the binoculers. We made my mom and two brothers come out side and look at it too. It then went behind the tree&#39;s so we decided to go down the street a bit and get a better look at it. When we got there it must have traveld at some sped because it was way much further away to the north west than it was when we were observing it at the house. But still you could see through the binoculers the red flashing going from bottom to top of the object and the sparklieness. Couldnt make the shape out anymore though. Then my dad said your not gonna belive this and said there was another one, it was in the north east sitting there. Looked just the same as the first one through the binoculers and it was closer. We stood there watching them both and the first one slowly moved to the north west tll it was a litle dot and the same happend with the second.<n>

It was around 12am and a few clouds where in the sky. We went to the 2nd floor balcony.  We looked up in the sky and saw a blinking light.  At first we thought maybe it was the space shuttle or the space station. We knew it was not any type of aircraft it was to far up to be anything other than a planet or something else.  We continued to watch it for a few minutes trying to figure out what it was.  When we looked over the bay there was a light cloud bank at the time.  Clouds were blocking out the moon light so it was sporadic at times.  And there it was the clouds moved out and the moon light hit a large circular object.  It had a dome on top and below the dome appeared to be what looked like some sort of exhaust ports.  Could not tell what was underneath other than something was protruding from there.  It couldn’t have been more than 100yds from us. You could actually see how smooth the service.  It lasted maybe 30 se! conds the clouds rolled back in and it was gone.  And while this was going on the light was still blinking in the sky and when the object left the light stopped at the same time.  We went inside thinking what the hell just happened.  Neither of us could sleep and ended up staying up most of the night.<n>

8/1/05 22:15|Santa Rosa|CA|Light|1 minute|Saw a very bright light on an unusual course moving at relatively low altitude without making a sound.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45416.html|341|ndxe200508| Saw a very bright light on an unusual course moving at relatively low altitude without making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking my dog before going to bed, I noticed a bright light that was rapidly approaching from the east heading in a north-westerly direction. The elevation at that point was about 30 degree. The light was a bright yellowish-white that was brighter and larger than the ISS when it is directly overhead. There was a small strobe light to the lower right of the larger light slightly detached, that was flashing in about 1 second intervals. The motion of the light was smooth like the ISS but it was going more than twice as fast as the typical speed of the ISS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light moved along a left-handed long sweeping turn. When it passed to the north of my position, it was at an elevation of about 70 degrees. It continued to a point at about 50 degree elevation in the north-west. At that point, the craft must have made a course correction by making a smooth but easily noticeable turn to the south-west. As it came out of this turn, the light increased in brightness by a factor of three or four for about 2 to 3 seconds. It was by far the brightest light in the sky at that moment. It then went briefly very dim for about 2 seconds as if something structural was obscuring the light source but I could still see the glow of the light behind it. It then brightened again for about 2 seconds to the intensity it had been when it passed to the north of me. The light and even the glow then totally disappeared and all I could see the was the strobe plus a fainter strobe nearby that was about 1/2 second out of synch with the first strobe. When they receded, the strobes has a reddish hue. I was able to follow them until the object disappeared over the roof of a house heading due south. The elevation was then about 30 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire affair from first seeing it and then losing sight of it lasted no more than one minute. There was absolutely no sound, even when it made the turn south and it seemed fairly close at that point. There may have been other, fainter lights but I could not clearly see them because I was in an area where there were several bright street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home, I checked &#34;Heavens Above&#34; and found that the ISS will not be visible in my area until August 7th. Envisat was scheduled to be visible about 15 minutes after my observation at a trajectory SE50-ENE72-N10 at a maximum magnitude of 2.9 which is about as bright as Envisat gets. I have seen it many times and there was no comparision to the light I saw. The light I saw was at least a minus 4 or brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other satellites were listed as being visible to me at that time. I have no idea what I saw. If it was a conventional jet, I should have heard a sound, since it didn&#39;t seem to be very high in altitude. This fact was confirmed by the ease with which I could follow the strobes to such a low elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/1/05 21:30|East Orange|NJ|Unknown|4 minutes|Heard a HUGE object larger than the football field across the street flying over clouds covering a wide area|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65816.html|342|ndxe200508| Heard a HUGE object larger than the football field across the street flying over clouds covering a wide area<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened sometime in August 2005 and it was around 9 - 10 pm because my toddler aged son was sleep and I was at the window kind of thinking over some things. I actually heard something loud that sounded like a jet that was flying very low. Actually that&#39;s what made me perk up because it was so loud it made me look up because I thought I would see it. That&#39;s when I noticed the sky. It was covered in white clouds. Not one white cloud but seemingly the whole area of sky seemed covered in one white cloud, perhaps with some slight spaces in it but it was like one big cloud. It was so big that although it blocked the moon out it kind of created its own light. What made it kind of surreal is that I lived in a small building directly and diagonally across the street from a school football field. So it looked surreal looking up and seeing it over such a wide space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well- that&#39;s what I saw once I looked up to see what sounded like a low flying jet. It seemed like it had to be some kind of military jet because it sounded loud and very fast. Well- guess what.......after looking up and noticing the wierd clouds everywhere- that is all I heard. Was the sound of the jet. But here&#39;s the kicker- the sound did not go away for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me let that sink in for a sec so that you can understand me......We all know how loud a low flying, fast flying military jet must sound. Not that I have ever seen a low flying, fast flying military jet- but that is what I expected from hearing the sound. NOW.........IT DID NOT GO AWAY FOR A FEW MINUTES. I stood at my window kind of scared as I realized what I was hearing seemed to come from over the clouds and I got the distinct impression that it was that HUGE that it encompassed that whole area I was lived in, including the football field across the street. I got a VERY STRONG impression that I had heard it approaching, heard it travelling over me, and heard it travelling away. NOW- this was all TOO LOUD and TOO LONG a time for it to have been a jet. I KNEW exactly what it was and had a very strong idea of how big it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My reaction at that experience, was WOW- That thing has a cloud under it to hide it and that thing is TOO BIG to not be a familiar object to the government.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

At first I thought it was a helicopter before it was so bright.  As it went directly over head I noticed that it did not make any sound.  The object was triangular in shape and was the whole object was intensly bright white with a red light underneath.  The red light did not blink.  The red light was located closer to the front of the triangle but not at the tip.  It was incredible.  I didn&#39;t tell anyone because I figured no one would believe me anyway.  I know what I saw, I just don&#39;t know if it was military or extraterrestrial.  I have encountered a couple of sightings in the past. For example a white ball of light hovering in the distance and then disappearing, but I never thought much of it.  But this particular triangular sighting was different because it past right over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was about 30ft in diameter.we decided to stop and find out what it was. The light appeared to be like that of a candle. It hovered for five minutes then disappeared. It then appeared a few meters away from where it was.  I then realized this UFO was definitively not an aircraft of any kind.the light finally disappeared as it moved away.<n>

I noticed a dark object in the sky a great distance away.  I didn’t think much of it because we see a lot of air traffic, Commercial, military and private aircrafts including hot air balloons.  The object was traveling north west.  As it approached closer, I could see that it was actually five aircrafts of sort flying in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were now maybe a quarter mile away.  I could see clearly, five triangle shaped crafts.  Now maybe a thousand yards away, they stopped in mid air for approximately 10 to 15 seconds.  In an instant, one at a time made a hard flat turn towards the south west, even closer now, a few hundred yards above me, I could not see any markings, lights, windows, doors.  Five perfect shaped triangles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see any type of exhaust trail, nor did they make any noise, not a sound. They traveled  to the south west for about a hundred yards, then made a hard flat turn back towards the north west leaving my view of them with great acceleration.

8/1/05 05:00|Lawara (Afghanistan)||Light|30 seconds|I saw a light while pulling a guard shift in Afghanistan that at first I assumed was a satellite.|1/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106583.html|349|ndxe200508| I saw a light while pulling a guard shift in Afghanistan that at first I assumed was a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stationed in Afghanistan from Spring of 2005 to winter of 2006.  In my first few months, we were put along the Pakistan/Afghanistan border to stop Taliban from having free travel across country to country.  It was the hot spot of the country at the time.  We had observation posts (OP) all along the border.  Each having from one squad to an entire platoon stationed on each OP.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My squad was stationed on an OP right in front of a big plain the locals called the &#34;Dashteh&#34;.  Put along a ridge line we watched over the border.  24 hours, someone was always on guard obviously and we would rotate through our company of pulling shifts, OPs, patrols and time off.  So we were low on sleep sometimes but I was not at the time.  I was well rested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Special Forces soldier that we were stationed with told me of how there is absolutely no light pollution which is why at night we could literally see every star the naked eye could see.  We could even see satellites....just small white dots of lights that moved along in the sky, orbiting the earth.  Simple put, they looked like moving stars that did not flicker.  They were easy spot and very common.  Looking at the sky at night you could easily see 2-3 of them in 10 minutes....and shooting stars.  We saw plenty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was pulling my guard shift one morning right before the sun was rising.  When I was woken up for my shift, it was dark, when my shift was coming to an end, the sun was beginning to rise (Early Morning Nautical Twilight).  The sun was not up yet but it was starting to shed light to begin the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nearing the end of my shift, the moon was still out and I saw, what I assumed, was one of the satellites I have already seen so many nights before.  For some reason, I kept my eye on it.  I watched it for about 30 seconds or so before it did what it did.  It slowly moved along in the sky, just as all the other satellites did that I watched.  It cruised along, directly under the moon moving from South to North.  The moon was nearly full and from where I sat, two adult hand widths above the horizon.  The second the light got on the North side of the moon, it&#39;s speed changed to drastically fast, shifted directly up 90 degrees towards the sky, shot away in a straight line, straight up, and faded away in about 1 and a half to 2 seconds.  From start to finish, it&#39;s flight path was like a capital L.  I asked if any of my squad members saw what I saw but no one else was awake.  It felt unreal and I was very frustrated that I was the only person that witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where we were at was absolutely deafening silence.  If you stopped breathing, you could actually experience being deaf.  The craft made no sound or anything of the sort.  It didn&#39;t flicker, change shape, or change color.  It stayed constant (a small white dot of light traveling South to North) until it got on the North side of the moon and shot away.  The only thing that changed was it&#39;s speed and direction.  It did not leave a trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I am a skeptic with ghosts and UFOs and what not but I do not see how what I saw is explainable.  No human aircraft can make that sort of maneuver let alone move at that sort of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I stopped and adjusted my backpack and looked again at it and it seemed like 2 or 3 led lights that were together (but orangish colored) close together and I couldn&#39;t tell what it was-looked like it was staying in one place which was weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I started moving toward it and walked down the trail after it.  It stayed there slightly off the trail.  As I got closer I couldn&#39;t see it because it was hidden behind the trees that were along the trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got closer to the left hand side of the trail I put my back pack down on the side of the trail and walked up and over the side of the trail and though the woods -when I got to the top of the hill on the side of the trail and was in the woods I could see in this big field (for cows -but they have no cows) this column of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The column of light was an amber and light yellow.  Similar to a column (about 20-25 ft tall and about 1 1/2ft wide) Within the column were vertical 2-3&#34; beams that were amber and yellow in color.  The whole column slowly rotated from the left to the right, in place and smaller beams the same (2-3&#34;) would move from the center of it like it was scanning the grass bellow it from the column out around it about 3-4 feet out -from the center about ten feet up.  It hovered above the ground by a few inches, it slowly moved within a small area along the field less than six to ten feet that I saw it move.  I don&#39;t recall it making any sounds. There was no metal or glass, only beams of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An amber &amp; yellow column of lights (like a information or energy gathering satellite device) I don&#39;t know, that&#39;s my best guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was gathering information or energy from the area below it-I was so frightened that I only could watch it for a few minutes once I found it doing that.  I wanted to run and was scared it would follow me.  I calmly and briskly walked away from it and kept looking back.  I don&#39;t know how it got there or what ever happened after I left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always look toward that side of the trail even to this day.  I know it wasn&#39;t anything supernatural.  It was a far more intelligent being than us that was in controlling it.  I just thought someone should know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If there was a way in this medium I would for you.  It would take less words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I noticed this site I thought it important to explain what I saw to a credible place and have it documented.  Unfortunately I had no cell phone back then with a camera with me.  I will submit a sketch -but it&#39;s not even close to how cool it really looked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for this medium (for explaining what I saw).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was a major &amp;quot;what the hell was that?&amp;quot; moment.  No noise.  Nothing.  We sort of joked how we better not say anything about it to our buddies or else we would surely be laughed at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today:  I saw a video on a local San Francisco News (CBS) website that showed these same lights.

It was a clear, quiet night. Looking north from my second story bedroom window I pulled down the top sash of the double hung window to watch through the screen and smell the night air. The room light was off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the helicopter moved off to the east and the blade noise faded I noticed a burnt orange-colored ball of light appear in the west and moving silently to the east seemingly tracking the helicopter but on a parallel path I estimated an additional mile north of the helicopter&#39;s flight path. The ball of light was moving about 150 mph, about half again as fast as the helicopter.  It appeared to be about 600 ft above the ground.  I tried to resolve its shape but I could not until it had moved off to the east.  The window screen pixelated the view and I finally convinced myself that the the orange ball of light actually had a vertical diamond shape, although that was not readily obvious.  Most of the time it seemed to have an amorphous, ill-defined shape.  The light was seen for about 30 seconds. It was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the amorphous-shaped object, if two miles away at 600 feet, seemed to be between 30 to 40 feet,  It was as tall as it was wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As it approached the downtown city lights it vanished and simultaneously a meteor appeared, following the same trajectory as the object had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have one witness with me who saw me pointing to this object, but he couldn’t see it himself. He instead followed my eyes as I was following the object and he saw the subsequent meteor. I said to him as I watched this object &#34;look at that, there are no lights, yes, there are three lights&#34;. I said “no lights” first because there were no red or white blinking lights that you would see normally see on a plane. I knew there were no wings in other words. I don&#39;t understand how he could not have seen the object, it was large enough, close enough and there were no other objects visible in the cloudless, starry sky. He was absolutely convinced I was seeing and watching and following this object with my eyes, and the meteor happening at the same time I said to him &#34;it&#39;s vanished&#34; was quite a coincidence. No alcohol or other substances involved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about the size of a large airplane and was caterpillar or ameba-like with three &#34;dome&#34; type lights beneath it that did not radiate any sort of light downward. The lights took up at least 80% of the underside of the object. There were no other lights on the side or top or around it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound at all, yet was flying low enough (maybe 10,000 ft) that if it were a regular airplane, you would have heard sound. It was too late for a normal airplane to fly over my house. It moved very &#34;smoothly&#34; across the night skyline. It appeared completely in synch with the sky, as if it was traveling on water. When I say caterpillar-like it was because of the fluidity of its movement – like it wasn’t a completely solid structure, it seemed to move and bend in a way a plane never would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sense was that it was scanning.<n>
