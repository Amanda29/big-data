As I was driving I looked to the sky and saw 9 bright orange/red orbs falling slowly from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to be very close to earth, to the point where they continued to fall to the ground beyond the trees until they were no longer in my sight.  They were in a line, yet not straight, they curved, some lower or higher than the others.<n>

A glowing bright yellow object in rectangular structure zooming across the night sky in a sloping line upwards towards the southern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last couple of photographs taken at about 8.16 pm, 2 minutes later, shows twin lights emitted and the structure has changed direction and moved upwards towards the Moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was amazed and puzzled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Photo shows<n>

It went right directly above us at that point you could see one light in the front two lights in the back in the form of a triangle and there was no tail behind the two lights at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be black because I can see the outline and I could tell that it was trying to her shaved because there is no tail nothing hanging out behind the two lights in the back and there was nothing extending past the front light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued southwest just had a very very slow speed I could tell it was not a helicopter because there was no sound of a helicopter there was the sound of a turbine, but like I said, it was very very slow<n>

The lower orb was gone behind the distant mountains at this point, and the higher orb stayed in the lower sky for 15 minutes.  It was orangish in color and brilliant.  The higher orb eventually went below the distant mountain range.  They were heading in the direction of Ogden, UT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take pics with a digital camera, but due to the dark sky, it picked up the ORB out of focus.<n>

I actually saw 2 or 3 jets flying leaving smoke streaks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked left through the driver side window, I see another jet leaving a smoke streak.  However, there is an odd polygon shaped craft flying above the jet behind it above the smoke streak.  This craft was moving as fast as the jet keeping up with it and not leaving a smoke streak behind it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it wasn&#39;t because of the traffic, I would have got off road and recorded it was odd and I was just in shock.  It was my second ufo sighting ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was silverish grey and it was reflecting the Sun&#39;s light.  It seemed to have like a dark haze around it.<n>

I was coming through what we call the tunnels into downtown Portland.  As I was coming out of the East Bound tunnel, I saw what I cannot explain.  The thing I saw seemed to be a massive triangular object.  It had multi-colored lights on each point of the triangle which seemed to me to be at least 150 to 200 yards apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the middle of this object was a bright white light coming from the middle pointing to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I caught this sighting just as it was ascending back into the clouds, the thing I remember most is that when it was moving back into the clouds I could tell that it was a solid mass  because it was darker than the clouds it was acending into.  This lasted 4-5 and happened straight in my view while driving.<n>

This craft rapidly approached a cluster of yellow gold luminous objects that I had been watching for the last couple of minutes.  It started out as 2 or 3 lights, and then there were 5, and then 8, lights in a V-formation and in a straight line in front of this hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This glowing red object had no features except a sort of brim around the center, making it look like two inverted bowls held together and was strobing and pulsating in one color-a dark red.  It was huge compared to these other yellow gold lights and looked very solid and metallic.  It suddenly banked and headed to the south through San Francisco and kept going very fast.<n>

The viewing lasted about 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, two bright orange lights were seen from our window, heading east from the ocean into the Bay.  We went out to our balcony to get a better view, and an additional 4 lights in a vertical diamond formation came into sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All lights were bright, steady (no flashing), and moving slowly and silently. They were at a low altitude –maybe 200-500’ above the water.  The first two lights appeared to come together (possibly one moved in front of the other so that only one was visible…), then, after a few seconds, the(ir) light rapidly moved north across the Bay and faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other 4 lights began to fade as they began to move north.  After the orange lights were gone from sight, we could still see tiny dim lights (of red, white, and blue) moving erratically around each other, apparently on the far side of the Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At least two small private planes flew near the lights during our observation. It would be interesting to know the observations of the pilots.<n>

Somewhere near Salado, she observed 2 blue lights traveling southbound near her.  They appeared to resemble aircraft landing lights, but were a deep blue (not the blueish tint of some LED lights, blue like emergency lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> One was solid and one was blinking slowly.  They appeared to be on the same craft.  She observed it until about Jarrell (roughly 8 miles/5 minutes), and lost sight of it, as it continued south.  No aerial maneuvers, just a steady flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The coloring was the strange part.  Also, there was a &#34;low ceiling&#34; so no stars were visible.  It was flying below the ceiling of clouds, maybe 2000-3000 feet?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know of no aircraft that uses blue lights such as this.  No other colors were seen, no strobes, just the 2 blue lights.<n>

Yet when she returned approx. ten minutes later, there it was, looming right off the beach.  It just sat there in the water while we exclaimed and wonder aloud about it and went to fetch binoculars and a telescope and our iPhones to attempt to capture stills and video of it but it was too far and dark to enable a capture-yet it remained there while we scrutinized it for five or so minutes till she said, &#34;I&#39;m going inside- it&#39;s too close.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, as if responding to her fear it moved off so as not to trouble her to the north east somewhat laterally-port side first rather then bow or stem to stern...<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we checked back in another five or so minutes, it was nowhere to be seen, yet a rather blurry and opaque fog had indeed moved in approx. where it was doing whatever it was engaged upon, before our scrutiny and my girl&#39;s sudden apprehension- and it&#39;s my pet conjecture and theory that it simply &#34;cloaked&#34; itself to be able to resume its tasks unobserved and uninterrupted, as the sun came up around six am and the entire sighting lasted only about fifteen minutes, or from 5:45 till when we checked back at six after sunrise, and it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above, to reflect a sighting on January 29, 2015.

I was traveling East to West on Forest Hill Rd between Holden Blvd &amp; Jasper St. Staten Island NY 10314 area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of the driver&#39;s left side window, the light caught my eye, as it streaked past my vehicle and I watched it either disappear or burn out while looking through the front windshield, it was also traveling East to West Just over the tree tops.  I was completely sober lol, as I said just driving home from work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reminded me of a &#34;shooting star&#34; I&#39;ve seen many meteor showers in August near Lake George growing up.  But this was different it was much closer to the ground fire works height.  But I&#39;ve never seen this color in fire works.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The tip of it appeared very dark black the body was an extremely bright cobalt blue with a long bright white tail that widened and sprayed out as it streaked across the sky.  No one else was driving on the road at this time.  The night sky was very overcast I could not see any other lights no stars, no moon either.  It happened so fast there was not enough time to take a picture with my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was listening to &#34;Coast to Coast&#34; on the radio and my window was rolled up, so I never heard a thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m leaning more towards something celestial not ET, but I&#39;ve never seen those vivid bright colors in the sky before.  I would love to know what I saw.  I have made a report like this in my life.<n>

It was moving at a very high speed and was not making the sounds that a low flying airplane would.  I kept losing it among tall trees and houses, but I did follow it long enough (and saw it enough times) to see it make a sharp turn downward and to the left, all the while its lights flashing brightly and appearing to alternate in color from red to white to blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I parked in front of my house and ran from my car just as the craft disappeared from view above and behind the trees of the Bonnie Brae School.  The area was completely silent and there were no other witnesses.  I looked for the craft to reappear and sadly was not able to get any photos of it.  Due to the shape, the changing color of the rapidly flashing lights and the silent, sharp turns it took, I was completely sure that what I saw was not an airplane.  I am wondering if any other Basking Ridge area residents saw what I saw.<n>

The time was between 1600 and 1630 about an hour before the sun sets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my backyard working in the garden when I happened to look up and see some seagulls circling above.  Then further up in the sky a bright spot caught my eye.  Then another one and another until there was a bunch of them.  They were traveling northwest to southwest from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they might have been airplanes but I could not make out any wings.  They were very high in the sky so I thought maybe that might be why I could not see any.  The light I saw from them appeared to be reflection of the sun from something metallic. Most were not blinking but rather shown steady as a reflection.  However, there were a few in the center of the cluster that had a red glow that increased and decreased in intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not in any formation.  They were scattered in an elongated bunch, some apart, some were close together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or so I decided to try and count them. I got to ten but started to lose the front ones flying into the southwest.  I estimate that there were maybe 18 to 25.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They looked like stars.  Some brighter than others, but flying as a group.<n>

This morning, as many mornings in the past.. at 6:30 am, I look outside my window and I see this huge object flying in the sky.  It was just soaring through the air..  It looks to be the size of a plane.  It has 3 lights on it, 2 yellow and 1 red blinking flashing light.  It&#39;s triangular in shape but its a sideways triangle... the red light is in the middle...<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning it was flying through the sky, not making a noise, as it never does, while it was blinking its red light... then it stops...(in the same spot it always does) in the same direction as the window im looking out in, Its as if its almost looking at me... and it starts blinking its red light extremely fast.  I was frightened as I usually am so I move out of the window... then when I went back a couple minutes later it was gone.   My boyfriend has seen this object many times before with me...  A few days ago he saw it when he went ou!side to warm the car up at 630 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I was trying to convince myself that it was a drone or that it was all in my head, but it&#39;s not,  Drones are about the size of a kite..  This thing was the size of a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I&#39;m seeing and I&#39;m not the only one.  I see this object too frequently and I would really like someone to look into this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other day, I also saw at the end of my street (across the street), a huge yellow light floating in the sky, it looked like it was a piece of the sun.  Again I didn&#39;t see this alone. I have a witness.  The very first time I seen this object it was at the end of my street and was very low to the ground as it hovered over our car and it was a huge craft, low to the ground.  It&#39;s always happening around the same time.. between 630 am and 7 am.  I&#39;ve been seeing this thing since the end of October 2014.<n>

The object was flashing quite rapidly but inconsistently, in several different colors, which caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am quite familiar with the night sky here, as the rural area and terrain provide for great viewing that enables views of the Milky Way on clear moonless nights.  I also follow the planets, and this was not a planet, as it was too far to the north and not on the ecliptic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assumed that the object was an aircraft or a star, but it did not move like an aircraft, and it was too bright to be a star… So I watched it for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, it seemed to be stationary, but soon it moved quite rapidly to my right (further to the north) and then back to where it started.  Then it moved up and down and returned what seemed to be close to its original location.  Between motions, it would return to its original spot and remain motionless for several seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously, I was intrigued.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lined up the view of the object with a tree in my line of sight so that I had a fixed reference point, as I know that sometimes a sky object can only appear to move.  I also looked at the pattern formed by several nearby stars.  At this point I confirmed that the object was indeed moving, and moving very fast.  It made several circles and figure 8 patterns, and a couple of dramatic zig zags that were very rapid.  None of the motions appeared to move the object any closer to my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a total of about 15 minutes, I got a pair of 10 power binoculars, but I couldn’t see any additional details to the shape of the object, but the colors were easier to make out.  White, red, blue and green were the object’s predominant colors, with their frequency pretty much in that order.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what the object was, but it seems to fit the UFO category to me.  I will look for the object in the same location tomorrow, and if it is a star whose light was perturbed, the star should still be there… Considering the motions observed, I don’t think so..<n>

It was very far away so it had to have covered a great distance in that shot Period of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get to physically see it travel, although I am certain it was the same object I had just observed with my wife.  15 seconds prior to the movement.

No airplane were in sky at the time then noticed a plane to my far left out of corner of my eye and the lights I was watching completely disappeared and was not seen again once actual airplane was noticed me and 3 others watched them one of the guys has some video of the event not sure if it turned out did not get to see it we returned to our job and we told 2 others about the event and they thought we were crazy of course I have never seen anything like these that traveled so fast apart and then back again so fast still don&#39;t understand what they were<n>

I spotted a bright object in the sky up ahead and as we were talking, I kept noticing the object wasn&#39;t moving and was getting closer, meaning we were moving and the object wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally said to my daughters, &#34;Look at that thing in the sky.&#34;  Neither of them believed and didn&#39;t look up...I am always pulling jokes on them and being silly.  One of my daughters said it was probably a star, sarcastically, but the night sky was completely overcast...not a star in the sky.  The back drop was an orange tint to the skyline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I finally said it again, we were almost under it and my curiosity grew when I didn&#39;t see a pole anywhere in site.  I was thinking it was one of those towers with brinking lights, only they weren&#39;t blinking.  As we got right under the object, my other daughter finally looked out the window and almost cussed, saying, &#34;Holy.....oh my gosh dad!!!!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She rolled the window down and started making out what she was seeing.  She said it was a longer shaped sphere, no wings, no propellers, about 300-400 feet in the air.  There were 2 extremely bright lights on either side of the object and a blue lights that looked like it was underneath or coming from inside.  It hovered, completely motionless as we passed by....my other daughter wanted to see it but the other daughters head and body were in the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told her to look out the back window and that&#39;s when they both said it was gone....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled off of exit 13 and drove back down to exit 12 to see if we could see it again and unfortunately, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am posting this because I don&#39;t believe in aliens, but I can tell you that I have no idea what we just saw, and want some answers.  Just the fact that I am posting this on this site is enough for me to ask, what the heck was that?<n>

It was very big, very bright, very still and very quite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now my neighborhood has alot of dogs and is normally a bit noisy, but since seeing and watching the lights in the sky it was absolutely silent outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about two and a half hours of watching the sky the lights appeared to shift into what looked like one light that wasn&#39;t as bright as the four.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights then began to move slowly behind my house out of my sight to which I ran outside to see how far it had moved, and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the sky for about thirty minutes, as I was still stunned and shocked that the enormous light had disappeared so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed that the planes that were flying by had stopped as well.  By this time its 11pm and I went to bed.<n>

They passed, then three seagulls remained flying in the air without the rest of the group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch the birds I kept thinking my mind was playing tricks on me due to the height of the birds.  They seemed to be flying higher and higher in the sky with a swirl type motion without flapping their wings.  Then the more I looked at the birds, the wings seemed to morph into their bodies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was only able to focus on one bird as they appeared smaller.  It got smaller and smaller then turned into a white dot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing that happened is that it started to glow a white bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, lastly, it turned into a tiny, red, glowing dot in the sky.

They seemed to be off the coast and over the water.  I drove through the intersection and they were still there.  There were about 8 yellowish colored lights in a circle about 25 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Down and to the left of the larger circle formation there was another formation.  It was smaller, maybe 5 lights.  The lights stayed in place, and did not change their relationship for a couple minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then pulled over on the highway near another car that had stopped and was also looking at the lights.  Then the lights started to change their spatial relationship with the other lights.  There was no audible noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights then started to just fade out one at a time.  It was cloudy and some fog outside.  My wife during this time had gotten out of the car and was attempting to photograph them with her phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in Oak Harbor, which is home to Whidbey Naval Air Base.

Though I do not know how high it was, it did not seem to be be more than several thousand feet up. The fact that I heard no noise was strange.  All the time the object was red with a green blinking light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued on a short ways in front of me(heading south)and then it hovered for a short while and then backed up, then in move to my right (west) and stopped again.  I just went outside again and I note it is overcast outside.  As the red light did not seem to be obscured at all, this seems to verify the fact that it could not have been to high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aside from me my mother also saw this after I called her out side. She is 93 and I am in my mid 50&#39;s.  I am college educated and have seen aircraft all of my life.  As Ft. Lewis in nearby, I am accustom to seeing the aircraft they operate a lot and this was nothing like like a helicopter.  When it stopped there was no deceleration and when it moved again there was no acceleration.

Well lit but dark for suburbs.  First saw an odd shaped light appx due east, appeared to maybe be rising in elevation.  At first mistook it for aircraft.  No sound though highway noise was present.  It appeared to be sort of floating but still moving away. Just didn&#39;t move right.  Slowly faded above and behind treeline.  As first one faded a second appeared from due south above treeline moved north and arced east on exact same path as previous.  Identical flight pattern and characteristics and craft appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it faded to the exact same location as the previoius another appeared from exact same location on same path.  This repeated for a total of 4 craft after the first.  Very strange shaped lights, flight behavior, path and movement. No noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First thought:  Airplane/Jetliner Second thought: Helicopter Third thought: Absolutely no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it&#39;s a helicopter or jet, its not like any I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 11 year old son grabbed my phone and we videoed the last one.

Cont-  I have several pictures that make no sense to me, I sent you some pics in an email on 1-23-15, I tried to send a video but postmaster at hot mail undeliverable, I will try and send it again in a zip file or some other means.<n>

It is still the dead of night at this time of year as the sun will not peak over the mountain for another hour or more.  I immediately noticed a light to the west.  It was much larger than any thing I have every seen in the sky and was a a very strange shape.  For reference, the lights of an airliner would be the size of a pencil eraser in the night sky.  This object was the size of a match book.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way it moved, it appeared to be a solid object but unlike anything I have ever seen.  It was rectangular in shape but made up of only lines of light.  Take a match book layed on it&#39;s long side and draw 8 evenly spaced lines from top to bottom.  That how it appeared in the night sky except only the lines were visible and the lines bowed ever so slightly from end towards the middle.  Again, this thing was huge in the night sky.  The shape never varied as it moved the 10 to 15 miles until it faded from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about a mile or so west of my house when I first saw it and it moving steadily due west. It was hard to estimate the altitude but at least 3 or 4 thousand feet as it easily cleared the far mountain peaks.  It was so big I was able to follow it much further than a standard airliner.  I get a few airliners, a verity of small private aircraft and a few helicopters through the local air space.  I have no idea what it could have been or where it could have come from.  I only know it was huge, completely silent, and a solid object that moved on a straight fixed coarse at a steady speed through the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the window open and it made no noise and I live in a place where you can hear a pin drop.  I was an air traffic controller in the service and have seen most every thing that flys including blimps.  I have no idea what this could have been and can&#39;t understand how something this big could be airborne.<n>

It also appeared to strobe in the sky and change color throughout the spectrum.  I went back inside and woke my partner so he could corroborate what I thought I was seeing.  Together we watched the object continue to move about in random patterns for another 45 minutes.  We both agreed it was not a normal nighttime object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It eventually receded in the sky at approximately 4:15am and we went back to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a planet, or star??

There were two sets of lights.  Each individual set was a bright white light centered within (two?) red and green lights.  The red and green lights were pulsating like emergency vehicle lights.  They were not blinking lights.  There were not aircraft.  They hovered or slightly drifted for about 15-30 mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one set of lights moved gradually to one side of my vision and then disappeared.  I don&#39;t think it moved into cloud cover.  There was very little cloud cover if any last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have a camera.

Between the county line of Kosciusko and Whitley county.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching the fields off to the right looking for deer.  I noticed a green light in the sky.  I didn&#39;t think nothing of it until we passed a large areas of trees and was wide open to some fields.  Not really moving fast just a steady moving.  It was above the large power line but lower than the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was a plane but the longer I looked at it the less it had the attributes of a plane.  There was no blinking lights.  No red or white lights.  I thought how strange that a plane so low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my husband drove on, he asked what I was staring at.  I explained to him a green object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He kinda poked down and looked over, as we kept driving down IN 14, I watched it slowly glide across the sky behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few hours later on the ride home we passed the same field and we looked around, thinking a tower of some sort or lights on top of the power lines, but we could see nothing. Just a house and power lines then open fields.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure what we saw.  It just seemed a little odd to me.<n>

The light was vibrating rapidly at frequencies I&#39;ve never seen in any man-made aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached, I could see 3 different colored rockets attached on the bottom and a gray/white roof on top.  The top was sort of triangular and the bottom had 3 rockets that were cone-shaped with flames of light coming off of them.  One of the rockets flames was orange/yellowish, one was blue, and one was red. It seemed like it was vibrating instead of being propelled by an engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew about 20 feet above my window and very close to the roof of my 10-story building.  It happened very fast.  The vibration of the aircraft was so fast that taking a picture would most likely have resulted in an image of an extremely blurry light.  Although it was vibrating so fast, it seemed like it had slowed down to observe the area for some reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was in Capitol Hill.<n>

It was surrounded by a very bright purplish glow that stood out like a sore thumb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial reaction was WTF is that!  It was not a plane or helicopter.  The light surrounding it was solid and did not flash.  I was able to see it for about a minute before it went out of view behind my car.  I then watched my review mirrors and was able to catch one more glance in the mirror.  It was hard to tell the size or how high it was.  It seemed much lower altitude than a plane would fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky is very clear tonight.  I can see more stars than usual.  There is no wind or any other weather factors tonight.<n>

At first I thought they might be military planes in close formation but as they got closer I realized there was absolutely no sound and they were traveling - more like gliding - much slower than conventional aircraft.  The weather was perfectly clear and the night seemed remarkably quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 1 minute, the formation passed directly over my driveway at an estimated altitude of 250 feet and each craft appeared to be the same size or a little larger than the wingspan of small private planes at that height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed 3 dark triangle-shaped objects with red nose lights and smaller green &amp; white lights on the side points.  The shape of the objects was like a flattened triangle or boomerang as the distance between the green/white lights was very wide and approx. twice the span from the front to side.  The red lights seemed unusually large and remained constant; the green &amp; white lights blinked alternately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not make out any detail on the bottom of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house and grabbed my primitive camera phone, but could not capture anything but dark night sky.  I watched the formation move off to the northeast, then jumped in my car and followed it for another 4-5 minutes until it eventually went out of view over Myrtle Beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be following along the Highway 17 Bypass, and maintained the same steady speed for the entire sighting, which lasted 7-8 minutes.<n>

They were spaced fairly even.  I recorded the event on my Samsun Galaxy S5 phone.  The lights had the exact same color as high pressure sodium street lights.  I found this strange as I never saw this color before from an aircraft.  The lights were solid and non-blinking.  The traveled generally North and then turned West towards Camarillo.  They appeared to be high in the sky.  At first I thought they may have been toy drones, but after the first one 4 or more showed up soon after in the same flight pattern.   After heading west they got much dimmer rapidly, and I could no longer see them.  My best guess would be some military aircraft, but I really don’t know.  In the videos you can see regular planes fly by as a frame of reference, so you can see just how different these lights looked.  Since these lights were flying very close to the main air corridor to LAX and Burbank  - I wonder if any pilots or passenger saw anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I uploaded the videos to YouTube.<n>

Thought it looked a little unusual, until I observed it make a very sharp, practically right angle turn.  Looked to be travelling at a high rate of speed and not manoeuvering like a commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object continued moving somewhat level until appearing to enter  another, more gentle turn while still climbing steeply (trail was more of an arc than another right angle).  Object was actually turning closer to me.  As it started to get closer, it became even more apparent that it was travelling extremely fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The really curious part came as the aircraft travelled directly overhead.  It looked to be very high up, flying above the wispy cloud cover, and as it flew over, coincidentally, there was a commercial airliner passing underneath it.  Based on those observations, it looked to be too big to be a fighter.  As well, its shape (and coloring) did not really match any aircraft I am familiar with.  More flying wedge than plane with wings.  It looked more SpaceX than F-22 or F-35 (or any other active/inactive US military aircraft).  Most assuredly man made, but very unusual all the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Photos provided by witness, which appear to indicate contrails.

I Wish now I had taken a video, but this is not the sort of thing I see every day and was wanting to watch it with my own eyes as much as possible. The blue area on the map picture shows the general line of sight where I was looking when first observing the craft (S/SE).  My vantage point is the dot at the apex of the traingular area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I really wish I had recored a video, but would probably not have gotten anything usable as it passed overhead anyways due to the awkward angle of trying to blindly aim a camera almost straight up and out my window as it flew over.  I&#39;m sure overall, this is a pretty pedestrain report (and not really alien), but some of he crafts movements didn&#39;t seem quite &#39;right&#39;, and it&#39;s shape was certainly unique.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hey again,<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing I forgot to mention anywhere that is worth noting is the sound the craft made, which was none.

Typically I see them coming into Oklahoma City all the time to land but this time the lights were higher than normal and appeared stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they went North stopped then went straight up 90 degrees.  The speed seemed beyond what any known aircraft could do for the given height in the sky.  I estimate that the craft was at normal jet passenger traveling elevation of 10,000 to 20,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the craft went rapidly to the south and descended at an extremely fast pace.  I would lose it in the light overcast clouds and then it would reappear in the East at a point I first noticed it.  Its movements were very quick but directional, meaning a straight line.  You could follow it with the naked eye but were amazed at the speed.  From the east it went southwest and I would lose it in the clouds only to find it again in the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I would observe it going from the east to the northwest appear to stop and then takeoff at a rapid speed to the east.  This went on for about 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had 3 red lights that were in a V-type formation.  Once only once I saw a whit light.  It was not flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it moved the 3 red lights didn’t follow the v path of the lights.  The object did not make any audible sound.<n>

It just started getting dark in the sky, I don&#39;t remember the time though.  But I&#39;m driving towards the high way to go under the over pass for the high way, when I see 2 VERY bright yellowish lights in the sky.  They looked almost like car head lights but a lot brighter.  They appear stationary for awhile so I start thinking it&#39;s a cell phone tower or those tall street lamps we have in that area.  But as I drive closer, it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I look forward and continue driving maybe about 10 seconds, and then this huge ship appears right over the tree line, and slowly moves over my car. It was going maybe 10-30mph but I couldn&#39;t tell because it was so large and so low to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it flew over I couldn&#39;t really make out the shape, the bottom of the ship was so dark that I couldn&#39;t make out any type of patterns or designs under it as it appeared to be a reflective black paint or something.  But when it flew over it had 2 bluish lights under it. It looked like they were on the tip of each wing thing, and the lights were coming from a square window-like enclosure.  The blue lights did flash, but not in any type of pattern, it was almost like looking at metal in a microwave, but with all blue sparks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no noise which confused me the most, there was also no rumbling or shaking.  I could see some of the wing where the lights would flash.  The lights that lit up around the wing did let me see some of the wing shape though and color.  From the little I saw, the ship&#39;s shape looked similar to that atlantis space shuttle.  The ship looked like it was following the highway, but next to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll provide a picture/map of the course I saw it flying on.  Sadly I do not own a cell phone, and the other people in the car were too in shock to respond quick enough to record it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I usually hear stories of strange red lights in the sky in this area, but this goes way beyond that…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I thought it was a new street light because it wasn&#39;t moving until it slowly started moving right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend, his girlfriend and I stopped and began watching it as it sped up, before stopping again after moving from my 12 to 4.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I noticed it wasn&#39;t 1 light but 3 long lights.  Then as it began moving again, I noticed a second one off in the distance.  These objects where probably at around 8000 ft if I was to guess.  It didn&#39;t make any soumd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was seemed large, and moved a lot like a similar object I seen around 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen something similar 3 times within 1 mile of each other.  All orange, but until I saw this one I never noticed the three bars of light and always thought they where 1 light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the past 10 years, the feds have been buying up a lot of land around here too.  And there is a Lockheed Martin factory close too.  I seriously think something weird is going on in north centeral WV.  There are places where you can see large air shafts coming out the ground, but there hasn&#39;t ever been word on what they are doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope you can dig more up on this because no one else seems to care.<n>

I normally don&#39;t report things I see or encounter, but this was a first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was having trouble sleeping so I was just lying in bed half asleep when a sudden rush/vacuum of air outside our home shook the whole house.  It lasted about 5-7 seconds.  I don&#39;t know how to explain it, but it was sudden and tremendous.  I&#39;ve never experienced this before.  And it wasn&#39;t like wind pushing on the house, it felt like an upward vacuum with a crescendo.  We have occasional military jets fly over low so I understand the buildup of sound and vibration from those.  This was different. It was quick and right outside or above our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s not uncommon for me to see things people would deem &#34;ufo&#39;s&#34; and that&#39;s just normal. But this was different so I thought I&#39;d report it.  Wish I had more info.  Thank you.<n>

In between the Orion and Sagittarius constellations, I noticed two bright objects that looked like stars, but were not known stars, nor planets.  These lights could have been sattelites, but I have seen moving objects in the sky here that are moving erratically before, with others.  The two lights then moved slowly toward the center sky, and twisted Around each other somewhat erratically.  They were very high in altitude and faint compared to Sirius, Venus, and Alpha Centauri.  They then grew fainter and began to move much more quickly, then either disappeared due to speed or the lights being dimmed. Judging by their altitude as triangulated with the mountain range in the back ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were following the general direction of the train tracks, and moving from around 2 knots to around 870 knots from a near standstill.  They retained either a linear or somewhat triangular pattern, though the two rear lights have have been one reflecting off of frost in the atmosphere, or some other atmospheric disturbance.  This is not the first time I have seen these particular lights, and they are sometimes accompanied by infrasonic pitches of around 2-4 Hz or less, and sometimes a faint red center light.  The dogs in the neighborhood all get very loud when the infrasound begins, and if it flies at a lower altitude they all attempt to go inside or seek other shelter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have detected very little radio static on any frequencies from the objects, and no noticeable sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have yet to try radar detection.<n>

We see these light orbs occasionally at dusk &amp; sometimes a few hours after dusk.  We have been researching these orbs since 2006 which is when I first made my report here.  At one point we was seeing these orbs so often that it seemed pointless to report every single time.Anyone who reports to Mufon, well good luck!  They will tell you that satellites &amp; the ISS passes over ya at a few hundred to 1000 ft from the ground or that it was a`plane.  I would advise to not report anything to mufon because it&#39;s a waste of time.  I am making a report tonight in case anyone in nortwest Alabama has or is seeing these to know that you are not alone.I don&#39;t have any photos from the past 2 nights but I do have 1 from Dec 9, 2014, I&#39;ll share in email.  I have photographed &amp; filmed these light orbs in the past &amp; they are on youtube.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s time for answers, more people are seeing these across the states, but no one can make an official announcement?  My advice, do your own research &amp; make those photos &amp; videos &amp; load them up on youtube.  Remember, watch low in the sky from the west &amp; south to north at dusk &amp; when the stars start coming out.<n>

Yesterday afternoon I kept hearing what sounded like a small aircraft flying above our house.  It sounded strange, so I went outside to take a look.  What I saw was a triangular craft with a long forward fuselage and what looked like canards at the forward end of the craft.  I would estimate the size to be about that of a Lear jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my camera and snapped several pics before it disappeared in the distance, only to return a few minutes later and I was able to take a few more shots of it before it headed towards a cloud in the distance and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The enlarged the photos to get a better idea of what the craft looked like, and was surprised to see that it had no visible propellors or jet engines.  The strange thing about the sound it made was that it seemed so artificial, like a recording.  The sound also seemed to trail the craft by several hundred feet and the aircraft was not moving any faster than a typical single-engine airplane.<n>

Last night, I saw 4 orange/red glowing orbs above my house starting around 10:00pm.  The first one I saw while I was driving home.  It was hovering over a commercial building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I stopped my car to see it better, it started moving north.  I got back in my car and drove home (about 4 blocks away).  I was watching it the whole time.  It eventually just vanished in an area that it didn&#39;t make sense for it to vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I got home, I had to change the windshield wipers on my car.  I was telling my husband about what I just saw because it reminded me of a story our neighbor told us when we lived in Casselberry, FL, last year.  She had seen 3 orange lights flying above our house.  I had also seen similar lights when I lived in Pompano Beach, FL, about 2 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I was done telling him what I’d just seen, another orange light came from over the horizon.  It flew in the same flight path as the first one I saw.  We sat there and watched it the whole time (roughly 5-7 minutes).  It flew right over our heads and did not make a sound. It seemed to be the size of a small car about 1,000 feet off the ground.  It disappeared right as we heard a jet from the airport taking off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 minutes later, as we were finishing replacing my windshield wipers, another orange light appeared, again in the same flight path as the other 2.  We watched that one appear over the horizon, and when it was about halfway through the path the other 2 had taken, yet another one appeared and flew the same path.  Right around the same place that the other 2 disappeared, so did these two.  It almost seems like they were going into an invisible mothership or something.  Because they weren&#39;t high enough to be hidden by clouds, and they weren&#39;t far enough to fall out of our range of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were a dull orange (similar to metal halide street lights) around the front and sides.  The rear had red lights and some type of glowing red “antenna” could be visible form the back.  When they were directly above us, you could see a very faint white light alternating flashes from the front and back.  A couple hours later, helicopters flew nearby, you could hear them and see their flashing lights distinctly. Whatever the orange/red lights are, they are definitely not planes or helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve checked the box at the bottom about being contacted by an investigator.  These lights seem to be coming up near us for the last 3 years.  Coincidentally, that&#39;s how long I&#39;ve known my husband.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last year, after the neighbor told us she saw lights over our street, my husband told me about how he feels like he&#39;s been abducted when he was a kid.  He showed me a place on his foot that appeared after his apparent abduction (I think he said it was about 20 years ago).  Anyway, this spot on his foot looks like a drill hole and has not healed since he got it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m wondering if there may be some correlation between his alleged abduction and the fact that it seems like I&#39;m seeing UFOs all the time now. Please contact me by email.  Thanks!<n>

It seemed to be going very slow for a minute.  We were amazed and terrified this was not natural.  We cried.<n>

He had been trying to tell me about these lights in the sky around his home.  They appear consistently every night.  I never paid attention. He called me outside, and I had my first experience with this when I saw a light that was approximately 4-5 hundred yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered, floated and was neon purple and blue.  Almost like a firework in its brightness. It was absolutely silent.  It changed from purple to blue. It rose up in the air above the treeline and went left about 200 yards. The, went back right.  It then hovered for a while and sank below the trees.  We have video of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night I was home but he called me to tell me there were up to 20 orange ones, some in formation and some not.  They were going into formation, then breaking away. Some were going in circles.  They appear out of the middle of the sky and disappear the same way.  This is a common occurence for them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did an Internet search and several, several people saw the same thing.  I am attaching video of what he saw on the 17th.  It is very impressive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My question as a skeptic is why in this world, are we not trying to explain and find out with government resources what these things are?<n> <n><n> <n><n> And on a side note-I went to Thailand personally and saw with my own eyes Chinese lanterns.  They are not the size of small cars.  And they do not move like planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And they are easily followed with the eyes, as they rise from the earth where they are let go.  And Chinese lanterns are illegal in Louisiana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could someone please explain this?<n>

I had gone to my car to retrieve a book I wanted and as I returned I saw the object hovering and gliding around low in the sky.  The sighting occurred from about 8:10 till 8:30 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was round and bright red with a bright yellow spot in the lower right section. The object glimmered or pulsed in brightness.  Visually in size in appeared to be about one-sixth to one eighth the size of the full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the trees and houses blocked my view of it as it went behind them, I estimate that it was at least 1000 feet away, perhaps a quarter mile or even half a mile or more, so it seemed quite large.  Its movements were very strange in that it seemed to float, totally silent, in various directions at various speeds, mostly at moderate speeds.  It went upward in a straight line, floated both left and right, reversed directions easily, descended below the tree line, then quickly ascended to its previous position and again moved around the sky silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing it for two minutes or so, I realized I had my cell phone, and began videotaping the object.  After videotaping for a minute or two, I ran into the house to get my girlfriend.  She came out and together we watched the object for another three or four minutes, videotaping with my cell phone again, until the object descended behind the trees and houses toward the ground away from us at good speed.  It descended toward the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, it did not return so we went inside.  Several times over the next hour I checked the sky and did not see it again.  Two videotapes were made of the object.  The cell phone video does not do justice to its actual visual size in the sky.  However, its gliding, floating movements are well recorded.<n>

1/16/15 19:30|Lafayette|LA|Unknown|5 minutes|Red, green and white lights flew in, hovered, reversed course to depart.  Not airplane or helicopter|1/26/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116758.html|239|ndxe201501| Red, green and white lights flew in, hovered, reversed course to depart.  Not airplane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur astronomer with 50 years of sky watching, thousands of hours, a college degree in Geology.  Until now I have never seen anything in the sky that could not be explained as a natural, although sometimes unusual, event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out in my yard looking for meteors and relaxing when an object appeared from behind my roof.  It was in the SW sky about 15-18 degrees above the horizon, moving to the ESE and caught my attention, initially as an airplane with red, green and white lights over the trees.  It was far enough away  that the body of the craft was not discernible, due to its bright lights, and it was clearly high in the sky being visible over the trees at the back of my property.  I glanced directly at it, and immediately thought there was something very odd, in that the lights were blurry, fuzzy looking.  More like orbs than the lights of a plane.  There were stars clearly visible nearby that were pinpoints of light so it was just odd in the cloudless sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was visible and moving West to SE slowly for almost five seconds until it slowed quickly and then stopped completely.  My first thought was that the object was turning and only appeared to stop but the lights, which were clearly separate colors, were not reorienting themselves as a turning airplane would certainly do.  The red and green light did not blink or change intensity.  The white light on the right (West) side of the object was pulsating, dimming and brightening, unlike an airplane with strobes that blink.  The object appeared to hover for about ten seconds with no other changes in the lights and then abruptly reversed its course back to the NW.  The way that it started moving was too abrupt for a turning airplane, it was almost like a computer animation in that it seemed to jump to its path with no curving motion and a very short period of acceleration followed the initial jump.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then maintained a very steady, straight path in departing.  I was able to ! change position and watch the object for several minutes.  I attracted my wife&#39;s attention and she was able to see the object also while it departed NW and disappeared near the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time did the orientation of the lights change as I would expect with an airplane. Nor were the lights pinpoints as typical with airplanes.  These lights were diffuse orbs that were close enough to overlap.  The brightness of the orbs and dark sky did not allow a hint of the actual shape of the object to show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been skeptical of stories told by others about lights in the sky because I had never seen anything that I felt was not &#34;explainable&#34; but this event has made me wonder just what I actually saw.  I think that it was definitely not a &#34;normal&#34; aircraft and was obviously a craft under intelligent control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an &#34;unidentified&#34; object that I hope others will have reported and perhaps identified as a natural object, but it was NOT something that I have ever seen before.<n>

My first impression was three aircraft on a very low approach to land at the Friday Harbor Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped our car so we could watch, since the lights were starting to bob up and down.  I said they had to be helicopters.  But then they almost appeared to be going down  behind the buildings in town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They stopped getting closer and suddenly started climbing at a very high speed headed back northwest.  They grew dimmer, and one at a time, blinked out and were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole duration of this sighting was about two minutes.  I kept trying to find an explanation for what we were seeing.  I wish I had immediately reached for my I-phone to get a video.  I knew they were unconventional aircraft since they didn’t have red and green navigation lights.  Then the erratic flight and changing speed ruled out any aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I are both private pilots and have flown into the Friday Harbor airport hundreds of times.<n>

While squinting, I was able to make out white wings with black on the tips.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued watching their flight I began to notice several oddities, (1), the flight seemed to be moving at a speed too fast for geese in flight, (2), I also noticed that the wings on all the objects were not moving at all during the entire flight of the formation, (3), there wasn&#39;t any noise as they passed directly overhead, (4), I did not observe a head, neck, or tail to the bird/object, but then noticed that the main body of the objects were perfectly round with a silver translucence color such as a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next thought was just that, a string of balloons with wings held together by a string.  As I continued to watch the formation it was starting to become obscured by the house roof, so I immediately walked to the front of the house and resumed watching the formation, when at this time the entire formation stopped and ‘all’ the objects broke from the V-formation and began to do random irregular circular movements in all directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this moment I briskly walked about 15 feet to the front door of the house and yelled to both of my daughters (19 and 16 years old) to come out to see what I was watching.  Upon both daughters stepping outside and standing next to me I pointed out the objects still doing random movements while still in one spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While this continued I ran into the garage and grabbed my small binoculars from my roll along tool box and returned to the driveway next to my girls and started viewing this event th! rough them.  About 30-45 seconds later, all the objects stopped their respective random movements and began moving again due east and formed back into a V-formation at their original speed of approximately 125-150 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As all three of us watched them travel eastward, I then observed a private aircraft (Cessna) appear from a northeast direction flying towards us and then began a hard left turn, exposing the full underside profile of the plane which then leveled out and headed directly towards the objects in the V-formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the Cessna approached the main V formation 2-3 of the objects from the right side of the V-formation broke off and began traveling due south with the Cessna, making a corrected turn to the right and pursuing the 2-3 objects which seemed to be a little faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10-15 seconds went by as we watched the main formation starting to disappear to the east when I tried to relocate the Cessna and the 2-3 objects I then observed the objects make a 90 degree left turn a! nd resume heading due east in the same direction as the main formation with the Cessna also making a steep left turn in pursuit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within approximately 15-25 seconds both the plane and objects had blended into the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In disbelief as to what I had just witnessed I went into the house and sat at the laptop and pulled up a phone number and made two attempts to call Fullerton airport, both calls went to voice mail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called Riverside Airport and spoke to the airport manager which showed some interest.  I also called Whittier police dispatcher which had no calls of the sighting. I called ABC news, nothing. I called Whittier Daily news, nothing.  At this time it seems only my girls and I had seen this event to date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this time I returned to the laptop and began any searches of sightings and came across the Nat’l UFO Reporting Center which advised me to follow up with a written report of the incident, as well as my daughters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please be advised that a drawing of the objects sighted will be made available.  At this present time, I would not mind having contact with a representative or Peter Davenport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, ((name deleted)) Retired Calif. Peace Officer.

I cannot remember why I did this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought of getting my IPhone ready to take pics but I reasoned that time was of the essence and I would not be able to enter the Passcode, find camera app, open it, then shoot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then remember getting out and moving to the other side of my car and looking up.  I saw what appeared to be a silent rectangular shaped object with a long Blue light underneath, a very long tube shaped light; I am not sure how high it was but I believe it was tree top level; my side of the trees that lined the roadway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure but I think it had turned off  its lights as it passed me ( because I did not see it clearly while being only feet from me) being head high above the ground.  There was only ambient light available.  I heard the craft as it passed me (approx. 20-30 mph);  It made a combination of an electrical/mechanical sound (mechanical being the possible result of a pulse like a droning ping against the metal or craft material encasing the propulsion system) … not very loud.  No prop sounds or conventional  engine sounds when it had passed me; not sure how far, it went to become silent again but a good guess would be 20-30 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next time I actually saw the craft (not in detail but possible shape; rectangular at best, it was tree top level with possible red, blue, and white lights on before it turned left with ease out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t remember getting back into my car or anything else that morning (as I usually go to bed around 3 am) except making a mental note of the St. Augustine exit and saying to myself that it wasn’t far behind me where I encountered the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife told me that I had told her every day of the encounter never altering my story once.  The thing is she tells me that I had been telling her for weeks when I realized so much time had passed while I was still thinking that it had just happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind has not revealed anything else of the encounter; I believe that I suffered some sort of emotional shock or trauma from the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please edit name out of report that was accidentally copied and pasted on report for Saint Augustine, FL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Blue light rectangular shapes object, electrical mechanical sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was driving into town from the southeast on SR 37 on my way through town.  I noticed a very bright light, very low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving it first looked like it was still.  I didn’t remember a cell tower in that area or any lights on the top of the courthouse so I took notice.  It was low enough that I lost sight of it through the trees and buildings and flying slow enough, I thought it could be a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I reached the top of the hill continuing into town, it was slowly flying directly along SR 37, which is the main street of town.  I pulled over as soon as I could and stepped out of the car to get a better look.  This thing had come right across the middle of the village on a straight course from as far as I cold see it and exited the same way.  It flew directly over me.  It was a hundred to maybe two hundred feet above the ground and very quiet.  I expected it to be an airplane and be very loud but it was nearly, if not, silent. We sometimes see military helicopters from Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio, coming or going, usually in formation, but nothing like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I don’t think it was ET because it had the usual marking lights but the Delta shape, silence and, altitude was strange.  We see Jets flying in low preparing to land at Port Columbus Intl Airport, never this low never this quiet and this was not heading that direction.<n>

Shortly after getting on the main highway, I noticed that there were breaks in the clouds, and that I could see stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I glanced out of the driver&#39;s side window (looking West), and noticed an extremely bright object, which I thought at first was a planet.  I kept looking, off and on, as I drove, and as I focused, I could make out that what I was looking at, was actually a cluster of three, very bright lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had an urge to pull over to get a better look, but I had a truck behind me, and no good place to pull over.  As it was, I slowed down temporarily to almost 40 mph, in an effort to get a better look at this array of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To aid in my view, I lowered the driver&#39;s side window, to avoid any glare.  It confirmed that I was seeing a tight cluster of three lights.  They appeared bright white, while at least one had some red in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cluster seemed mostly to hover, although I did detect some slight movement. The size was about 1/3 of a dime, held at arm&#39;s length ( 3-5 times that of a bright star).  The cluster was about 35 - 40 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had no camera with me, nor binoculars, but in the hope of getting a better look, I doubled back at the (8 miles further) Thetford, VT, exit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I had returned to the area of sighting, cloud cover had moved in, and/or the object could not be located.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t going to report this, but after checking to see if others may have seen something similar, and discovering that there had been similar sightings around that date and area, I decided to report what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I have no photos, a sighting reported, and photographed, in the Valley Forge, PA, area (reported on MUFON site) from around the same time, the first of that series of photos, looks very similar to what I saw.<n>

He left and I moved my car back in the driveway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of my car that was parked in front of the front door of the house and I looked at the sky and I saw 2 bright lights close to each other that look like identical stars.  I was looking at them for about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew I saw this happen to me before I walked fast in my house with snowy boots on to get my Windows phone so I could film it.  I was walking fast back outside 12 seconds later with camera ready to film and I knew they would be both gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this before when there was the lunar eclipse a couple months ago.

I awoke to the sound of my television and then turned it off while still lying on my couch.  I sat there for a few minutes and darkness looking at my view of the Chicago skyline when a bright light caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My condominium is the flightpath of O&#39;Hare airport and I&#39;ve grown use to watching planes fly past my balcony on approach to O&#39;Hare airport.  I am also fairly close to the city&#39;s medical district and will occasionally see emergency response helicopters fly by my window as well.  However, I&#39;ve become very adept at identifying types of planes, their altitudes, and the speed in which they are flying.  As the son of a military and commercial pilot, I&#39;ve spent more than 45 years around airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was flying far too low and moved more fluidly then any aircraft I&#39;ve seen as it made an ark across the sky.  Its lights flickered brightly, making and arcing tracer as it dissipated in the same manner as a signal flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked over to my window looking for signs of a tail light and nothing was there.<n>
1/14/15 02:00|Tulsa|OK|Unknown|3 minutes|3 Round Bright Green Lights not flashing side by side & 1 Red Flashing Light, Loud Craft.|2/12/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/117/S117276.html|272|ndxe201501| 3 Round Bright Green Lights not flashing side by side &amp; 1 Red Flashing Light, Loud Craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looked out patio door at 2 a.m. In the North Airport area I noticed some really bright green lights side by side in sky.  Thought it was odd and not normal.  So I sat there and waited for it to get closer.  It was low flying, barely above tree top level.  It came about as fast as an airplane taking off would.  When it got close I could see 3 really large Round Bright Green Lights that were not blinking.  It was going South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it got to my fence line it stopped and hovered. It was real loud like a lawnmower in the sky. It was so steady hovering there.  I sat there wondering what the heck this thing is? I could not open my door to get a better look, or my Alarm would have went off.  I sat there watching it.  I heard a noise like a transmission would make and those 3 Green Lights rotated counter clockwise and was now Facing East instead of South like they were facing. That was an incredible sight.  The lights literally twirled around fast.  When it turned I now saw a R! ed Flashing Light on the back of this thing and could see about one inch of the Green light lens on one of the lights on the side near me, I knew the lights were still there but now they were facing East.  The craft took slowly off going East now.  This thing had to be black or a dark color cause It was so dark that morning, I could not make out shape of it.  I could not tell what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not our Police Helicopter or an airplane.  It was not a toy either.  It was too large.  The lights were huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on the flight path of the airport and am used to seeing all kinds of airplanes and helicopters.  Never saw lights like that or a sound like that.  I have spent hours now researching every plane, drone and helicopter I can find and can’t find anything that has 3 Green lights on it that are that large and round and don’t blink.  So wish I knew what it was.   One thing for sure, I saw first hand how these flying crafts change direction so fast.  Apparently they must push a button or a gear and can go from going South to going East real quick.  It must be a new craft too, not many reports of 3 Green lights that are solid and not flashing.  I will never forget what I saw.  It all happened so fast and me being slow at walking, I could not get my camera to take a picture or I would have missed it!<n>

There was a regular airplane with blinking navigation lights, and then in front of it was a triangle shaped craft with 3 orange lights moving from east to west.  The airplane appeared to be following the UFO, and was east of the UFO as they traveled west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could hear the engines from the regular airplane, which was obviously some sort of jet, but not from the UFO.  The UFO appeared to be larger than the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were still flying in a westerly direction.  Not sure if this was some sort of military operation or if it was an actual UFO with a plane following it to see what it was.<n>

I assumed the plane was coming in to land at BZN.  I happened to notice what I thought was a satellite in the same vicinity; at first, I thought it was the ISS as it was big enough.  I kept watching it and dismissed that though as it appeared to be moving much slower than other times when I&#39;ve seen the ISS and wasn&#39;t nearly as bright.  In fact, I saw that what I thought was a satellite was really two lights--almost vertical--and, when my hand is held at arm&#39;s length, was about as tall as my thumb and forefinger held about an inch apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was interesting; I hadn&#39;t ever seen something like that before.  I stood there watching it and it&#39;s direction changed, from headed N to headed W.  At first, I still thought it was a satellite: it had no blinking lights, so I just thought it was a satellite in orbit and it&#39;s orbit happened to curve right then.  The longer I watched it though, the more I realized that it was being followed by the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its angle in the sky changed; the lights went from appearing to be vertical in the sky to being parallel with the ground.  There were three lights in a triangle shape.  It flew right through the constellation Orion, south of Taurus and the Pleiades, and the plane followed behind.  At arm&#39;s length, the plane was about a foot behind the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The heading of both the object and the plane continued to curve slowly around, from west to SW, and it eventually left the Gallatin Valley with the plane following behind, just off to the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It struck me as odd; the object had no blinking lights AT ALL.  Normally at night, even at high altitudes, it&#39;s obvious to tell if something is plane or a satellite, primarily from the blinking lights.  This object had no blinking lights, no colored lights--other than white, and they weren&#39;t the same intensity as the &#34;chase&#34; plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A description of the backgrounds of the observer(s) is useful as well: I have a MS in the quantitative sciences, a BS in Biology, and have been an aviation buff since I was a kid.  I don&#39;t drink alcohol or use drugs so could not have been under the influence at all.<n>

It was moving slowly- appearing to be one big country block off to the northeast of me.  It was low, and that&#39;s what caught my attention, and moved very slowly.  Thought it could not be a plane.  Originally thought maybe a heli-copter &amp; either an emergent situation or the sheriff&#39;s dept looking for something. ?  It seemed to be staying right in that area (and did for at least two hours) sometimes higher above but often appearing not far above the wooded area.  When it seemed lower, the dogs (many) one big country block over would bark like crazy.  At one point it seemed to be closer or something and moving away from me- and I saw blue lights moving horizontally left to right and back again.  But not like just lit. More like someone skilled at piano, playing one note quickly at a time one aft! er another.  I was in and out, as it was so cold out. Intermittently, would get online searching for anyone that was also seeing something.  I saw object one on and off for 2 hours. Near the end, I went back out and did not initially see it.  When I turned toward straight east I saw a bright &#34;star&#34; seeming almost straight east, seeming higher up but pretty much positioned above the State route &amp; moving slightly.  So initially, thought it had moved quite a bit while I was in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Got my tablet and tried to take video and pic, but was just appearing as a star would.  Was messing with my tablet when I spotted the original one over where I head watched.  Then realizing, there were now two. Then the one I originally saw seemed to be shining a white light in the thick cloudlike atmosphere toward the other and then started moving to the west (quicker but still not fast)and the other moved over and started heading west (trailing slightly behind and more south) and they passed on my! north side- heading west. I no longer could see because of ho! w the ho use is, so ran in and looked out west side. Object 1 headed straight west toward Martel, Caledonia, etc. Object 2 seemed to head more southwest (more west than south but more at an angle)  As they passed and after I no longer saw the white spot light type light or the blue lights I saw when it wasn&#39;t nearly as dark, but was as if I saw red lights (not moving or flashing) as they went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else see anything????  I wondered drones or weather balloons, but whatever they were, they were more the size of small aircraft.  They could not have been planes.  &amp; I doubt that two helicopters could hover so very long, or move that smoothly.  I have NEVER believed in the &#34;alien type&#34; ufos- but I have no explanation.  Seems like had to be drone type or large technology that I am just not aware of.  It is very rural here. There are residents but very small population.  A lot of wildlife.  Deer, turkeys. etc.  ???<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tried pics, too dark. Took a video with my tablet of object 2- when! I didn&#39;t realize it was not the first one, but it only appears like bright light, as a star would.<n>

As they were exiting, they were much closer to me and went by me to my north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is not a shape I feel is appropriate on your drop-down.  To me, they appeared the shape of a hand-held CD player.  Having more length and width mass than heighth. I can only liken color to some sort of metal as they seemed to blend in fairly well in the night sky, however, as they were so low as they passed the north side of my house, I did see them. &amp;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Antoher couple odd things- I only saw the red fixed lights on back (not all the way across) but nothing in front at that time.  &amp; I heard nothing!  No engine, no whir or jet kind of  noise at all. &amp; To back up,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object 1 was the only one that seemed to have &#34;aura&#34; or cloudy sort of mass around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object 2 was sitting in a clear space. &amp;<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they exited,  Object 1 had nothing around it either.  They just left-slowly west &amp; southwest. (although quicker than previous movements)<n>

We noticed 3 orange lights in triangle formation flying from southern sky towards us level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first they looked like helicopter lights.  However, as they neared us, one at a time each light headed straight up and disappeared.  4th light followed closely behind the three and like the first three, flew up and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lights did not blink and there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had enough time to discuss what we saw and disappointed that none of us had a cell phone to capture it!<n>

Tonight, it was not out yet but we were still looking because he was going &#34;mooo&#34; crazy...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow, we went out front and it was pretty clear, could see many stars, including a few very high flying objects.  I assume they may have been satellites but one thing i saw had 3 white lights in a triangle shape, and one red light in the middle.  They would blink almost as if morse code, but couldn&#39;t really read it (even though I kind of know morse).  But there was a pattern in the lights.  I could not identify a shape because it was so high, but the fact that the triangle was so big and it was so high up, it must have been HUGE!  Anyhow, we went back inside to show my wife and when we went back out it was gone.<n>

The trail dissipated quickly behind the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, it seemed to be creating a lot of drag.  The first thought that came to our mind was a falling satellite of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was another white or gray jet with no contrail much lower heading southwest at the same time.<n>

1/12/15 23:00|Oakville (Canada)|ON|Unknown|40 minutes|Low-frequency pulsing hum associated with aircraft lights flying around for over 40 minutes|1/16/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116688.html|286|ndxe201501| low frequency pulsing hum associated with aircraft lights flying around for over 40 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> Woke up from a light sleep by an irritating low frequency pulsing hum that could not be localized, It felt as if it was inside my head.  Got out of bed and went to the window to see if there was any machinery on the street.  You could describe the sound as being like the idle of an engine but only in terms of rhythm.  This frequency was much lower than any engine.  I could almost feel this hum throughout my body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked out onto the street, there was no activity.  However, there was what appeared to be several aircraft each with multiple lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching for a couple of minutes the configuration of the lights changed with the direction of the movement.  So you could assume the multiple white lights were at the front and multiple red lights at the rear.  The rear red lights were in two rows on top of each other which gave the appearance of a straight flat surface at the back of the craft.  The lights themselves looked like running lights (small, singular, but bright).  When the craft appeared sideways you could see much less white at the front and similarly red at the back with large dark gap (lack of any lights) at the sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was night and the sky was clear yet dark, I could not discern any solid shape other than what you might think is shape determined by the configuration of the lights.  My window points south towards the lake whose shoreline is only 1 mile away.  Two craft were just west of my position (right) and were off shore heading inland (toward but just west of my house).  They were low on the horizon.  As they passed, I could not see an underside of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving very slowly, (much slower than any small plane) and made no noise.  The third craft was some distance away to the far south east and much less visible but appeared to be just hovering (stationary).  Feeling awkward about what I had seen, I tried to go back asleep.  But the hum continued.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not fall back asleep and the hum seem to grow louder again.  So I got up and went to the window again.  This time, the aircraft were south and east of my house.  Their movement appeared to be along the shoreline, heading north, then south in a zig zag pattern heading from west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distant craft was still stationary off to the south east. When I went to the back window I expected to see the craft continue further inland (north) and west (left) from my position. But I could see nothing.  Seems as though their flight pattern would zag, about where my house was as a distance from the lake, and they would head back south again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went and got a pair of binoculars.  The configuration of the lights were clearer but I could still not determine the shape of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I felt a little silly with my wife sleeping beside me while I walk about the bedroom peering out of the windows, so I tried to go back asleep again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The hum continued (never abated), and again got more intense, so I got out of bed again to have a look.  This continued for over 40 minutes.  I know because the hockey game was on (was falling asleep to it) and 2 periods had passed while this was happening.  Also, at one point the tv signal got scrambled for a brief moment which I thought was odd (not unlike everything else that was going on).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects continued eastward zigzagging north then south.  As they got more distant, I went back to bed and eventually fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The closes proximity I would say was practically over my house just to the east at a fairly low altitude 1500–2000 feet, but I could still not see any underside (nor lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size would be that of a single engine 4 seat plane.  They made no noise.<n>

When they turned off the lights at the beginning of the show the stars shown brilliant in the sky.  I noticed two bright stars to the South at about 45 degrees that were moving slowly about two inches apart at arm&#39;s length..  The lights came up for the show and I could still see the two lights in the sky but dimmer, they very slowly moved down and then suddenly disappeared while the stars around were still visible.<n>

They were spotted at 7:45 pm and were present for about 20 minutes.  They came from the south and headed northwesterly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They merged together at certain points, and seemed to just blend away into the night sky opposed to speeding up and flying away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were able to get video footage, and noticed the distinct sounds of moving water and insects upon viewing, however, we were in Albuquerque proper where neither of those things were present.  I believe the sounds were emanating from the ships.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been witness to quite a few sighting over the years, but never one so blatant. How no one else took notice, i don&#39;t know, but they were definitely noticeable, and not of this world.  That I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d also like to mention that out of all the sightings I&#39;ve been witness too, this is the first one where I had no sense of euphoria during or afterwards, was not compelled in anyway, and my phone didn&#39;t die or shut off, which is why I was able to obtain footage.<n>

It seemed huge, like the size of a mini van.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Judging by the foothills in the background, it had to have been a couple thousand feet climbing to the upper atmosphere, where it gently faded into nothing.  We noticed it re- ignited about a mile east, for a minute or so, then it disappeared when commercial aircraft was near its proximity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still have the chills going through my body from seeing that..<n>

We live in a small town, and having no city lights does wonders for stargazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a very bright, twinkling “star”.  Both my husband and I have seen it before, so I watched it for a bit to make sure it was the same thing I had seen.  Both times, I noticed it was moving in odd directions, up, down, diagonal, and sometimes a sort of circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed it was not only white but flashed some blue and red, with possibly some green.  I watched it for a long time to make sure I was seeing what I thought I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went in to tell my husband and we watched it together.  My kids saw us staring at the sky and started watching and noticed the twinkling lights as well.  It was visible for a few hours and I think the clouds dimmed it out and it just faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During that time, maybe half an hour before we lost visual contact, we saw what looked like a comet or fireball in the sky.  For a split second I thought it was a shooting star, but when I thought about it, it was most definitely NOT a shooting star, way too close and very big, and the “twinkling star” was most definitely NOT a star because as far as I know, stars don’t move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot tell the shape of the object because it’s a little too far away, but it doesn&#39;t move like any craft I am aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A possible sighting of &#34;Sirius,&#34; we suspect??

Since we have an airport in our community, I suspected it was a helicopter or other air craft at first, that changed direction maybe suddenly (?) I suspected the two balls of light were the lights on either end of a plane, or either wing... or nose and tail?<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was not the case.  The two balls moved in a fashion that made me suspect the plane (or helicopter) must be spinning or about to crash... then, as the balls twisted around in mid air, the seem to be interacting with each other somehow.  (Truly having a panicky moment then, as I realized it was not a plane, and it was NOT a crashing plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two balls then skittered off, far enough apart that I knew they were not one plane, and then sped up..  Seemingly propelled by something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire thing from start to finish only too a few minutes...but the time I stopped panicking enough to think I should get out my cell for a video, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m an educated rational, sane person.<n>

It flew in front of the moon and had five straight sides with a small light at each point, and a big glowing orange light on the bottom center.  It was silent.  Then took off fast to the north until it was out of sight.<n>

I was talking to my neighbor on the phone.  I was walking east and saw a light in the sky.  The light looked orange, but  thought maybe it was just a plane and because of  the clouds appeared orange.  The closer it came, it appeared to be fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my neighbor to hurry and come outside and see what I was seeing.  I was scared for a moment, thinking it was a plane on fire about to crash.  When it went over us, it appeared to be a ball of flames.  I could actually see what appeared to be flames.  It was mostly orange, a lighter color of orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is hard to determine the shape, but if I had to choose, I would say round.  The fireball traveled to the northwest fairly quickly.  I would say was traveling faster than I see most small planes travel, and seemed to just disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The background was scattered clouds till heading towards the west where it became very cloudy.  I also heard no noise whatsoever.<n>

I was out walking my dog when I saw a group of red-orange lights in the southwest sky. There were 8 lights in the initial group moving southwest to northeast - a smaller group of 3 lights was following. The larger group started in a roughly triangular formation before re-forming into a more linear alignment - the smaller group was in a linear formation from the outset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the larger initial groups had moved on there were 3-4 individual lights moving in the same direction. All of the lights were moving quickly but I have no idea as to speed. The objects made no sudden maneuvers or turns - but they appeared to be flying a defined course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was some air traffic in the area (we are close to PHL approach) and the objects did not seem to be any higher than the 2 aircraft I saw that were on approach to PHL, so maybe 1000’ in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects traveled for about 30-45 seconds in a northeasterly direction before disappearing.  There was some patchy cloud cover but the objects were not obscured by the clouds, they just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects flickered reddish-orange, no other lights\color were observable.  There was no sound from any of the objects.  The objects appeared to be bow-tied in shape, a dark center with the red-orange lights fanning out fore and aft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at the following lat/long when I made this observation - 39°56&#39;07.2&#34;N 75°18&#39;15.9&#34;W<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reporter - 53 year old male, IT professional, I saw the entire event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Secondary observer (my brother) - 48 year old male, construction worker.

It was so loud and low that I went outside to see what was flying so low or close to my home, only to feel the rumble and hear the noises but never finding anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted about 7 minutes the first time, and the second was about 6 minutes.

Blinking in a strobe fashion and not in sync with each other, one red, one blue and one white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caught our attention at first was that it had a spot light on top of it that was shining upwards lighting up the clouds above it then went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving and tried to follow it for as long as we could. 2 people were watching it while I was looking for a place to pull over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lost sight of it behind some trees for only about 15 seconds, before we pulled over and got out of the car too look for it.  The object had completely vanished from sight, and we had a clear and open view of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers were myself, husband and daughter.<n>

It was loud enough that the sky had to be looked at to make sure a big jet, or several copters were not flying right over the homes.  There was nothing but dark clouds, with that sound lingering for about 7 minutes before it quit, as fast as it started.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, approximately 10 minutes later, it occurred again for about 5 or 6 minutes, and upon listening to the sound, searching the sky for this noise, again it was just really dark, sounding almost like the rumble of a giant train, but the weird thing was with the first time, you could feel the vibration in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an odd experience and was not a plane, jet or helicopter.  Living close to the airport, we know the sounds of those and they do not linger with that low rumbling in the sound.<n>

The lowest light moved vertically, and then we turned the car around to get a better view.  By the time we where able to see them again there was only one bright light left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around the only remaining bright light, there were tiny red blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure if there were many different objects, or if there were just a few that were quickly moving side to side.<n>

It&#39;s normally very quiet here.  On Jan 11 and 12, I heard and felt massive rumbling.  I&#39;ve lived on air force bases and this sounded like we were living at the end of the runway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Jan 11, at about 4 pm, I was outside, when this loud jet sound (like a C5) began.  It was slightly overcast and I could not see it or really determine what direction it was coming from. I actually expected a massive plane to come through the clouds and crash.  I felt the rumbling and the roar was as loud as being at the end of the runway when B-52&#39;s or C-5&#39;s are taking off.  It sounded very close. While I often hear and see aircraft flying, they are very high in the sky and cannot be heard inside my home.  This lasted 7 min or so and then just suddenly stopped.  I dismissed it as some kind of military exercise even though i don&#39;t live near a military base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Jan 12, at about 10:30 am it happened again.  This time I was inside my home and it felt like it had to be directly over the house.  I went outside but once again, it was slightly overcast and I couldn&#39;t see anything.  This lasted about 10 min and stopped suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later, I asked my husband if he had heard of any military presence in the area.  I told him what happened, and he said it could have been aircraft testing of some sort, but that he was not aware of any exercises.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today, I was browsing UFO reports for an entirely different reason and noted two reports on Jan. 11 describing the same sounds I heard on the 11th and 12th.  It never occurred to me that this noise was unidentified...<n>

Ran back in to grab better camera.  I turned camera on and the object just went black, just a black floating ball.  Then it was gone!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came in and painted a picture of what it looked like.  It was too high to be a balloon, and it was almost dark.<n>

Today started with a NOISE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 5:13 this morning, I woke up...and I heard it right away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A deep, droning sound...more than just a HUM...and with a “mechanical” quality to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listened to it for a couple minutes, then got up to go to the bathroom...giggled to myself, thinking I was just hearing my bladder rumble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No, that wasn&#39;t it...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could hear it in the bathroom...<n> <n><n> <n><n> And all throughout the house !!  After leaving the loo, I went into every room, and looked out the windows, and UP.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the sky was very overcast, and I couldn&#39;t see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As much as I wanted to go outside and look, there was “something” that told me not to do so...this morning was not a cool time to do so...and I have to admit, the sound was a bit eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most intense aspect of it was NOT just the noise itself...but HOW it seemed to be...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way I can described it would be that it seemed to “encapsulate” our house...as if a bowl had been put over us, upside down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And yes, to me, this noise was LOUD...quite a bit louder than the HUM I regularly hear when I really listen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I went back to bed, and lay still and listened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the while this was happening, the cats were glued to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not freaking out and running around the house, but trying to stay as close to me as they could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And when I came back to bed, and lay on my right side, 3 of them lay on the top of my left side...3 more lay right next to me as close as they could get...and several more were on the dressers  After about 45 minutes more, it stopped...as if someone had flipped a switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t “fade away”...it was just suddenly GONE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The silence was very intense...made the hairs on my arms and neck stand on end...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several of the cats came slowly over to the bedroom window to look out...and yes, they looked UP.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And for the life of me, I could NOT get back to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband, ((name deleted)), woke up to go to the bathroom around 8AM, and I asked him if he had any weird dreams or such...he said NO, but felt that the house was creepily quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And no, I did NOT wake him up during the NOISE...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had wanted to, but couldn&#39;t figure out HOW to do so without planting the suggestion of “hearing something weird” in his head...THAT would have affected his experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So now I must investigate this, to see if anyone has reported such an experience to MUFON and NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything I learn, I will write down, for my own records.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If anyone in the Orlando area was witness to the sound, we would like to invite them to submit a written report, to supplement the report above.

It couldn&#39;t have been a plane, as he&#39;s very familiar with planes, and was certain it was not a plane.

An orange-red, fire-like, or glowing, orb came from the north over the tree line, and then over our house, and continued towards Lake Superior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both could tell it was low in the sky because we had ran outside to watch.  He described it like he thought it was a drone, but it was too glowy, fast, and noise-less to be a drone, we agreed afterwards.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the thing as it got farther away and it stopped and slowly faded, but did not disappear.  It then started to blink green and red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the shock of first seeing this thing come over us, we saw 2 other odd objects in the sky.  It was a very large triangle formation they had all made and all 3 were doing the same blinking.  One was way to the northeast; the one we saw flying was souteast, and a third almost directly east, but higher in the sky to make the tip of the triangle....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after watching and then noticing the formation, a plane began approaching, and looked to be heading directly for it, but ended up below/south, but kept going past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

1/10/15 19:30|Freeland|MD|Triangle|10 seconds|Three lights that looked like stars in perfect triangular formation, moving very slowly, then fading away simultaneously|1/16/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116724.html|330|ndxe201501| Three lights that looked like stars in perfect triangular formation, moving very slowly, then fading away simultaneously<n> <n><n> <n><n> After parking in my driveway at around 7:30 PM on 1/10/15, when I stepped out onto the driveway I happened to look up at the stars.  It was extremely clear and very cold (around 15 degrees).  The stars were very bright.  I was looking to the southeast, and just below a familiar, sideways V-shaped formation of stars I saw three stars of equal brightness forming a perfect equilateral triangle.  They caught my eye and within a second or two I realized they were moving.  I had to stare very hard at them to be sure they were in fact moving because they were moving so slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I was certain of this, they began to fade away.  I would guess that between 5-10 seconds had elapsed when they began to fade out. It was like someone turned them off with a dimmer switch.  They just faded out perfectly synchronously and were gone in about two seconds.  I continued to stare at that area of the sky for about five minutes, but saw nothing else.  It all happened so fast, and my! eyes were still adjusting to looking at the dark of the sky, so I cannot say whether there was a form connecting the lights, though I did not see any stars within the triangular area encompassed by these three lights. They were the brightness of the average star until they faded.  Then there was nothing but the night sky.  I have no idea of any distance to whatever I saw. It could have been 100 feet from me, or miles away.  This is the first time I have ever been unable to easily verify something I have seen in the sky.  The lights weren’t blinking.  They were like the cold white light of starlight.  I see aircraft in the sky every night and they do not fade away, plus their lights blink and they usually have red and white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for my background, I am a Systems Programmer/Analyst.  I am 50 years old. I have a wife, 2 teenage children, 2 cats and 3 dogs.  The dogs force me to be out in my yard a lot at night, so I am always staring at the stars and planets when the sky is clear.<n>

I&#39;ve never seen anything like it in person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my daughter to the mall shopping for her birthday coming up.  As we were leaving, my daughter pointed out a light in the sky and said, &#34;Hey mom, what is that?&#34;  Let it be known, I have never seen a UFO, though I have studied the phenomenon in depth.  My children are teens and are aware of this too.  We are always skywatching when we are out and about but don&#39;t take time out of our day to do this.   I&#39;m always looking up due to what I know has been occurring around the world in increased frequency.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, it was far enough away to not be able to make out a true shape but very large.  It was not a star, it was not an airplane, it was not a tower, airport, anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a huge skeptic so I went through all of the possibilities internally...nothing fit.  There was a smaller light that seem to be fading in and out and zooming into the craft and away again.  We decided to follow it.  It was only hovering at first but then it began to move slowly away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally found a dark road and have two pieces of footage.  The craft was further away from us at this point and began to change colors from green, red, blue.  The little light (possible craft) was still going away from it and going back in to it but at this point it was so far away it could have been a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the mall, it was pretty clear and large.  Well clear enough to know it wasn&#39;t a star, satellite, or anything remotely close to what I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky on earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hovering again on the second footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to have this footage analyzed.  How can I get someone to do this?  I want to know what this was?<n>

(N-S).  I noticed a flash in the corner of my eye and looked and there was nothing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I glanced back up at the satiltes and when i looked back over where i saw the flash there were 2 brigh lights sitting vertical.  They began moving South and began to climb and started to roll and tumble faster and faster as it fell deeper into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When i lost site of the lights there was a blue flood light came on for about 2 seconds and went out and repeated a 2 second blue light.  I could see a craft moving North.  Only for that blue light i wouldn&#39;t have see it.  It was higher than jetliners fly yet the light were right in front of me.<n>

In the Northern sky (North of my vantage point), I noticed a light moving from West to East.  It was bluish to green in color.  The strange thing was that it had 3 plumes coming out of it.  One plume was directly behind it and two others were coming almost straight out the sides.  It was very bright and easily noticeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following behind the first were three more.  They were single lights, almost as bright, but smaller and yellow colored.  There were no plumes on these lights.  All 4 lights were following a same flight pattern, but far enough apart that there is no way it could have been a single aircraft.  The first (plumed), third and fourth lights were in a direct line.  The second light was higher in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited for 5 more minutes after they disappeared into the horizon to listen for possible delayed jet engine noise and there wasn’t any noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever this! was there is no doubt that all 4 lights were flying in unison on the same flight pattern all the way across the sky.<n>

At first I thought I was looking at stars until I noticed it was moving.   Then, I could tell that it was much much closer than any stars could be.  It was much closer than an airplane would fly.<n>

The other one was a bit smaller and was mostly a red flashing light.  Both hovered together for about 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like they were flashing lights at each other.  I am 100% sure they were not planes.  Neither one ever came closer or seemed to fly in any direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15 minutes of my observation, the brighter one, on the left, slowly started to distance itself from the one on the right.

1/9/15 19:00|Torrington|CT|Triangle|40 seconds|Wow, I finally saw one of those triangular objects.|1/16/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116618.html|354|ndxe201501| Wow, I finally saw one of those triangular objects<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am one of those persons who has seen UFOs numerous times.  I have literally seen UFOs probably at least a dozen times, but I had never seen one of these triangular objects until last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a 2nd floor apartment that faces east toward Hartford.  I get a nice unobstructed view of the sky and I constantly see planes coming from Bradley Airport about 20 miles away, or I see planes going in for a landing there.  So, I am VERY familiar with airliners. But tonight I just happened to look out and saw this BEAUTIFUL perfect triangle object.  It had many very bright white lights on it and was flying very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know how high it was, maybe 3-5000 feet at most.  It looked quite large, I got the impression it was probably twice the size of an average airliner.  I wish I would have had time to count the lights, but I am sure I saw probably 7 or 8 large white lights, and one very small blinking red light near the center.  But the entire craft was outlined by the white lights and was a perfect equilateral triangle 60/60/60.  It was really a very pretty sight.  It seemed to be going quite slow, much slower than the airliners I see every night.  If I had to guess, I would say it was going maybe 200 mph at most.  It was flying from northeast toward the southeast, which is the regular path many planes from Bradley follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I was only able to see it for about 10 seconds before it flew over my building, but I had time to put on a coat, grab a pair of binoculars and run downstairs which probably took about 15-20 seconds.  It was going so slow that it was still there and I got to look at it for about another 15 seconds before it went behind another building and I lost sight of it.  I am not completely sure, but I think I MIGHT have heard it, if so, it sounded like a normal airliner, but I might have been hearing another plane that I saw in the same part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s it, very simple sighting, but a very beautiful object.  It was probably one of ours, but I don&#39;t care, I have always wanted to see one of these triangular objects, and now I have.<n>
1/9/15 19:00|Torrington|CT|Triangle|40 seconds|Addendum to earlier report made on 01/09/15|1/26/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116814.html|355|ndxe201501| Addendum to earlier report made on 01/09/15<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is simply an addition or addendum to a report I made several days ago, I believe it was for 01/09/15.  After I filed the report I realized I made a mistake.  The craft was travelling from the northeast toward the southwest.  I believe I mistakenly wrote the southeast. That is error, it was going toward the southwest.  This is a very regular route for the many planes I see coming from Bradley Field in Hartford, so this might have been some sort of commercial or military craft, but it was quite spectacular and unlike anything I have ever seen, and I grew up around airbases, as my father was a aircraft radar technician by trade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also including a drawing I made in Paint. It will be obvious I am no artist, but it will give the rough idea.  I could not actually see any body to this craft, just the very bright and very beautiful lights.  Only the red light blinked, all other lights were steady.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> So here goes.  My wife and I were sitting in our backyard in the Jacuzzi (as we do every night) watching the planes come in to land at LAX.  Have lived here for 18 years and sit outside at night often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, she was talking to me and I was staring up at the sky cause I saw a bright light that didn&#39;t look familiar and it was moving slow, going away from us, stopping on a dime and then slowly coming back.  Its flight pattern was irregular.  I thought perhaps it was a helicopter (I am a helicopter pilot) doing a circular holding pattern over a traffic accident as sometime they do.  The only thing that didn&#39;t make sense was how bright it was and not being able to see any flashing lights...at least not yet.  And then of course how it was moving.  It was southeast of our house and proceeded to move all over the sky.  Not super-fast, but faster than anything else at that altitude which is what also made it stand out.  So I jumped out of the Jacuzzi (we had been watching it for about 2 minutes by then) and I ran in and grabbed my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point it looked like it turned (without moving in the sky) and we saw red blinking or flashing lights for about 5 seconds.  It moved all over the sky in a random fashion. It was not a helicopter or plane.  I went on a site and tracked the aircraft in the areas at around 6:45-6:55 pm and did not see any helicopters.  Of course with all UFO video, sometimes it is hard to see what is going on.  I backed out on one of the videos so you could see the palm trees in my back yard as a reference for how it was moving.  There are street lights in the picture, but I think you will get a good picture from the video.  It went beyond the horizon of our backyard and that&#39;s when we lost it.  Could it have been a drone?  Sure, but since I don&#39;t know what drones with lights look like and have never in all the time I have lived here seen what I saw last night, I decided to report it to you guys based on the recommendation of a friend that is familiar with ya and after he had seen the videos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They are on my facebook.   ((address deleted))  There are two of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Glad I could help in any way.  Not saying it was extraterrestrial, just that I have never seen anything like that.  You will see a jet coming into land at LAX and I wondered if they saw it.<n>

Temperature was around 10 degrees and sky was very clear and stars were very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I passed the new water tower and I looked out the drive side window &amp;lt;to my left&amp;gt;. I noticed a Very bright orange sphere in the distance.  The sphere was about 30 degrees above the ground to my left.  I would feel comfortable stating the object was miles away at least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept glancing over at the object as I was approaching the last 2 corners on the road before the straight away into the Town of Woodson.  I looked away from the object and had to watch the road since there was a oncoming vehicle coming around the first corner at Walsh Road.  The road jogs north for about 1/4 to 1/2 mile, then turns back west into Woodson.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I came around the 2nd corner into the straight stretch to Woodson, I glanced over to the south again and saw the original object still approximately at the same location.  However, I also saw a second object, much closer, and slightly lower, traveling east thru the empty corm field.  I would put that object at 1/2 mile south of the roadway, approx. 150-200 feet off the ground.  It was also a solid orange sphere.  It was visibly moving East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it It looked to 2/3rds of the way down the straight stretch towards Woodson from the corner I had just rounded.  I was traveling at 55 mph to start and noticed it was moving east at a decent speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down to about 30mph while watching it, and confirmed that it was moving east, and it passsed between my vehicle and the distant orange object.  It was at a lower angle and closer to the ground than the distant one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sped back up to 55, and entered Woodson, crossing the train tracks, and continuing to the highway towards Jacksonville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just prior to leaving home, I was visiting and my vehicle was warming up.  I had been looking at the sky looking for the new comet that would have been just past Orion&#39;s Belt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time, I did not see anything unusual in the sky or in the western sky.  I am very familiar with star gazing, astronomy, and Chinese lanterns.  I can confirm these were not meteors.  These were not Iridium Flares.  These were not the space station.  I can confirm these were not lanterns.  They were solid orange, no flickering, perfectly round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not take any pictures of the objects.  Without a tripod and time exposure, or a very high ISO camera, it would have been moot to even attempt a photo.<n>

1/9/15 17:00|Seal Beach|CA|Unknown|8-10 minute|Mystery light visible from Seal Beach, CA.|1/16/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116672.html|360|ndxe201501| Mystery light visible from Seal Beach, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of January 9th, 2015, I was at the pier in Seal Beach, CA, specifically to observe the conjunction of Venus and Mercury, visible to the west as the sun set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was parking my car on the street adjacent to the pier, I looked to the west to see if I could make out the conjunction, and I was surprised to see both Venus and what I thought was Mercury in the western sky.  I was surprised by the brightness of “Mercury”, as I had witnessed the conjunction the previous evening, and Mercury was very small and dim compared to Venus, while on this occasion it appeared at least the same visible magnitude as Venus in the evening sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I parked and grabbed my binoculars, having brought a good pair of lenses with me to view the planets.  This was approx. 1700 as the sun, I believe, had not yet fully set.  I picked a good spot to stop and bring up my binoculars in a little park at the base of the pier. Looking through the lenses, I was shocked to see Venus, Mercury looking small and dim below and to the right of Venus, and in the same line formed by Venus and Mercury, another object that I perceived as another planet, below and to the right of Mercury. It was this object that I initially mistook for Mercury while driving up to the pier.  Looking through the binoculars, it looked very much like a planet under magnification, revealing what, to me, looked like a planetary disk and having a distinct, yellowish color.  The size of the disk and the yellowish color put in my mind that I was looking at Jupiter, which really baffled me as Jupiter was not suppose to be there!<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was trying to figure out what planet this was, I noticed that it was not in the same place as it was when I first started observing the three objects (2 planets and this whatever-it-was). In the approx. 3 or 4 minutes that I had been looking at it, it had moved directly under Venus, from my perspective!  It did not change in elevation, but just moved to the left.  The movement was very slow, I could not perceive it moving by looking at it, only by looking away and then looking back, and using Venus and Mercury as reference points, could I see that it was indeed moving.  As it moved to the left, it became more orange and started approaching red when, after moving well to the left of Venus, it started an upward and to the left movement, again at the same, almost glacial speed.  By this time the sun had set, and although Venus and Mercury were becoming brighter and brighter in the darkening sky, this object was becoming dimer and whiter, having gone from almost red when it started its upward motion to orange to yellow and finally to white, at which time it finally disappeared from my view (by the time it turned white, it was only visible in my binoculars). I would say that the time frame that I observed it was approx. 8 to 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been around aviation all my life, and have owned a telescope since I was just a kid, and I have never seen anything like this object before.  It was definitely not an aircraft, as it had no anti-collision lights, navigation lights, or any type of beacon.  Blimps and drones also operate in the area, I have observed plenty of those, as well, and I can say that it was neither.  A balloon?  Possibly, but unlike any balloon I have ever seen, changing color the way it did and shining with at least the same visible magnitude as Venus before the sun fully set.  I would way the it was spherical, but cannot be 100% certain of that as I only perceived it as a disk.  Conditions at the time were relatively clear, with a slight haze over the ocean and twilight lighting.  This did all take place over the ocean in the direction of Catalina Island.<n>

I was driving my truck on a dirt road, about a mile from home, and nearing a t-intersection where I would make a left turn near my neighbor&#39;s property.  The area is rural, consisting of farm fields, ponds and forest.  It is 4 miles east of the small community of Garfield and about 15 miles from any town, and not on a state route.  I have lived at this place for 7 years and am familiar with the topography and structures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned onto the dirt road which itself is about one mile in length, I saw 6 bright orange lights that were oval in shape.  They were arrayed in 2 groups of 3 with a wider gap between the 2 groups of 3.  They were in perfect alignment, as if they were affixed to an object, the lights were steady and did not flicker or change in intensity nor did they move in relation to each other or in space.  They were amazingly bright, yet did not hurt my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was talking on my cell phone with my employer, at the time, and told him what I was seeing.  I drove slowly as I approached the paved road, knowing that the direction would give me a better view, but the lights disappeared in unison before I made my turn.  Because of the trees blocking my view for a moment, I did not see the object (or objects)go away, so I do not know if it moved or went dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting followed the same type of sighting a few weeks earlier and at the other end of the county by the logging crew that I haul for, they had all stopped work after dark one evening and as a group watched the same type of phenomenon, as did two others I know that have seen the same in the Swainsboro, Emanuel County, are over recent weeks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was after dark, and I could not see a solid object, nor judge the size and distance, but, I knew that it was immense, based on the are it spanned in relation to the are.<n>

They were in a horizontal line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights alternated blinking, however it was clear that there were 2 sets of 3 lights.  They were bright, round and yellow.

As we did, the 3 lights on the right side each took a turn lighting up seperately, only to never re-light.  Then the one on the left followed suit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was completely clear and empty.  No clouds.  Just stars in the distance.  No noise.  It just complelty disappeared.  Or seemed to.<n>

I and a co-worker who is our company&#39;s safety officer were driving south bound on I-465 at, or around, mile marker 43, when we both saw an intense flash of light at the horizon line that looked to be no more then 300 meters ahead of us.  We saw two flashes, and brake lights were everywhere on the freeway at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My passenger and I thought it was a transformer that blew, or some massive electrical issue with the power lines, but once we got to where we thought we could see the flashes coming from, there was no sign of any power outage.  It was very peculiar.  Two very intense flashes of light that resembled balls of electricity.<n>

There was a ring of lightly colored clouds that covered the horizon, in all directions.  When we looked up it was like a giant circle of black (like the world had turned into a dome shaped skylight), and there were three lights in the sky, dispersed to where I thought I was seeing the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked to the south, there was a gap in the clouds, which was a very lightly colored sky, as though the sun was still setting.  When I looked back up at the black, I started to notice, I couldn&#39;t tell if it was really clouds or not.  It didn&#39;t look right.  Then I noticed the brightest of the three lights (mentioned earlier) was actually moving, with a lesser bright light slowly tailing behind it.  The brightest light seemed to split up into two bright lights for short instances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two lights were moving south, but the further they went it seemed as though they weren&#39;t moving! at all, despite the speed at which they were moving.  I stuck my finger exactly where I saw the brightest one last (making sure I wasn&#39;t seeing stars) and sure enough they were moving.  But, they still seemed to be going nowhere.  About the time I confirmed they were moving I noticed the third star disappeared and several little lights dashed and flashed all over the sky.  At one point one little bouncing light dotted the outline of a square.  I think there was thirteen of them, maybe more.  This went on for a while and I noticed the clouds coming from the horizon stretching all the way across the sky. (It took about three minutes to occur) the clouds stretch across like ribbons laid out side by side.  It looked like the lighst were pulling the clouds in, it wasn&#39;t natural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next thing I noticed was the brightest light and the little light tailing it had finally made some distance.  It went from directly overhead to west over the house.  I was soon able to make out the shape of the brightest star, a triangle with a little red pulsing light in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It and the little light ducked in and out of the clouds (Six minutes after the clouds appeared, the sky was covered by clouds), and the lights soon disappeared.  Still after the two lights left the flashing, ducking, and dashing lights still remained and later ceased.<n>

Right before I came into the town of Concord, I notice movement in my peripheral vision, to my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly slowed down and pulled to the side of the road.  For a split second I thought I was seeing fireworks, because the light was rising over the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I next expected to see it burst into a pretty display.  But I quickly realized the orb of golden light I was seeing were no longer in motion.  It appeared that the one golden orb, quickly split into three, spaced a short distance apart.  That quickly became 6 orbs, 3 in each group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were in a line completely even with each other, but hovering over the tree tops.  It was dark out, so the lights were very bright, but not extremely large.  Then they disappeared as quickly as they had formed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an outdoor photographer, and have never seen anything like this in my life.  I have driven this road everyday for over 5 years, and sporadically before ! that for over 15 more.  I still can&#39;t process what I saw.  I have told a few people and they suggest that maybe it was a drone, seems those have become so popular lately.  But the lights were spaced at least the distance of a midsized car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am at a loss, and have no explanation for what I saw, so I figured I would report it to you hoping someone else saw something similar.<n>

I was having a cigarette scanning the sky looking in the eastern sky. I saw something at about 45 degree in the falling towards earth at a very sharp angle, like if it was the hands of a clock, it would be facing seven o clock. It was traveling incredibly slow.  So slow, that I didn&#39;t know whether this was a contrail from an earlier plane or whether it was moving.  I had to use the telephone wire as a reference marker to make sure it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I realized it wasn&#39;t a contrail, a plane flew near it, on its own trajectory, giving me an immediate reference to the movement of planes.  As it started falling past the tree limbs it did something really funny.  It seemed to have compressed, almost like an accordion into itself and seemed just hover in the sky.  Watching this sent chills down my spine because it&#39;s movement was one I have never encountered in my life.  It wasn&#39;t a meteor because the speed was too slow.  Nothing could just fall from the sky at the rate it was falling.  The velocity was just too slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And it wasn&#39;t a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a video, buts it&#39;s poor in quality, but I did take a few photos that didn&#39;t turn out so badly.

My brother was speeding away and I was the one watching it but stopped watching because I was so scared.<n>

We decided to drive around to get a better view of it over the treetops and witnessed what looked like a triangular light pattern -- one very large, very bright amber light in the nose and a smaller flashing light on each wingtip and center which stayed illuminated but strobed brighter in order from left to right.  It passed in the opposite direction of our car.  Because it was so far away we could not make out any structure.  The large light was unlike anything we had seen in the sky before in terms of its size and brightness.  Once it was out of view we continued to the gas station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the way back to the house we saw the object again, hovering back close to its original position.  It was much closer and we turned into a neighborhood to get a good look:  The object was very close.  I would compare it to watching a plane in take-off pass overhead in terms of its distance.  As we pulled into the neighborhood it stopped hovering and began moving -- drifting might be a more fitting verb -- across the sky towards us.  We parked the car and got out as the object passed directly overhead.  As it did we both witnessed the solid black outline of an equilateral diamond:  a small white running light in the center and at each tip with an over-sized, amber-colored seemingly directional (forward to forward-down) light at its nose and a significantly dimmer light on its tail.  The three lights from wingtip to wingtip constantly strobed in a left-to-right direction as it moved away from us.   The object was silent as it passed over and disappeared behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We jumped back into our car to try and get a better angle to continue watching it but as we circled the woods which it had passed over it was nowhere in sight -- until we happened to catch the faint strobe of the object now a great distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove to my girlfriend&#39;s parents&#39; house and watched this object glide back and forth across the sky at a great distance -- like a commercial plane at altitude --silently for over an hour.   At one point her mother came outside to watch it pass at about 45 degrees above the horizon close enough to make out the triangular front of the object.  We kept noticing that it seemed to pass in a straight line until we could not see it anymore and then begin its trajectory again from where it started -- but we never saw it fly back.  We assumed that we simply missed its return path.  Finally we watched one disappear not behind trees but simply into the distance and made sure to watch for its return.  It never flew back.  Suddenly it was once again close and over our left shoulders.  We were in disbelief that it could have 1) flown back to this position with such speed and 2) have done so without us noticing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tracked the object as it passed about 60 degrees above the horizon when suddenly we noticed a second, identical object flying towards us from a great distance.  We continued watching these two objects pass back across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total sighting lasted from 9:20pm to 10:45pm, which is to say that at 10:45pm I finally came inside out of the frigid cold to write this report.<n>

A red glowing object flew directly over my car.  I thought that it was a meteorite because of the brightness and the way that it seemed to blur as it moved across the sky flying directly southbound along highway 101.  I was driving at a speed of 50 miles per hour and I assumed that it would burn out seconds after I saw it, but it did not, it continued on, in a straight trajectory, not losing any altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thought that I had was that it was going as fast as a missile and, living in Oceanside, Ca near Camp Pendleton, it may have come from there.  My confusion turned to concern, knowing that it had no other flashing lights like the jets that land at Carlsbad Airport or the commercial jets that fly southbound along the coast over the ocean.  The only other aircrafts that fly along the coast above the land are the police helicopters that fly over head at times, but mostly over the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued following it down the coast, rarely taking my eyes off of it so as to keep my car on the road.  The light was very bright at first, like a meteorite, bigger that Venus when you can see it on a clear night and it’s closest to the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had kept my eyes on it for about 2 minutes when I saw that it had seemed to be flying over the Sea World tower, approximately 30 miles away.  I had reached Leucadia, Ca, and couldn’t see past the cliffs at this point, but at my last view it had traveled far enough so the light was just a speck in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my approximations, the light was about 1000 feet from the ground and traveling at a speed faster than the F15s from Miramar Air Force Base. 30 miles in 2 minutes would equal about 900 miles per hour.<n>

Hopefully, you will be able to follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at the clouds about 20 minutes ago 1:31 PM 1-7-15 and saw what looked like a light in the sky.  The clouds were bright, but the light looked like something reflecting the sun.  So of course I tried to zoom in. and I did.  See the next picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is this?  At first it was not moving, then it was. now I cannot see it.  I saw a tiny point of light in the sky above the clouds, and zoomed in like when I take pictures of the moon.  120 times.  Then, I opened the picture in paint and zoomed in to see it better.  No photoshop.  I wish I knew what is was.  It was still then moving to the left, and after a few minutes I could not see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can&#39;t see it in the cloud picture, too far, but look at the middle of the picture, move to the right to the denser piece of cloud, it was right above that when I first saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi, can you look again at the pictures of the thing in the sky?  I am asking for everyone to repost it- someone out there may know what it is.  These are high clouds, a few planes flew by while I was watching the bright object--they were much lower and way faster.  This viewing lasted a few minutes, not seconds.<n>

It was illuminating a cloud and appeared like a spot light shining up there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned around and went back in the house to tell my husband to come out and see this thing.  When I came back out and looked again, whatever it was had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t the moon, wrong area of the sky, and it wasn&#39;t a street light, too high in the sky, and it wasn&#39;t a spotlight, since we live out in the country.  To tell you the truth, I can&#39;t even describe the shape other than it was round-like and bright white.<n>

(The noise was not as smooth as a jet, and it was much louder.) He ran out and called to me.  I went outside, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We couldn&#39;t see anything at first. Then, to the northwest and moving in that direction, we saw two pulsing white lights arranged vertically with a lot of space between them. My husband said there were a lot of smaller red lights all around them.  (My night vision isn&#39;t too good.)  They were moving as if in a formation, but it wasn&#39;t an orderly formation.  It almost seemed like it was one huge vehicle, because all the lights were moving as one.  It would have been a massive vehicle, and indeed, it sounded huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the neighborhood dogs were barking loudly when this came over.<n>

During the same time each night, these objects it seems turn multi color light on which are blue, green, and red and it zig zags and dances around.  There is one red light that is on top of all of these objects and looking through a telescope and binoculars it would seem that these so called stars are in our airspace.  If its a clear night I can show anyone who would like to see them.  The best time is between 7:00-8:45 PM is when the lights are on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I&#39;ve been watching these objects every night since 11/16/08.  On 11/22/08 a News 10 Sacramento helicopter was covering a high school foot game and try to get close to one of these objects and it got further and further away from the helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was since explained a few days later that it was an airplane with lights doing advertising which is not the case.  I went online and the video of the helicopter chasing this object has been removed from every site it was on and only a still picture of what they chased is there.<n>

I look to my right, and see TWO bright lights (one flying object).  We think nothing of it at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I follow it with my eyes and see it start to speed up.  It begins to go so fast that I am now looking at it straight on as we proceed to go East on National.  It begins to proceed to the left, but then it stops midair.  The object then begins to start heading right.  That is when we decide to follow it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then starts to go left again.  We thought, maybe this was a helicopter, but then, logically thinking, a helicopter would not have been going that fast.  As the object proceeds going left, it starts to go downward, then back up, then down again behind a building.  And that was the last we saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please do not take this as a joke, we truly believe we witnessed a UFO tonight.<n>

I had trouble getting focused while I was driving and while I was in the process of trying to get focused, the bottom light started to move rapidly away from triangle shape it was positioned in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after it moved pretty far across the sky, I vanished in the air.<n>

I was looking out my open window towards the east.  It appeared to be very very high in the sky it was long and silver bright and moved at a steady rate toward what looked to be SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very very clear sky&#39;s and not a cloud in site with very bright blue sky&#39;s.  It appeared as if the sun from the west was shining very bright on the object.  This is a pretty windy day so it could just be a silver balloon.  The object did not turn or shift it just seemed to dissolve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live with in about a few miles of a airport and have planes and other aircraft fly directly over my house, so close I can read and see which airline the plane is from.  I have lived here my entire life, im 26 years old so I know aircraft very well and their paths of flight. This object made no noise at all.  Whenever I see a very high up plane that flies by and the sound does not hit my ears till later due to ai! rcraft speed and hight the object I saw had no sound ever.

Spouse comes in from the back patio and a little excited tells me he saw an object moving pretty low from the north across the sky over the recently cleared property behind our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s his description:  A big ball of fire with ropes moving in the wind and hanging down with balls of fire!  First thought was: meteor.  No, maybe a weather balloon on fire and falling?  We live very close to the big intercontinental airport and there were lots of aircraft landing at the time; they are low and you can see the entire plane with blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I go to the front yard facing south.  I see a glowing red object like it was on fire and in the same flight path as the first object which spouse saw flying north to south.  About 2 to 4 minutes later I saw the third object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were not the average aircraft like I saw flying to land at the airport.  These objects were not on a path to land like the other aircraft.  The 3 objects all followed the same path and same speed.  These objects were not ordinary but appeared strange.  Pics on my I phone were blurry.  Thought about the Bible stories of the &#39;chariots of fire&#39;.  No idea what they were.  Anyone else see them?   My digital panel on the back of my stove has been out for several weeks and several hours after incident the digital clock on the panel was working.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband has worked in construction for about 40 years and is in supervision. I am a homemaker and we have raised 3 children and we have 6 grandchldren.  We have been married 40 years and are both in our late 50&#39;s.  We are Christians and I really don&#39;t believe in extra terrestrials.  I have never seen anything like this before!<n>

Spotted a single light in the north sky and remarked on it - she said it was airplane.  I said that glows different and there are no green and red lights marking lights - just a orange glow, unlike airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched as 2 more joined it, and I said &#34;getting camera&#34;, ran inside, came out and she said there is a 4th light, I started filming as we talked, but only seemed to capture street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other 3 lights seemed to start to go up into the low clouds after 5 minutes or so, as the first light started flickering as it appeared to disappear into the low clouds as well about a minute after the other 3 lights vanished.  No sound heard by either of us.<n>

My boyfriend was the first to notice the first one.  It was red in color with bits of green.  So where the others, and they varied in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They came from the north traveling southwards.  It seemed like the other ones where following the first ones?  Then they hovered in the sky for a moment, then slowly one by one they dissipated into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what they where, I am hoping they where lanterns or something.  I really so not even believe in this stuff.  I mean, I do believe that there are other planets they may have life on them, but I never believed in the whole UFO/alien thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just moved here about 6 months or so ago.  I never seen anything like this. I don&#39;t know what else to put.  I am just really freaked out.  Even my cat, ((name deleted)), was freaking out.  I don&#39;t know what to think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to video record it, but I don&#39;t think it worked.  I think the only thing showing up is the street lights below?<n>

It goes on for awhile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But after ten minutes we left that area and drove off to another location.

From my back porch I immediately observed approximately ten red/orange objects or balls of light hovering in the sky.  The flight path of the objects appeared to be traveling from a Southward to a Northward direction.  The objects did not appear to produce any sound.  I would estimate the objects distance to be approximately five miles from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Northern most three or four objects of the group of ten objects made a 90-degree turn to the East, with the rest of the group following what appeared to be the exact same flight path.  As the last of the group executed the 90-degree turn, approximately three minutes had passed, I noticed a second group of approximately fourteen to fifteen more objects following what appeared to be the exact same flight path as the first group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, I had walked down the steps from my porch to get a better vantage point to capture the event on my phone camera.  I watched in utter amazement as the objects traveled at what appeared to be a slow rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event lasted approximately eight to ten minutes.  I could not be exact as to the time as I was somewhat excited over the spectacular light show and the precision of the flight path of the group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the precision of the 90-degree turn, and the absence of engine sounds, I do not believe the objects to have been fixed or rotor winged aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions at the time were very light clouds with a high ceiling and zero wind.  The wind direction and speed was verified by the lead meteorologist at the Shreveport, LA, National Weather Service, KSLA-TV in Shreveport, and Weather Bug Station in Mt. Pleasant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be exceptionally sincere, and serious-minded, in his description of the objects.  He does not believe the objects could have been so-called &#34;Chinese&#34; lanterns, or sky lanterns.  PD))<n>

There is a landing zone a block East from our home where medical emergency helicopters land so it&#39;s not unusual for us to hear or see them as they tend to fly over our home.  I did not hear anything so she told me to step outside and look in the sky and see if what she was looking at was helicopters or if I could hear any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon stepping off my back porch I immediately saw red lights in the Southwest sky that were traveling Northwest in a line of succession and getting brighter as they got closer to our area.  As they each got to a certain point in the sky they started getting dimmer, appearing to head East, then the lights succinctly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not count the number of lights I saw, but I would say I saw more than a dozen.<n>

The light had a star-like appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light seemed to move erratically, in small jumps with components perpendicular to the direction of general motion, which was north to south.  It almost seemed as if the flashes were confined to a small area around the apparent center of motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flashes got to about 25 degrees above the SSE horizon, and then swung back towards a generally northerly direction, moving with the same erratic motion.  When the flashes got to the northern part of the sky, the apparent source suddenly accelerated and disappeared in a northerly direction.<n>

In the night sky there were 6 to 8 ORBS reddish in color moving silently to the NNW. the were over the Tucson mid-town area.  Davis Monthan AFB is in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought at first it was the Pima County Patrol aircraft (a turbo prop). However it was all red ORBS not red and green NAV lights nor did they blink.  Also, the Sherriff&#39;s aircraft has white strobes anti-collision markers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved NNW then without a stop, retraced its path.  In a few more seconds it started straight UP.  It was a steady glide at no &#34;Super sonic Speeds&#34; just a fast rate until it was undiscernible from the stars.  It was a New or full moon and there was a reddish star or planet at the moon&#39;s 8 o&#39;clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to make my own investigation and am not convinced that a &#34;Drone Octicopter: was the object, because the ORBS didn&#39;t have border &#34;FUZZ&#34; as the lights in my area have, ie: stop lights, aircraft &amp; tower markers.  Furthermore, the SCALES would not support a toy aircrafts size.

I pretty much paid no attention and figured it to be the usual aircraft with blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a moment I spotted another bright reddish light object below and to the left of the first one just above the horizon and continuing to follow the first object horizontally and the straight up into the sky.  I pulled the car over and observed them both for a few minutes the first one then accelerated a bit and went straight up, thru, into and above the clouds..  I could see it all the way with light of the full moon above.  The second object followed the first one&#39;s course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I picked up my cellphone from the back seat and tried to figure out who to call..shaking like a madman..I then left the phone, went to the front of the car and 2 more objects appeared from behind a foreground hill like mound and they proceeded in a due line across and just above the horizon from the  left to right.  At this time..with no luck..  I was pointing at the objects and trying to get vehicles passing to stop and observe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third object followed the other 2 into the clouds and he last one I watched as it slowed to a complete stop and dimmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 4 of the red fireballs were moving on a Northeast to Northwest heading.. No sound, No smell, it was 17 F degree according to my car gauge..the night was clear and still below the cloud ceiling.  The objects were 1/10th to quarter mile away and were the size of a nickel held in hand at arm&#39;s length.  All of them were bright red/whitish in color with flame like streamers steamimg from the top and they had a revolving lighter red outer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked with the local TV  and newspaper media and no one else reported them,,as far as I know I am the only witness to the sighting.

I sat in my chair and looked out to see if there were any fireworks because I could hear them going off all around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next thing I knew I saw two Orange fireball objects coming over some tall trees.  At first I thought they were fireworks and then some kind of rockets until they curved to the left.  I wondered if they were some kind of helicopters but I listened but there wasn&#39;t any sound at all.  They were moving very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then yelled out to my daughter who was right inside &#34;Come here.  Hurry, you have to see this!&#34;   My daughter came running and she saw the objects.  Next thing we know there were three lights behind it.  I said whatever it is, they are flying in a triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then two more orange objects came over the trees one at a time.  By this time we were out in the backyard looking up.  It was very cloudy almost a fog outside!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects didn&#39;t fly in a straight line, but curved several times so we got to see them at different angles.  Still no sound!<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they flee to the closest point to us we could see the large triangle object was a solid object with lights a each point of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched until the lights disappeared into clouds.  The objects were flying low end o ugh that there should have been some sound but there wasn&#39;t.  There had to have been other witnesses because with it being New Years Eve a lot of people were out and about in the area.  In addition my daughter tried to film the objects on her cell phone but she said the screen was black and she was unable to film it.<n>

The night was slient - no sounds of planes, helicopters, or the like.  In fact, there were no sounds at all - not even of other vehicles or animals - only silence and us quietly discussing what we thought it was we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because we knew this was not an airplane or helicopter, I suggested taking photographs with my cell phone.  We took two photographs, one directly after the other (both logged at 10:14 p.m.); the changing shape of the object is evident in them.  It was bright orange in color, yet had a fog like haze around its perimeter.  I stated while viewing it that when really focusing on it with the naked eye, it appeared to be round in shape with a trail or &#34;spotlight&#34; appearing to be shining downwards.  Then, the object appeared to r! ise in altitude, the orange &#34;lights&#34; dimmed, brightened again very briefly and then it completely vanished leaving us feeling bewildered, curious, a tad bit nervous, but yet excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was all over with and we were discussing what we thought it was that we had seen and whether people would think we had lost our minds if we mentioned it, we heard cows mooing.  In fact, I made the statement, &#34;The cows are unhappy about something.&#34;  They continued to moo for at least an hour as if they were upset by something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to releasing the photographs that we have, we would love to speak with an investigator.  We are also interested in whether anyone else reported this as we believe we cannot have been the only two people who witnessed this.<n>

It was too bright to see past it, didn’t move, and it was too quiet to be an aircraft.  She said she was surprised and stared at it hoping to figure out what it was when it flashed after 20 seconds of staring at it.  It wasn’t a flash like something passed in front of it, it wasn’t like a regular camera flash because it was a massive size, but flashed like it blinked or possibly took a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She yelled, “What in the hell” and that’s when I got up from the living room to see what she was looking at.  She said it flashed once more and then it disappeared before I was able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are in a second story apartment and she made it crystal clear that it wasn’t headlights either because shortly after it disappeared, a car drove down 11th street from the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This isn’t the first time she and I have seen something like this.  In 2010 we saw lights flying over that alerted the entire town and it was reported in the Dailey Press the following day with pictures.<n>

Moved very slowly and gradually faded out of sight over the ocean.|1/7/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116432.html|459|ndxe201501| Two fireballs hovering over I-65  near the exit to the old Saturn Plant outside of columbia TN<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I had been hunting today on some family land in middle Tennessee.  On our way home on I-65 around the exit that leads to the old Saturn plant, we saw two lights in the sky.  I have an Aerospace degree and make a living in technology and design which puts me in some interesting experiences.  I am naturally visual spatial and am usually very aware of my surroundings and notice a lot of details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove for about 4 miles from the time that I first noticed the lights before finally stopping on the side of the interstate to watch them almost directly overhead.  At first the two lights were in close proximity to each other and seemed to rotate slowly at about a 20 degree angle from horizontal as we were initially driving along.  I say that it looked that way but of course from our vantage point in a moving vehicle it can look like rotation but not actually be that. the most interesting thing was what we saw when we came to a stop and rolled the windows down.  The two lights were at about 1000 feet altitude from our position.  We had an overcast sky with a ceiling of about 1200 to 1500 feet I guess without checking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two objects seemed from my vantage point to be about as large as a car each in size judging from the size of the light they were emitting. initially from the first view we had of them, they seemed to alternate between brighter and darker in the intensity of their light which initially led me to believe that they were two airplanes that were in a holding pattern waiting for their turn at final approach into Nashville airport.  I knew that air traffic control would not have placed two planes this close together so I figured that they must be much farther apart yet my vantage point just makes them look closer.  I also thought they were much farther away than they actually were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we pulled over and stopped the car, I could see that they were not airplanes, helicopters, drones, balloons, light from a ground source, etc.  We had about 30 seconds of clear visual from the time we stopped and tried to video to the time that the first object on the left phased out like turning off a light with a dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 seconds later the second one on the right phased out the same way.  Now they did not fly into the clouds, they were below them.  The light they emitted was an orange glow like a torch.  I am familiar with most everything that flies and many FAA regs.  I also am able to use logic and reason to determine what I might be seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I know is that with my experience both educationally, professionally, and Spiritually, I was not able to determine what I saw but I am convinced that it was not something man made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like it before and am very aware of what it takes to make something fly and these two things did not match that knowledge.  They did not emit any sound that we were able to single out from the mild interstate traffic.  We would have heard a helicopter or possibly even a drone in my estimation.  Even if it had been something like! a drone then from the size it was, we would still have seen the object against the cloud ceiling via the ambient light emitted from the nearby urban infrastructure when the light it emitted phased out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again the light was a orange glow times two, fixed hovering in the sky about 1000 feet above the ground  with a constant fixed distance between the two.  The left one phased out first, then 5 to 10 seconds later, the second one phased out the same way leaving no trace or sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I reiterate, I would know if they were airplanes, helicopters, drones, balloons, flairs, ground emitted light, etc and they were none of those.<n>

When I looked over I saw a single orange looking fireball with an orange trail taveling fairly quickly going northeast to southeast.  Not super fast, but not slow either.  It looked like what I would expect a rocket launch might look like but it was traveling across the sky not up from the ground.  It also looked to be at a high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled across the sky and disappeared behind clouds after 20 seconds or so.<n>

It looked like something burning and on fire, which alarmed us at first.  We could tell it wasn&#39;t a plane or anything with a constant beam of light because there was a center light that was bright and the flickering fire-like light was moving up from the lower ball of light, just as flames move up and &#34;lick&#34; the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object wasn&#39;t flying as high up as commercial airplanes fly, but more around the height a helicopter would hover.  It was on a constant path moving from west to east at a constant speed when it stopped suddenly for about a minute; it just hovered there and kept burning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it started moving again at a slower speed moving south, also appearing to gain height in altitude as well.  We could see the light grow faint but could no longer see the burning.  At this point we were viewing the object thro! ugh the trees and watched it change course again heading slightly diagonal towards south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as fast as it had appeared out of nowhere, it began moving up in altitude very quickly until it was just a faint light, almost as if it was a star, despite the snow that was falling and the fact that no stars were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a video that captures the main chunk of the sighting but my phone died just after it began gaining altitude and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fact the object was burning was alarming enough, but the intelligent speed and direction changes were enough to convince us this was something foreign and extraterrestrial.<n>

I pretty much paid no attention and figured it to be the usual aircraft with blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a moment I spotted another bright reddish light object below and to the left of the first one, just above the horizon, and continuing to follow the first object horizontally and then straight up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled the car over and observed them both for a few minutes.  The first one then accelerated a bit, and went straight up, thru, into and above the clouds..  I could see it all the way with light of the full moon above.  The second object followed the first one&#39;s course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I picked up my cellphone from the back seat, and tried to figure out who to call..shaking like a madman.  I then left the phone, went to the front of the car and 2 more objects appeared from behind a foreground hill-like mound, and they proceeded in a due line across, and just above, the horizon, from the  left to right.  At this time..with no luck.. I was pointing at the objects and trying to get vehicles passing to stop and observe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third object followed the other 2 into the clouds, and he last one I watched, as it slowed to a complete stop and dimmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 4 of the red fireballs were moving on a Northeast to Northwest heading.  No sound, no smell; it was 17F degree according to my car gauge.  The night was clear and still below the cloud ceiling.  The objects were 1/10th to quarter mile away and were the size of a nickel held in hand at arm&#39;s length.  All of them were bright red/whitish in color with flame like streamers steamimg from the top and they had a revolving lighter red outer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked with the local TV  and newspaper media and no one else reported them,,as far as I know I am the only witness to the sighting.  I watched them for around 15 minutes.  This was on the old Jerome highway I mile west of the intersection where interstate 93 joins the old Jerome highway on the south side of road between there and the Snake River Canyon Rim.

The night sky was clear of haze or clouds, which is unusual for our area this time of year.  High in the sky (much higher than the city fireworks displays), I saw a bright orange round ‘fireball’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked unusual to me, so I grabbed my 50x binoculars to get a closer look. Watching through the binoculars, I could see that the fireball was slowly moving from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes, a commercial airplane flew from west to east, lower in the sky than the object, perhaps originating from SeaTac airport.  As the airplane neared the fireball vertically, the orange fireball light went out, but I could see the faint circular or oval shape of the object since I had been tracking it through the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or two the outline became fainter and I lost visual track of the object even through my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange object reappeared after a few minutes moving lower in the sky from west to east.  I had the other witness look through the window and by then we observed two orange objects moving from west to east.

My kid hurt his hand and yelled out, I turned to see if he was okay and was now facing north toward I-84, I looked at his hand and then he ran back into the house, with his father following him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not follow because as I looked up, I saw some reddish orange orbs in the sky, maybe 50 feet up (just above the one story roof lines of our complex).  They appeared to be floating straight towards me, flickering like candles but synchronized.  I called my husband to come back out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I was afraid they were some huge embers from NYE fireworks or something and was watching to see if they would burn out or land on our building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before they reached our building, they took a  turn to the left (about 12 feet or so from me) though the turn was a right angle, the orbs floated smoothly, not particularly fast, just g! liding and flickering, more kept coming, spaced evenly apart and in some kind of formation, at the same height, spacing and rate.  They were almost floating lantern like but not that and way to small for that.  There were around 8 or so in all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked closer and watched them floating by and flickering, not sure what the heck they were, they moved out of our sight and we went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It kept nagging at me, so I began to look to see if embers like these were even possible from fireworks (I could find nothing.)  I looked for fires or other reports of these orbs in the local news and saw none but then I stumbled upon a bunch of information online about others reporting floating orange orbs in the sky, all over the world.  (I&#39;ve never heard of such a thing before.)  I came here to check out reports for Portland on new year&#39;s and found nothing, so I thought I should report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are stunned to find this may be UFO phenomena.<n>

1/1/15 00:05|Portland|OR|Formation|3-5 minutes|8 orangey red orbs, floating and flickering in formation in night sky over I-84 on New Year's.|1/7/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116459.html|497|ndxe201501| Five small, orange floating objects seen overhead at the beach. Erratic flight patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were staying up late to ring in the new year.  While looking at the stars, we all saw a few tiny orange lights in the sky.  They flew erratically and were bright orange in color.  Two flew south and disappeared immediately, while one took some time before getting smaller and vanishing.  Two more could be seen in the distance.<n>
1/1/15 00:05|Egg Harbor Twp|NJ|Formation|5 minutes|2 sets of red/orange glowing objects seen just after midnight in south Jersey.|1/7/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116372.html|498|ndxe201501| Orange ball of light/fire seen on North Coast; not Identified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As is typical of the New Year&#39;s tradition, we went outside to light some fireworks and howl at the moon.  Plenty of others have joined us in this escapade, lighting a good portion of the street with fire while an occasional bottle rocket would flitter upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we look into the sky to gaze at a fireworks display, something catches my eye beyond the show.  	A bright orange light shines in the distance.  It&#39;s brighter than Venus by comparison, glowing a dull yet vibrant orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fireworks dissipate over time while this unidentified light glimmers behind.  We stare in some mild form of disbelief.  Tears are coming out of my eyes for no particular reason I can fathom.  The light sits, unwavering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it might be a paper lantern.  Being a holiday it seemed likely that someone might light off a few.  It&#39;s possible that a paper lantern could have been caught in an inversion current leaving it in a point of temporary stasis.  From experience we know what paper lanterns look like however, regardless of distance.  The light being emitted was far to bright to be a little ball of fire in a bag.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes the object begins to move away from us, getting smaller steadily.  I begin to run to tell my neighbors, looking over my shoulder every moment or so to make sure it&#39;s still there.  By the time I make it to my neighbors front door, the object has vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While it&#39;s very plausible that this was something mundane, we can only go with the emotions during the event.  The feeling was grandiose, like witnessing a miracle.  Hearts were racing, not with fear, but a feeling of tranquility and unrequited joy.  Tears came down as there seemed to be no other way to express such a thought.  I simply remember thinking, &#34;We are not alone.&#34;<n>
1/1/15 00:05|Stayton/Salem|OR|Light|3-4 minutes|A slow move bright reddish orange flickering light moving slowly and changing direction before burning out.|1/7/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116383.html|499|ndxe201501| Went out to watch the fire works at midnight.  Saw the usual aerial fireworks but then saw 2 bright red lights traveling from the west and then turning in a wide arc to the south.  At first I thought they were fireworks gone awry and waited for them to explode.  Neither of them did.  That attracted my attention as being odd.  One was above the other.  After about 3 minutes first one then the other faded and disappeared several miles southward.   Went out an hour later (at 0:54) to have a smoke and saw a red light come from the west from the direction of Florence, Oregon followed by 6 others.  As they traveled in my direction, they all appeared to be moving very fast. They appeared to be traveling high above the oregon coast mountain range.  I have always watched the weather coming in from the coast ( we live 60 miles inland) and have a pretty good idea of what the weather is going to do here in the Willamette valley based on my observations of cloud activity wes! t of us.  I&#39;ve seen a lot of jets in the area but none of them flies from that direction or that fast.  All of the red lights disappeared at the same point several miles toward the south.  All of them followed the exact same trajectory and faded quickly and disappeared at the same point in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived less than 2 miles from the Eugene airport for the past 23 years.  I have seen private airplanes, private jets, commercial jets, cargo jets, navy sub killer aircraft conducting touch and go training flights, and a wide variety of military jets taking off after re-fueling on north to south trajectories.  I know all of the trajectories for all of the aircraft that fly over or around my home and, at times, what time of day I can expect to see particular airlines.  I am can distinguish the difference between night time aircraft lights and landing lights between fixed wing and jet aircraft.  I also know the sound that all of them make.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight I neither heard nor saw anything I have ever experienced.  There were none of the usual stro! bing lig hts, throbbing engine sounds, or jet sounds.  I have also seen military jets climbing at night.  Their after burners have never looked red.  What I saw and heard were bright red lights that fluctuated minimally and felt, but did not hear, a slight bass hum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions were clear, 23 degrees F, no clouds, and a bright half moon in the sky.  I have never seen any thing like this in my 55 years on the planet.<n>
1/1/15 00:04|Oakville|MO|Sphere|6 minutes|15-25 orange lights or orbs traveling from West to East slowly, no sound, strung out over 6 minutes.|1/7/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116388.html|500|ndxe201501| Seen 7 orange/red fireballs in central Florida on New Years<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking up at the night sky in central Florida, my wife and I saw 7 orange fireballs in the sky at roughly 15000-20000 ft. altitude.  There was 1 at first and we thought an airplane had an engine on fire, until the other 6 in a group form came in behind what I&#39;m gonna call the lead fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were headed south/southwest.  Could see the orange/red flame for quite a while until it faded from site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what these things were, I&#39;m wondering if I should be concerned?  Seems people are seeing these &#34;fireballs&#34; all over the US. does anyone know what these are for sure.  It&#39;s NOT a helicopter, airplane, or from the military.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live about 20 min. from OIA and can hear those jet engines pretty clear, these &#34;fireballs&#34; were silent, no noise of any kind.<n>

I had just came back from a get together with my family.  Me and my dad were the first once to arrive at my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my sister arrived with her baby girl from our get together.  She took out her baby girl out of the car and came inside the house.  She was trying to put her baby to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards, my sister went outside to get something from her car.  Then she said, she saw an orange circle down the street do south of my house.  My sister said it was really low and then it went up to the sky.  She got scared.  The orange circle past up my drive way and headed to the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, my sister came inside the house and told me to come outside.  She can barely speak. She said it was urgent!<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it was me and my sister that went outside.  When I saw that orange light of circle in the sky, I told my sister that its just a plane.  But as I started to focus more on the flying object, it did not look like anything I&#39;ve ever seen before.  I was very shocked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad came out of the house to see what was going on.  This was around twelve thirty something cause I didn&#39;t check the time. I told my dad  to go get my tablet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got the tablet, I started to take pictures.  Then video. As i was recording, my dad     yelled  out to me, theirs another one coming from the south! I aimed my tablet to capture them on video.  Then another one was coming from the same direction.  Then I starded taking video again cause to more were coming from the same direction. They all headed to where the other flying objects were.  I capture at least 4 flying objects coming from the south and headed towards the mountains.  I got 2 pictures, and 3 videos on my tablet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I told my sister to go get her camera so she can record the flying objects. We stayed outside for a couple of minutes to capture them on video. Then we went inside our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, when everyone was asleep, at 3:26 a.m., I went outside to see if they were still there. They were, and still in the same position that we saw them.  My dad counted to see how many flying objects we saw and he said 8 in total.<n>

They kept coming.  I stopped counting at 20.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were first headed right over our house, and then also to the far right.  There was so many, me, my daughter and son couldn&#39;t count them all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take pictures with my Vivitar camera.  They didn&#39;t come out as clearly as we could see them with our eyes.  We were in awe!<n>

S. Coast Guard, and found out the next day there was reports up and down the California coast of the exact thing I had seen.  The scariest part of my experience was watching it fly with intelligence and as odd as it may sound.  When it noticed me noticing it, it changed course and flew away..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Triangle shaped no other color but red and could stop and go at will and hover.  Never seen anything like it.  Made me shake in fear!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the report was submitted by the party who had just telephoned the Hotline, but we cannot be certain it is the same person.  This is one of two reports from the Watsonville, CA, area, submitted by the same person.  PD))<n>

I looked to my right, and above us a UFO came across the night sky, hovering red and green lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was round with green lights one one side but it had red lights on the other side of it, it flashed in both colors, at first my sister claimed it was the news filming the event, but the people including myself said that not a helicopter, it maneuvered across than accented up and than down, it turned and began trailing back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This isn&#39;t the first time I recorded this red and green flashing light UFO.  Last year, on Fourth of July, I recorded a craft with this same descriptions at a fireworks display going off.  It hovered over our home.  I wasn&#39;t sure if I could display the link to my actual video recorded footage from you tube.  I have also sent a description and uploaded my video to MUFON.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
