PD))|10/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102870.html|1|ndxe201309| Stationary object high in the sky that had rapidly flashing lights - colors were distinct - red, green, white and amber.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I were sitting on our front porch looking West, when we noticed an object pretty high up in the sky that was stationary.  It was a dark night, but after looking closely, we could distinctly see flashing lights in the colors of red, green, amber and white.  It once quickly moved straight up into the air, but otherwise remained completely stationary.  The lights flashed intensely and quickly, and the colors could each be made out distinctly.  It was cold, so we decided to go back inside, and did not see it leave the spot in the sky.  I peeked through a window about 15 minutes after we went inside and saw that it was still there, but about an hour later went back outside and there was no sign of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During that time, we saw approximately 4 airplanes move through the airspace at what seemed like a lower altitude than the object we observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Arcturus.  It would be in the western sky, at the time indicated by the witness.  PD))<n>

They formed a Nike sign,above my house then slowly faded into atmosphere.  Then there were 3 large crafts,aboua mile apart from each other. One was a large dark triangular object w 3 pulsating lights on points of triangle..changing colors from very light green to orange then red and it appeared  to be moving in a counter clockwise  Then the lights flew apart from the craft and went north south,and west.  Then we saw the larger craft appear with no sound like it just came from out of the sky,and was there the whole time.  Almost as if it was invisible and just appeared. It the began to light up,at points of than craft and formed,a merang shape of like I bow from an arrow..  It hovered for about 10 minutes lighting up turning in the sky like clockwise counter clockwise turning crazy sharp fast turns.  Then the lights seemed to go up like a,space,ship,and  disappeared.We couldnt get th ed clystr<n>

Very weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Helicopiter did NOT have any kind of spot light on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Son saw something similar in August in the outdoor shower one night. Bizarre to say the least. Both VERY low....above tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also saw orange fire balls heading towards Atlantic Ocean (heading east) in August a few times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first we thought it may be a planet or star, but it would move slowly every few minutes, sometimes changing it&#39;s position or direction.  We don&#39;t have binoculars or a telescope, but we were flashing a big flash light up at the craft, my two children and I were waving and trying to send messages to it telepathically, asking the aliens to please come down and visit us if they are a benevolent species.  We told them that we would try not to be afraid if they came to our house.  The craft was at first positioned north of our townhouse, then it moved directly overhead.  We were outside on our deck watching it and trying to communicate with it and the craft seemed to become brighter for a brief moment.  I had to take the kids inside at inside at around 21:15 so they could get ready for bed.  We are now very hopeful, we have been seeing UFO&#39;s occasionally for several months.  My children and I belie! ve that if continue trying to initiate contact, we may have success.  If the aliens do visit our home we intend to send you a picture Mr. Davenport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS.  There is no need to call me back at this time, I&#39;ll call you as soon as I get a photo of the aliens or the UFO up close.  Thank you.<n>

It did have a red flashing light with several lights spread around the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved south southeast through thurmont towards Walkersville/Frederick MD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend called me and I verified to him that I saw it as well.<n>
9/30/13 20:00|Berlin|WI|Light|~20 minutes|Light over Berlin WI area.|10/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102854.html|6|ndxe201309| Light over Berlin WI area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before 8 pm. I saw a light off to the SW hovering over an area just north of Berlin, WI.  It would hover and then sway from side to side a bit, then suddenly dip down and rise back up quickly.  While odd, what got my attention more was that about a dozen other aircraft with anti collision lights began heading over towards that area of the sky as if to observe or interact with this light.  I thought that a lot of attention to be given if it were just some lighted balloon (weather balloon) or some prankster&#39;s lighted kite.  Some of these aircraft seemed to have search lights turned on although they were up too high to be searching the  ground and did not have their lamps aimed at the ground. There also appeared to be brief flashes of light from areas near that region of the sky that I could not visually associate with any visible aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about twenty minutes of such hijinks, the light in question began to move lower on the visible horizon either moving! down or traveling wsw away from me and disappeared below horizon.  The other aircraft remained interested in that area of the sky.  I went inside and just kind of scratched my head and thought it a bit odd. Saw nothing alien or that fantastic. Just looked like odd behavior.  I would also add that there seemed to be kind of an aura in the sky in that area of it. as if night sky were more energized than normal is the only way I can think to describe it.<n>

I looked up and west. I was a large clustered group of at least 10-20 bright lights.  They were high in the sky, higher than any tower or antennae could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They formed a disk or oval shape of sorts.  They appeared to be about 1/2 mile or a mile away.  They were stationary, hovering, in the same location.  I found it odd and pointed it out to at least 10 other random people in the area.  They all looked at it and reported seeing the same thing that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not change direction or shape or size. I viewed all this with my naked eye, and so did all the other people who saw it.  My phone camera and very low resolution and when I use it at night it takes all-black photos so I did not bother trying to get a photo.  I could only stay for about 20 minutes because I had to go somewhere.  I cannot explain it other than saying-- it seems to me that it was was an object that was flying and I, to me, it is unidentified.<n>

The surface was highly reflective and the crystal clear sky and viewing conditions were ideal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Austin Bergstrom International Airport is within 4 miles of my location, and my view to the east showed airplanes taking off and landing normally as the object shared the sky with them.  All other visible aircraft in the sky at the time yielded audible characteristic engine sounds, but the passing cylinder was  producing no audible sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A short video was made with a cellphone camera, but excitement prevented the operator from realizing the focus mode was inappropriately set to macro, yielding a video that only falls into appropriate focus for a few short frames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded quite sincere and sober-minded to us.  We suspect that he is a reliable and capable witness.  PD))<n>

Reports of a UFO having crash near a school in a British town started circulating recently  and even made the local paper.  There were even photos included  and a description of the events  told.  However the newspaper reports went on to reveal it was all a hoax for the local school to provide a a topic for a creative writing day for the children of the School and the jolly local police man even joined in..<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.tottenhamjournal.co.uk/news/ufo_crashes_into_north_harringay_primary_school_playground_1_2825363<n> <n><n> <n><n> People were soon posting comments to the news article online and even joking about people taking it for real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So all seems fine and happy but there is an undercurrent going on that is not being reported and people secretly point out errors and false facts in the article, photos and other details..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initial reports of it having been a real UFO have subsided with talk of people being pressured to change their stories or silenced with threats of loss of income, Benefits, job and home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reports of 12 inch to 6 inch tall dolls or figures being moved in an ambulance have slowly gone quiet and hushed along with mentions of them having elongated heads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One report which has not been substantiated is that one of the figures had a USA flag on the arm of its  clothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People point out how there are financial cuts going on everywhere in the United Kingdom and no money exists in schools to stage such acts for the children, when jobs, staff and building cuts are taking place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Police officers in the United kingdom are not allowed by law to take part in uniformed in such staged events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A parent is claimed to have  built the UFO , staged the crash and pretended to be a forensic  officer all in double quick time just to help the children have a creative writing day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People comment of disinformation going on and posted online.  Some say the school angle was staged to cover what really landed elsewhere and during all the attention on the school the real event site was cleared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People point out that on a slow news day the reports made the local paper yet strangely regional TV and newspapers  were quiet. So just what really did happen what really did crash?  People now won&#39;t  talk or only tow the official line after all Jobs and homes are hard to come by in the United Kingdom right now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was seen when the sun was going down and the horizon was glowing orange and red.  The UFO was definitely a bright white light moving very fast first vertical for a very long distance then from East to West until it disappeared.<n>
9/30/13 03:30|Keeseville|NY|Changing|1 hour|Multiple flashing lights in sky.|9/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102833.html|12|ndxe201309| Multiple flashing lights in sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 3:30 a.m. observed what was initially thought to be a helicopter to the south about two hands&#39; widths above the horizon until I noticed that one of the flashing lights was blue.  It was the brightest non-moon object in the sky.  The sky was clear with no clouds at any altitude.  Observed with binoculars but was unable to tell shape of object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my fiance what colors she was observing and confirmed red, yellow, green, white and blue.  Object remained stationary for 45 minutes cycling colors randomly.  The lights at times seemed directional at times sphere-like at times rectangular/cigar-shaped or a cross as its aspect changed.  It was too distant to see a superstructure with any clarity even with 8 power binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observed two aircraft (red/white navigation lights at much less intensity than the object).  One traveled south at a relatively high rate of speed towards the object and then banked right and traveled quickly out of view to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another traveled north along the horizon at relatively high rate of speed to the east of the object about ten minutes later.  Total time of observing the aircraft was approximately one minute per observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given time of night and nature of flight patterns I speculate that they were Air National Guard from Burlington, VT.  I attempted to take a video but the camera-phone was less than ideal, it is shaky and I upset a sleeping bird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stopped viewing for about ten-15 minutes at the 45 minute mark approximately. Returned to the window and saw that the original light had moved west and was partially obscured by a tree limb.  The observed several lights, originally thought to be stars but noticed they flickered.  Binoculars showed the same light emission patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 5 additional lights arranged roughly north to south with varying intensity due to distance with two advanced farther to the west forming a roughly L shape, though I believe there was a salient in the formation as the dimmest and closest to the horizon object was not the tip of the L..  The lights maintained this formation and drifted slowly west until they were obscured by a tree.  Total time observed was approximately 1 hour with a break.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have observed aircraft in this area for thirty years and have seen all manner of USAF and commercial aircraft at night as there was a air force base here formerly.  I have observed helicopters and I believe a drone in the area as well at night.  These lights were unlike anything I have seen in the night sky.  I can&#39;t explain what I saw, I do not believe in extra terrestrials and I can see no rational reason for any craft to use lights in this fashion. Nevertheless, we saw what we saw even if it defies explanation.<n>

Noticed 2 orange orbs come out of nowhere, flying next to each other heading north to south.  Both my wife and I went to the window an watched them fly right over the house. I ran out to video them.  Watched one continue flying south.  It disappeared after a little while. I turned around and then the other flew south.  As if it had stopped over the house.  I didn&#39;t see it stopped. I had been wondering where it had gone. It disappeared at the same distance as the first.  Neither made a sound.  I don&#39;t think a lantern flying evenly at the same speed with another would stop, especially above me, for a couple minutes while the other continued at its pace!

They went behind a neighbors house as I pulled in obstructing my view.  I got my phone and went to the backyard where I saw them moving independent of each other.  One of the lights disappeared, then reappeared.  A single light then disappeared, leaving two, then another disappeared, leaving one, then the last one disappeared.   They were constantly moving left and right, not in straight lines, and trended toward the horizon.  When I initially saw them, they looked to leave tails behind them when moving, but this could not be appreciated in the video i took with my phone.  Fortunately in the video there is one stationary light closest to the bottom of the screen, that light is a porch light from a neighbors house about 800 yards away.  Its character is notably different from the lights moving in the sky and would serve as a good point of reference. ! I could submit my video if someone wants to see it.  This is the second time I have seen something strange in the western sky from where I live over the past 4 months, though this event was quite different from the last one.<n>

About 16 miles east of Gunnison CO saw large circular white light to the south, headed west at about 60 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming down Monarch Pass and watched a unusual cloud formation to the south of Pass. Roughly 16 miles east of the town of Gunnison I saw a bright light to the south above the skyline of the mtns. Way to big to be a star as there were a few stars visible behind it. Seemed to big and bright to be an airplane. woke wife to see it, which she really didnt care. kept watching while driving and seemed to be moving about same speed 60mph.It was headed west.  Stopped in gunnison to gt some coffee and proceeded on.Light was still visible to the SW ahead.  Seemed to actually be dropping in altitude from the skyline of mtns. lost sight of it a few times when i got to blue mesa resevoir area. last saw it at about the easterly bridge area.  Seemed like it went down (landed maybe?)around big blue creek area. dissapeared. didnt see it anymore after that. Sometimes i would see a airplane flying by to the south and i could plainly see flashing lights,and they were much smaller in! size.Weird. the speed is what gets me because it seemed to be going same speed as us. just slighty ahead and SW.I think there is a fancy lodge up in that area somewhere. Theres just no way it could have been a helicopter because of brightness ,size,no flashing lights and speed. seems to slow for a chopper. I dont kmow, but it was to me unexplainable. wife did see it numerous times also. i would keep waking her, saying what is that? she would look say i dont know and go back to sleep. it kind of looked like a large star in the sky with maybe just very slight flickering.distance was kinda hard to tell but probably within 10 to 15 miles from us? hard to say.

I know this sounds crazy, but there was no noise, the objects were moving much too slowly to be aircraft or a meteor, and the lights did not appear to be airplane lights as they were solid and even when the direction changed on the red one it only appeared red (my father is a pilot and said that you would be able to see the green light on the oppos! ite wing after a direction change).<n>

High in the southeastern sky around 10:25 pm, were 8 – 10 sets of orange/amber colored bright lights or dots.  In pairs of twos in a Z shaped formation, they moved slowly but not in unison (the pairs did not seem to be like headlights).  Some disappeared and reappeared, moving slowly up/down or sideways, but not down; others were constant.  By the time I pulled out of traffic, there were only two independent ones left, and they were fading.  They just faded out one by one. I observed all of this for about 8 minutes (while driving and stopping on road.  (The orange dots were already in the sky when I noticed them, so do not know how long they were totally visible).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw lights in the sky as making a 90 degree left turn, I thought it was fireworks up in the sky, but quickly realized nothing had been shot upward and nothing was falling back down, as in fireworks.

In the sky, I noticed these bright orange lights floating in a strange oval-like formation.  At first I thought they were remnants of a firework..<n> <n><n> <n><n> But they were in the sky for much longer.. They were just floating there.. And slowly moving around one another. At one point, some of the lights parted off from the main group of lights, and started spinning rapidly in a circle. I then called out my grandmother as a second eye witness.  We both were watching this strange phenomenon and were puzzled as to what it was.  Then, the lights began to disappear out of the blue, slowly fading away one by one.  As they were fading, they disbanded the oval shape they were previously in, and formed an arrow-like shape.  Eventually they all just disappeared. I have seen helicopters and strange military craft in the sky before, but what I saw tonight, was nothing like what I have previously seen.<n>

It was there for a good minute or so and did not have the &#34;twinkle&#34; as a normal star would and was not a planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just watched it and it then &#34;went out&#34; as if a person would turn off a light.   I waited for more, but nothing.  There was no trail as if a meteor.   This has happened before with my daughter.  This time I saw it....it was as if it knew I was watching it.<n>

At first I thought it was some kind of search light but we live in Brooklyn and there are no search lights in Brooklyn. When my boyfriend saw it he said it was probably a ufo because there were no beams of light. I thought that he was joking and I dismissed it but as we got on the highway and continued to drive for another 15 minutes we saw the same exact light rotating in the clouds with no sign of any beams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had already driven a significant amount of miles from where we originally saw the white lights so I began to wonder how we were still seeing them and why it seemed as if we were getting closer to it. I am a believer in extra terrestrial beings so I began to believe that it was a possibility that, that was exactly what we were witnessing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to Google my sighting to see if anything similar would pop up and I happened to read a report that was taken in 2010 in California and the witness reported the same exact sighting as me. I find it hard to believe that what I saw was anything other than a ufo sighting being that another witness reported the same exact sighting from all the way in California approximately three years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A series of amber lights were floating slowly across the sky, north to south at about 10 degrees above the horizon.  There were probably 6-8 of them and they appeared for a minute or two.  I did not see where they went because they went behind the stage where my view was blocked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assumed that they might be flares the fire department might have been using to test wind direction for the fireworks show that was scheduled later that night but the fire department told me it doesn&#39;t use flares in this manner. A check with the 911 center showed no calls reporting lights or flares in the downtown area during that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Google Maps view of the area is here:<n> <n><n> <n><n> https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ll=35.773562,-78.642111&amp;spn=0.001668,0.002331&amp;t=h&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=35.773471,-78.642115&amp;panoid=SBItjg_tPtd3F2O27AGl0g&amp;cbp=12,304.59,,1,0.91<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared about 10 degrees above the buildings in the background, somewhere over the intersection of Dawson St. and Cabarrus St, and moved slowly from right to left.<n>

When we turned to look, we saw a red, transparent object floating horizontally through the sky.  It was spherical in shape and it had two bright red, shield-like objects orbiting around it.  It was hard to gauge its distance from us but it appeared to be within 200 yards from where we were sitting.  The object was very low in the sky and seemed to be just above the tree line.  We watched it move for about a minute until it was out of our line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We felt entranced while watching it move and we were unable to say anything until it had gone.  That may sound strange but prior to sighting the object my phone had frozen up. I&#39;m an avid stargazer and I&#39;ve ruled out any possibility of it being a plane or helicopter.  The main reason for ruling out common air traffic is that there was no sound.  We can all recall hearing crickets while the sphere passed by.  The local radio station ran a story that many people reported seeing a &#34;fireball&#34; in the sky tonight, but those reports came in around 6:45pm when we saw the object closer to 10pm. I&#39;ve never witnessed anything like this before.<n>

Flew quickly into view in straight line and stopped, moved to the left a bit and then to the right. It was during this time I was able to observe that object appeared to have 2, maybe 3, glowing orange circles situated close together on one object. Object then moved quickly to the left what seemed to me to be about one hundred feet, but was most likely in actuality much farther, then just disappeared. My first thought when I saw it was &#34;what the hell is that?&#34;  For the duration of my observation I was in awe. I have never observed an aircraft to move in that fashion, and most definitely have not seen any fire-orange craft ever in the sky above. It was a most exciting, yet terrifying, experience. I was almost frightened, and am having difficulty describing exactly what it was I saw. I am in the city in a subdivision, so the background was just the night sky with a few trees along the street. I was just going to get the gr! oceries out of my vehicle. I was a bit frightened because of the way the object moved, and then remained stationary for a bit, it almost seemed as though it might be scanning the area below. Although it was not close enough to be a threat, by all measures approximately three times as far up as an airplane would pass over my residence, it had an ominous feel to it. Because of the unusual nature of the object, naturally I wanted to hide, but was mesmerized and instead followed the path of the object until it simply disappeared into thin air directly above me.<n>

We then headed down and parked in the yard and got out the ones we saw up the street vanished but many more started to appear from the skyline above the trees they just kept coming about 6 at a time, at the end we might have seen about 40 to 50 of them.  (I didn&#39;t believe anything like UFOs before I seen this it was literally mind blowing ).  They all have seemed to be going north/north west.  This was going on for about 15-30 mins.<n>

Flying slowly at about the height and speed of a helicopter it flew off to the north west followed by two more identical craft.  As the moved off they slowly  blinked out.  The last craft with the same description flew a slightly different pattern and blinked out at a much different point.  There was no sound they did not blink there was no additional lights just solid orange.  when we told our son about it this morning he said he saw them too. He was spending the night at a friends in the neighborhood.  To test him I asked how many he saw.  He said four.  We are just normal folks.  We all work retail it was just a really cool expereance.<n>

We pulled over and observed for about 2 min.  The orange lights changed shape and world rearrange.  As I began to video the lights they began to burn out one by one until they were gone.  A plane also flew what appeared to be right through the path of the orange lights as they were burning out.  When we arrived at our friends house we played back the video only to find nothing on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a professional ATP rated pilot with a college degree and consider myself and my wife of above average intelligence.

I was inside and initially observed light through the open blinds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On going outside, I could clearly see that the orange light was travelling in a counterclockwise orbit.  The light was travelling slowly, roughly speed of what you expect of a slow flying single seat aircraft.  As the initial orange light continued its orbit towards the East, I then saw a second orange light again coming from the North. It appeared they were 180 degrees off from each other, making the same CCW orbit.  As they would disappear towards the East the orange glow would dim to a faint blue, until being obscured by trees to the East.  The objects made no sound.  There are a number of small airstrips nearby.  Regularly have small aircraft and military helicopters fly in nearly same area. However, airstrips are daylight use only and always hear the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my position, the lights would appear at approx a 40deg NE and elevation angle approx 16 degrees. They would disappear from sight at approx 125deg SE, elevation angle approx 16 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This orbital pattern continued for at least 15 minutes.  I attempted to take pictures. Camera would not focus clearly on orange light, with no other objects for it to focus on.  Using a tripod and 3 second exposure, captured picture showing trail of orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We drove for about 10 minutes and parked with strong binoculars.  The westward one started flashing strobe-like bright white lights and the inside stayed red.  The lights got very bright.  We watched for 15 minutes and the strobing stopped and it slowly faded away.  The one in the north continued to flashing the red green and yellow but never strobed.<n>

I am not sure of the date; I think it was Sept 28th, at about 9:25pm.  I was at my yoga class and could see a small portion of the sky from where I was at the back of the room.  I was near the glass wall near the door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During class, I started to see a few, (about 4-5) bright orange orb-like, glowing disks, moving across the sky.  The lights looked like they were part of a large full circle, but I could not see the full circle because of a roof hindering my full view of the sky.  They were slow moving, if I had to guess… about 20 mph, they were silent, and seemed relatively close, i.e., they seemed closer than a small plane would fly.  I remember staring at them from inside and wondering what they could be.  Finally, I stepped into the courtyard to get a better look.  I stared as long as I could until they moved over the roof and out of my sight. The direction it seemed to come from was northwest and heading to southeast... or just west to east.  However, I cannot be sure because I only saw a portion of the full circle (if there was a full circle.) There was a slight variation in the distance between each orange light, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember thinking:  I will certainly find out what it was on the news because many people HAD to have seen the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am positive it was a UFO, even when I was looking at it, I was certain.  I wasn&#39;t frightened, however, which was good.<n>

The first two fireballs then slowly disappeared and only one remained for about one minute.  I witnessed the first part of this sighting by myself and then the last one with a family member.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:00 the fireballs reappeared in the same location northeast of Sale Creek, Tennessee and quickly became extremely bright while hovering together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first there were three and then the fourth, fifth and sixth fireball appeared consecutively.  They did not form a line but moved to create odd shapes.  Then they slowly disappeared one at a time only to leave the last fireball lingering for about a full minute alone.  This last fireball behaved similar to the last one at 8:30 pm before it disappeared.  This second sighting was witnessed by four family members.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am aware that there is a military flight training base about eight miles northwest of Fall Creek Falls in the Crossville, Tennessee area.

I took my camcorder outside and spotted a strange light, i assume it was the light she called me about,  At 1st it appeared to just be a normal plane coming in for a landing, but then i realized it was to far away to be that, after a while i realised it was not moving, so i continued video taping. The ligh simply sat in the sky right around the border of pennsylvania and NY.<n>

They were upright cylinders that glowed orange &amp; red.  Almost looked like lamp shades that were moving straight and the light glowed/oscillated orange and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They didn’t seem to be moving at a high rate of speed (not as fast as most airplanes as they approach our home and go beyond to the airport).  When they got about a mile or so away, the first object turned west and the other two followed; however, they seemed to take the exact route, i.e. they didn’t turn as soon as the first, but they made it to the same location as the first and then turned west to follow.  They seemed to stay at equal distances from one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they headed West we lost sight of each one (the first one first, down to the third).<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it didn’t seem as though it went so far that we lost sight; it was as if it just turned its light out when it reached a certain point.  And the other two did the same at about the same point in space.  I looked around for the next hour and never saw them again.<n>

The object was similar in size to a large passenger plane.  It was traveling from North-West to South-East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It immediately caught our attention because it was bright white (similar to the bright- ness of the moon) and completely illuminated.  There were not any flashing lights or any colored lights. The front was larger and tapered off at the back.  It was traveling much faster than any type of plane any of us had ever seen.  The house is very close to the Greenville-Spartanburg airport so we are used to seeing planes go over.  The object disappeared behind a tree but we never saw it emerge on the other side. We were shaken up because of the speed it was traveling seemed abnormal.  Approximately 15 to 20 minutes after the sighting, we saw a plane emerge from the same group of trees and take the same flight path.  This was what we normally see.  Red and white lights and traveling at a normal speed.  This plane disappeared behind the same tree but emerged on the other side.

I live in north Glendale, north of the Loop 101 highway in the area of  67th avenue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 7:15 pm, I happened to glance out my kitchen window that faces north, and I observed some bright orange lights traveling from the west to east.  It seemed unusual, so I went out into my back yard to investigate further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I observed multiple bright orange objects coming from what appeared to be the Lake Pleasant area which is approximately 15-20 miles northwest of my home.  They were traveling from the west to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my mind, I immediately thought these appeared to be Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO’s).  I immediately thought to myself, “If I don’t get pictures, nobody is going to believe me.”  I re-entered my home and got my I phone and started to take pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were being partially blocked by some trees on the golf course so I decided to go out on the golf course where I could obtain non-obstructed pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a great interest in UFO’s and have done a fair amount of reading up on them and was convinced the probability was high that these were in fact UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I filmed these objects for probably over 5 minutes.  At one point my video stopped and I had to restart it again.  I was in awe because they just keep coming.  I would estimate as many as 150 of these orange objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s hard to estimate their speed.  They were not going as fast as a military jet and they were not stopped.  They seemed to maintain a constant speed that I would have to estimate at 150-200 mph.  I did not see any particular formation.  There would be 5-7 of them traveling together and others following behind in a line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to me that when I first saw them coming from the Lake Pleasant area, that as they came higher they were trying to catch up to those ahead.  They maintained a constant orange glow with no flickering.  I observed no other lights on them, just the orange glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that the Phoenix area had reports of a meteor last night.  This was not a meteor.  A meteor travels so fast that if you blink, you may well miss it.  Meteors are generally a white flash of light or fire looking and these objects were bright orange in color and had a controlled speed far less than a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a weather balloon as the government might claim.  There were approximately 150 of them and they were rising at a speed inconsistent with a weather balloon.  These were not Chinese candles (candle lit objects that rise from the heat of the candle).  The objects were much too fast to be Chinese candles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not military flares as some might think.  They were rising, not falling, as flares do after being shot into the air or falling after being dropped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once again these objects were traveling from west to east at approximately 150-200 mph and as they passed just slightly east of my home they seemed to just disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This parade continued for over 5 minutes.  As some would disappear, others would appear from the lake area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When all were gone, I went back into my house to call family to tell them what I had seen. Like most people out there some were believers and others had their doubts.  I thought “but I have video proof”, and when I went to view the pictures, nothing was visible, just a black screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw and unless someone has a better explanation, I feel that I was fortunate enough to see what many of us hope to see someday and will not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have absolutely no reason to make false claims or file false reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be exceptionally objective and sober-minded, in describing his sighting.  We suspect that he is an exceptionally reliable and capable witness.  PD))<n>

It was mostly dark outside so the only thing I could really see in the window was the reflection of back inside our house living room and couple orange street lights from outside way up on a hill that is kind of far about a block/block and half  that blended in faintly with the inside of our room.  As I was watching tv somthing out the corner of my eye caught my attention and neglected to look than i finally did look and it was the street light in the distance looked almost like there were maybe some leafs or branches blowing in the wind so it was obstructing the path from my eyes to the light.  As I stared at It for a few minutes I realized that It was slowly moving and indeed not somthing blowing in front of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my cell phone and I went to the sliding door to the deck in backyard which is to the right of our tv and the backyard faces west.  What I thought was the street light was a small circle of light almost like a satellite looking object but way too low to be was coming straight my direction than without any type of warning or speed change in the object it just went south.  I have never seen somthing like that before.  The steady constant flow and direction change of an object was just unbelievable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this object is heading toward another Large circle of light that is to the south in one spot, whiteish in color , kind of flickering a orange or redish color, about ten times in size , and same height as the one coming towards it.  As this circle of light is moving towards the big steady one, the light is slowly fading the closer it gets.  It gets real close to the still non moving one and just stops and stays .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once that one had stopped next to the big one, out of nowhere to the left of both them and next to the bright one, another even bigger light appears and lights up really bright  for seconds and slowly dims but remains lit and non moving.  After a few seconds where it is no longer dimming and just staying lit, It now starts moving east across the sky and than after some distance goes south to where I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the most craziest thing I have seen or been able to record. I had told my friend a few days later and showed him the video and once he got home he had told me someone that night at the same time had also recorded somthing very very similar at a Minnesota twins baseball game right above the outdoor stadium and he had showed me the link to that on youtube.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other two had stayed stopped and remained in that spot for awhile than slowly went south west and under/behind the tree line!!   I have alot of videos and pictures!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

County<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:40 p.m. on Saturday evening, September 28, 2013, I was parked on Whittier Blvd b/t Painter Avenue and Strub Avenue, when I noticed far in the distance a large but bright white light hovering high in the sky. I estimate the large light was approximately 10-15 miles away, to the northwest of my location, which would possibly place it closer to Los Angeles International Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about 10 minutes, I simply watched it hover in the sky. During this time, I noticed a helicopter flying towards the northwest in the general direction of the light, but the helicopter was flying far below where this object was located in the sky, and it did not appear that the helicopter had seen or was targeting the object. At approximately 6:50 p.m. the large light began to drift slowly towards the north. Then, a second, very small white light suddenly appeared above the first light, and appeared to be moving towards the larger object. At this point, I was distracted by a small crowd of people, but I did take the time to point out the large light to a couple near me, who did indicate that they did see it as well. I looked up again a couple of minutes later, at approximately 6:55 p.m., and both objects had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It is an actual craft that looks like a fireball with a tail. We were completely under this object for about 8-10 min and it simply would not move. Being under it and because of the sunset we could completely see a flat bottom surface (it was huge;as we can see small commercial airlines).  The colors were red/orange (like fire). It looked like a comet, but it was motionless/stuck in the air; frozen.  But what it did next was completely astonishing and amazing.  The object went out like a dimmer switch/light/lamp and within 20-30 second it reappeared completely over our shoulder/north-east within unbelievable speed that no convention aircraft and conduct.  It basically went out like a light and appeared within an! other location.<n>

It was very bright and sudden, and there was no storm – It startled us both.  We looked up out of the window and there was a white cloud-like trail in the sky that lingered for about 2-3 minutes before dissipating.  It was very strange.  I rarely see lightning that bright – It lit up the entire area around us! I am pretty certain that it was an explosion of some sort.  I called my sister who was also driving home on the same road, and she said that she and her boyfriend had seen it as well.  About 15 minutes later, she called me back and said that they had just seen a second flash of light.<n>
9/27/13 23:40|North Bergen|NJ|Disk|13 minutes|Lights in the sky Hides bigger Object Behind it!|9/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102794.html|106|ndxe201309| Lights in the sky Hides bigger Object Behind it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok so on the 27th of september between 11:40 &amp; 11:53pm last night I was walking to work in North Bergen and the road I walk is pretty dark! Suddenly a group of oval shaped lights dashed from behind me and cluttered together at least a mile ahead of me. It was so quick I thought the moon had a reflection for a minute, but that was odd within itself. Little did I know all the lights were focused together in one spot!  I kept looking around looking for the actual moon but as soon as I was ready to conclude that it was the moon all the lights spread apart from each other!  Through out my walk they kept changing positions with each other expanding and contracting together again! You&#39;ll see this in the pictures themselves!... I checked online there was no light show in North Bergen that night and what&#39;s interesting is that in the UFO database this same incident was reported over North Bergen back in 1997 and the description was eerily similar to what I witnessed! Further weirdness is that the lights came from behind me then zoomed to a mile in front of me. The whole time I saw no beams of light coming from the ground Like you would normally see with search lights and projected lights witch led me to believe they came from the sky as if there were a magnifying glass or many micro lenses pointed at us! Some people from my job sight saw it too and couldn&#39;t explain it! Meaning that these lights had a very far range instead of one focal point. For them to be so strong that they replicate the moon we would have seen the trail of light also come from the ground as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister (a photography major) noticed an interesting bit to  of the pictures! I circled as many green lights as i could find and if you look closely they line up in a way that resembles a rim. She noticed this when she saw the lights breaking in the pics and decided to zoom in. this suggests there was a big object behind the clouds shrouded in pitch black! When i was there i only saw the white lights! I wish you guys could see it from my phone its much clearer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a few people think i&#39;m an idiot and they explained it to me like they were there and they were the eye witnesses so I can see why people dont come out and say they saw these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the Eye witness report for 1997! http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59259.html<n>

I couldn&#39;t make out a shape or &#34;craft&#34; as you call it.  But I was walking out to my car with my headphones in.  All of a sudden the sky lit up. I remember flinching because I was expecting a loud bang from heat lightning, but it wasn&#39;t lightning.  I looked up and saw a light shoot across the sky in a supersonic speed.  At first, I thought it could have been a shooting star, but the crazy thing was that it left a small trail of smoke, only for a split second, and then shot off out of sight in a nano second.  I watched the smoke trail dissipate into the sky in several seconds.  Whatever it was, was traveling at a speed 100x faster than any plane i&#39;ve witnessed.  Also, the altitude couldn&#39;t have been more than a few thousand feet. I didn&#39;t hear anything, but like I said, I had headphones in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

One of my friends called his dad and asked if he had seen the lights.  His dad went outside and said no but he had just seen some fighter/military jets.  This was about 5 minutes after we had seen the triangular form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour after all of this, me and one of my friends were inside playing cards, when his brother came in and said there was a big explosion.

I heard no sound with its’ flight.   (I had seen a similar flash on 6/28/13, but it had a w-h-h-h-sh sound – which I never reported, expecting to see something in the news.  But, I didn’t.)

There was a church parking lot and I parked the car there and saw what appeared to be an spherical object at about 400 ft altitude traveling in a straight line path at about 35 MPH and at about 400 feet altitude (very rough estimates), this object was observed partially through car&#39;s windshield and partly from outside the car.  The elevation angle was loe perhaps 20 degrees.  I lost sight of the object as it passed on the otherside of a line of trees.  About 40 seconds after this event expired I saw a 2nd and apparently identical object following the same flight path and speed/altitude as the first object.<n>

I focused on what at first I thought had to be an airplane but it definitely was not. It was large and probably over the ocean, but it appeared to have 2 &#34;ribbon&#34; like curved lights, almost like a belt but not quite.  The shape was Triangular but not a &#34;steep triangle&#34;.    It was a dark orange light, and lit up for a half second and then the light faded very quickly.  I stopped dead in my tracks and it did it again, same spot -same lights.  It almost appeared as if something was attempting to &#34;power up&#34; and the lights came on very briefly and then faded very quickly.    I took out my phone, hoping to get a chance to film it, but it never re-appeared.  Nothing, just dead silence. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it...It was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At the closest view, the orbs appeared to have a slight ring object around the center of orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was viewing them at the closest view all the circling orbs suddenly disappeared all at once.

We pulled over to get a better look at it.  When we came to a stop it did too.  It made no noise and It was fully illuminated with lights on both the top and the bottom.  The lights were white and red. It was disk shaped and was quite large. It looked like it was getting closer to the ground so we got back in the car and started going again. It went behind the tree line and we couldn&#39;t see it anymore. Within minutes we saw helicopters with search lights heading in the direction we had seen the craft.<n>

The last light stayed for about a minute after the others went out then started blinking and went out.<n>

Looked like a big metallic heating/cooling duct, with segmented pieces.  Approx 40-50 feet long, 10-15 feet high.  No sound.  No lights.  No jet propulsion, or helicopter blades I could see. It was just hovering.  I wasn&#39;t the only one that saw it.  It stopped traffic and I looked at the guy stopped next to me and we shrugged at each other.  I looked back, and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Initialy thought it was a metorite but it moved slowly(much to slow for meteorite) to the West and seemed to stop momentarily then gradually faded away.  Official report is that it was the International space staion but I have observed it before and it has never been this large and it was orange ball that became almost vertically diamond shape, at one time I thought a smaller orange smaller shere fell off and down. Generally the space staion is white and much more distant. I suppose the sun could have reflected off the gold solar collectors on the space sation but again seemed much too big . ????<n>

I couldn&#39;t see when it appears first as the tree was blocking my view, however, I was able to recognize it as unusual object before moving into clearing and had direct view of the glowing orange reddish sphere/ball.  The sky condition was extreme clear and crisp, this occurred at my backyard where I was able to observe the night sky pretty regular and I am familiar with frequent flight paths, although, this object had caught me off guard with bizzare light and traveling in a path where the planes and satellite never comes across. I&#39;ve also witnessed an asteroid breaking up in an entry and saw it breaks into smaller pieces and what I observed tonight was nothing like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before this sighting, when I first came outside during 2340-2345h on 26th, to enjoy the nice stargazing weather, I immediately recognized orange reddish streak escaped my view before I was able to identify it.

I was at a stop light and saw a blue laser light  reflecting on the the clouds at a high altitude. It was making at first a small circle, then would relocate itself to another place in the sky. I watched it thinking someone was using a beam as an advisement for a business but there was no beam to lead down to the originating point.  So I thought someone was using a huge laser pin to shine in the night sky, but then it is a flight path which would be illegal. It then  literally swung out of nowhere close above the ground to my left about 100 yards away and appeared to be a small aircraft but had great control like a helicopter, and hovered on an tilting angle without any sound;  almost shaped like a dragonfly. It had elongated wings, and a center. It did tilt while it was moving in a controlled manner going back and forth in a small circle. No airplane would have that ability. It had blue neon lights /glo! w surrounding the entire edges of the wings. It happened all so fast I think there may have been a bit of pink tinge alongside the blue.  The body appear to be  grey.  It definitely glowed. It really was lovely.  Then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object followed a shallow arc towards the Earth.  I was surprised to see that when it approached the area slightly under Cassiopeia it made somewhat of a “U” turn and went up and to the East and disappeared with a slight flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had the same brightness you would see from a meteorite – and the flash was brighter than the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was white.<n>

My vantage point gave me good visual clues to judge the height and speed of the object. It had a round glowing orange shape with no lights that you normally see on a conventional aircraft. The size appeared to be smaller than the small aircraft that you see in the area that pull ads along the beach. The object followed the shoreline from the east (North Myrtle) and flew to my right (west) towards Myrtle Beach.  With the night being clear I was able to track it for at least 15 miles.  It traveled at a constant altitude until it got about 12-15 miles away (Myrtle Beach) and then appeared to ascend, disappearing into a light cloud cover/haze. As it passed in front on me, it was only about 100 feet or so off the ground and was no more than 1/2 mile or so from my position. I heard no sound. I had seen other aircraft/helicopters during the day flying higher altitudes and further away and had no problem hearin! g them. Based on the time it took to travel from my vantage point to the clearly visible lighted landmarks in Myrtle Beach, I estimate that the object was traveling between 400 and 600 miles per hour. This was no conventional aircraft.  Over the years, I’ve seen hundreds of those in the night sky (and dozens at the beach)and know what they look like.  My wife and daughter saw the object but only after it had passed our position, moving away from us towards Myrtle Beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired IT manager. I have seen and reported one other sighting to MUFON back in May, 2009. The sighting was during the day and involved a pencil/cylindrical object in West Virginia where I live.<n>

Then we saw a large orange ball of light far up in the sky above the water.  It hovered there for a few moments.  Then another one appeared beside the first.  The first one moved to the right quickly.  Then the second one followed.  They kept moving as if they were dancing.  first the one and then the other would catch up to it.  At times the orange light would go out and you couldn&#39;t see it anymore and then it would reappear.  After they disappeared altogether two of us saw 2 circles fly VERY close to the hotel above us.  They were large but had no lights and no sound at all.  The moon was out and we could just see these large black looking masses fly a little above our hotel. it was very strange because it seemed like whatever it was should have been very loud but we didn&#39;t hear a thing. Later we saw the orange lights out again this time going in the opposite direction over the wa! ter.  This was at the Cherry Grove pier.  Not sure if it&#39;s related but we did see a dead bird by the pool and an injured bird soon after.<n>

The lights coming down looked like jellyfish tentacles and came down approximately three times the height of the bright red lights at the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at these two objects made me feel like I needed glasses. The lights coming down would not stay in focus. I could not see the shape of the objects. They were too far away and it was too dark.

I then grabbed my cousin and uncle who were there with me to see it.  As I was trying to spot the slow moving dot in the sky I noticed a group of stars which I thought was just a constellation start to move south across the sky.  This group of stars was in the shape of a V and spaced almost perfectly apart.  As I frantically tried to point the group out to my family the stars began to separate and then suddenly went dark.  At that second my uncle found the satellite and the group was nowhere to be found.  My uncle lives right by DIA and the Air force base so I know what planes, helicopters, and even jets are capable of. None of those could have gotten as high as these lights were, and if they were anything humans make why did they just go dark all of a sudden instead of staying lit up like the satellite.<n>

One really bright white light appeared and lingered for at least 8 minutes as more and more started appearing, always at the same path at very high speed.  Definitely too fast to be planes.  All of the red/orange ones that appeared seemed to move higher in the air and eventually just completely disappeared.  Once the Bright white one was gone, only a few more showed up and then it was over.<n>

When I went out for a cigarette, I seen a small light in the sky that was flashing in many different colors.  It stayed in the same spot for the 45 minutes I stayed outside and watched it.  It was gone by the next time I stepped outside (about 30min later).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked uncommon enough to impress my friends and family so I took a 45-second long video to show off what I had seen(not fully convinced myself of it being a ufo).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking back on how odd this light was and seeing all the colors in the video have me thinking twice.<n>

I work the early morning shift for a local news station. I decided to go on a smoke break right around 3:00 AM. I exited out the back door. The only thing in the back is grass and woods. I have seen small and distant sightings before but nothing like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I’m smoking my cigarette, I looked to my right and as soon as I turned my head, I saw a bright, shiny light coming around the corner of the office building. I also noticed an orange light inside of the bright light.  The bright light appeared to be extremely blurry and moving at a very slow speed. It is very hard to explain and to put into words. The shininess of the light almost made it appear as if it was floating water or a jelly-like substance. It was extremely low to the ground and got as close as thirty feet from me before shooting up. The object didn’t shoot up much higher than it already was, but it was high enough to have to look up at the object. It then began moving West before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time, I am also tried to take my cell phone out to take try to record the object. I opened my camera and switched to video mode. The grid appeared on my screen and the object was in clear sight on my phone. However, as I’m trying to press the “record” button, it will not record. I pressed it several times trying to get it to record until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I lost sight of the object, I thought that it had disappeared. All of a sudden, the light zooms back at a much faster pace right above me before heading northwest. All of my previous sightings have never been reported. I would see them and keep them to myself. This sighting was much different. When I saw the light, there was a huge and unexplainable rush of excitement that overtook my body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked back into the office almost in a trance-like state. I went straight to my computer and noticed that it was 3:30 AM. A whole thirty minutes had gone by. Smoke breaks are only five minutes and ten minutes at max. I used the Internet to find the number and called the local Baton Rouge Air Patrol. A lady answered the phone and informed me that the tower in my city closes at 11:00 PM. She went on to ask more questions and was very intrigued with the details. She also mentioned that there were multiple sightings within the month that had been called into Air Patrol but nothing like mine; in regards to how close it all happened. This sighting was as real as it gets and I will never be the same because of it. It left me completely speechless.<n>

The two objects would converge on top of each other in the top right quadrant of the elliptical revolution, and stay at that location for about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects would change speed, but stayed on the same track. The first object appeared to be exiting to the upper left quadrant where the sphere was cut in half, then totally disappeared ( as if going through a door) approximately 15 seconds later the second sphere exited the same way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky had low overcast clouds and there was no sign of a spot light &#34;beam&#34;.  The spheres were illuminated as if light reflecting down from the clouds.  There was no noise, hum, or vibration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the spheres left it looked like there were four dark areas in the clouds, where the spheres were stationary.  This incident  lasted for at least 20 minutes.  We were unable to capture any video due to the halogen lights in our parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Daughter says&#34; what was that&#34; and another fireball came over ,south to north.  They were glimmering, round and soundless and disappeared behind trees on the north in approximately 5 to 6 seconds.  We ran the 40 feet to the edge of the property and they were gone.  They were immediately followed by a jet from Mitchell Field,  which was flying  southwest and made a sharp turn and followed them to the north.  They had made no sound or left no trail of any kind.  What the heck did we see?<n>

They moved rapidly, but staying within one area of the sky.  At one point, they seemed to omit smaller lights in rapid formation coming from one of them.  I was only glad that I had another eye witness to this event as I would have thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I do not know what they were, but I know what we saw and it was not what one sees normally i&#39;n the sky.  I hope this helps in some way.

There is a specific road that is perpendicular to PCH.  We were coming back from the beach towards where we live, towards inland.  On this particular road, the beach is behind you and there is a drop- huge valley on your right hand side and huge trees-blocking houses on the left hand side.  I was in the passenger seat and I immediately saw this black, huge triangular mass hovering over the side with the houses/trees.  It was hovering like I have never seen anything hover. It was huge in mass, cannot recall the exact size.  It was triangular and it had numerous lights on each side of the triangle- lights varying from red, green and blue.  The lights would alternate flashing.  Once I spotted this UFO, I immediately told my sister who was driving and also spotted it.  The strange thing about this UFO is that I could clearly make out the different co! lor lights but could not see the black mass- seemed like it was maybe “super black” or had some kind of invisible-ness.  It was hovering in the same position for about 1-2 minutes and as we were driving by, the black mass suddenly dropped vertically down into the unknown trees/houses.  I have never seen a flying unit drop vertically within 3-5 seconds of in the air.  I do have a drawing of the mass I drew when I got home.<n>

The quality of the light coming from it seemed to dim slightly at times, and the colour would flash from red to white.  Upon further inspection, we noticed at least 20 other lights in the sky that appeared similar.  Though the light coming from them was not as intense, they too flashed red and white.  These smaller spheres were in every direction!  Some seemed to hang in the air for minutes on end, and would change direction at random.  Also at times the ones closest to the large brightly glowing sphere, would fly directly toward and around the large one.  video was captured.  After aprox 20 mins of this we went inside to eat dinner.  When we came back out, the large sphere was apparently gone.

9/25/13 20:04|Redmond|WA|Formation|4 minutes|Formation of 7 red-orange lights seen by 1 person on SR-520 Eastbound near Redmond Washington.|9/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102688.html|181|ndxe201309| Formation of 7 red-orange lights seen by 1 person on SR-520 Eastbound near Redmond Washington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 8:04 PM of September 25th 2013, I was on State Route 520 Eastbound towards Redmond/Avondale when I looked southward, past Marymoor Park; in the sky were seven objects.  These objects were above the horizon, and were too high in the sky to be lights in the Marymoor Soccer Fields or streetlights on one of the hills that surround Redmond.  The reason I determined that the lights were not in Marymoor Park was the fact that they were bright enough to be seen past the lights on the soccer fields; which were bright enough to drown out the stars and most other light source beyond them.  These objects were in two groups, four in one, three in another.  The four were higher up in the sky, and were in a finger-four formation, the other three were lower and in a triangle formation.  The objects were red-orange lights, and shined steadily rather than blinking.  All the objects were identical.  Also, the objects did not seem to be moving; however, they could have been at v! ery high altitude and moving slowly, or the fact that I was in a moving vehicle at the time of the sighting meant that I couldn’t observe the UFOs moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that they are UFOs because I cannot see any other reasonable explanation.  The objects were bright enough to be seen over the floodlights of Marymoor Park, discounting the possibility of them being stars or planets.  Unlike planes, these objects did not have any other lights other than the red-orange light that allowed me to see them; they did not have the red and green lights on the wings, and they did not have any white lights on the nose.  I believe that the objects cannot be blimps or hot-air balloons because, I have never seen or heard of seven light-than-air aircraft flying in such precise formation at any time, much less at night.  I do not believe that the objects are helicopters because, one I heard no sounds from the helicopter’s rotor blades, also, the helicopters did not have any sort of lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have thought of one possibility of what these lights are, other than UFOs of course:  I think that the lights could be afterburners on military aircraft, perhaps out of Mcchord Air Force Base south of Tacoma, Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, or a base in Oregon or Idaho.  The fact that the lights were south of Redmond, towards the Mcchord Air Force Base area, could support this thesis.  However, if they were aircraft, they were not sporting any lights other than their afterburners, which is dangerous to say the least.  Some conspiracy theorists might say that the government was conducting “hush-hush” testing at Mcchord Air Force Base.  I think the military would not do that, for one reason.  Airspace around Mcchord is busy; if a secret military test was being conducted in the area of the sighting, the testers would risk a collision with another airliner.  I would think that the military would conduct such testing at an area like Area 51 or Edwards Air Force Base.  Therefore, I believe my alternate theory of it being a military jet in afterburner to be unlikely.<n>

I was standing, facing the Northeasterly direction when I glanced upward toward the sky.  I saw a bright light that quickly shot a brief distance across the sky.  The object went behind a cloud and did not reappear on the other side of the cloud cover.  The object seemed to be round or spherical in shape but I wasn&#39;t able to distinguish an exact outline.  The speed with which the object moved was extremely quick and would not have been mistaken for an airplane.  The object appeared to be slightly lower than an airplane would have been flying.  I don’t believe that the object was a star because it was much larger and brighter than the stars and it was much lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Once down we were walking home and we saw the first of the stars come out as it was getting darker. Venus was obvious as was another, slightly brighter light almost due west approx 25 degrees off the horizon.  I figured it was another of the planets and was pointing it out to my son. We watched it for a little while until I figured it would get lost in the clouds that were slowly moving in. However when the clouds covered it, the light was still visible.  The planets surely aren&#39;t bright enough to shine through the clouds, so we kept watching until it suddenly winked out. The light was constant, not moving, not blinking. The sun was at such an angle that craft over 30k feet were leaving bright contrails. For the next half hour we watched and it didn&#39;t reappear, nor were other craft visible from the approximate location.<n>

9/25/13 13:40|Marin/San Rafael|CA|Disk|6 seconds|Disk/Saucer shaped object hovering near Marin County in California for a few seconds and vanished @ 1340hrs on 9/25/13.|9/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102643.html|185|ndxe201309| Disk/Saucer shaped object hovering near Marin County in California for a few seconds and vanished @ 1340hrs on 9/25/13.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 9/25/13,approx. 1340 hrs, I was driving southbound 101 from Novato heading towards San Rafeal and I noticed a off white silver oval and saucer metallic small shape object on the right side of the sky thru my front windshield window.  I thought the object was an airplane at first but it suddenly enlarge 7x to 10x its original size in a second or two as I drove on Southbound on HWY 101. It was clear to me the object was not an airplane because the top portion was oval shaped like a cap and the lower part was shaped like a saucer/disk. As it hovered for a few seconds, the air around the object slowly began to move and enlarge like as if you were staring at the road infront of you on a hot day driving thru a dessert road. After hovering for those few seconds it suddenly vanished. There was not other aircraft near the incident before and after the object dissapeared.<n>

After driving up County Road 38, I saw a bright light in the sky.  Not yellow, orange or any color, just a bright light, the sun was to the east rising and this light was brighter than the sun.  This object did not move, just stayed motionless for about 5 minutes, as soon as I went to take a picture, GONE . . . nor zig zag or flicker just gone into space, as if it backed up full speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One week later I was at home cooking super and my brother called me out to show me the same bright light that I saw, but this time two.  I live in Prince Edward County and the two bright objects my brother shows me are to the west over Toronto.  After again 5 minutes of spectating, one light just disappears, 2 minutes after the second one disappears.  After standing waiting too see if we could catch something else, military helicopters from the southeast, start towards the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now when you see one by yourself and then a week later your brother spots two of them and shows you, same far distance in the atmosphere as if they are just poking in to observe, that&#39;s just crazy.  This second spotting happened 1-Nov-13.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now going back approximately 10 years, on the same lake (L. Ontario) we were camping and had saw a circular disk with red and yellow light hovering over Lake Ontario and then zing across West Lake. the observed UFO may I say, was flying about 500 ft. off of the ground and other people in Wellington reported seeing the same thing the next day.<n>

It was going straight from west to east for about 8 seconds and then it did a 90 degree turn to the south for about 3 seconds and then it turned 90 degrees and was heading back west and I lost sight of it.  I thought at first it was a dim meteor, but I know they do not behave this way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

9/25/13 03:39|Hopkinton|RI|Light|45+|I went to let my dogs out and have a smoke. The moon was bright, high above my yard and the sky was clear, I could see all of the stars|9/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102631.html|189|ndxe201309| I went to let my dogs out and have a smoke. The moon was bright, high above my yard and the sky was clear, I could see all of the stars. To the “south” of my yard, I could see what appeared to be a pulsing light, right above the distant tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a couple of minutes, and it seemed to be moving, yet not as fast as a plane. I called the dogs back in as soon as I saw that it was rising yet becoming clearer. I wanted to turn the outside light off and watch without worrying about them, which is exactly what I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood on my front steps and watched as the pulsing became brighter, and the closer it came, the more defined the beams surrounding it became. It was the most beautiful thing I think I’ve ever seen. There was the pulsing center, sure, but I could see what looked like a row of blinking dots that ran horizontal and the beams were varying colors, rainbow almost, with white rays mixed in along the bottom. The colored beams were separate, and went in all directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered if I was witnessing the death of a star, until it started weaving from side to side, and what appeared to be back and forth, upward and downward, slowly. Almost as a seagull does against the wind, trying to stay in one spot. I went inside and woke my son up to confirm what I was seeing, and he definitely saw the colors, the pulsing that was different from the blinking lights in the middle. And, promptly went back inside wanting nothing to do with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I brought my female dog back out and walked to the end of my yard attempting to get a picture on my phone but the distance was too great for the quality of my device. While trying to do so, my dog started to whine, whimper, and slightly growl. Her fur stood completely on end, and she leaned her shoulder into my knee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I’m about to share might have me sounding like a complete lunatic, but, honestly? I’d rather everyone think I’m nuts than not share it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was looking over at our neighbor’s yard, and when I turned to see, there were three sets of eyes looking back at us. About my height, I immediately assumed deer. These were no deer I have ever seen. They turned to “run”, and they were far from anything I’ve ever seen, except for mutations shown in movies. They were hunched over, their heads more in front of their bodies, and they “loped” in almost an orangutan fashion. They were FAST. They appeared fur-less, and an odd brownish color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog started to run after them, and the last of the three “creatures” stopped, turned, and looked directly at my dog. My dog halted, and LAY DOWN. I called to her, and the sound of my voice caused the shiny eyes to turn away, and off it went with the others. My dog remained stationary until they were out of sight, and then bolted toward the door to the house, with me right behind her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I locked the door, looked out the window, and the pulsing light was still there, but moving south west without the colorful beams…I know it makes me sound crazy, and I don’t care. If these creatures weren’t related to that light in the sky, then I’m one lucky girl to see both things! However, my dog will not go out alone now, so I think we may have been far luckier than we know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We watched it for about 20 Seconds before the Humming stop and it disappeared completely.  I was never one to believe in UFO’s but from what I had saw tonight I’m a firm believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No noise what so ever.  i could have touched it<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working tonight at chase at easton office center, when I decided to go for a walk. I went through the back door and walked behind the building.  I was playing with my phone when i saw some thing colorful in the SKY.  I ran to get a closer look, and went to the side of the building.  There&#39;s a sidewalk there and i was on it. It was about 10:33pm. Mifflin High School is Behind Chase.   I saw this big ballon like thing. It was colorful, bright spinning and going down at the same time.   I though my eyes were playing tricks on me  but NO!! It was slowly descending.  This white guy saw it too, he just gave me a blank stare.  It landed near Mifflin High school in the field, and I then lost sight of it.  I went back inside. I put all the chase cameras on that spot to see..if it rises again.  But after my shift ended 15 minutes later at 11pm, I drove to Mifflin high school and tried finding the same spot i saw it land.  I hopped the fence and went to the baseball field, nothing was there but the ground was hot and it was like 60 DEGREES outside.  I HAVE NO ((deleted)) IDEA WHAT I SAW..BUT IT WASNT A PLANE OR A HELICOPTER.  I DONT THINK THEY CAN SPIN , GO DOWN AND MOVE FORWARD AT THE SAME TIME.  IT WAS ALSO HUGE.  I should have recorded it on my phone..or jumped the fence at that 2nd and just went to it!!  But i was too scared.  I&#39;m going go to the same spot tomorrow night, with my camera.<n>
9/24/13 21:45|Hazen|ND|Cigar|6 seconds|Long, cigar-shaped object; dark grey with three oddly-placed lights; rapid flight path and silent|9/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102604.html|193|ndxe201309| Long, cigar-shaped object; dark grey with three oddly-placed lights; rapid flight path and silent<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 21:45 PM, my father and I were sitting in our backyard looking up into the night watching the occasional satellite and meteor go across the skyline.  I turned my head to the north and was looking at a couple of constellations when all of a sudden I saw a large, dark grey object come over the house at a fast rate of speed. It was heading from the north, going south, and there was absolutely NO SOUND heard.  I immediately pointed and alerted my father. He managed to see it in time before it went past and was lost from view.  We got up to see if we could still track where it was going, but it was gone within seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a long cigar shape and the size was large. I figured that it was approximately 250 FT in length, but the odd thing was that it was traveling horizontally. No known plane (as far as the American public has been allowed to have knowledge of) can travel at the speed this object did. It had dim, solid circular-shaped lights, almost like the off-white color of the dim stars in the sky. The position of the lights was the most noticeable. There were two on the starboard side and one on the port side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was a real dark grey, but it was enough to be noticed in the dark of the night sky. The object emitted no sound at all. To further solidify this unexplainable sighting, a prop-engine plane coming from the southeast passed over the area at 21:55 PM, approximately 10 minutes after the object was first observed. I could hear the engines and see the distinct placement of the aircraft’s lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions were clear. There was no moon out and no wind was present. This is the second time I’ve witnessed something in the sky that I cannot explain. Whether it’s classified military aircraft being tested or something not of this world, or even realm, my dad and I saw what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day, we’ll have answers. It&#39;s only a matter of time. Thank you for taking a look at this report.<n>

Something caught his attention in the corner of his eye… It was something bright and fiery coming up out of the trees.  It had to only be a couple blocks away. They were both very confused as to what it could be. It looked to be the size of a beach ball… but was bright and fiery.  He immediately pulled out his phone and started to record.  At first it looked as though it was just floating up, but then it started moving and zipping around in all different directions very quickly. It kept getting higher and was hard to keep recording it because it was moving so quickly.  Eventually an airplane was crossing through the sky and this fiery ball seemed to be above it. It ended up going higher and higher until it disappeared. When I got there to his house he told me the whole story and showed me the video. We are both pretty sane, smart people and are definitely a little freaked out by this. I! have never seen anything like this before, and can’t think of any reasonable explanation of what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was sunset, the sky was mostly dark and the first 2 came from the back side of my house along side each other-about north/east. They were not moving too fast but were traveling at a steady pace.  I followed them by running out to my living room when they went past my line of view.  They continued on their path until one seemed like it just slowly winked out eventually followed by the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to go lay back down,  my oldest was tired,  when I saw the third.  This one came from the same direction but at a faster pace.  I didn&#39;t follow this one because my daughter needed me, but I wanted to. I am posting this now because I can not understand what this is,  and I have been trying to find out more about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 2 videos of this incident, the first one is pretty shaky and my dog barked pretty loudly, but the second one is steady.

My 3 year old started shouting &#34;Daddy - look at the Helicopter&#34;.  I saw what appreared to be a very bright star in the Southern sky.  The &#34;Star&#34; became brighter and began to get closer.  As we drove south down 17, the traffic began to slow considerably (from 60 to about 30) as people noticed this light.  As it approached, I made out 3 distinct white lights in the shape of a triangle.  There were no strobe lights and no Red or Green Navigation lights visible  (as would be required on any civil aircraft).  The object slowly moved over the highway at about 500&#39; and then drifted, slowly, to the west, out over Brookgreen Gardens.<n>

We went out in the backyard and for a twenty minute period we witnessed approximately 50 triangular objects with blinking lights flying overhead in a northeasterly direction.  There were two to five visible at any given time over this period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not directly over our heads, but as we looked NE, some were to our left, and some were to our right.  We could turn to the SE and pick out new ones, and follow them as they flew out of sight to the NE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We think they were triangular because they generally had three lights.  The lights allowed us to see the solidity of the objects.  The objects were moving in the direction of a side of the triangle; a point of the triangle was in the rear.  The rearmost light was blinking while the front two were steady.  There seemed to be more than just the three lights that defined the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their flight was straight and steady.  A single object would take about four minutes or so from initial sighting in the SE to going out of sight in the NE.<n>

I quickly pulled over and ran over the bridges edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I arrived, the three red lights, which had been stationary, began to ascend into the sky.  They were separated by equal intervals laterally, but the lowest of the three was offset from the formation along the positive x axis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Starting from the highest in the sky, the lights began to, for lack of a better term &#34;dissolve.&#34;  As this was happening three airplanes had been triangulating the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the lights disappeared, the airplanes changed course, no one flying in the same direction.<n>

I watched it for 15 minutes as I sat by my front door.  It appeared to be moving somewhat towards my direction but very slow which I thought was an incoming airplane to Midway Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 4 to 5 minutes of watching the object it appeared to stop.  I focused my eye with a rooftop edge as I sat on my front door stoop to help me judge if it was moving or not and from my judgment it was not.  Approximately another 4 minutes went by and the object appeared to drift very slowly to the right dimming on occasion.  At one point it dimmed to nothing but within 15 seconds or so it came back in the exact position it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m pretty familiar with the flight patterns of airplanes over my home, this wasn’t on any normal path to Midway and why it caught my attention other than being very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I ran inside my house for my digital camera returned and snapped 4 photos.  Like any other photo ever taken of objects at night they usually come out dark but the light was very visible along with outlines of the rooftops.  I lightened them up as much as I could and blew –up a few photos also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When first observed it appeared to look like a very bright star in the SW sky at about 30 degrees above the horizon.  The exact size is unclear from my observation point but as indicated it looked like a bright star.  It changed from an oval dot to an un-described shape, perhaps in a cylinder form.  If one was to look at a piece of rice three feet in front of them that is the shape it would turn into.

The sky was clear and light blue in the area where I was looking, slightly south of west, just above the tree line, about 20 degrees up from the horizon.  There were two aircraft visible with their contrails bright from the setting sun.  The sun had already dropped below the tree line.  I suddenly noticed what appeared to be a star in the blue sky.  This is the third time I have seen such an object this year and I immediately pointed it out to my family.  We observed that it was moving toward the south at a slow speed.  As it moved, it appeared to move horizontal to the ground, then change direction, climb higher into the sky and slowly get dimmer.  It seemed to hover in place then for a minute or so, appearing just like a star, when I broke visual contact due to a disturbance in the woods.  When I looked back I could not locate the object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/24/13 18:00|South Sioux City|NE|Sphere|1.5 hou rs|The sphere is best described as a perfect pearl.  ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flare??  We await other reports.  PD))|9/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102655.html|207|ndxe201309| The sphere is best described as a perfect pearl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 18:00 hrs I received a phone call from a friend and neighbor of mine, asking me if I had a telescope. I asked why and he replied that he was observing a UFO. I told him I didn&#39;t have a telescope but I did have a high powered rifle scope. He said he had been home a short while from work but his family had been observing this UFO since noon. I told him I would grab my rifle scope and take a look and call him back. I then proceeded to the front deck of my home to investigate. I located the sphere with my naked eye, then located it in my rifle scope. Upon focused and magnified acquisition of the object it was clear to me that I was observing something completely out of this world. The next 15 minutes was very intense! I needed to find a way to photograph this object. My first problem was holding the scope steady enough so I could show my wife. I brain stormed briefly,and remembered I had a laser level kit in the garage that contained a tripod. W! hile acquiring the tripod I also grabbed some automotive grade masking tape to afix the scope to the tripod. After successfully affixing the rifle scope to the tripod I needed to elevate the front of the scope to approximately 75 degrees angle of elevation. I then grabbed a small end table from inside the house and elevated two of the legs on the tripod. This work yielded a steady picture in the scope suitable for viewing.  The following steps included showing my wife and calling my neighbor back and telling him to come over to see this thing magnified.  My neighbor showed up promptly and took a look.  He then informed my wife and I that he had called relatives 450 miles away to the west and they too were observing this same sphere.  I thought to myself, I have to try and photograph this object under magnification of this rifle scope.  I figured if I could see this object clearly by positioning myself to the proper eye relief of the scope maybe I could get my iPhone to auto focu! s at the same position and yield a quality photo.  This was no ! easy tas k but I pushed on and got the job done.  After taking many pics, I had at least 3 in focus photos of the sphere.  My best verbal description of the object is simple, it looked like a perfect pearl with the light of the sun reflecting on the left side of it.  The accompanying photos should speek for themselves.  The position of the object was eleven o clock, north being the 12 o clock position. The elevation angle was approximately 75 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The object looks to us to be a lens flare, caused by reflection in the rifle scope.  However, the witness assures us that he saw the object with his naked eye.  We are awaiting other reports, in particular, the report from the people who were located 450 miles from the first witness.  PD))<n>

The craft was very clear I could see every detail on it.  It had green, yellow and red lights rotating in one direction and the craft itself rotated in the opposite direction of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I started panicking and telling my kids to get out of the car and go towards the house I kept my eye on the object and felt as I was been watched by whoever or whatever was inside the craft.  The craft than changed its position from facing straight down to angle view (front part of the saucer facing towards the ground and back facing to the sky) and then it just shot up in the sky and to the side as if I blinked and nothing was ever there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My kids saw the craft from the car.  The metal of the craft was not ordinary it almost looked as it was see through some kind of liquid metal not of this earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until this experience I was not a believer.  This was not something out of this world it almost looked as it moved with the speed of light..<n>

When I was driving I looked up at the sky and noticed something shiny and I thought it was a blimp since they are very common in our area.  When I looked up at the sky again the object was gone, my son said did you just see that.  I didn&#39;t realize he was looking at the object as well. I said to him yes did you just see that, and he said where is it.  It just disappeared,  I wasn&#39;t paying attention to the speed of the craft or did I notice what shape it was I just figured it was a blimp but it was small and my son said it looked like it was oval.  There were no clouds in the sky and it was right over Elk Nek Elem.<n>

North end east of  I71 and west? of Westerville road. North of I270 and south of Polaris parkway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: I first saw it around 7:07 am.  When I saw it and for the entire duration of the event it did not appear to move, so it may have been there long before 7:07 am.  It may also have been there after 7:12 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: It was a very bright slightly crescent shaped cylinder with tapering ends when I was observing it from west of its location.  As I moved northwest and then to the north of it it became just a bright dot like I was looking at one end of it.  As I moved to the east of the object it disappeared from sight.  I don’t think it moved, it just wasn’t visible from that direction.  What is odd is that the object was visible with the sun BEHIND it and became invisible when I got to the north and east of it.  That indicates to me that the light wasn’t a reflection of the sun, but something coming from the object itself.<n>

I went to the north side of my house and looked up and I saw these lights that were pulsating, sort of like the phoenix lights, but rapidly.  I stood there in awe looking at this object and it just continued very slowly right above the tree tops.  It moved without any noise and I continued watching it for approximately five to six minutes.  I then heard what I thought may have been a semi idling down, but the object was no longer visible to me.  I kept looking in the direction, but the object was no longer there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The fireball was about the size of a nickel, if I held it out extended from my body, and had a long trail of fire about 15 to 20 times the size of the ball. The tail seemed to emit sparks as it streaked down. The fireball just disappeared approx. 500 ft from the ground. It looked like a meteor but thought it would be wise to report incase of other reportings from the area. It was dark out so I had a very good view but the event only lasted a few seconds<n>

They usually are in the same place each night but they do change position slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve been told that communication satellites are stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These move occasionally.  One night I watched them for about an hour, and the one I was watching eventually moved off into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve heard that Neillsville is a hot spot for UFOS because for the magnetic polarity that is part of the glacial formations around the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a bombing range located in Pittsville that is about an hour away, so it could be part of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are now about 12-15 of them that appear every night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I cannot figure out is, if they are UFOS, why are they appearing every night, and what would 12-15 UFOS see in Neillsville?  On the other side, why would a communication satellite look like a pulsating disco ball that changes color, and why would you need 12-15 of them over a city with a population of about 2,500 in the middle of Amish farm country?  I’ve lived here for about 14 years and never saw them till this Spring and now they seem to be a constant in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’d love any input and opinions.<n>

Got my camera so I could enlarge. Put on night mode (Samsung Galaxy 4).  Once enlarged I could make out the shape and lights much clearer.  Disc shape with top and bottom domes.  I also saw what looked like little stars or balls of light around it coming and going (almost reminded me of swarming mosquitoes), one turned a bright red for just a second.  Kept moving in a line further away until I could not see anymore (took about an hour from when I first noticed it).   Disappeared out of sight or went behind trees I could not tell which happened first. Lucky to see it by about 12:40 it became overcast in our area.<n>
9/23/13 22:00|Defiance|OH|Sphere|Minutes|Blue/White sphere over woods.|2/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107463.html|217|ndxe201309| Blue/White sphere over woods<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always been a down to earth person with the attitude that if something can&#39;t be proven, it&#39;s probably for a reason.  I have a difficult time saying I believe in a god.  I think the vast majority of sightings are a hoax, or a case of someone wanting to see something that it&#39;s clearly not.  I would have classified UFO&#39;s with bigfoot in a list of fairy tales, if I didn&#39;t experience the story I&#39;m about to write you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last year I was traveling down an old country road with a friend of mine.  It was a normal night, and I certainly didn&#39;t have anything like UFO&#39;s on my mind.  When we were about half way down the road, I notice a bright bluish/white light over the woods.  I instantly thought it was a police helicopter hunting for marijuana plants in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, I noticed something seemed off.  I instructed my friend to stop and shut his car off, and we proceeded to roll down the windows.  The events that happen next occur extremely quickly.  I point out to my friend that the object was completely stationary, making no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time, he remains completely silent.  I can only guess he is as puzzled as I am by whatever we were watching.  The distance from the road to the woods is about a football field.  During this time, there were no crops obstructing the view of the woods.  The object appeared to be hovering directly over the middle of the wooded area.  I can only estimate it was hovering about 25yards above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d like to take second to note that these distances might not be completely accurate.  To be honest, I was a bit shocked about the whole event.  Even now, my friend refuses to speak too much about it.  Continuing the story, within a few seconds of us both sitting in silence, transfixed on this unknown flying object. The light went completely dim and we witness it dash off, horizontally, at an indescribable speed. The lights went dim before it actually took off, yet it left behind a colorless trail o! f some sort, and I could even see it&#39;s silhouette for a fracti! on of a second before it completely went out of sight. I apologize for not being able to provide any type of image. I just needed to tell this story to someone.  I can say with absolute certainty that I will never experience another event like this in my life. I can only re-live the moment as a memory. I felt as if I had to tell this to someone, since it was beyond spectacular.<n>

MST. Las Vegas, NV I went out front to smoke a cigarette when I was joined by my mother we noticed 2 lights pulsating all colors of visible light one high and far north the other west was not much higher than the background mountains and was moving slowly south it maintained altitude speed and direction until it crossed into the backyard and was no longer visible due to rooftops and trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object was moving away and north we determined this by it becoming more and more faint and decending and moving right (north north east) at a slow pace. Seconds after the second object moved out of view a third object just appeared in the same place the second object was sighted it too was pulsating all colors of visible light went from a hover to moving in exactly the same way as the second object same alt., Speed, and direction a civilian Jet flew under the third object in no more than a minute it disappeared in the same place as the second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:28 P.M. MST the first object fell below the buildings and trees of the city what seemed over Creech AFB. all 3 objects all displayed the same color and flash pattern. All the objects seemed to be a great deal larger than any aircraft in the sky, a plane overtook and passed under object 3 during the sighting. This is not the first time unusual lights have been observed in these places.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At this hour I was not used to seeing stars in that location and it was in the wrong place to be an airplane as the flight pattern for the airport is above my house.  This light was many miles to the east closer to the mountain that is approximately 10-15 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This Light is what is commonly called the “fireball UFO’s”.  It was an orange orb seemed to be glowing from the inside.  That’s the best way I can describe the glowing light.  This did not have a trail like a real fireball or meteor would.  I am used to watching the sky at night as I often do and when the meteor showers are in duration I actively watch them.  This was not a meteor because of the deep orange color and the lack of trail or tail.  This orb was also moving way to slow to be a meteor or an airplane.  I watched this for about a minute and a half as it appeared to be moving south west.  After watching it for a minute and a half, the orb suddenly blinked out.  Like as if someone had turned off a light with a switch. Just like that it was gone.  I watched for another 10 minutes just to see if anything would come back and it did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it disappeared, I started eliminating reasons for its sudden disappearance.  It did not go behind view of any building as it was too high for its location and there was still plenty of room before it would have gone out of view by going behind the apartment building to the east of the one I live in. If I were to guess, if the orb wouldn’t have blinked out and continued at the same speed, it would have been another 3 to 4 minutes before it would have gone out of view behind the building. It also did not go behind the mountain range both because it was heading the wrong direction to do so and it was higher than the highest peak that it was around as I could see the outline of the peak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had this type of encounter before. It was about a year ago and the orb was directly overhead. It glowed from within just like my encounter a year ago and was the same darker orange in color as the encounter a year ago.  Unfortunately, I was unable to enter a report at that time and no longer know the details as far as time and date.  However, it seemed to be the same type of UFO as then.  I don’t view it as being a meteor or an airplane therefore it is an unidentified flying object in my book.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look forward to hearing what you think at the NUFORC.<n>

In a triangle formation, At first it looked like a fire work but it was standing still in mid air for awhile. The bottom right object was fading away and reappeared east of the formation. Then quickly moving side to side. It kind looked like it had tail at the end of the object. It quickly moved back to its original spot in the triangle formation. There was a helicopter flying around the object and soon there were several after the three objects disappeared.  That’s how low the objects were to the ground. We could visually see the helicopters. Took a picture of it with phone and will send it in. Looked on net for others who might have seen it with no luck. Also there was a car that lost power near our intersection, they thought they ran out of gas, put gas in and that didn’t work. The car did manage to start after awhile. And our car that was parked outside, lights did not seem to be working but work! ed afterward. Weird stuff. First time we ever experienced something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It disintegrated into several smaller pieces before reaching the ground.  It was across town, possibly over a large lake.  The light was bright enough to be seen out of the corner of my eye gaining my full attention.  It lasted long enough for me to yell for my friend to look and also see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I lay down on the garden long chair, as has been a usual thing this Summer and which also blocks out a street light by doing so (yard fence in the way).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 20:40 I saw what looked 100% like a satellite, crossing above me heading North to South. Brightness, movement speed etc were perfectly normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved overhead and down, to approximately 35 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then stopped, completely stopped its travel and sat in the sky motionless to the eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The luminance was exactly the same for the next full 1 minute as when it had been travelling. Then, still without moving, it slowly faded in brightness til fully disappearing, taking approximately 20 seconds to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mention the experience, because Austin Texas is only a few degrees from due South of us here in Oklahoma and usual satellite orbits can place their viewing to many hundreds of miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The stopping has never been witnessed before, though fading can happen sometimes depending on viewing time after sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m well versed in satellite spotting, with a favourite being the ancient Atlas Centaur 2, using www.satview.org to determine viewing time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regarding recognising aircraft, I have extensive experience of aircraft identification over my 44 years, with many years of R/C aircraft building and having lived on the flightpath to Manchester Airport in England before moving to the USA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clouds moved in over the next few minutes after the event and i&#39;ve been unable to view the sky for the rest of the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stared at this light for a few seconds then notice 2 less bright light approaching the first making a triangular shape.  After a minute or two the other two lights stayed and the  Original light vanished at a blink of an eye. My second sighting happen about 4 days after driving home from work I looked up at the sky an noticed this Bright Orange Light in About the same position it had been the last time.  After a about 2 minutes it again disappeared. Now the third time saw this light I knew where to look an around the time I should look because I noticed it appeared at around 20:00 and 20:45 this time it was not a Singular light but instead it was  in a Triangular Shape with 2 other lights. I Watched the 3 lights Hover over the Northern Sky an about 5 minutes later two of t! he lights branched of in different directions one flew overhead the weird thing is it was only one light and it moved silently trough the sky(I thought it was a helicopter again)  Then the main light I have witnessed just vanished.( I have lived close enough to O&#39;Hare to differentiate a Plane/helicopter From a Star and this Light is Neither)<n>

One of the lighted ovals disappeared and then came back.  Observer 1 then yelled for the others to come and see. It was about 2 miles away in the denver metro area and about 2 miles up in the sky.  Observer 2 saw three orange ovals.  They were going in a circle and then some disappeared and then came back.  After that they all disappeared and did not return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer 3 went outside when observer 1 called and saw three comet like objects circling one another.  Objects were disappearing and coming back before finally vanishing all together.  The objects seen were a very large size.  If all observers could guess how large the objects seemed to be they would all say they objects were about each the size of half the moon.  We all observed this north east of where we were at.<n>

I knew it could not have been a comet or an aircraft because it didn’t have a tail and both lines were the same length and there was an aircraft heading toward it from the south.  The object was heading due west, with a slight turn towards the north.  There was a lighter glow in the front of it which was the very reason I looked up to see what was leading it. But then it vanished or perhaps cloaked itself.  The small aircraft kept coming due north and could have crossed paths.  I wonder if the pilot saw anything!<n>

The brightness only lasted about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was a metallic craft which was reflecting the setting Sun.  After the first 10 seconds, the brightness started to diminish.  The object was extremely high in the shy (Approx. 50 degrees up moving in the Southwest direction) and my thinking at that point was that I was watching the Sun reflect off the International Space Station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the brightness diminishes, I could see that the object seemed to be round in shape, but very small because of the distance.  I was able to visually follow the object for about 60 seconds, as it got smaller and smaller until it went out of sight due to distance.  I estimate that the object disappeared at about 30 degrees from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that I witnessed the ISS but was not sure because of the shape.  When I returned home, I checked the orbital direction of the ISS.  I found that it was not close to my location and that it was orbiting in the Northeast direction.  The object I saw was travelling in the Southwest direction.<n>

I watched it move slowly from north to south. I called my 18 year old son in to look at it too. He said it could be a jet and my 15 year old son said he thought it was a missile.  It was a sparkling ball with an orange tail behind it.  It went across the sky until it disappeared behind the mountain range.  Within 5 minutes, I saw a jet following the same course in the same direction. I don&#39;t know if the jet was trying to follow the fireball or is it was unrelated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It slowly moved across the sky and became lower in the sky where it became obscured by trees.  We were looking at it through a very good pair of binoculars and the lower it went in the sky you could see that it was oblong and you could clearly see the different colored lights.  I went in around 9:30 p.m.,  however my son drove out to another location to see it better and he watched it for at least another hour where he said it slowly went across the sky, then just dropped down behind the mountain.

Both of us came out and saw the lights but realized it was not a meteor shower but lights blinking on and off in a stationary position.  The three of us continued to stare at the object.  There was not a sound coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent my dad in to get a pair of binoculars and we looked at the object carefully with them.  We discovered the lights were not blinking on and off as we thought but were dimming and then brightening.  When they were dim you could not see them with the naked eye.  The lights circled a disk shaped black mass that seemed to create a void space in the sky yet at times it seemed almost transparent.  It was saucer shaped with the lights on the perimeter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the lights appeared to be white there was one white light on the top as we were able to view it as it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten to twelve minutes the object started to move directly north toward town.  It moved slowly with no sound. It looked like it just floated away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since there was nothing to use as a reference I would guess it was between 50&#39; and 100&#39; in diameter.  As it moved north, it appeared to be almost at tree top level around 60&#39; to 100&#39; and the body seemed to turn translucent looking like a frosted glass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total time viewed was about fifteen to eighteen minutes.&#34;<n>

It sounded like an electronic fax signal only much louder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the sliding door of my bedroom that opens to the outside.  I live on the edge of a 675 acre natural area.  There was nothing out there, no visible lights or vehicles.  The single long electronic signal was followed by a long sequence of signals that sounded like morse code, very crisp and loud and almost metallic.  The sound seemed to be coming from all around.  I could not see the sky over head because I was standing under a porch roof.  I was considering walking out into the yard so I could see what was over the building when the sound suddenly stopped.  It was then dead silent.  No sounds of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a few seconds I heard the fax signal and then the morse code sound coming faintly from a distance in the northwest.  Then it was gone.  There was no visual phenomena associated with the sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again this morning on October 8, 2013, I was awakened at 1:57 am by the tail end of the fax-like signal, followed by the loud morse code like signals.  Again I went to my door and opened it.  There was nothing visible, just the sound enveloping me from all directions, very loud.  The sky that was visible to me from the porch looking north was clear and stars were visible.  I was afraid to go out into the yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2:04 am the signals stopped suddenly, followed by dead silence.  Then in a few seconds they were repeated coming very faintly but discernibly  from the northwest.  Again, there was nothing visual to associate with the sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood at the opened door and continued to listen.  Whatever was emitting the signals was travelling northwest and repeating them at intervals, because I heard another set coming even more faintly as if even farther away.  Then I could not hear anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived here eight years and am very familiar with the local sounds.  This is totally unlike anything I have ever heard.  The quality of the sound is particularly unique as it seems to come from all directions  in the immediate vicinity.  I felt cocooned in the sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wondering if this is reportable as a possible UFO. These are not sight experiences, but they are so odd I am wondering if you may have received similar reports of sound experiences of unknown origin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an accountant, I have two master’s degrees, I am healthy, do not drink or use any substances, and I have no hearing abnormalities.  And I am very curious to find out if you have received any other reports of this nature.<n>

At first they look like regular stars.  These objects are normally really bright white or a yellowish color.  They move in circles and zig-zag motions. Some of the objects move very quickly and others move very slow. Some of the objects seem to have flashing lights.  The flashing lights usually appear in blue, green, and red colors. I have seen the objects move fully across the sky as well. When they move like this, some fast and some slow. They have moved in all directions of the sky. Some are alone and others in pairs. I&#39;ve even seen four of them in a group moving together. The objects that cross the sky are white in color and resemble a star. Some dim and some bright. I&#39;ve seen them move across the sky and literally light up really bright for a split second and then keep moving. I have devoted a lot of my time to looking for these objects at night for the past year. My family has even been involved in tryin! g to figure these things out. The most incredible sighting was with my mother in Grundy Center. About 2am, we had seen several moving objects like we have in the past. But, out of nowhere an object appeared. It lit up bright for a split second and then shot flames like a fireball and left a small short trail of what appeared to be fumes. The object went so quick and went directly upward into the sky never to be seen again. That time we both literally ran for the house. We truly believe that these objects are not stars, satellites or any human/man made crafts. All summer we sat outside at night and looked up into the sky. Repeatedly week after week, we witnessed the same objects in a few different variations. We also have several witnesses some family, some friends and co-workers. Even the neighbors.<n>

The 4 lights were in the formation of a small rectangle moving together at the same speed.  they dimmed out for 2 seconds then returned at the same time almost as if paying through a cloud.  It was late at night but the recently full moon was lighting up the sky pretty well,  and it&#39;s a fairly clear night as  well.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this in my life.  We DO  have an airport local,  however this made no sound (all planes over here fly low enough to hear loudly),  plus these lights were TOO  low to be any  planes.  Very interesting!<n>

I live on the outskirts of a large residential area laid out around the base of Barrett Hill in Northern California.  At the top of Barrett Hill is the Jr. high School that I attended over 25 years ago.  The top of Barrett Hill offers a near 360 degree view of the night sky and is often my favorite spot to watch the Perseid Meteor Showers.  My sighting occurred around 11:30 pm as I stopped to have a smoke on my way home from a grocery run.  I had parked my car in the middle school parking lot and stepped out to have a cigarette.  As I was leaning against my car and gazing up at the night sky I became aware of motion and blinking lights about 3/4 of the way up from the horizon. I observed 8 to 10 alternating red/white blinking lights in a &#39;V&#39; formation moving at a slow but steady pace across almost 3/4 of my viewing angle of the night sky.  I have witnessed many aircraft lights as they travel at nearly 37,000 feet and also satellites as they travel above 160km as a reference.  This &#39;V&#39; formation seemed to be flying MUCH higher than a commercial jet and must have been utterly massive.  I&#39;m ended up walking from my car about 200 feet to the back of the school following the giant &#39;V&#39; formation until it travelled silently out of my view.  The total sighting lasted about 2:45 seconds.  Being an avid Coast to Coast listener my first guess as to the identity of the craft or crafts might be a fleet of autonomous high altitude lighter than air vehicles or black triangles.  I hope this account serves as one of many pieces of the puzzle that will eventually lead to &#39;Full Disclosure&#39;.<n>

About a good 5-10 seconds I was looking up at the sky, I saw a flying object with white fluorescent coloring flying upward toward the sky. It was difficult to make out the shape of it due to a poor perspective. I caught it (from my angle) coming out from behind a house (though i&#39;m sure it was much further away) and I have a hunch I caught a glimpse of it JUST as it was leaving the planet. I saw it for maybe just about one second traveling at a miraculous speed (for an object so far away) before it disappeared. After it disappeared it left two lines of light behind it that vanished after about 2 seconds. All I could make out was that from my angle it looked like a round ring shaped craft with a black dark spot in the center of it, so I guess you&#39;d define that as a spherical or circle-like object. Also, there was no sound being emitted from this object. At first I thought it! was just the moon, but then I looked around and realized that from the direction I was standing, the moon was 90 degrees to my left. So NO it wasn&#39;t the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were NOT stars<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving south on Hwy P, returning to Jackson from West Bend, WI.  It is quite dark on Hwy P, therefore the stars in the sky are more visible than they are in a more lighted area. My son pointed a group of lights in the sky that appeared to be flashing and floating slightly.  I am not at all a believer in UFO&#39;s or aliens, but this spooked me out.  If it were just one or two floating flashes of light, I would have assumed it was an airplane or two...but this was not the case.  There were multiple flashes of light. We looked west, towards the Town of Hartford.  In that direction, I counted more than 20 flashes of light that appeared to be moving.  There was an obvious difference between the stars are these entities of light. I have no idea what they were, but they were spread across the sky and moving.  The stars were stationary in comparison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached our home, there were a few Jackson Police officers along with a Washington County Sheriff who had pulled over a man who apparently been drinking.  I asked one of the officers if she had a moment as I was driving by.  She said yes, so I pulled my car over.  She came over and my children and I got out and began explaining what we saw.  By that time, the westward sky was blocked by trees, and the officer dismissed the handful of lights that were eastward as airplanes.  I could see she was not going to believe the story we were telling about the multiple lights west of us.  I then just asked if she knew of any military exercises in the area.  She replied that she knew of none. With that, we left and went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sons and I were having a hard time shaking what we had just seen.  It was NOT normal.  That is when I searched the internet for a log of UFO sightings.  I found this website and am taking the time to log this because what I saw was that strange and amazing.<n>

It was closely in-line with the lights from the Jay county grainery ( Anderson&#39;s) but was just off to the left and it was blinking red and yellow lights.  It was almost do West of where I was standing, which was my front yard,  Redkey, Indiana. It lasted for about 30 minutes and then slowly faded away to nothing.  It was not the lights from the grainery, not an airplane or jet.  Really, the only logical conclusion would be an unidentified object of some sort that just hovered.  I just checked again, (about 1 and 1/2 hours later) and there is nothing there.  No lights close to where the object was.  I would be curious to see if anyone else saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Shape of object appeared to be that of a jet completely engulfed in orange flames then seemed be a large burning meteor as I observed further.  Obviously it was neither, because it changed course to S/W direction while it also increased altitude.  Seconds later completely out of sight.<n>

Her words: &#34; I  saw the strangest sight in the sky as I drove to work tonight. In the western sky looking from the Auburn Blvd/Watt Avenue area, there were about 20 orange dots.  I keep thinking about it, where they Chinese lanterns, flares, planes or some sort of Soltice celebration?  Or, were they UFOs? They hovered in the sky, one falling to earth and turning white in color. I know that flares can be caught in an updraft and &#34;hover&#34;.  I saw a helicopter head that way as I drove and by the time I got to work at 8:55, poof, nothing in the sky.  Stars don&#39;t change color, and are not that bright that low. Planes at least move.&#34;   She called me at 8:30 PM and I witnessed the following:  &#34;I was able to see approx 10 orbs from the Foothill Farms area of Sacramento looking to the west toward Sacramento: 1 orange/white one with white orbs on either side and lower, and one above another - all very low in the sky - approx 30 degrees.  Then a string of 7 more above them.  I watched them for approx 15 minutes; I could only detect slight movement during those 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a friend in the Greenhaven area of Sacramento (south and west of Sacramento proper) but they didn&#39;t see anything. I called a friend in the Cal Expo area - she ran outside and spotted three  orange orbs hovering over Cal Expo, but when a plane approached the orbs, the orbs disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By 8:40, the lower string of orbs had moved closer to the ground and I lost sight of them by 8:49, although I could still see the higher string of 7 and the one orange/white one lower in the sky.<n>

I was driving westbound on Auburn Blvd near Norris.  The  orange dots were low in the sky and not in any uniform formation.  I immediately called my mother and she in turn called a friend. All 3 of us saw the same same thing from 3 different locations within Sacramento , CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been going over all of the possibilities in my head as to what t this could have been. h Te sun had already set and there was no sunset after glow.  We do have an airport, but even if it was planes lining up to land, they would be moving and not that close together. Maybe it was Chinese lanterns for a soltice celebration?  Did our local military drop flares from an aircraft?? One of the orange dots actually started to &#34;fall to the ground.  It turned white in color and stopped falling and hovered in place. All of the other orange dots stayed in place.  One of the dots had 2 smaller dots that moved erratically around it in very close proximity.  When I finally got work I could no longer see the dots in the sky.  On my way to work, I had to make a turn onto another street going southbound and that is when I lost sight of the dots.  My mother and her friend both kept watching them. I saw a helicopter, possibly local law enforcement or the news, travel at a high rate of speed towards the dots.  My mothers friend said she saw a plane approach the dots and they just went away. I don&#39;t know if they flew off or just vanished.  I will try to get clarification.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here are some final thoughts: I drive a sports car, which means it sits very low and the windshield has a limited view.  These dots were not that high up, but not ground level either.  My mothers friend lives near the Capital City Freeway (business 80] and Cal Expo. This means there is a lot of light pollution, and these things were very visible in the sky to her.  I have looked online at the local news sites, nothing is mentioned.  I even looked at the airport website, no mention of any major events that would require 20 planes to be in the area.  There were about 6 planes that landed in the time frame this took place.  I don&#39;t know where else to look for answers. I am trying to be logical, but this just baffles me.  If it was actual alien UFOs, awesome, if not, then ok, but what was it?  Curiosity is killing this cat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time and energy. Credit to Coast To Coast AM for turning me on to you.<n>

It was by no means a star and was not blinking like an airplane.  The light it emitted was very bright and large.  At first the odd shape was heading Southwest, then it changed directions and started to go West.  The weird thing was though, was that it would stop in the middle of the sky and just suddenly hover there for a few minutes.  We stopped, jumped out of the truck and proceeded to record a quick video of it.  We were shocked as it flashed blue, white and red very quickly in the video.  We hopped back in the truck and started moving again, trying to get closer although it was dozens of miles away in the air.  When we stopped again to gaze at the orb of light, it hovered again over a mountain and begin to suddenly go out like a light switch had been flicked.  It eventually disappeared, but we were all pretty shaken. In many of the pictures the light seems to be a sphere of some sort, moving in small circles while still hovering in the same spot.<n>

It appeared to slow down each time while glowing which makes sense do to speed and atmospheric resistance.

On the way there we noticed a bright, white light in the eastern sky which appeared to be stationary over the mountains.  We thought the light would be gone quickly but it remained in the sky for about 2 hours or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called a local radio station to report it and the man who answered said he saw it too this morning but it looked red (most likely due to the sunrise).  He thought it was a planet but it was too large to be Venus or any other planet or star.  It was about one tenth the size of the moon seen in the Western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the object appeared to move higher in the sky but without much lateral motion. When we started our walk we talked to some balloonists who were getting ready to launch and they had been watching it for some time as well and said they didn’t know what it was but suspected it was a weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were four balloons that launched in the park and they quickly moved north and out of sight, but the object over the mountains remained where it was without much movement up down or to either side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got home we looked at the object with binoculars of 30-50x and it appeared to be spherical, extremely brightly lit (since the sun was behind the mountains and hence behind the object).  It looked like the inside of a led flashlight with little brightly lit circles inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many at least three other people at the park saw the light but we did not get their names.  We took a photo with our camera phone which will be e-mailed to you but it was indistinct and showed no detail.<n>

I saw these 3 things hover silently for about a minute, the dogs were going nuts, whining and crying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then just like that they disappeared!

Looking like they came from the sky.  We briefly ignored the bright green flashes assuming they were just a weird tint/minds playing tricks on us about lightning. Afterwards, we noticed several red flashes as well (each flash lasting in about 6 or 8 second periods). We went outside to check, and asked several people if they saw the lights, and they saw them as well, and the lights changed to a bright yellow, and seemed to originate past the W.E. dubois library at center of campus. It was consistent flashing. I asked if maybe they were fireworks, but it was raining, and it was flashing too much to be a fireworks show. And a firework at 2:30 in the morning makes no sense.<n>

This light object also appeared to have a metalic look to it as well as a greenish white glowing light.  It swayed and hovered and pulsated while slowly moving in a circular motion after swaying.  It continued to move higher in the sky over a range of ten minutes.  I also noticed an airplane about 5 miles away with its blue lights heading toward the Duluth Airport a this time as I am looking at this strange object glowing greenish white and no sound. I go outside several times in the AM due to chronic pain and to have a smoke.

I couldn&#39;t stay in the middle of the road so I turned into a neighborhood and parked,got out and looked up.  We watched 1-3 flying objects turn into about 9 and they all flew in different directions.  As we stood there I made sure to watch closely to see if they were falling or flying and they certainly were flying.  After about a minute they started disappearing,however 4 of them remained for another 3 minutes.  2 of the objects stayed very close together,the other 2 were not very far behind.  We watched them just disappear and stood there for a few minutes in disbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes we live near LANCASTER AIRPORT, I know what aircraft looks like in the day and at night and this was not a PLANE.<n>

The light was approximately ten to fifteen miles away. As I watched, the light moved laterally, left along the horizon. I told the person I was with to look, and she also watched as the light reversed direction and started moving right. At first we thought it could be a helicopter, but then the light started moving left to right in a speed and manner that was unlike any helicopter I had ever seen. As we continued to watch, the light got significantly brighter and the started to rise before completely flashing out. We watched the area for a little while longer when the person I was with spotted another object. This object moved very similar to the other one, and we continued to watch both. The flashing of the lights was actually very similar to what I have seen certain planets do on a clear night. They would flash from  red to white to blue and then co! mpletely disappear. Shortly after both lights flashed out we observed another light coming fast from the south of our position. We watched and listened but could not hear any sounds from what I thought was a plane due to the tail lights. This third &#34;plane&#34; had one bright light at the very front and two lights to the rear and left and right respectively. It was completely silent, but was not flying at a height altitude like commercial airliners. After we saw the &#34;plane&#34; go over us towards the direction of the lights, we both decided to get back into town.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While observing it, we noticed that it was flying upward towards space and suddenly disappeared.  We observed many planes in the area and their pattern to determine that this was not a regular aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few moments later, we noticed two more coming up above the trees.  They traveled in the same direction as the first, and disappeared almost in the same area as the first.  Each red ball disappeared slightly apart from the others. From our angle, it appeared to be a ball of fire, not huge, smaller than an observable plane.  Within 15 minutes or so, we observed 6 of these red balls follow the same path and watched them disappear.<n>

The object dispersed these balls at least twice before it passed out of my field of vision.  Its speed was relatively slow.<n>

These were not afterburners, flares or swamp gas.  I got them on video but it is about the quality you would expect, no good.  A couple of flickers, thats it.

I viewed them from the South facing North while they moved in formation East as the size stayed constant they neither grew or shrunk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the area several cars stopped in the middle of the road and also observed the event.  I viewed a single aircraft believed to be a passenger plane flying the opposite direction below the objects.  The plane was half the distance to the ground that the spheres where, with me looking up at a 70 degree angle.  I believe the objects were at 40,000ft to 60,000ftt if the plane was at 20,000ft or 30,000ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a period of about 5 minutes the lights began to flicker out much like if you shut off a light switch.

We headed out onto the lake at approx. 19:40. I then moved my boat from Safety Island towards the North shore close to the East end of Celina.  The other boat was still heading West towards us when we arrived at the North shore as they had left the dock sometime after us.  My father called my brother to find out where we were and proceeded to tell us that he saw something in the sky towards the South shore at approx. 21:00.  We looked and immediately saw it directly South of Celina over the South Shore.  This would have been roughly a mile from my position, but we had a clear view over the lake.  The object started out as a ball of orangish light.  It appeared to drop some type flares every 2 or 3 seconds, lasting about 30 seconds. The flares appeared as if the kind that comes out of a roman candle.  Then the object would speed up and it looked as if there were two afterburners on each side and a large flame coming out of the backside of each on.  The flames coming out were very long.  The flames would go away, and the object would go back into just one light, dropping the flares again. This happened several times. One time the object started to change colors. I had my IPod and was able to catch the object with the flames visible and also when it was changing colors. I also took multiple pictures, however being that it was an IPod, completely dark and the distance, it is not the greatest quality. But you can incredibly see the ball change colors and throw the jet trails. Also, the object stayed in maybe a quarter mile area, did not come any closer or farther, and flew very tight, spinning and turning patterns. Could this have been UAV?  Possibly. I have no way to know.  I do have video and photographic evidence.  I searched the internet, but not find any postings or information! about this happening.  The entire event lasted around twenty minutes and the light just disappeared.<n>

Can you or someone please give me and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more people too, but get us an explanation or answers?  I don&#39;t know about other people, but I really would like to know what it is!  I have been seeing this object now for about 2 months now. I&#39;ve noticed that it&#39;s usually there about the same time of the day.  I&#39;m thinking that it&#39;s usually there about when the sun is setting or more around 8pm and is up there between 30 minutes to an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night I had got my digital camera out to try to take picture&#39;s of it, but then right as I was about to take a picture my camera had died on me. I have took some other pictures, but for some reason I couldn&#39;t seem to get the flashing colored lights and it just looks like some bright light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was hoping that maybe I could see it a lot better and get some picture&#39;s. Then if it turned out to be something that I needed to report, like an alien space craft then I would. Or if it just happened to be something explainable like some type of air craft that was from here on earth, then I would just let it go and not really say anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well right before my camera had died on me, I had saw some red, white, and blue, flashing lights on the object. The flashing lights looked like they were going back and fourth from side to side. I think that was the only color&#39;s that I have seen on it flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The part that sucks though is that I didn&#39;t get a chance to see anything else. I had only got to see those flashing lights when my camera was zoomed in, but not from the naked eye. When you look at it normally all you can see is a bright light or lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think that if you just kinda glance at it, it only looks like it&#39;s one big bright white light, but if you look at it a little longer or try harder to look at it, it looks more like several bright white lights. It&#39;s not until you use something else to try to look at it closer that you can tell it has other flashing colored lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every time I see the object that is hovering in the sky it kinda looks like it is the same shape as a flying disk, but then again I can get a chance to see it very close to confirm it. I really hope that someone from this company will try to investigate these sitings that I&#39;ve been seeing, and get us some answers! Thank you for your time.<n>

I was at the student union (SUB) earlier and then I had an urge to go outside and look towards the east (Sandia Mountains).  It was approximately 1900 and the sun was setting.  The sky conditions were clear with no cloud cover in any direction northeast to southeast.  There was a flock of common house finches in the tree with a flurry of chirping at this time.  I had an urge to look towards the east and saw an extremely noticeable bright object in the sky.  The object was approximately 13-15 degrees in the sky and was bright white.  It was also in the form of a cylinder about so, I first though it was Comet ISON.  Of course that was ruled out as it is scheduled to pass in Nov, and then I ruled out aircraft types, and balloons.  The object remained in the same spot on the sky for the ent! ire duration of 15 min.  The object was as bright as a sewing pin head held at arm’s length for the duration.  It seemed to be above the traffic departure pattern at the airport, estimated at 15000’.  Aircraft traffic taking off towards the east did not seem to be near it vertically or horizontally; however, I can bet radar would have picked the object up. The object also seemed to be friendly and there were times during the duration I saw other smaller white objects around it for less than a second. When I asked if they could change colour they did at the time period of 12-15 min. The object became more circular and changed from bright white to red orange to red then faded out to look like a very dim white star. I did not observe the object after 15 min. I normally do not make reports unless the object is a bit more significant in scale/size/colour/duration; although I see objects usually once a week or more. I also have an extensive military aircraft background and have seen! objects of significance while on missions. Lastly, I want to ! give my sincere thanks to you for providing this service and thankful you are also featured on coast to coast often!<n>

The second pair was to the left, and lower in the sky than the first pair, but they were all in the same vicinity.  The brighter pair started to fade and eventually disappeared into the night sky.

The night was clear and no clouds.  The lighting in that part of town is low light. not many businesses around.  What caught our attention was how silent it was and you could tell it was lower than the stars and higher than the trees that lined the road.  We looked for planes and saw none.<n>

One of the F15&#39;s made a quick bank toward the teardrop shaped extremely bright desending craft which didn&#39;t look like anything my friend or I have ever seen in the clear sky over this city.  The object was gone as fast as it came well before the jet could turn to chase it.  About 10 minutes after sighting the sky was full of military aircraft to the south of the city.  We have a major Air Force base hear in Tucson, most of the aircraft came out of that base to search for whatever the unusual object was or where it went.  I checked with our local tv news channel to see what they could add, they recieved many calls but could not get any answers from local sources.  I&#39;ve been a pilot flying in this area for many years as well as around the World and have never seen an object flying as fast and change directions as quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

9/20/13 20:00|Bluffdale|UT|Fireball|20-30 seconds|Amateur astronomer sees bright, stationary object next to a star begin to move and descend behind the mountains.|9/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102691.html|337|ndxe201309| Amateur astronomer sees bright, stationary object next to a star begin to move and descend behind the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While pursuing my hobby of astronomy, I was observing westward to see Venus and Saturn shortly after sunset. At this time of year, there is also a bright star in the vicinity called Arcturus.  As I turned my gaze to this star I was amazed to see what appeared to be another bright star sitting next to Arcturus, of approximately the same size and brightness. After several seconds, I realized this star was not a star at all as it suddenly started to move. It descended in a directly vertical direction and appeared to be thousands of feet above the ground.  My next thought was that it was a high altitude flare, which I have seen before, but the brightness of the object did not change or fade away like flares do.  This also does not explain why it was completely stationary in the sky before it began to &#34;fall&#34;.  I also considered that it might be a meteor, but the object was moving too slowly, perpendicular to the horizon line, and did not change in brightness, or break apart like a meteor.  As the object continued to descend, I walked over to a pick-up truck and stood in the truck bed so that a nearby fence would not obscure my view.  I lost sight of the object behind the Oquirrh Mountain Range, where it almost certainly would have made contact with the ground a few seconds later (assuming it continued in its trajectory).  I am not saying it was any kind of extraterrestrial craft, but it was definitely strange and worthy of me reporting this event.  There were no other bizarre events surrounding this observation.<n>

I thought it may be aeroplane or rocket but within a second it lands in a field near my room.  I captured some of it&#39;s photograph by my mobile phone camera but soon it returned with speed.  I called my relatives, they came on terrace and saw the UFO too.<n>

My house is at the end of a cul de sac looking straight up the street with an unencumbered view of the sky.  I could clearly see Venus and several bright stars including one that was lower in the sky than Venus and to the north, but just as bright.  I watched this star or planet or whatever it was just hanging in the sky for at least 10 minutes when it started moving vertically.  It moved fast and steady on a seemingly straight trajectory until it quickly disappeared.  From the time it began moving until it went out of view was maybe 15 seconds.  There were absolutely no clouds so it couldn&#39;t have gone behind cover.  In fact, I watched several planes at high altitudes moving through the sky for several minutes after, hoping I would see it again.<n>

My wife, child and I from viewed this from inside our vehicle with the lights positioned directly ahead above the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other colors besides the white lights.  All lights  blinked in unison with a rough spacing of about a second.  Lights appeared to be in perfect horizontal line and were equidistant from each other.  Altitude believed to be approximately 1000-2000’ but that was approximating if it were a plane with lights, which is extremely unlikely.  Radio in vehicle was on and did not hear any airplane/helicopter sounds.  No background shape seen (if one even existed) as the lights were too bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lights were bright similar to that of looking at a search beam.  An attempt at following was not successful mainly due to many trees though headed west for about 5-10 minutes hoping to get a glimpse of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Contacted local sheriff’s department around 2100 EST and was told no other reports of the lights or planes known that were in distress.  Though this occurred seemingly above our neighborhood unfortunately, no one else seemed to see this event.  Posted to our community forum and another local forum and no one else saw anything.  No pictures taken unfortunately as I did not think quickly enough.  Checked online and there were a couple shots people have taken.  The light configuration is similar to this video http://www.ufocasebook.com/2011/videotassiesky.html but the lights that we saw blinked in unison and were very bright white.  In addition, where this person zoomed in with his camera we did not have to at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any insight of what I saw would be greatly appreciated.<n>

It is lit up differently on different sections.  It caught my eye, because its lights did not blink.<n>

Lots of planes fly near my area, and a couple passed by as the ball was flying around.I know it was not a plane.  I assume it was one object because I never saw two at once but with it weaving in and out of the clouds it is possible that there were more than one just not visable all at the once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside and came back out and tried to get video but it did not turn out.<n>

Back and forth but moving in a westerly direction.  At one point i saw what appeared to be a small bright light or orb shoot out from the center of the row and was shot west, with the light vanishing quickly after leaving the lights.  I used the tree line to be sure it wasn&#39;t me moving. I could see these lights through the pine trees; they were bright.  I have never seen this site before googling it tonight.  I did a search to see if there had been any other reporting of light formations like this.  It is 1:35AM now, i am going back out to see if it is still hovering, because i lost sight of it due to moving behind trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This would put it about 100 deg. true from our location.  I estimate elevation to be about 20 or 25 degrees, again approximately level with the rising moon at 9:25pm local.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object appeared to be moving WNW and I at first thought it might be an aircraft inbound to SeaTac.  The reddish color (more red than Mars and far brighter) had a quavering appearance.  Not flashing like aircraft strobes and not twinkling like planets or stars as affected by our atmosphere, but a semi-periodic variation from bright to not as bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the neighbor who joined me and observed the same and we were both struck by how red and unusual it appeared.  As we watched, it appeared to start moving to the east (as judged by standing in one place and referencing the eve of a 2 story house), then dimmed and disappeared over a period of 10 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This observation was very different than anything I’ve seen (satellite, Space Station, etc.)  It was brighter, redder, larger and had “non-conforming” motion.<n>

It was so bright.  There wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky. I could see every star.  It was a beautiful night.<n>

It was a crisp night and we were in a relatively quiet neighborhood.  A blue and green disc-like object floated down, there was no noise so we were confused as to what it was.  We assumed it was far away because of the lack of noise.  But when it stopped moving, we realized it was only about a mile away from us, and then hovered for around 3 minutes mid air.  The colors were emitted by a light that encompassed the entire craft, and it seemed like an aura and not light beams. It then lowered towards the ground out of our sight.  There was no noise coming from this object when it was lowering.  We were still on the patio 40 minutes later when a helicopter ascended from the same area.  However, the difference was that we could hear the helicopter as it was taking off and for the rest of the duration it was in the area.  The lights on the helicopter were colored red and yellow, and it was clear to what it was.<n>

There are also many questions and no answers regarding a &#34;private&#34; project on Lost Mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 19:30, I arrived at my good friend&#39;s house located in between St. Luke&#39;s Episcopal Church and Walmart, on the west side of Sequim, and started a conversation in the driveway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 10 minutes passed, my friend mentioned that he had seen another (suspected) &#34;drone&#34; this afternoon.  We discussed, in layman&#39;s terms, the unusual characteristics of these &#34;drone&#34; craft in regards to their appearance.  My lifestyle is that of a hermit, and yet this was the third person in the past week who has commented to me regarding these &#34;drones&#34; they have been noticing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 19:45, my friend noticed a bright white light on the horizon.  It seemed to be moving very slightly but not enough to be certain.  I suggested that it could be a brightly lit residence on Lost Mountain, or bright headlights on Lost Mountain, based on the direction and the distance away.  My friend countered that the houses on Bell Hill, which would be comparable in light output and in visibility, were barely visible at all despite being much closer to us.  I commented that the light appeared to have a lamp post underneath it which was definitely black in color.  My friend did not see anything resembling a post beneath the light.  I consistently did, however, and after adjusting my vantage point, I observed that the &#34;lamp post&#34; seemed to fade from black to invisible at a distance beneath the light approximately 3x the height of the white spot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked away for several seconds and consistently saw a sharply defined, straight, narrow, black vertical post or beam of some sort underneath the bright white spot, apparently attached to the base of the white spot.  The sky was partly cloudy with a mild northwestward breeze. We wandered elsewhere and the topic changed for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we returned to the driveway vantage point, a few minutes later, at the onset of dusk, my friend noticed that the bright light initially seemed to be gone, noticing a few seconds later that it seemed to have moved to a slightly lower elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed that it was not as bright as it seemed to have been before, perhaps contrasting its surroundings the same amount as it had been previously (As compared to most lights which increasingly contrast their surroundings as the sky turns dark and the lights &#34;take effect&#34;)  The brightness of the light seemed to be in relation to the sky around it, perhaps as a means of conserving onboard energy while maintaining consistent visibility during a test run.  This is purely my own hindsight speculation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend mentioned his need to visit the grocery store before it closes and reminded me of my own need to do the same, and for a minute or two we thought nothing of the white spot in the distance and focused elsewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned and began walking toward my car, my friend shouted &#34;Look at that, up there!&#34; pointing at first straight above us and following an aircraft headed northeast.  If directly above us were referred to as &#34;12:00&#34; using the position of the hour hand on a clock as an indication of its position, I saw what he was pointing at when it was between 1:00 and 2:00 position.  The object was a bright yellowish white light at an altitude comparable to where one might see an ultralight or possibly a hang glider, and it moved more rapidly than any aircraft I recall seeing before.  There was no flashing light on board as you would see on other aircraft; just a bright, yellowish white light moving rapidly across the sky in an almost perfectly straight line, headed northeast (slightly east by northeast).  I noticed a very slight sway side to side as it sped away.  Our vantage point was unique as we can presume that it passed straight over us, from Lost Mountain area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was a different hue, though, than the one we had seen shortly before, and I do not think either of us initially realized that the two lights could be related, despite the fact that the craft went in a straight line away from the area we had been observing initially.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After maybe 10 seconds of rapid flight straight away from us, we noticed that it seemed to suddenly slow down to an abrupt near-halt, as a red light onboard began to flash brightly, 500ms on, 500ms off, on off on off for about 2 minutes as it slowly got further away and seemed to be slowly descending, before disappearing as the lights seemed to shut off or be lost in the clouds.  It was extremely quiet, given its apparent altitude and velocity, although we both noticed a faint jet-like rumble briefly after it was already a few seconds away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first few calls that I placed to the hotline were mysteriously disconnected within the first few seconds; this is not a problem I often have to deal with.<n>

The object moved slowly in a straight line, stopped and stayed in place for periods of time (30-60 seconds at a time). It was far away, but closer than a plane.  When a plane came lose to the object, it seemed to disappear... Went away.  The object reappeared about 5 minutes later way over to the right if where it had disappeared.  Absolutely no sound.  Moved back and forth, slowly.  Stopped and was still for about 60 seconds before ascending at an angle up to the left then disappearing again. I lined the first sighting with my phone.  When it came back, I attempted to film again but my phone froze, completely, with a strange picture of a whitish object in the blackness.  I was unable to film the second sighting and had to restart my phone...  The picture tht had been frozen on the screen was nowhere to be found.  Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m interested to see if any other sightings were reported that night…<n>

It is bigger than airplanes.  I saw 2 airplanes near it and they seemed like 1/10th or far less than that, the size of whatever this thing is.  It looks like a star at first glance but you can see that it has some kind of wings.  It is perfectly round, like a classroom globe but shiny and with blue-ish wings, the rest is white or extremely shiny silver color. This was seen in the sky at 19:45-ish right now 19 September 2013.  Again, I don&#39;t know what this is, but it seems very large, too large to be a plain and much larger and nearer than any star I&#39;ve ever seen.<n>

There are others before and after, general scenery shots of the area being taken at the time.  We did NOT notice the orb when the pictures were taken.  Only after, looking at them October 1st, looking through photos, noticed the image on 7014 and then “discovered” the second on 7016 and pieced the sequence of events together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw these the other day, like I said looking through some pictures we took, taking a second look at 7014....what IS that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon&#39;s coming up and that isn&#39;t ....mars? “The thing is way to big.”  “My camera lens isn’t that powerful!” – blew it up and noticed the reflection of the moon on the left hand side of this perfectly round ball. What?  After a few minutes I check on the remaining photos in sequence, and notice on photo 7016 there it is again, and gone in the next shot 7017 taken a few seconds later. Not right after, as we were not taking pictures of this object (had no idea it was on the photo), we were taking pictures of the pink sky in the case of 7016 and 7017.  Again, if it was something floating in the air like a cloud or a balloon etc., shouldn’t it still be there 24 seconds later?  Moving!!

Between image 7014 and 7016 is only 40 seconds at that altitude, must equate to quite a distance in 40 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance travelled between picture 7014 (facing East) and 7016 (facing South) is quite large in a time of 40 seconds and results in a complete directional change (photographers vantage) from east to south. We had no chance of “seeing” this when we took pictures of the “beautiful moon” and “pink sky at night”.  This thing was moving too fast obviously. Again, we only noticed the (what I now call “the orb”) round “spot” on the first picture 7014 a couple of days ago and started questioning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have shared this with some family members here, they seem to agree there is something in the photo.  Of course they know me and it was interesting that my nephew said “if it was coming from someone he didn’t know, didn’t recognize the property, knew I wouldn’t have any interest in putting themselves “out there” he would have dismissed these images.  I might possibly have said the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Makes you reflect on the other stories you hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first shot (7011 through 7014) we are looking East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Picture 7015 moving from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pictures 7016 and 7017 are facing south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So a fairly large piece of sky for something to move so quickly across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How many miles at that altitude in 30 seconds!?  These pictures have good enough resolution to blow them up fairly large (you lose focus after a bit) but the shape is round.  No matter how big you blow it up, the edges don&#39;t distort. It isn&#39;t a cloud or a wisp of smoke.  The pink picture, 7016 shows the image quite clearly again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had no idea these images were on here.  Doesn&#39;t appear to be an &#34;airplane&#34; or &#34;swamp gas&#34; to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And the distance it moved it that time....no wonder the naked eye doesn&#39;t see this stuff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This isn&#39;t a joke...I have the original photos (date and time stamped) unaltered and no skills, software, time nor interest to play games.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well.....what do you think?

My partner ((woman&#39;s name deleted)) and I have recently seen a very bright “star” over the complex of wind turbines locally last week.  It was that bright we first spotted it from several miles away. Just sitting right over the wind farm complex.  Wasn’t there an hour later when we returned?  Then, when I came across these a few days ago….just kind of &#34;wigged me out&#34; and thought I&#39;d ask the opinions of your organization.  Actually having something in my hand like this that I KNOW without a doubt is real, has me now totally convinced there is some major stuff going on we’re not being made fully cognizant off.  I mean, come on!    How can we capture an image like this and the “gov’ment” can’t grab a pic or two and let us know what “they” think.  I’m getting some suspicious over here.

The sky was clear and blue with a few scattered white clouds.  I saw what I thought was a very large bright white star in the sky near the sun.  (About 4 times the size of a regular star, but in broad day light.  Bright white and perfectly round.) It was moving quite fast but in a stop/start sporadic path.  It would surge forward a few “inches” in my view, stop, then go again a few more “inches” in roughly a 45 degree angle.  I was not wearing sunglasses so this was not a reflection on a lens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 10-15 seconds until it started to enter a cloud, and was about to go out of my vision due to my house’s roof.  So I looked down for a moment and walked down my 3 steps so I wouldn’t lose it.  When I looked back up it was gone, and I stood for 5 minutes trying to find it again but could not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am General Manager for a local business almost 30 years old.  There was a white plane high in the sky a few &#34;inches&#34; from where the light vanished in a cloud.  This white plane continued on its path and did not seem to respond to the light.<n>

Intermittent patches of clouds sometimes obscured my view of the stars, but most of the time I had a spectacular view of the sky above a long line of storms to the north which stretched approximately from the mid-western states to western New Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was after a short period of cloud obstruction when the strange lights appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you were to mark a spot midway between a line joining the two stars at the end of the handle of the Big Dipper and draw a line perpendicular to and up from that line, the lights appeared on that line at a point about a third longer than the line joining the two stars.  They were slightly brighter than those two stars and appeared white.  At arm&#39;s length they were about a pinky finger&#39;s width apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m familiar with that area of the sky and knew immediately that they couldn&#39;t have been stars, planets, or any other celestial body.  My first thought was that they were satellites, so I watched them for any movement.  They remained perfectly motionless like stars for about a full minute.  Then briefly for several seconds, my eyes were drawn to a few flashes of lighting below.  Then when I looked back up, the two lights had disappeared.  I continued watching that area of the sky for at least 15 minutes afterwards but they never reappeared.<n>

I saw in the sky a bright orange light, about the size of two stars combined moving slowly to the south/east.  I went to grab a phone/camera and I was in the middle of the Apple IOS upgrade (the first day available) and then went to grab my thirteen year old daughters iphone and I did not have the pass code to open the phone.  Anyhow I went to my front door on the north and east side of the house to watch and it slowed and went to the west slightly and went blank.  Poof it was gone.  Wow that was cool I said to myself and I’m sure lots of people must have seen it.  But I haven’t found any info in my local area so thought I would add it to this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After a few minutes, it dropped straight down out of view behind the trees<n>

I was looking into the clear night sky, reminiscing of my childhood summer evenings.  Where I slept outside under the stars noticing the occasional satellite pass over, dreaming of seeing a UFO.  As I was looking to the North at the  handle of the Big Dipper I noticed what I thought to be a satellite traversing the night sky.  I pointed it out to my wife and she also took notice. As the perceived satellite headed in a North Easterly direction it abruptly made what looked like an almost instant 90 degree arc towards outer space.  It diminished to nothing at that point in about 1 second as it passed the 3rd star in the  Big Dippers handle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have inbound air traffic for Sea-Tac International airport.  I can tell you this was not a case of mistaken common phenomena in my area.  It was not a plane, jet nor meteorite (I have never seen anything burn up heading out of our atmosphere.  The object in question looked to be in a low Earth orbit.   It was definitely beyond the atmosphere of the planet.  Whatever IT was,IT was not conventional...<n>

Lights were going one after another for a few secs and then started flashing together and thats when the third light came up from our line of sight over the houses across the street.  As soon as we saw that there was 3 we tried to get on my truck to see better and they took off towards the south.<n>

My son is a 15 year old Caucasian male and I am a 42 year Caucasian female.  We were driving home from his volleyball league at night, heading north on route 675 close to mile marker 4 or 5 around Centerville, Ohio.  We saw something that looked like car headlights in the sky about the height of a cell phone tower.  It was up ahead on our left.   As we got closer we noticed it was too large to be a cell tower and we did not see any structure underneath it.  It was definitely stationary - not moving.  As we got up almost even with it, we noticed how large it was and how we couldn&#39;t see a structure underneath.  We couldn&#39;t see the actual craft, but could now see lights underneath as well - forming a large triangle.  All of a sudden it took off!  We pulled the van off the road, and my son took out his cell phone and tried to get a video as it went parallel to us for a second or two, then veered off perpendicular to our left - ! quickly.  We were stunned.  We wanted to report it right away in case more people saw it.  I think it&#39;s important to note that we have lived in the area for more than 13 years.  There is an Air Force base near us.  That being said, we know how planes, helicopters, fighters, bombers, etc. move in the sky - we see them very often.  I have never seen anything move like this object moved.  So unless it is part of some new, experimental military thing, I don&#39;t know what it was!  Another note, before this happened I was in the grocery store near where my son was practicing, and things just felt weird.  There was a policeman outside of the grocery as I came in ... not sure why, this is an extremely safe area of town.  Also the people in the store were acting strange - just kind of overly friendly.  I didn&#39;t even think about it until after we saw this thing in the sky on the way home.<n>

Moved almost straight up.  Moved in less than five seconds from roughly 20 to 45 degrees above where horizon would be if not interrupted by structures.  Stopped hovered and moved up and down about 10 degrees of elevation several times.  Disappeared below house and trees.  Went outside to see better.  It repeated same maneuvers before dropping out of sight.  It seemed less than a mile away but I saw no structure associated with light.  No sound.  Definite not a helicopter or fixed wing aircraft.  Looked like a firework but lasted too long, more than five minutes .<n>

At first there were 3.  Two were closer together and the third one was a few miles to the south.  I watched the two whilst my husband went to get my camera - a 4th one appeared just under the two I was watching as the other light a few miles to the south dimmed out.  2 others dimmed out until I was just watching the 1 light, it was stationary - my husband gave me my camera and I started filming.   As I was filming the light in the South appeared again very brilliantly - I filmed this one too.   We stood there just watching the light.  There were planes going by in the distance moving fast with blinking lights - we see these every night.  The difference with these other lights is that they shine so very, very bright, sometimes they dim or just blink out completely.   So far this year we have seen them 4 times now, all differ! ent nights, and with several witnesses.<n>

The time between them varied from 2 seci onds to 45 seconds.  Some were in pairs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived in the flight path of an airport for 15 years so I know what a plane or helicopter looks like high or low and it wasn&#39;t that.  They appeared about 2000 ft high.  They had no tails so I knew they were not meteors though they had the look of fire.  The total duration of time was less than 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called 911 and a local news channel and no one else had made any report.<n>

Ruled out landing lights from aircraft due to the fact object stayed in same spot for 20 mins.  Was not Venus because Venus was observed 20 degrees to the west north west.  The object was 3 or 4 times the size of Venus. Went into house to get the telescope and was gone for 2 mins and object was gone!  It could have been a satellite called OAO 3 Copernicus satellite put in orbit in 1972 but I&#39;m not sure of the observation time is. Any one else see this?  I saw the object in Olean NY about a month ago and it did the same thing!<n>

I estimate it was 10-15 miles away.  It was four times as bright as Venus (at the planet&#39;s brightest) to the naked eye.  I observed it from the Spring Valley area of Clearlake Oaks, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and got a pair of binoculars and could see the object was diamond shape, bright white, and seemed to be rapidly spinning.  For the distance the object was from me, it must have been larger than a Boeing 747 airliner.  As large as it appeared in my binoculars, I should have been able to discern structure but all I could see was very bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It remained stationary for 15 minutes and then slowly moved off to the NW.  It was then obscured by hills and I could no longer see it.  I could not detect any noise. It did not fit the profile of a helicopter, airplane, satellite, blimp, or Chinese lantern (it did not flicker.)  The date was one day away from a full moon, so there were relatively few stars visible.<n>

At the end of my street is a stop sign.  You can either turn right or left, and directly ahead of you is nothing but dense woods and trees.  Marshy land mostly.  There are no cell towers or street lights in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at the stop sign and noticed 3 orange lights above the trees.  They were very, very low so I knew that it was not a plane. Or any kind of aircraft for that matter. They were simply hovering.  They emitted a red orange glow and they were not in a straight line.  One sat above the other two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat for probably about 5 minutes and just watched.  They never moved.  I thought that maybe some towers has been built back there and they were just now lighting them up this evening, so I went on to the store.

The object did not turn an any direction, it moved one speed and not enough noise from the engine to disturb homes and nieghborhoods.  I work for the DOD and I know what we both saw.<n>

We had noticed a white light moving in the sky thinking it was just an airplane but had no sound, completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued watching it as it flew closer to us, I mentioned to him that the light is moving as fast as a jet airplane but did&#39;t see it&#39;s flashing marker lights.  This object had to be as high as the elevation of a jet airplane.  We continued watching it as it flew above us and we both knew it definitely had NO flashing lights and no sound at all.  We told each other that it was absolutely not a jet or any other type of human made flying object.  It continued flying away heading east towards the Middleport/Pomeroy (Meigs County) area, then I&#39;d say 30 seconds after it had flown past us the color of the object had faded from white to red. 5 seconds after it changed to red it slowly faded into the night sky.  Then my friend had noticed the exactly same red light ob! ject had re-appeared in a matter of 3 seconds was south as we were looking across the Ohio river.  Watching this same object in the sky after no more than15 more seconds it had unfortunately disappeared.<n>
9/17/13 20:00|Tumacacori|AZ|Changing|5 minutes|Bright Amber Light over the Tumacacori Mtns, near Tumacacori, AZ, Shape Shifting Back and Forth to a Large Triangle|9/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102104.html|404|ndxe201309| Bright Amber Light over the Tumacacori Mtns, near Tumacacori, AZ, Shape Shifting Back and Forth to a Large Triangle<n> <n><n> <n><n> Went outside with the dogs, just after dusk, at 7:55 pm Arizona Time, or 19:55  (7:55 MST).  Close to full moon was up in the East, about 2/3s of the way to Zenith.  Winds calm (reported as 3.7 mph WNW at Tubac), some scattered clouds in the sky, good visibility.  My viewpoint was 3 miles due E of the Tumacacori Mission in Southern Arizona.  Immediately saw a bright, wide amber light in the sky at about 20 degrees South of true West from where I stood.  It appeared to be right above the Tumacacori Mountains/Highlands in the Coronado National Forest about 6 miles away.  It hung just over a broad flattish area in between two small crests, at about 5500 feet altitude, although I cannot rule out that it was further to the WSW.  The object wasn&#39;t Venus because its size was too large and also too wide, too bright, and the wrong color.  I have observed inexplicable big and bright amber lights and displays a few times here beginning exactly three years ago this September.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, the bright amber light suddenly faded away, revealing two small dim white lights at the horizontal tips of the wide area, and a small red light somewhere in the center.  About 10 seconds later, the bright amber light gradually started to return, and, as it returned, it looked like there were 3 spokes of amber light radiating out at 120 degrees from another from a common center, close to where that red light had been.  This made the object resemble a triangle before it got so bright that I could not see any particular shape except one that was very bright but wider than tall.  I estimate the object was at least 100 feet wide, based on the size of other features on the Tumacacoris  (including a &#34;dry&#34; stone waterfall drop) with which I am very familiar.   It remained brightly lit for about one minute, then faded out quickly again (saw the small white lights at the horizontal tips again before it disappeared).  It then reappeared one more time just as! it had before, and repeated the sequence above.  When it faded away once again, I could see two small red lights on it that then faded away quickly.  I waited a minute or two to see if it would reappear, but it did not.    Checked the time;  it was 8:02 pm or 20:02 Arizona Time, so I viewed the object for about 5 or 6 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not hear any unusual noise,  just a little truck rumble from I-19 that runs past the Tumacacori Mission.  I can readily hear airplanes or helicopters traveling in that area, as noise echoes in the Santa Cruz Valley between mountain ranges.   Sometimes helicopters &#34;hang&#34; in place over the Highlands at night (due to smuggling route), but their lights flash, and they are up higher in the sky and nowhere near as big.  I visually scanned the North 2/3s of the sky, and did not see any other lights or unusual phenomenon (couldn&#39;t see the extreme South of the sky from where I conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up near a military airbase, have lived near flight patterns for three major airports, and have attended a few air shows with state of the art military aircraft.

Then the color of the light shifted reddish as it faded.  If I remember my physics correctly, that may be because it was traveling away from me.

I looked up in the sky to see a weird formation of what I thought was stars in the sky.  The odd star formation wasn&#39;t a constellation I had ever seen before.  It was two oddly shaped triangles right on top of each other, 6x dots in the sky that I thought were stars.  Another odd observation, though the dots almost were identical to the rest of the stars in the sky, they had a slight flicker to them.  One triangle looked like a small crooked Orion&#39;s Belt with two dots in a row with the third being slighting out of the straight line.  The other was a triangle with an elongated left hand corner.  After about 10 minutes of looking at the formation, the 6x dots very slightly started moving.  It was so slight I thought my mind was playing tricks on me.  Then they started moving in a slow motion most comparable to electrons, bu! t the motion was more random like fireflies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been giving my brother a play by play of what I had been seeing and then I coerced him to go outside to try and see what I was seeing, even though he was in Breckenridge MN.  I said he saw something similar but he saw red and blue lights.  After about 10 minutes,  I went inside to try and wake my wife up so she could also witness what I had been seeing.  I returned outside and I saw that the 6x dots had returned to their original 2x triangle positions.<n>

Had 7 lights on the underside all dim and light yellow.  About 8-10 feet high, enough for there to be inhabitants.  Side of the craft looked to be set at a 45 degree angle.  Lights were evenly spaced apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was riding my bike about to hit University when I saw what I thought was an air plane coming in for a landing in the west.  It took me a second to realize that there was no sound coming from it and it wasn&#39;t getting any larger and therefore was not an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped and listened a little harder for some sound and I noticed that the crickets and frogs were both silent in the area.  For a swampy area, I thought this was strange.  So I turned around and saw that this object was still hovering in the same area I saw before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it knew I spotted it and slowly maneuvered itself behind the treeline a second after I regained visual contact.  It went south.  Again, there was absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later down the road, I spotted a military cargo plane fly directly over me. It was heading south towards the area where I spotted the object.<n>

It was a typical night for us; we had just gone out to dinner and returned to her house at around 9:00PM.  Getting out of my car, my girlfriend pointed out what she thought was a crop duster in the distance to me.  We stood in her driveway just staring at the thing for quite a while as it flew in our direction.  As it got a bit closer, we realized something rather important:  it wasn&#39;t making any sound, and crop dusters are fairly noisy machines (not to mention crop dusters do not typically operate at night).  As it slowly came closer, we continued hypothesising what in the world it could be.  At one point, I even said &#34;it looks like a helicopter flying sideways or something&#34;, to which my girlfriend replied &#34;yeah, but I don&#39;t see any blades, and it isn&#39;t loud&#34;.  She had a good point there, a helicopter would have been rather deafening, but it was still across the street quite a distance from us at that point, so I figured there was still a chance it would be louder when it got closer.  Eventually, the thing flew directly over our heads only roughly 100ft from the ground.  Despite being in such a close proximity to us, the craft made only a very low, very quiet humming sound and produced no wind-- it just sort of glided over us at a very constant, very slow speed.  Whatever this object was, it was perfectly rectangular in shape, very thin-looking in proportion to its width, and had two equidistant white lights (one on each side of the craft) which faced forward rather than downward almost like circular car headlights.  Sadly, the thought to take a picture or video of this thing did not even cross our minds until after it had disappeared behind her house.  I know this sounds crazy, but we honestly did not even think to get any form of evidence of this thing as it was in our sight (plus, it was at night, so any picture or video would probably have looked like a dark blur anyway).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not claiming that this was uncountably an alien UFO, but whatever it was, we saw it.  We saw what we saw, and nothing can change that.  It was amazing, it was breathtaking, and for some reason we were completely unafraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The light was in the Western sky.  It seemed to be constant (not flickering) or anything.  I pointed it to a fellow coworker and they said it was probably a satellite.  It was so bright and 4 times the size of the other stars in the sky.  I have seen a satellite before, and this was NOT a satellite, however I do not know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch it off and on as I was at work.  It didn’t seem to move at all.  It was a very clear night and you could see a few stars, but this was nothing like I have seen before. It was so bright.  Between the time I noticed it and the last time I looked out approximately 40 minutes had past.  The last time I looked out it was gone (at 2130).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reappeared the following night around the same time, and at the same spot.  This time it was still there when I left work at 2230 but it had moved further down the road, more in the south, over trees in the far distance.  I went down the road and tried to take a few pictures and a couple of videos with my cell phone but it was hard to capture as there was no zoom on my phone for the video.  It appeared to slightly change shape as I watched it.  I watched it for a good 10 minutes, and went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area I work in is towards the outskirts of town in a rural area.  I have not seen this again.<n>

I saw 5 flame-colored orbs rising over a line of trees in the formation identical to that of the number 5 as it appears on dice.  That is: 2 orbs in front, one orb centered between the two in the middle, and two orbs in the rear that were even with the two in the front.  They were in a definite formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that they were military planes or helicopters, but they made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved silently across the sky from South to North.  Then the middle orb moved out of line and advanced toward the orb positioned in the front left.  They appeared to make contact with each other and the center orb flickered out. Immediately after that the remaining orbs began to fade out one by one until the front left orb was the only one remaining.  That one floated on for a few seconds alone then it also faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects faded out with an appearance similar to when you blow out a candle.  The fiery orange glow faded to a single point of light and then went dark in the night sky.  I continued watching where I expected their trajectory to go but I could not see them once the glow had flickered out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What did I see tonight?<n>
9/15/13 20:22|Wethersfield|CT|Fireball|1 minute|3 Flaming Balls over Wethersfield CT|9/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102114.html|432|ndxe201309| 3 Flaming Balls over Wethersfield CT<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 9/15/13 at 8:22pm - Wethersfield, CT - Walking by myself on State St towards Main. Looking to my right (south), I saw a bright white light, 5 to 10 times bigger than any star or planet that I ever saw. It was just off the horizon, over some trees.  It might have been stationary at first, but within a few seconds I noticed it moving to the north (towards me) at about the speed of an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few more seconds, I saw that there were 2 more on these objects, following the first one in single file - all together, 3 round bright white lights, moving together in unison and precision, in uniform motion, as if they were connected by a rope. Then they changed into round red flaming balls. It looked EXACTLY like these orbs were engulfed in red fire. I did not see any fuselage/body of any type. Just 3 flaming balls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They kept moving north at a very uniform speed, rising steadily, until they were in front of me, about 45 degrees off the horizon. At no time did I hear any sounds emitted from them. They then changed direction and started heading towards the east(away from me) and quickly faded out, one by one. There was no noticeable wind blowing which could have caused them to turn 90 degrees. They turned with their own power.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just to be thorough, I&#39;m not entirely certain that they actually turned. They might have just stopped and started rising and getting smaller as they faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As there were no clouds or anything else that might have been used as a reference, I am unable to make an accurate determination as to their size, speed or distance from me. If I had to guess, I would say they took the approximate path, and speed, of a small single engine airplane which was in the process of climbing to cruising altitude. If that&#39;s correct, then these objects would be about 10 to 20 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been looking up in the sky for 50 years and never, ever, ever, ever, saw anything like this. Straight out of X-Files.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Note - I had just made some very clear affirmations to myself about expanding my consciousness and awareness out in all directions into infinity, and for eternity - past present and future - and in all dimensions.  I had just finished this affirmation and was focusing on these thoughts when I looked to my right and noticed this phenomenon in the sky.)<n>

The ball of light appeared to get brighter and fall rapidly, from where it first appeared, it descended in a straight line towards earth, than it made a loop de loop (one complete circle), than it went right and left in a roller coaster type of action, and it made a very sharp left turn going west.  As the light made a sharp left turn the brightness faded and it seemed to have slowed down after it made the left turn and the ball of light began to fade and than as fast as it appeared it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I stayed there till 9:30pm, and the clouds began to move in.  We did not see anything more.  My friend who is very skeptical, truly could not explain this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular object was capable of descending in an almost straight line towards earth and make a loop, than turn right and left, before making a sharp left turn and at that point it slowed down, as though it was like airplane traffic speed in the sky.  All of this took less than 8 seconds.<n>

They were heading west.  The color looked to be reddish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically I saw from directly looking south and they were going west in sky as far as I could.  The spacing of the lights were not close to be same object but 3 separate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I saw these lights there was a plane with a bright light that&#39;s what actually caught my attention.<n>

At first I thought it was a fleet of helicopters, there must have been at least a dozen lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were red to orange and they were steady, there was no pulsation.  They started out scattered but slowly made their way into a large almost rectangular shape.  It was easily the size of 4-5 football fields.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It struck me as strange because the lights were very small and very low in the air.  The best way I could describe them would to be to compare them to floating ping pong balls.  They moved slowly and in formation.  Multiple people pulled to the side of the road and began taking videos and photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was much to large and too low to be an airplane, and it was too small and too quiet to be helicopters. There was no sound what so ever, just floating lights.  It was eerily beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents house is very close to the highway so it takes me less than 2 mintues to from their house.  The reason that this is important is that I left when I did becuase the sound on our TV kept mysteriously and unexplainably kept shutting off and the picture would break up every now and again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to add, that I was alone in the car, in a sober state of mind, with no drugs/alcohol in my system.  I have a college education and am in the medical field.<n>

This object was huge.  It was star/cross like shape. I thought at first it was a star, but the sun had just started to go down and this was brighter than any star I&#39;ve ever seen,and was the only thing in the sky, not even a cloud present.  It gradually moved NW until disappearing over a 40 minute period, so it moves very slowly but does move.  Almost like it is scanning the earth below it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have witnessed this several times over the last 4 weeks and I just want to know what it is. It has appeared around the same time each evening and takes about 40 minutes to disappear.  On a couple other occasions there have been other smaller lights around this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have photos, and my camera is just run of the mill digital Canon.  When I loaded the images to my computer and zoom in, the object seems to be changing shape in each photo (which was not detected by just observing it.)  The images are all different, some circular, some cigar like shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just want to know if anyone else is seeing this besides us and what it is.<n>

As I was waiting outside for them to come out, I noticed several red-orange spherical lights in the sky to the south (they appeared to be in the city of Chandler, just south of Tempe).  They were traveling in sort of an arc, heading first west and then toward the north and finally north-east, at which point they just disappeared.  They moved in a single file line in almost perfect formation.  There was a helicopter traveling along with them.  I watched this for about 3 to 5 minutes before my clients came out.  When the first one came out I pointed it out and we just watched them come up on the horizon, travel in the arc motion and then disappear. By this time we could no longer see the helicopter.  The second client came out after about two minutes and we continued to watch for about 2 minutes as the last lights came and disappeared.  I took three pictures, which are very poor quality, but photographic evidence nevertheless.  We then departed the apartment complex and continued to talk about our experience for about 10 minutes until we arrived at our destination.  We thought that maybe they were Chinese lanterns and that maybe there was a wedding or some type of festival or something.  But the question of why there would be a helicopter travelling with them kept coming up and didn&#39;t make sense to any of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a month later, I picked up the same clients and we discussed whether any of us had researched the incident but none of us had.  We were still baffled.  On 11/28/13, I turned on Coast to Coast am on 550 AM out of Phoenix. A s soon as I turned it on they were talking about similar incidents throughout the county and identical descriptions.  Listeners were encouraged to report their incidents on the ufocenter.com website, so I thought I should.   The incident was just too strange to ignore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was walking very calmly almost like sneaking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My immediate thought was that this was my friend, and I thought he was going to pull a prank on me.  So i said to him, (the shadow/silhouette) YOOHOOO!.. by the time i ended this Word, it stopped and turned only its head towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had with me a flashlight, but my friend has numerously times discussed with me since i ruin his nightvision by blending him, so i didn&#39;t turn on my flashlight, after a glimpse of 3 seconds, it began to walk towards the heavy bushes, and i thought to myself, WHAT THE HECK IS HE DOING!?<n> <n><n> <n><n> So i went up to see where and why my friend was doing this, because it made no sense that he was going in to that place...upon arrival i saw my friend came up the same path that this being was headed, and I jumped and was both horrified and surprised, and asked him...Did you just run Down again towards the water, after just being here`? He replied no, and he noticed that i was worried.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So i told him that we are not alone on this island. This island is very small, we could walk around the entire site in 5 minutes. I will Place a map so that you can see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We searched the entire island  meter by meter with a 4500 lumen flashlight that is very powerful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am or at least was a sceptic, to both aliens, or other entities, upon this incident, Ive spent many hours if not hundreds of hours in the woods for several years, and nothing has ever been this intense, and at the same time, so mind bugging scary, due to the fact that I can not explain what I saw and at the same time I know what I saw, something that could resemble a humanoid, it was dark, and I could not see any colors, or any sign of clothing that would normally protrude or break the line in or out of a silhouette. Also the horizon was bright, due to some twilight in the distance. I know that this could not be any human, because it vanished out of thin air...<n> <n><n> <n><n> If someone had escaped by swimming, we would definitely hear it. Or even see him or her when we inspected the island.   Same night, when we went to our tent, we were woken up by a pulsating vibration. Im a guy who sleeps very heavy,  but this vibration managed to somehow Wake me up in a matter of minutes.  it was not normal and i think my brain must have picked this up as a &#34;threat&#34; or something unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend also woke up from this. To make further example of how heavily i sleep, my friend started shooting at geese&#39;s flying over Our tent, and i did not wake up even though he fired his shotgun, 2-3meters away from the tent in a 80 degree angle above it.  I have no clue what this vibration was, but Norway is NOT known for having earthquakes also previously noticed a lot of light movements in the sky in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have done research to find some concrete answers but nothing adds up, except one thing...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The description of the white tall aliens. The silhouette from one drawing drew my attention to articles about them and i find it very intriguing to my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have thought about trying to see if I can get any contact With this &#34;being&#34; or entity, if its still there. I have also thought about putting camera there for 2 days, to see if i can Catch some footage.    It is a place that often has lights moving on the sky, some go about at an arch and some look like satellites. Sometimes there are small flashes that moves rapidly from one point to another and sometimes the lights tends to respond to the flashlights. Its not uncommon to see lights descend or ascend while they slowly look like burning out, in a way that it looks like it disappears or burns up. All of the lights that I have observed with my hunting buddies, was before this incident at this Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The silhouette was tall, thin, and normally sized head. Im an artist and often draw paintings and drawings, I could share this if needed. My friend is 6fot 3inches.  From what I can remember and going through the scenario with my friend it had to be around 6ft 3- up to 6ft 6inches tall, I saw it from the torso up, as it was to black to see the legs.  My friend did not have his shotgun on him, but I was wearing mine on my back while I was fishing at that time, as I don&#39;t like leaving the gun alone.

9/15/13 01:00|Lincolnville|ME|Triangle|>30 minutes|Awakened in the middle of the night by a bright, focused light by my head coming through the skylight.|12/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105172.html|443|ndxe201309| Awakened in the middle of the night by a bright, focused light by my head coming through the skylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While vacationing with friends for the first time in Lincolnville, Maine on September 14, 2013, we arrived at our destination after dark to a house in the woods.  I had not been oriented to my surroundings since my arrival was after dark but was told that the house was on a pond in a wooded area.  I went to bed approximately 11:45 PM which was  in an attic bedroom with a skylight in front of the bed on the drop ceiling.  I was awakened after midnight to a blinding, focused, white light coming through the skylight about thirty yards away from the house, illuminating the bedroom and focused on the wall beside my head.   The light became brighter and slightly dimmer and then brighter again which stayed bright for at least 20 to 30 minutes or longer.  It was brighter than the lights on a football field at night.  I got up and looked out of the skylight and saw three large spotlights arranged two beside each other and the third under them in a triangular fashion.  The lights were attached to a triangular object suspended just below the tall tree line in the quiet black sky.  I did not know what to think so I remained calm and peaceful not even thinking about waking up anyone.  I eventually covered my eyes from the light and fell back to sleep.   When I woke up in the morning I became terrified because the condensation on the skylight took the form of a picture of an alien grey head.  The second morning the condensation looked like half of a huge cat head, and the third morning the condensation reminded me of a Peruvian Indian head. All three of the forms has personal meaning to me.  The first picture reminded me of an UFO encounter that I believed happened to me as a child and had suppressed for about 35 years, the second picture of a cat is my favorite animal and the third picture looked like one of the native indians I saw while visiting Peru in 2007.  It is NOT like me to be so calm in a situation like I experienced in the middle ! of the night in Maine.  All of this is so bizarre that I start! ed not t o report this but this is what I&#39;ve experienced.<n>

We both got very scared and immediately look out our window.  We were waiting for cops and sirens and air planes to be coming but no one ever came nor is it on the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after, I grabbed my phone and started recording.  I recorded the whole time and it&#39;s been in my view for 1 hour.  It was a circular object.  The lights seemed to be spinning and it was shine bright then go to a dim then go to other colors like green then orange and yellow.  It didn&#39;t move straight towards anything, it kinda is just going upwards, slowly like it&#39;s trying not to move to suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The footage I have is great.  We thought it was a start till we notice it was circa and had different color lights.  Nothing close to being a airplane, helicopter, or jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don&#39;t know why it&#39;s not on the news or an airplane hasn&#39;t came by it.  Maybe something the goverment is trying too hide is definitely out.  I can still see it now.  And I will continue recording.<n>

I gazed out of the window to get a better view of that big bright beautiful star that was sitting in the northeast sky it began to move more toward the east then it circled back toward the west and as it headed more toward the west I could see two white lights flashing in a sequence of three and one red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It headed back to that same point of the northeast sky that bright light would “enhance” for lack of a better word then fade then begin the same circling routine all over again this went on about fifteen times and as I watched it, at one point I thought I could see a massive ship through the clouds but I can’t make that my claim as of today but that made me “think” that those lights where coming from the front of the ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about the fifteenth circle the ship flew away so fast heading east leaving a line of smoke in the sky.  I’ve seen a different kind of ship flying around in that same exact area a few years ago this ship was not circling as far out as the ship that I saw last night, it had sort of a search light on it, as if it was a car in the sky with its high beams on circling and circling.   It was moving much faster and then it just faded away into the clouds it was in plain sight anyone could have just looked up and saw it me and my daughter watched it until it faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see a Clear, Straight, Path into the sky no trees or anything preventing my View<n>

Noticed the moon&#39;s usual halo seemed to bend around at an odd angle, deduced it was roughly square.

First thought it was a helicopter considering it was near an airfield but was extremely bright for being so far away.  The objects were motionless when lit but the light would flicker out then reappear at different altitudes.  They seemed to &#34;leapfrog&#34; across one another and would even rise and lower in altitude.  The orange glow was small but so bright it was hard to look at. I work at an airfield and have never seen any aircraft with such bright lights and have never seen aircraft move in this motion.<n>

The object was viewed from a pair of high powered binoculars once it gained my attention, and upon observation, I clearly saw it had no-fixed wings or tail, whatsoever.  The blinking object was in the shape of a bell like Christmas ornament, and hovered in place over the tree line for 15 minutes, without moving. It was quite chilly, and the sky was clear with an abundance of stars, as well as a bright half moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object had multiple, rapid flashing lights around the middle of the object, as well as a red light at the tip of it’s bell shape The lights around the middle region flashed of bright red &amp; green lights, which flashed from left to right in unison.  There were a row of smaller bright blue lights spanning above the larger, brighter red &amp; green lights.  The lower half of the object had a upside down cone shape, projecting downward from the upper bell shape, which had white lights covering it like that of a New Years Eve ball drop.  Once I focused in on the object through my binoculars, and saw it clearly, I could not believe what I was looking at.  This WAS NOT a human aircraft of any kind.  It was unbelievably beautiful &amp; brilliant as it hovered in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no-audible noise coming from the object as it hovered above the tree line to my North West. I watched it and video taped the strange object to the best of my ability, before it ever so slowly moved away to the North, and disappeared behind the tree line.  I knew I had just witnessed a UFO, but I just could not believe it.  I am hoping that it returns again, as I am armed with a video camera, and picture camera with tripods, hoping I will get a better image and footage of this very strange craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is NOT a hoax, nor is this a made up story.  I witnessed an actual unidentified craft in the sky, just beyond the woods of my property.  I don’t know if it will ever return, but if it does, I’m ready with two camera’s to document this strange craft.<n>

They kept coming about every 15 to 45 seconds and flew same direction.  No sound to them, seemed to be about the same speed as an airplane and maybe a bit lower in the sky than a plane.  They were not floating, but moving at a good speed.  We do not what they were, but we do know they were NOT a floating lantern or an airplane.<n>

Initially there was one light observed moving E to W approximately 70 degrees above the northern horizon.  The brightness of the light was between my observations of the ISS and Venus.  There was no sound or any additional lights one would expect from a passing aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was taking video of this object with my IPhone, a friend who was also observing this lighted object said toward the eastern horizon there were four more moving in the same direction and the same speed.  They also came across the sky at the same elevation as the first and the final two were closer together, only 3-5 degrees apart.  I also recorded these objects on my IPhone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brightness of the objects maintained their intensity as they passed by but slowly became dimmer as they continued to the West until they could no longer be viewed.  It was almost as if they were satellites reflecting the light of the sun, but that would have required a significant altitude based on the sun setting nearly 2 1/2 hours before the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I flew in the Air Force for 21 years and with a commercial carrier for 15 years and can say I&#39;ve never seen anything similar to this observation of these objects.  I consulted with a member of the FAA TRACON in the area and after pulling the radar history for the period of observation, he could find no activity to resemble the IPhone video he viewed..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am at a loss as to what I saw and wanted to pass this information along to see if anyone else observed something similar on the noted day and time..<n>

They were in a zig zag pattern like looking at a constellation only they were very close like helicopters in the sky.  We watched this for at least 5 minutes with two poeple claiming to throw out a local news paper.  The objects looked like ufo&#39;s because they made no sound.  It was like watching a movie about the earth being invated. It was the most unexplainable thing that has ever happened to us.  We live in O Fallon. Missouri.<n>

It was a dark orange color, round in shape, about 45 degrees up in the sky, and looked to be about the size of Jupiter as it appears to the naked eye.  It moved to a location that was just west of north and seemed to stop.  Then it slowly faded away. It did not get obscured by clouds, it seemed to just disappear.<n>

The single one that I saw was red.

Roughly, five minutes later another fireball oval in shape more orange/red in color shared the same path, not hovering or halting, but moving slowly same speed across sky to dissipate.   both travel paths were from NW to West-almost a circular path.  Both also appeared to have what looked like sparks all around or some other type of brightness.<n>

Maybe there is an explanation for this event?????<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out onto my back deck, (evening of Saturday, September 14th) started to sit down on a chair but looked up before doing so.  Coming from the direction of the southeast there is a bright orange round object moving over my house. Higher then a helicopter but much closer then an airplane.  It is bright orange on the outside/underside but a deeper orange in the center.  The color in the center seemed to be moving but that might have something to do with the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped into the house and the clock reads 9:40 pm.  About 30 seconds later a second one appears coming from the same direction, displaying the same thing as the first.  About 30 seconds after that another orange one goes over my house but still at a level that I could see the darker orange moving around inside the center.  All three objects move out of sight into the northwest sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back outside and have been watching but I do not think any more will come tonight. I am not very good at trying to judge size and distance but they were close and big enough that I could see the variance of the orange colors inside the spheres/UNDERSIDE.  I believe if I would stretch out my arm, the objects would be about the size of the palm of my hand.  This is the first time I have seen anything like this.  I did have trouble sleeping; I kept seeing images of them in my mind all night long.  All I can say is, it might be explained away but I can see the stars in the sky, so it is a clear night.  There are no other lights like an airplane would have and they were completely SILENT but moved at about the same speed as an airplane would travel.<n>

Two flew together in a definitive path, hung out in the sky for a couple minutes.  The third took off from the ground on the same path as the others in a very meticulous fashion.  The first two started to move away than suddenly disappeared as the third approached.  I ran in to tell someone looked out the window and it disappeared.   My guess is there are groups of people that play tricks on the UFO community and the gen pop.  I think a balloon with a propeller could have the same effect, but I  do not know.  And total respect for you guys I just don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve been visited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Edit: after scrolling down and seeing the &#34;animals responded to event&#34; I will say that dogs in the neighborhood started barking and other strange noises I usually don&#39;t hear around here.  I assumed something happened and a dog started a chain of dogs barking.  In no way does this prove anything and I am still a huge skeptic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also possibly two lights, one on top, one on the bottom.

These objects looked exactly like the fireballs described.<n>

We were looking SSW from my front porch in Canby, Oregon.  They were about the size of very large stars.  All were the same size, amber in color and steady – no blinking or flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lowest was about 20&amp;#730; above the horizon and appeared to be moving toward us and descending like a plane approaching for landing.  Above it and about 2&amp;#730; to the left and at approximately 50&amp;#730; above the horizon was the second orb.  It was completely motionless.  Directly above it was the third orb at approximately 65&amp;#730; over the horizon.  It was also motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching them for about three minutes, the highest orb made a steep and rapid ascent away from us and quickly went out of sight.  Immediately the second orb did exactly the same thing and disappeared at the same point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lowest orb that appeared to be moving toward us in a descent like a landing aircraft instantly headed the opposite direction away from us.  It made a steep and rapid ascent using the same path as the previous two orbs.  However, on its ascent it appeared to make a few corkscrew or wiggling movements on its otherwise straight ascent.  It disappeared at the same point as the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a mostly clear and moonlit night with some areas of haze.  I don’t know if they flew out of sight or if they became obscured in a patch of haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their size and form are difficult to describe.  They were about twice as large as Venus (although not nearly as bright) on a near pass.  However, they were too small to be able to discern any form other than spherical.  The amber lights did not shimmer, blink, flash nor gain or lose intensity.  They weren’t brilliant or faint – they were about a medium intensity.  They were all exactly the same size except that the lowest increased slightly in size as it approached and then all three decreased in size as they ascended and disappeared.<n>

As we were getting closer to them they look like small red circles going North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were very close together but they did not touch each other. Almost like they were connected by a net  I took my phone and decided to take a video.  My husband stopped the car so we can have a better view without getting or causing an accident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know when they showed up, or how many they were from the beginning, but when we saw them they were about 12-15 and as they travelled North, they started to disappear one by one in the same spot until they were not visible anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived home, my husband decided to go outside to see if they were still visible .  He called me outside and they were all together almost like a bunch of grapes and they went up slowly up in the sky.  We took more pictures with our cell phones and I did try to take a video again but is not visible to the naked eye.  The pictures we took at home we can make them bigger and it looks like a big light in motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if an expert with the right technology will be able to see something on my video. I can&#39;t make it bigger as the pictures can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time we first saw them until they went up in the sky, I would say it was about an hour.  We decided to come inside and check the local news but I did not see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Outside that light was still visible and it seems like 1 big blinking light to me, but my husband said he saw more than a couple of blinking of different colors (red, silver, white) In the pictures we took it looks white with blue around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you,<n>

Looking south I saw red lights at a distance between the trees rising as if it were fireworks.  Looking up towards the moon I noticed they were traveling from the south to the north going directly above my head.  They were at a very high altitude.  Going in a straight line at a constant speed i counted about a dozen red lights.  This line, not a perfect formation lasted about 2 minutes,  Directly after this I noticed two airplanes, coming from the southeast.  They were at a low enough altitude for me to see the whole shape of the plane.   These two planes crossed paths.  This is unusual because I would consider this a near crash. Would you please investigate this situation.  I was in my proper fram of mind and this is NOT a hoax.  At least check about the near miss with the two planes.  One plane was on an intercept course towards the redlights.  The lights dissappeared before downtown Chicago.  There was no trail of light.  The red lights were a perfect circle as they were approaching me, while overhead and as the past me.  This in itself is unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not take pictures but I was not the only one who saw this. The sky was clear that night.<n>

At first I assumed them to be helicopters flying in formation, possibly towards one of the closest military bases like Ft. Campbell.  They were moving very fast, and appeared to be somewhat low in the sky.  They were completely silent. As they passed over head and moved on to the west they &#34;faded away&#34;.  The lights quickly dimmed and vanished.  Never seen anything like it.  Can&#39;t say with certainty that they were NOT military aircraft, but the color and intensity of the lights were like nothing I&#39;ve seen before.  They looked like they were on fire.  Helicopters flying that low are typically audible.  These were totally silent.  Maybe I was seeing pieces of some orbital junk burning up, but they were flying low and straight, very fast, and appeared to be in formation.<n>

From northwest to southeast in a minute maybe?  It seemed as high as a star, but travelled too fast to be a satellite. It did not burnout as a shooting star would in just a few inches. If I held my arms up in a &#34;V&#34; shape, (like the &#34;Y&#34; in the YMCA dance) that&#39;s how far across the sky it travelled.  My family of 4 saw it and a family of 6 up the street saw it too.  When it disappeared it seemed as if it &#34;blipped out&#34; by moving further up and and away into the atmosphere.  It was not a plane, shooting star, planet or satellite.  I have never seen anything like that before in the sky.<n>

I saw four lights first moving slow from south to north, after about 30 seconds they slowly faded to black. about 1 minute later we saw them again but now there were five lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They repeated they same pattern of moving in a north direction and again faded to black.  We saw them again about a minute later in the same area as the first two times but this time there were 6 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again they moved slowly north and then faded to black. we were using a trolling motor to move our boat so there was no noise from the boat and no noise from the direction that the lights were seen.<n>

The lights were orange/red, no flashing markers.  The first 5-7 were in a single line formation, followed by 3 that traveled in a triangular formation.  The lights were approx 1000~2000ft, silent and traveled in a southeasterly direction from the direction of Mt. Holly.  Several other cars pulled over on the bypass to witness this event.<n>

It was a blueish, brilliant light.  It kind of hung around the monument for a bit then disappeared.  I don&#39;t know what that was but I can tell you it was no plane as planes don&#39;t move in that manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t seem to find any reports on this.<n>

Once we got to oswego rd i noticed noticed a red and green flying object in the shape of a triangle it was hovering the whole way up oswego rd until we hit pine haven trailer park once we entered the park there was a huge round object that was travling at a fast speed and looked like there was a huge fire ball under it and almost looked like there was a red glow around it almost like a shield or ring behind it was another red and green flashing triangular object almost as if it were chasing the fire ball object.  That was headed towards the tear drop and right before it could even make it to the tear drop it litteraly just dissapered there was no light trail or anything just gone right after, that the tear drop dissapered as well and the flashing red and green object was left once i got to my house we could see four of fhe flashing red and green triangular objects hovering pretty much surrounding the perimeter ob the tear drop that dissappered almost like they were waiting for the teardrop and fire ball come back and this is not the first time we have seen red and green flashing objects or the tear drop we  have seen this quite a bit in the past two.month months well the red and green more than anything and i would say the tear dropi would say this was my fifth time seeing that in two months period but this was the first time i.ever saw the fire ball and the first time i have ever seen a chase it was about 8pm every star was bright and visible it was cold  and while taking the video my phone died but i still caught sone of it<n>

The object resembled a miniature hot air balloon with about a two foot diameter canvas type cloth parachute and below it was suspendered a triangular platform on which was in an incindiary device that had burned out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A woman in the group identified herself as working for the police department and took the object.<n>

Birmingham, AL area<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 19:45 central time I and my family were getting into our car preparing to go home after visiting my parents.  I looked up and noticed a dim light that seemed to just be a high flying plane traveling northbound; but the object suddenly changed directions southbound. It did not turn it just changed direction from north to south.  When I saw this I called my wife and parents over to see what I was seeing.  As they were coming to see I turned on the video camera on my phone and began recording.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the initial light several more appeared; up to 8 or 9 at one point. T hese lights were dim and looked like stars. They sped up and slowed down and made erratic course changes.  Many times they traveled in a circular course; then would shoot off in a strait line.  These objects would also in 2s or 3s travel toward a common point and when they reached the common point (all at the same time) they would all change direction away from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several times while watching these objects a plane would fly through the area of the sky where these objects were performing their maneuvers.  When a plane would fly through the area the objects in front of the planes would quickly move away to the side and then change course and follow the plane.  This happened at least 10 times.  On one occasion I watched one object come up behind a plane for maybe 2 seconds, then moved beside the plane for maybe another 2 seconds and then speed around in front of the plane and quickly move off to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 20:10 my wife, daughter and I drove up the road to see if we could see the objects better from another location.  After arriving at a local Arbys and getting a few sodas we looked in the direction of the objects and were not able to see them.  We then returned to my parent’s home where we could once again see the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 23:50 hours I reluctantly decided to return to my home so my wife and child could get some sleep. At this time there were still a few of the objects still flying around. I have to add that I have never seen anything like these objects nor had my wife or parents. I made 3 videos on my phone; they are not very good quality and are shaky, but they do show some of the lights and maybe they can be of some use.<n>

The day was beautiful about 76 degrees without a cloud in the sky.  I looked up and seen a circular/disk shaped object silver in color with the glare of the sun against it.  I did not notice any lights on it and didn&#39;t make a sound; flying very nigh in the sky and thought it may have been a balloon or something floating up but it wasn&#39;t floating, it was literally flying at a high rate of speed and as I watched it, the object just disappeared.  I also noticed that there weren&#39;t any airplanes in the sky of which I found odd because I was about 2 miles from the airport.  My dad said it may be a military drone, but I have never heard of one that was circular shaped, but anythings possible I guess.  About thirty minutes later it reappeared out of nowhere, then disappeared again. I hope the government isn&#39;t covering up something that could put is all in danger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran across this site just to find out if anyone else has seen this thing and was surprised to see this many sightings.

It appeared to be moving west towards myself. I watched it for just a few seconds when I saw what looked like a little orange teardrop &#34;melt&#34; off the bottom of it, that then evaporated.  I immediately thought it was some kind of comet that was burning away. I ran inside and grabbed my cellphone to capture a video.  I began to film it for a few seconds and noticed it was was moving straight north now and seemed to have been gaining altitude very very quickly.  I observed a few more &#34;melting&#34; drops during this period until it completely disappeared from view in the northern sky.  I did see the object flash two more melting drops from it at this point, although I could not see the object itself.  During my entire viewing of this object there was no noise coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a minute long cell phone video in which the object is visible in less detail, although a &#34;flare drop&#34; can be seen.<n>

9/14/13 06:00|Zionsville|IN|Sphere|50 seconds|Faint Sphere/Saucer travelling South became more difficult to see, vanished, and left a greenish-white streak in the sky for a second.|9/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102175.html|493|ndxe201309| Faint Sphere/Saucer travelling South became more difficult to see, vanished, and left a greenish-white streak in the sky for a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at the Stars, as I do sometimes at Night. It was about 6AM early Saturday Morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was up, about to go to Sleep. I looked outside a North Window, looking NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a Plane, with the Red &amp; Green Markers heading towards Indy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then, I noticed something strange:  Just further to the North, there was a Tiny, very dim object moving South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very faint, and I could just tell it was White to Light-Grey in Color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I watched it, expecting it to have some Blinking-Lights as all Aircraft do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And yet, it never did flash even Once! I went over to a West Window, to keep it in view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It became even more faint, increasing in Altitude as it traveled further South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It suddenly vanished for a second, and the reappeared, possibly leaving the Atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then something very astonishing happened: The object reappeared slightly for a fraction of a second, then disappeared entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, a very faint streak of greenish-white light appeared ahead of where the object was moving toward. Sort of like how a Space Ship goes to light-speed in Science-Fiction shows. I continued to search for signs of the object further in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t find anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in shock of what I saw, not because it&#39;s impossible, but because I have never seen anything like it in the Skies. I shed a tear, and something came to mind as a Thought just appeared in my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That they know what is happening to our Planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been watching the Skies for years, and know allot about Astronomy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many Fireballs, which are basically Meteors on fire. I know the difference from a Star, and a moving object. I know that Aircraft have Lights, and that they Flash repeatedly. I have seen Helicopters, which appear not to flash until they pass a certain point in the Sky. What I saw not only didn&#39;t flash, but it wasn&#39;t lit-up at all. And it was much fainter than anything I&#39;ve ever witnessed in the night skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This could have been a Spacecraft launched from Earth [Manned], or a craft not from this world. Being that this came from far North of Indianapolis, there is no launch-site for manned rockets around Northern Indiana. Not even Michigan. Maybe Canada? Because I cannot Identify this as a Known Aircraft or Meteor/Fireball, I must report this as a UFO. And the very FIRST one I have seen in my entire life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *I would like to add, that nobody was around at the time I witnessed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no Traffic in my neighborhood, no one walking around outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I seemed as if this would be the perfect time for such an object or craft to be high in the atmosphere. Perfect, so that it had the least chance of being caught. I realized this, and I knew I was the only one up. Early Saturday morning, after every business including Bars &amp; Clubs are closed, would be the perfect time to have something like this in the sky. It was faint enough, that if someone was driving, they wouldn&#39;t see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *Also - This Object did NOT leave a visible trail, but it DID leave a faint Streak after it vanished for a brief moment. This streak was only visible for a split-second, then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were these three bright lights in the sky in the shape of a triangle over above Lake Ontario.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I took a photo.  They were bright enough to appear in the photo, while other stars/planes that were in the sky when I took the picture didn&#39;t show up in it.  I figured they were just a weird formation of stars, but by the time my cigarette was almost finished, they suddenly combined into one and just shot across the sky.  The lights seemed to have been changing colour between red, blue, and white.  Although it may have just been because they were so far away and so bright.<n>

After starting to say goodbye, I looked up to the sky and noticed what were certainly not stars, nor common aircraft.  I was amazed to see three, orangish-red, glowing triangles, flying in a triangular formation.  Their speed seemed to be comparable to that of typical jets, however, there was absolutely no sound to be heard from this spectacle.  They were in the northwestern sky, flying from west to east.  I observed this for about two minutes, when then the light emitted from each source seemed to flicker slightly, then fade out - the front one first, then another, then the last one, until I saw them no more.  I was incredibly excited and overwhelmed with curiosity after viewing this incredible and unexplainable sight.<n>

The moon was about 3/4 full and was very bright.  I did not actually really need my head lamp.  I was sitting in a chair looking up at my rod and saw 8 orange lights just above the horizon.  The shape was more like an arrow head then anything else.  It was a low glowing orange.  It was not strobing or flashing.  It was a constant glow.  There were 8 total lights in the shape of an arrow head.  The object did not make a single noise.  It was completely silent.  The object looked massive.  Much bigger then any commercial aircraft.  I would estimate it being at least the size of a football field.  It only took this object about 2 seconds to go all the way across the horizon and disappear.  That night I had seen plenty of aircraft as well as 2 shooting stars but this was somthing that I had never seen before and it was eye opening.<n>

Noticed (2) glowing objects, red/orange in color in the sky that appeared roughly 15 deg. North of East and moving SW.  Looked at my watch and it was precisely 11:00 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I watched, the object which appeared to be in a more Southerly position paused and did not move again until the trailing object caught up and passed.  After it had passed, both moved on in a South Westerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After (2) minutes or so, both objects simply disappeared.  A few seconds later, another object without so reddish a color appeared moving in the same general direction.  It also disappeared much quicker than the other two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire incident was over within (5) minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event occurred in the Grand Rapids, MI vicinity, with the objects appearing North of Gerald R.

It was long shapped and lasted for about 4 to 6 minutes until it became one dot of green light and faded quickly into space.  I saw the same in2011, at the same location, at around the same time.  It is steady, last for a long while and sometimes it looks as if there are 3 point of light emanating streams of light to each other.  It does not travel like a shooting star or  flashes like a meteor.  It is steady and consistent.  It is my 8th sighting since 2011.  Very steady behavior.  When I ask if it could connect with me - last evening - it flashed twice - maybe a coincidence, but  felt like it was in comm! unication. I asked for help with the floods and natural disaster we experienced last night here in Boulder.  It was very steady in its behavior.  Don&#39;t know what it is, but sure it emanated peace and green steady streaks of light that did not travel, but stayed steady in the sky until became a dot and disappeared.<n>

Orange in colour, brightest at the center fading towards the outer areas.  Didn&#39;t matter which direction it headed, it looked the same.  It was to the west of downtown Toronto heading south towards Lake Ontario and the USA.  It was completely silent.  Thought it was a meteor, but too slow and changed directions.  Was too close to not hear it if it was a traditional helicopter or airplane, too far and large to be a Chinese lantern, moving counter to winds as well.  Actually thought it may be a burning airplane for a moment, but no trail was visible.  The glow was quite large and far brighter than any aircraft I&#39;ve seen before, yet impossible to see the object itself or its shape.  No flashing lights, just a constant somewhat (though very little) pulsating intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the object for about 3 minutes.<n>

And then it was gone! It didnt shoot away it didnt fade out, it just vanished like you shut off a light switch..i felt like i was looking at the holy spirit, thats how beautiful the light appeared..it had a bluish tint toward the outer edge of the round light..it almost looked like a round diamond just brilliantly lit in the sky..no tail or no sparks or flames just this stationary light in the sky..it appeared high above my neighbors roof..from the distance it was away from me if i had to guess i would say it was maybe the size of a basketball?  I never seen anything like that before or after the event..i am certain it wasnt a meteor or comet..definately wasnt a shooting star or satellite!  I couldnt see a craft! attatched to light, it appeared to just be a gorgeous looking light..  And it was silent didnt make any sounds at all. I dont have any photo or video it happened so fast.  I reported to mufon and ufo magazine via e-mails but they never contacted me.  I would love to know what i seen and if anyone else made a similar report.  I am not a nut job i know what i seen and dont care if people think im crazy!  I watch the sky every night weather permitting and i have seen other hard to explain flying objects also..hope you can help me understand what i know i seen...thank you<n>

9/13/13 22:00|Boulder|CO|Changing|5 hours|September, Friday the 13 Left Hand Canyon hundreds of crafts and beings in the sky and on the ground|11/20/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104526.html|506|ndxe201309| September, Friday the 13 Left Hand Canyon hundreds of crafts and beings in the sky and on the ground<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was my first completely undeniable close encounter with extraterrestrial phenomenology.  It happened on Friday the 13th of 2013 in Left Hand Canyon the night after the 500 year flood began.  I was stranded up in the Canyon for 7 days, and saw activity each night.  The activity on the night of Friday the 13th shook my belief system to the core.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stranded up the canyon with a good friend we laid on her rooftop and watched the sky. Immediately the moon began to flicker and strange clouds poured out over the canyon.  Crafts were instantly everywhere, the entire sky full of different ships, moving at different speeds and different altitudes, all were silent.  Many familiar looking ships common to UFO sightings I had previously viewed online.  Many crafts unlike anything I have ever heard of or seen.  Foreign colors and movement that didn’t have a reasonable pathology to them as far as my human brain could tell.  They appeared to be in constant flux, shifting shape and color and teleporting short distances through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I pointed the first one out, my friend told me to stay calm and that they will land.  She had seen them almost every night for over a year now, and hadn’t confided in me fearing I would think she was crazy.  Moments later they landed, not the crafts but it appeared they were being flashed down.  The sky would light up like heat lighting, even though the clouds had now vanished, and glowing orbs were on the ground 20-30 feet away.  You could feel them and hear them “whistle”.  They were playful and would whistle back and forth with us.  They also seemed to have a telepathic ability.  I couldn’t hear it the first night but my friend had to go inside, as the sounds were too much and gave her a headache.  She described it as a mechanical bird chirp that never stopped.  I heard this sound the next night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for hours.  Crafts in the sky would respond to my whistle and humming. Some would stay focused on us for 30 minutes or so before moving on.  The entire time, crafts flew in and out of what I can only explain as a void, much higher in the sky.  The ships up high would not react with us and seemed to all be coming and going through what I have to believe is some kind of wormhole.  I watched them on the ground and in the sky for 4+ hours until exhausted I fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I awoke with a headache, that didn’t last more than an hour.  I spent the next couple days and nights scouting the forest for prints, which I found, however not in the area of the glowing orbs.  I believe many extraterrestrials from many different galaxies were present in this canyon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since been back and every time show more people, and spot 10-20 crafts over several hours.  This is a UFO hot spot. Some of my peers have had very negative encounters and won’t return to see them again, fearing a hostile presence.  He described the same mechanical whistle sound but said it had a harpooning effect on him, and he saw 3 physical beings, not like the glowing playful orbs, but dark and in the shadows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights at my house flicker for days when I return to the city. I have dreams often, but haven’t noticed anything else strange.  I continue to look for information and want to contact them very badly, it’s become and obsession.<n>

We thought it was a hot air balloon that was firing its burner? It was in the eastern sky out over the Atlantic.  We were on the balcony of our condo (17th floor). I also thought it was a plane coming in for a landing with an engine on fire? There definitely appeared to be a flame coming from this object.  I could not detect any shape.  There was no sound. I had binoculars on it but could not discern any shape, or smoke?  The object moved closer to  our condo, almost overhead, then moved back towards the ocean and was lost in the clouds?<n>

Silent<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9/13/2013  At Approximately 20:30 hours on above stated date I witnessed an object in the sky above Keystone Heights, Florida.  I was alone in my back yard at the time.  Movement in the sky to my left caught my attention, and I turned to see an orange light moving through a break in the tree cover.  It was a bright orange color without any pulsing or variation in brightness.  It was moving at a rate that would suggest in was at a fairly low altitude, or if higher moving extremely fast.  I was expecting to hear some kind of sound from engines or rotors.  Complete silence at first made me think it was one of those Chinese lanterns sometimes released into the air.  As it came overhead it was still silent and moving at fast pace.  It had a perfect five pointed star shape with the orange light extending from each point and fading.  I took my eyes off it for only a couple seconds to try and get a better vantage point, and it was gone.  Never seen this bright orange colored light on any aircr! aft, and there was no blinking or pulsing.  Completely silent, and either very high and moving very fast or fairly low.  I have never witnessed anything that I would consider an unexplained aircraft or UFO, but this was something that I cannot explain as anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((initials deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> U.S. Army Veteran<n>

It looked like a big ball of flame just below the moon and drifting across sky in a southwestern direction until I lost sight of it behind some pine trees.  Very amazing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took this picture with my cell phone.  My husband observed it with me and took several pictures with a digital camera, but the one on my phone is best.  (His are not steady).  I really am anxious to know what this was, or if it was seen by others.  -  Thank you.<n>

There is NO DOUT that what we saw was not from this world.  One of the crafts moved so much faster than any thing I&#39;ve ever seen!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not planes they were low enough to see the way the metal on the crafts fit together!!!!!!<n>
9/13/13 02:18|Sweetser|IN|Light|5 minutes|Red light sighted over Sweetser Indiana.|9/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102246.html|519|ndxe201309| Red light sighted over Sweetser Indiana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of Sept.13,2013 approximately 2:18 a.m., I sighted a pulsating,dull pinpoint of light in the sky bearing 170 degrees, azimuth 75 degrees.  This light pulsated at around two Hz from a dull red to almost dark.  Altitude was impossible to determine, although it looked about right for airliner cruising altitude. Its heading was 080 degrees. Its apparent speed was again similar to that of an airliner.  The object appeared to maintain heading and speed for a duration of around 3 minutes.  After this period, I took my dogs back into the garage and immediately returned outside and looked to where I had last seen the object. Could not reacquire.  Throughout sighting, the atmospheric conditions were clear with no moon nor clouds.  Temp was around 60 degrees as of two hours previous, per my pickup truck thermometer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I apologize for the prosaic nature of this sighting.  What struck me as odd about it was the fact that I saw no other aircraft lighting associated with this object, such as the green starboard wing tip light.  It is possible that due to the apparent angle of my position to this object in relation to its travel path, such a starboard light may have been obscured by the body of this object.  Neither did I see a white strobe tail light or steady white landing gear light.<n>

When directly overhead, we heard a sort of buzzing/whirring sound.<n>

The object seems to change colors mainly from white to red, it appears at the same time every night usually at 22:30.  The object moves suddenly between 23:30 and 23:45, it moves up in just a matter of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where i stand the object is always at a north east position.  It&#39;s as if it is signiling  or communicating with something else.

In front of the plane I saw two sets of two bright green flashing lights.  The green lights were a color I have never seen in the sky before.  Kind of the color of a green &#39;light stick&#39;.  They moved closer to earth and then joined to become one unit of about 5-6 flashing lights.  I told my husband to turn and look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire unit moved diagonally downward the left lower than the right and then became huge.  I could see the individual lights.  About 12-15 lights.  They were square, and flashed individually from the left to the right.  My husband saw the very last light before it then disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dogs in the neighborhood started barking for quite a while afterwards.<n>

Looking up in northern sky I observed a light that blinked on and then off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately another light went on and off to the left of the first.  Distance between the two was considerable and the weather was clear, no clouds and stars all over the sky.  I observed the first light pulse again and went inside to get my wife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We came out within 10-15 seconds and we both saw the light pulse in the first spot.  We continued to watch and there was no more activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the same experience about a week ago and in the same location of the sky.  When I pointed it to my wife there was no more activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location is always in the same place, which is in between the North star and Big Dipper, and closer to the North star.<n>

I initially thought it to be a death of a star but not sure if it takes such a short time.  The bright object did not move at all so a plane or reflection of a rocket etc. are ruled out.  The distance must have been many many miles up high in the sky.<n>

As I approached the 3 lights the object was so low I thought it was a plane that was going to crash on the freeway, so did everyone else traffic almost came to a stop.  As I got closer, the three lights turned into 6 lights and I could see two separate objects moving very slow too the east on one of the objects had something smaller come out of the rear of the larger object and all 3 objects drifted to the east until they just vanished into the night.<n>

These lights did not move and I quickly gained on them.  Arriving abeam, I clearly observed a dark shaped triangle, darker than the night sky.  The object was stationary, approximately 400 Feet of altitude, and less than a mile north of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to traffic congestion, my attention was divided and therefore I was unable to fully scrutinize this object.  Perplexed about what I had just seen, I drove on and subsequently lost sight of it.  Hindsight, I wish I had found a place to pull over for further observation.<n>

I was laid off from work this week so I have time to explore now.  Saw the lights at 8.pm,  Drove out to Wintersburg Rd and Elliot Rd to see if I can triangulate there flight area.  They were Still Farther To The South/West And In The Same Position from first sighting in Buckeye, and with all My driving out there. So I have to conclude that the lights are out in or past Gila Bend AZ and possibly South of there even. If there is anyone in that area who can keep an eye out, they have started flying at 20:00 now.  They can&#39;t be missed because if they are Dang Bright for Me to see them here, they must be eye burning up close.<n>

I was leaving the gym morning like 645.  i look up saw plane.  Behind it was a bright object looked like a star or far off planet since it wasn&#39;t flickering and was solid no biggie.  But I noticed it was moving so I went to car to get my phone.  It was so far off behind the plane.  Then it disappeared behind the clouds.  So I assumed it was just a star or planet and it was the clouds moving that gave me the feeling it was the object moving.  Then I look up again and this time recorded it.  Moving pretty fast for how far it was.  I have it on video as well.<n>

This was in the vicinity of Tampa International Airport, but was definitely not a plane.  We live due south of the airport and this figure was moving at a much greater speed than any plane I have ever seen and was fully lit, not point lights at various locations like a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was within a couple hundred feet above ground level, it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited for a crash, but heard nothing.  The cross-like figure had both axes of equal length.  There was a curved structure connecting the lower leading vertical axis to the lateral axis.  We have lived at this house for seven years and see air traffic all the time.  I am a licensed architect who studied engineering and I have never seen anything of this nature.  The weather was partly cloudy with a temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit.  There was a large, nearly perfectly round cloud where the object began wi! th winds heading East at 3mph at the time of the event.<n>

A minute or so later, another light appeared below it.  They moved around for a a minute before I went inside to get a camera and handed it to my wife.  She was confused at first and thought she was filming the UFOs, but I told her she was filming the streetlights!<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I took the camera from her and got a still shot of one of the lights before it faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching the lights, a neighbor walked by and saw the lights as well.<n>

Thought it was a plane but there was no sound.  Had my brother-in-law come and look at it as he works on planes.  It didn&#39;t look like a plane to him-he thought the shape was rectangular.  The it just went way up into the sky and disappeared.  It was very dark outside and the sky was clear - approx. 8:30 pm.<n>

They looked like stars, so I just assumed I hadn&#39;t noticed them before.  But around midnight I noticed that the cluster seemed to have moved slightly from where it was earlier.  I paid close attention to it from midnight until almost 1:00am, and it was moving very slowly across the sky.  From 11:30pm-1:00am, it moved about 5-6 inches in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent about an hour on the internet trying to find what this could be - satellites, weather balloon, - but I couldn&#39;t find anything.  However, I noticed that the lights were in a similar formation to the Pleiades star cluster.  But I did research on that and I didn&#39;t find anything that mentioned the Pleiades star cluster moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left around 1:00am, so it could have been there much longer.  I&#39;m going to go out tonight and see if it&#39;s there again.<n>

It caught my attention because of the odd shape with 4 lights and how quickly it moved.  I observed it for a total of maybe 15 seconds.  The first few seconds i was trying to determine if it was a plane; after i realized it was triangular with no wings i tried to determine if it was maybe a cluster of shooting stars or some other explanation, but it became very obvious just as it was moving directly above me that it was at a low elevation and a solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it flew directly over the top of me i was amazed to hear no sound at all.  My friend was unable to see it as well as i was because of trees blocking his view, but he agrees that he has never seen anything (satellite or plane) move that fast from horizon to horizon without making any sound at all. Since he was only able to see 1 of the 4 redish l! ights he though it was a satellite, however he quickly realized it was moving far too fast for that to be the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I probably would have convinced myself that i was seeing things if i hadn&#39;t actually watched it from horizon to horizon without taking my eyes off of it once.<n>

9/11/13 22:20|Saint Peter|MN|Circle|1 minute|A bright glowing orange circular object streaked from West to East in the late evening sky, leaving a wide light colored trail behind.|2/14/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107041.html|542|ndxe201309| A bright glowing orange circular object streaked from West to East in the late evening sky, leaving a wide light colored trail behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time and date are easy to recall, as I was listening to my radio on this historic date, in my tent in the back yard by the garden.  I glanced out the doorway to see if my cat was still sitting there, while waiting for my cell phone alarm to go off to remind me it was time to give my dog his meds and let my dog boarding clients out to potty for the night.  A bright light through the trees to the West caught my eye, and I wondered if it could be a helicopter search light looking for an escaped patient, as the regional treatment center for the mentally ill is about 5 miles away, and not an uncommon event.  A cargo plane headlight also came to mind, but there was no noise, so I ruled both out.  Suddenly a well defined circular object streaked by moving to the East.  It was a very bright glowing orange, like a pumpkin.  It left behind a wide light trail, almost as wide as it was.  It appeared to me, to be about the size of 5 bright planets (such as Venus) in ! the sky put together.  It was too quick to determine any dimension.  Unfortunately, my tent blocked any further viewing from my position, but I did get out to look around in the sky and farm fields in the area, seeing nothing.  It was not a Chinese lantern, as I have seen several of those launched by friends.  It also was not a typical shooting star, as I have known.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While surprised at this incident, I was not shocked, as I saw a group of 3 bright  glowing round objects about 5 years ago, while down at the barn late evening...during the summer.  They were very low in the sky, lined up next to each other, silent, and appeared maybe a mile or two away.  They hovered for about 5 minutes and then jetted off to the North very quickly and out of sight.  This scared me after a short while, so I ran up to the house....as after staring at them I felt like they had some odd hold on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several neighbor men saw a craft over the lake just down the road to the north of us about a half mile, about a year ago.  It was typical saucer shaped with windows and lights.  So I guess I am not the only one in the area who has seen unusual things in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a craft that was sort of triangle shaped. First there was two lights one red and one white, then the red light vanished and the white followed.  I suggested that it might have been a plane, although the lights were not flashing.  Then my wife saw a plane about a minute later, she saw something that freaked her out.  What she explained to me was that of a oval shaped light near the area in the sky where the plane was, she said that the light expanded 10 times its original size then disappeared very quickly. I&#39;d like to think that it was a portal that the light/craft went through.  But who knows?<n>

The second portion of activity included a very bright stationary orange circular object which then appeared to split into 2 objects and disappeared.  This activity lasted only for about 10 minutes but in a slightly different region of the sky.  The red circular objects were still active during this second portion.  No sound, trail or smoke present.<n>

I was out on my back porch relaxing after work when I noticed a light that looked like a star almost straight overhead. I was facing NE with the sun behind me.  I got my wife and a friend outside to check it out.  We all watched it for about 15 minutes before we had to leave.  During that time the object seemed to be shining bright then slowly dim to almost invisible and then back to shiny repeated the whole time we watched it.  The light looked like a big sun reflection off of the object to me as if something was slowly spinning or turning in circles.  It moved very slow from north to south then turned and headed west.  Although very slow the speed did not seem to be constant.  I did pull out my binoculars but all it did was make the star like object look a little bigger.  The pics I took just look like bright blue sky.  I am skeptical but know I saw something I have never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was researching to see if anyone in the area saw what I saw when I found this website.<n>

The sky was clear blue and about 30 degrees up from the horizon I saw a lil patch of dark smoke that expanded out of no where until it thinned out in the sky and thats when I saw this huge football like object.  At first I thought, how cool,  a Good Year Blimp, and then I realized it wasn&#39;t the letters GOODYEAR written on it but 2 rows of what appeared to be windows.  This thing was huge and in the distance because it blended in with the sky like how you would see the moon in the blue sky on a clear sunny day.  After about 10 seconds it faded into the blue of the sky as if a cloak was activated.   This wasn&#39;t over the city of Lebanon, it looked like it was way on the other side of the town in the country farm lands.  It was huge, slow and in the distance.<n>

Seeing a clear sky outside, I walked out with him into the front yard to check out the stars.  As I looked back down to check whether or not my dog (Aussie) was doing his business (He’s a faker sometimes), I caught a blue light to my right in the corner of my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near the shore of the northern end of the Great Salt Lake and I was facing south when I the light caught my attention.  I immediately looked to the west and  noticed a blue orb rapidly approaching from the west and heading due east.  The orb was bright blue like a ball of plasma and had a glow around it. It appeared to be pretty high but still large.  It took what I felt like 6 seconds for it to pass overhead a little to the south and cross over the rocky mountains to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve looked into how far my viewing distance was from my vantage point and It was roughly 50 miles. The 6 second fly over time would suggest an incredible speed.  From the cirrus clouds that sparsely skiffed the sky that night, I would speculate that the orb was at 60k feet or more when It passed over and it made no sound.  The light from the orb did light up the cirrus it passed over slightly but it appeared to be much higher than their level.  I have no clue what it was and this was the first time I’ve ever spotted anything you could call a UFO.<n>

He went out and saw the same elongated-cigar shape lights.  After approximately 7 minutes the lights were gone, but my father said he could still see them from his location.  As I stayed on the phone with him, he said he could see the lights as I stated, but he is colorblind so he could only tell me they were white but elongated-cigar shaped.  I asked him if the object was moving, he said looked like it was standing still.  I asked if he thought was an airplane, a star, a satellite, he replied no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approximately 10 more minutes he said he could no longer see anything.  The lights blinked out and were gone.  Although the craft was too far away, the lights both red and white were elongated-cigar shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 11:21 CST I contacted Mr. Davenport.<n>

We were surprised to see 3 large brilliant red lights off to the left of us, in a V shape formation.  As we watched these 3 lights, additional lights followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally we saw about 10 Red Lights before they, one by one, faded quickly out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These red lights moved slowly and made no sound.  They seemed to stay in that area rather than moving quickly toward us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was one more mysterious thing in the sky just before they all disappeared.  This thing appeared abruptly from the area in the sky where the red lights were.  It was a simi transparent large square shape with rounded corners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a large lacy thing flying straight across the sky approximately 500 feet high.  I say it looked like lace because it was a semi transparent thing with tiny bits of solids.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of these lights, or the semi transparent thing made any sound at all.  It was hard for us to gage the highth of these red lights but our guess is around 1,000 feet high, possibly lower.  The diameter of each light may have been approximately 100 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for all you do Peter...we continue to listen to Coast To Coast and appreciate your announcements from time to time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Boise, Idaho<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As usual, I looked up at the sky to look for constellations.  I was out particularly longer today because I was so transfixed on Venus which was on the west horizon.  As any star watcher knows, the longer you look up at the sky, the more stars you can focus on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I was able to make out many constellations. Eventually, I turned my attention to the eastern side of the sky as it moved north to south.  I spotted a satellite a little before 9 pm and tracked it as it moved across the sky.  I eventually lost it behind a building.  Hoping to see it again, I moved to a clearer area, but unfortunately, I couldn’t find it again.  I scanned the sky again and saw, at approximately 9pm, heading in a southern direction, a very bright light.  It was just as bright as Venus to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I knew that there was no star that bright on the eastern part of the sky, so I gazed at it a little longer.  Because of a tree right under it, I was able! to notice that this ‘star’ was moving.  I was a little stunned, but then I told myself that it was probably a plane. So I watched it as it moved towards the south.  Eventually, the brightness faded and I saw that this bright light was made up of three smaller lights.  The more it moved to the south, the less bright it became and the more I could make out all three lights.  There were two in the front and then one a little, but not by much, dimmer light.  They formed a triangle, with the base being the front and the apex forming the tail.  I thought that maybe it was a plane, but I stared and stared and tried to make out any beacons, or blinking, lights, but never saw any.  If I know anything from watching the sky is that planes always have blinking lights.  So I followed this light, which seemed to be travelling in a linear path, but eventually I lost it behind the same building.<n>

We watched it as it turned North and flew for another 2.5 minutes.  It was approximately 75-100 feet above the houses.  It was flying slow.  We also noticed our neighbour across the street observing it.  We were all stunned.  My husband snapped a photo with his phone.  Wish he&#39;d thought of it sooner because it didn&#39;t turn out too well.  This was definitely NOT a meteor, Chinese lantern or anything of that sort.<n>

As I had a better look I noticed I could not see the plane, only a tiny dot.  What really got my attention (and the reason for this report) was the emence speed of the craft.  It took less than a minute to go from the south horizon to the north horizon. Even if this was a plane, It&#39;s something of a sort I have never seen or heard of before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As it is a somewhat cloud filled day I was looking up in the SSW area of the sky.  Today it is a puffy white cloud, with a deep blue sky.  As I was viewing the sky, looking at the perfect clouds and looking in between them, I noticed a object.  This object was descending directly towards the ground. It was easy to determine this as most aircraft traversing the sky would appear to be moving from North to Nourth or East to west or reverse.  This object was clearly dropping and not traversing or ascending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The gap between the clouds –as I place my hand towards the sky- was from my thumb tip to my index finger tip with my arm completely extended outward and upward.  The object was straight (like a missile) and was white or bright in color.  It appeared to be somewhat ribbed or sectioned (possibly marked but clearly not one solid blank piece).  It traveled through this “gap” in the clouds in about 5 seconds.  Due to there being large and extended clouds lower on the horizon from whence this object passed behind the second cloud (my thumb) I could not see it immerge on the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> May not be anything, but I thought I would send a note.<n>

I turned the photo over, 180%, and saw the object that I do not think is a bird.  There is also a white object up to the right but that may be a cloud.  It was a bright sunny day and quiet just like it would be in the country on a dirt road and no one around.  Peaceful if you will. Just thought you may like to look at the photo.  That&#39;s all I can tell you.  Probably nothing but it settles my mind to know I have told a responsible party about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The object looks to us to be a leaf on the surface of the water, or perhaps a twig, sticking out of the surface.

Now the craft or what ever it was seemed to fade like it was falling out of focus.  Like I didn&#39;t want to see it, like my eyes didn&#39;t want to see it.

When I was driving listening to HLN on my Sirius radio.  When a diamond shape object went over my car or at least the wing of the craft did.  It looked like it was flying around 60-70 miles gliding. It had 3 big red lights and the body of the craft was that flat black.  If they didn&#39;t have them 3 lights on the front and one on each side of the craft I wouldn&#39;t have even known that it was just over me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I thought it was maybe a Stealth but the thing that amazed me is that it was gliding so slow for such a massive, craft and that it made no noise when it was over me when it passed.

We were about 15 miles past the area of New Gloucester.  My husband started to say something to me so I turned my head in his direction (west) and just as I did I saw a large green fireball falling out of the sky. It was about a 3 -5 second fall until it was behind the tree line and out of sight.  The fireball left a long trail behind it.  Background of observer- 32 year old, female, mother.<n>
9/8/13 16:30|Limassol (Cyprus)||Sphere|5 minutes|Two white dots in the day-time sky moving eastwards seen by a father and two daughters over Limassol, Cyprus.|9/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102748.html|610|ndxe201309| Two white dots in the day-time sky moving eastwards seen by a father and two daughters over Limassol, Cyprus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By nature I am a star- and sky-gazer and by profession  I am a physicist (specialty: plasma physics).<n> <n><n> <n><n> That day me and my two young daughters (8 and 7.5 years old), we came to the beach near Crowne Plaza Hotel.  I was laying on my back and watching the dissipation of a small part of a cloud.  The sky was partly clouded. The girls were sitting near me and playing in the sand.  I was gazing intensively in the sky above me.  Then, all of sudden a very small bright spot of white color appeared almost above me in the blue sky near the cloud I was watching.  The sun was in the western part of the sky at an elevation of approx. 55 degrees from the horizon.  I could not tell the size of the object, but it was not just a point and was definitely above the clouds, in my estimation 2-3 km high. It started moving (or drifting) eastwards immediately after appearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was definitely not an airplane, because normally airplanes flying here westwards from Larnaca airport are seen clear from this spot and trajectory of their take-off is at approx. 30 degrees to the trajectory of these unidentified objects.  Then I thought that it may be a satellite(s), but I quickly dismissed the thought because it was a sunny day, and, surely, I could not see satellite in the sky lit blue by the bright sunrays. Nor could it be some weather-control balloon(s).  And that&#39;s because the phenomenon appeared suddenly under a scrupulous eye.  And, especially, because after one minute of observation… another one, same-shape object suddenly appeared out of nowhere at the same level about 10 degrees to the right (south) of the first one.  And now they both were floating eastwards at the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon sighting of the first object I immediately called my daughters to watch it. They both saw it and were thrilled, since we were watching for a view day before the reports of UFO-sightings in the Internet. There were other people on the beach, but it seemed that nobody else saw the objects, because they were very small and moving among clouds. I think that this is sometimes the &#34;policy&#34; of the UFOs: to appear on a cloudy sky to use clouds as cover.  	 Naturally, I reached for my android Samsung mobile phone and tried to film the event, but the attempt failed, because my wife took the memory stick (with her photos) out of the device. We all were so disappointed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a minute the two objects moved together at the same speed. Then the first one disappeared and the second one continued the flight alone for another 2-3 minutes till it disappeared behind a distant cloud in the east at approx. 50 degrees above the horizon. It seemed to me as if they were (or are) monitoring the area… in shifts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a good feelings (if one forgets about the filming fiasco) and was very happy to have seen the phenomenon during daytime, because I had 3 other UFO-sightings before and all of them were at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I remembered what I understood to be my night-sighting of UFO in this area about 8-9 years ago. That was a star moving very fast eastwards in the exactly the same trajectory. The reason why I thought it was an UFO was the speed, for the object covered half of the night-sky in approx. 15 seconds, while satellites move at least 3 times slower.<n>

Jeff DeBlanc, USMC WWII Ace with Medal of Honor and Adrian Conrad, engineer who help design and build the Army &#34;Jumps&#34; reconnaissance drones introduced in Desert Storm.  Both friends related UFO they saw. Jeff was warned never to mention his WWII encounter with a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today I was on my 2nd floor balcony observing the very display of numerous stars over Austin, where city glare and haze limit observable stars to a dozen or so every night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning at 5 AM I was viewing the eastern sky with large 10 power binoculars when a star of the second magnitude (brightness) appeared to be blinking with reds and blues in addition to its white light.  It was at 100 degrees East, elevation about 45 degrees, and with the binoculars it was like the thing I reported to your site about a week ago.  I took some clumsy videos that time, but was afraid I had taken photos of lights in the parking lot below my balcony, and because there were only short &#34;views&#34; of the supposed UFO lasting only moments during a long blank video, I did not edit or forward the videos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning, however, I made nine videos, and was able to zoom in with my 15 power optical lens and capture many seconds of continuous video images of the UFO blinking red, green, brown, orange, white, blue, and mixed colors.  I was forced to hold the camera in my hands, so the UFO seems to be jumping and zooming around, but that&#39;s due to my jiggling hands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What it did do was appear as if it were a blinking white star, but suddenly it would become an round image, as if it were holding up a red, brown, green or orange shield in front of itself.  The apparent disk shielding the UFO was solid color, or occasionally a dull color rimmed with red or orange.  It rapidly changed appearance, with the &#34;shield&#34; image seemingly closer and larger than the hidden image that seemed to be behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will post all today&#39;s videos as Google files as soon as I figure out how to do that.  Maybe you can recommend someone who could coach me.  The files are on my SD drive with copies on my hard drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My camera is now mounted on a tripod supported my a lightweight table on my balcony, and it the sky clears, I will try looking in the same place in the sky as I did last night, 100 deg East, about 45 deg elevation.<n>

It looked like a pillar of luminescent smoke from a distance.  As it got closer and I could see it better it looked almost like a chain of 4-6 plastic bags with a candle inside.  (Our brains were trying to comprehend what we were seeing more than remembering exactly what it looked like.  Unfortunately no one thought to grab a camera until it had gotten too far away)  It moved slowly and horizontally and we could actually see energy lines that it was riding on.  They stayed in line but would bobble back and forth sometimes.  The edges and body of the orb seemed to be made out of plasma or something and I observed a soft yellow glow while others saw more red.  It passed within about 20 feet of us just a dozen feet above the roof.  Since then I&#39;ve talked to 2 friends who also saw this from the tower district.  My research has led me to believe they were inter-dimensional balls of plasma which had leaked through from another dimension and fully materialized in our own.  Many of us are into meditation and healing, this thing left us with a very wonderful feeling and has changed all of our lives for the better.  Another friend was also below us in her room playing bass, we wonder if that had something to do with it.<n>

Then we noticed a smaller light directly across the sky to it. It to was changing colors.  The two light were in sync with each other. I tried to video tape it with my phone, but the lights wouldn&#39;t show up.  So I began to flash my camera towards the large one.  When I did it began to change color and move up and down, right to left. I did the same to the small light. The big light would respond in the manner.  The small light would just change color.  At one point the large light became bright and looked triangular in shape.  The lights are still outside and are still sitting in the sky.  The large one would do maneuvers like I have never seen before. Almost as it were like a pen writing in the sky. That is the only way I know how to explain it.<n>

I pointed it out to my friend (There was only one that we saw) and we continued to look at it up in the sky.  There was no blinking lights at all, nor could I tell what the shape was, it was just a glowing orange light.  My friend said he saw it change the color to a little bit of purple, I did not see this.  About 15-20 seconds after I spotted it, it was becoming dimmer, then disappeared (there were no clouds in the sky).  About 10 seconds after it disappeared we saw the light again as it was becoming brighter as it traveled across the sky.  As this was happening, there was another person across the street looking up in the sky, watching the exact same thing we were.  This object then began to get dimmer, till it finally disappeared and we never saw it again.  I have never seen this ! before living here 25 years of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We both saw this bright red light coming from the North headed South.  It appeared to be moving very slow as it took a long time to finally reach us. When directly overhead we realized there was absolutely no sound.  I surmise that whatever it was, was much higher than an airplane. It continued to head directly south.  I am wondering if it might have been a drone, but I don’t know if a drone would put off such a bright red light. The lack of any noise as it was directly over my head leads me to believe it was actually very high in the sky.  The light was a very intense red and I am surprised if there weren’t other sightings of whatever this was.  I have never seen anything like this before and do not think it was a satellite.<n>

One light appeared by itself, and then as it turned inland towards the park and disappeared into what was perceived as clouds, another appeared and flew in exactly the same path, turning inland a bit earlier than the first.  The third turned in a bit earlier still but the fourth made a turn inland at approximately the same place as the first.  All four followed each other in formation, approximately two minutes apart. There was no sound and the lights consistently glowed.  They were flying at a constant speed, almost gliding.  They appeared close enough to the ground that in daylight, it would have been obvious what they were.  The night was partially cloudy and the stars were only visible as the clouds dissipated.<n>

As we were passing Painter Hill Road my teenage son noticed what he thought was a very bright star.  Then he said &#34;Oh wow, it&#39;s orange and there are a bunch of them&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled over, turned off the car and lights.  We were both able to capture what we were seeing with our phones.  We thought we were seeing a group of helicopters, mostly because of the speed they were moving, but then realized there was so sound coming from them at all.  It was a very dark and still night with light drizzle.  So whatever we were seeing was below the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got out of the car to see and film better.  The group of lights reminded me of what a car cigarette lighter looks like when burning.  The orange color was very bright but looking at them did not hurt your eyes and they did not seem to emit any radiant light.  One light would fade out then back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The group went over our heads and one light faded and disappeared even though I felt it was still moving.  Then the rest were gone.  This lasted about 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then drove back to Woodbury, slowing down in the open areas to hoping to see the lights again, but did not.<n>

The object by this time was midway across the sky.  (about 2 second period).  At first I couldn&#39;t see what my friend was seeing because my house momentarily blocked my vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, within a half a second, I saw a white/orange circular object racing across the sky.  Inside of three seconds, it had faded into the northern horizon.  The total time it took the object to cross from the southern to northern horizon was about 5 to 6 seconds.  I have NEVER seen anything move that fast in my life!  It did not seem to have a tail from my vantage point.<n>

It was an orange light with a white center.  It was a singular object to our knowledge. It moved in a loop de loop very quickly and went over the hill.  Over the period of a half hour beginning at 9:00pm it was seen several more times coming back over the hill, moving through trees, and then back to the north side of the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The people involved with the sighting are 30 and 31, the 30 year old is a female, and the 31 year old is male. We were simply talking in her living room while her front door was open when we saw the object. I the male responded first by telling her I just saw a UFO.  Then as before stated, we saw the object several times over the next half hour.<n>
9/7/13 20:22|Onalaska|WI|Fireball|10 minutes|Yellow/Orange fireball type objects flying in triangular formation hovering just north of the La Crosse, WI airport over Lake Onalaska.|9/9/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102025.html|635|ndxe201309| Yellow/Orange fireball type objects flying in triangular formation hovering just north of the La Crosse, WI airport over Lake Onalaska<n> <n><n> <n><n> From approximately 20:20 to 20:28 I witnessed 12 fireball shaped objects in the sky that were flying in formation.  Four separate triangular shaped formations, which consisted of 3 fireball objects in each triangular formation.  At different times, one fireball object would break away from their triangular formation and move in very rapid movement; appearing to move horizontally away from their group of three fireballs and then rapidly rejoin their formation after 3 to 4 rapid movements away from their group of three.  The four groups of three went from a straight line and then formed a “V” shape almost like a flight of geese does.  I spoke with three other individuals who also saw it, but I also witnessed other people along my drive who were pointing to them in the sky.  This took place over Lake Onalaska, just north of the La Crosse airport, between La Crosse, WI and Onalaska, WI.  The fireballs moved too erratically and were shaped too round to be convent! ional, manmade aircraft.  They seemed to have the ability to cloak themselves because one minute they were visible and the next they were gone.  They had the ability to hover, but they also had the ability to move very quickly as well.  I’ve never witnessed anything like it.  I was driving south on Hwy 35 and attempted to call my wife on my cell phone who was at a friend’s house to see if she could see what I was witnessing and my cell phone was unable to get a signal to complete the call.  The area I was in always has a cellular signal available, but I can only speculate that the objects in the sky had the ability to disrupt the cellular signal, because once they were no longer visible, the cellular communications were restored.  When I made it to the location where my wife was at, three other people at the house saw what I was talking about; the strange thing is, from their location only three of the fireball objects were visible…again I can only speculate that from their! perspective the other objects were cloaked.  Cellular signals! were sp otty for the rest of the night.  The time of the sighting was during dusk or sunset lighting….again speculation that maybe that type of lighting makes it difficult for their objects to cloak themselves.  These objects were in my opinion definitely not manmade.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Why a UFO?  They were silent, emitting no noise at low altitude, estimated at 2000 to 5000 feet.  Also, they &#34;materialized&#34; in same area of the sky, (45 degress on horizon looking west) then flew over us.  They all then de-materialized at about 45 degrees looking east.  They were a hazy reddish color, oval shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flew mostly in a straight line following each other although they were spaced differently apart. Moved faster than a plane or jet.<n>

They looked like orange, circular  balls of light and they seemed to come in groups of 3 at a time where they semi-shifted course in the sky, became close together, then seemed to dissapate...when the next group of 2-3 would make their way across the sky in a line-fashion, shift direction, come close together, then dissipate.   They were  definitely NOT flares in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure what we witnessed tonight, but never seen anything like it before.<n>

However, the object was omitting a vapor all the way around it sort of like the vapor that you see coming off an asphalt road when it&#39;s 110 degrees out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I am watching this in disbelief shaking my head wiping my eyes with my shirt and I swear, as God is my witness, this &#34;thing&#34; disappears in front of my eyes one section at a time.... front, then the middle, then the rear of the object..... GONE....VANISHED…<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw and I will be willing to take a lie detector test givin! by any sanctioned agency dealing with U.F.O&#39;s...  The craziest thing off all of this is that it looked like the cigar shaped object seemed to be trying to mimmick the color of the plane.

However, as I looked up to try to catch a glimpse of the jets I saw what I believe to be a single white to off white colored round or oval shaped object traveling at a rather slow speed in what I believed to be the opposite direction of the jet(s).  It was, at some times covered by clouds, but I was able to view it for over 2 minutes making it&#39;s way from roughly north to east, but I believe the jets had just passed by going the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hard to say if the military jets were on a routine training exercise or if they were trying to track the object.  Conversely, perhaps the jets were on a routine training  operation and the object was checking them out.  Total speculation, I realize, but I did in fact see something like I have never seen before; I wish I had a telescope so I could have picked out more detail.<n>

There were only a couple clouds in the air and some way off in the background. The disk appeared to be flying south for the next several seconds I watched it as it slowed down and changed sizes like it was shrinking.  The light turned green and as I crossed 249 still heading west on Bordeaux it looked like it was the shape of a black ball then there was a little white flash and it was gone.  I searched the sky and could not see where the disk(ball) had gone to.  To give you an idea how big it was initially, if you held a quarter by a third at 3’ (arm’s length) this would be size of the initial craft.   I am not far from Hooks Airport, but this was not a jet, helicopter or plane.  I am IT College Student, former professional trucker.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was approaching Hwy 62 from 145 south.  Object appeared on the horizon of the Mountain tops in front of me.  It went straight into the air upwards in motion. It then stopped when high in the air and went straight west till out of sight in a high rate of speed.  Its first appearance was about the size of the moon.  The center was green in color turning purple to the outside.  The radio station playing in the shuttle van had a strange humming while the object was going up.  When high in the sky its color seemed almost white with an orange hue.  It took only a couple seconds for it to appear the size of a pencil tip while in its upward motion when it stopped before turning in a westerly direction.<n>

First thought it was an airplane or a Chinese lantern, but when it started getting lower thought it was possibly a life flight helicopter.  It descended straight down rapidly at a 45 degree angle, almost like a flare from a flare gun.  It stopped blinking and began pulsating - we tried to slow the vehicle down to take photos but couldn&#39;t get a clear shot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a large blue water tower on the left side of the highway - between the Ybor City exit and the I-4 interchange - and when we began driving past it I started screaming &#34;what is it&#34;. It was a flat black and round (as if you&#39;d lay a car tire on its side) with one large round blinking white light on the left, and two large round red lights in the right side. It was near the same size AS the water tower so I was surprised nobody else could see it, it was VERY large.  My daughter began crying and we couldn&#39;t find an exit to turn around to look for it.  The craft came straight down, and literally STOPPED beside the water tower, it was hovering beside it.  That&#39;s when I started panicking because if it was an airplane, it was close enough to crash into the tower.  It was not a small engine plane as it had NO wings at all. Just a large black round &amp; disc shaped with the 3 lights.  It made absolutely no noise, and when we started passing it, it very rapidly rotated out of sight to the right side, back behind the water tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a half hour later, we drove to the roof of the parking garage (5th floor) at the Hard Rock Casino in Tampa to see if maybe we could be high enough to see it or take a picture, but only had cell phones and the video was poor quality.  My fiancé stood on the hood of my car and I was just outside the car, and there were two more of the identical craft, approximately 1000 feet away - but these ones were ascending straight up.  Not at an angle at all, not very fast.  The same 1 white light and 2 red ones on each. I have never seen anything like this before in my life, I&#39;m still really shaken at how close they were.<n>

I have seen meteors, comets, satellites and I often watch the space station as it passes overhead so I am very used to seeing moving objects in the night sky.  Both my boyfriend and myself witnessed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out tonight to try and see if I could catch any of the lunar module launch from Virginia at 11:25pm.  Unfortunately there were too many trees obstructing my view but I did notice something else moving in the sky to the south.  It looked like a star. It looked very much like a star.  It wasn’t blinking at all and it was catching the light the same way the space station or a satellite would but its movements were very fast and erratic.  I observed the object for a little over a half hour and only went inside because it was very late, it was still there when I left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object would remain stationary for quite some time and then move very suddenly and very fast in various directions. Sometimes it would move to the left or right or straight up or down, other times it swerved in a figure eight type of pattern.  At one point an airplane passed close beneath it and it moved suddenly straight up and back away from the plane and then remained still until the plane passed, at which point it moved lower again.  It was moving very quickly and changed direction with ease and had a sort of halo effect around it.  When it moved it created a slight tail trailing behind it.   It stayed in the same general area of the sky, almost as if it were circling the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where I was standing the object was 156 degrees to the south east (I have a compass app) and not terribly high up, right about in the area of the constellation of Aquarius.  (I have an app that shows me where the constellations are at any time so I am sure of this.)  It was very small, the same size as a star.  If I hadn’t been watching the sky long enough to see it move I would have thought it was a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen any object move in the sky like this.  I am an amateur astronomer and my boyfriend has a degree in physics and we cannot explain what we saw.  I am not the type of person to instantly think of a UFO, but once you have ruled out the possible whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth, so I am reporting it in the hopes of finding out what it was.  I would welcome and explanation if you have ever seen anything like this before.<n>

The object appeared at first, to resemble a meteorite.  However, I as I continued to watch, the orange spherical object left a trail of what looked like orange “sparks” from it.  The trail became brighter and brighter as the object descended from high in the night sky.  I thought if it was a meteorite, it would eventually burn up and the brightness would decrease.  However, the object stopped and hovered stationary for a minute or two and then proceeded from West to Southeast in a straight, horizontal line.  The object then again hovered for 2-3 minutes over a wooded area over Bucks County, and proceeded south beyond my view.  The object was glowing orange and did not have the typical red and green aircraft marker lights.  Other small commercial aircraft were in the area.<n>

I could sense a low rumble (the only way I can describe it) but could barely hear it.  I looked up to see where it was coming from and I saw a slow moving triangular shaped craft moving above me.  The sound quickly faded once it was not exactly over my head and it was now silent.  The craft had four lights closely spaced together near the front of the craft in a half circle shape, and then a light at the back two corners.  These lights were constant and were a faint orange color. In the center was a very slow pulsing red light.  I watched the craft with some binoculars I had with me, and could not make out much other than its general shape. I watched it fly off for at least 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 15 minutes later, I feel the same sensation from earlier and look up to see the craft again passing over in the same direction.  Once again I watched it for a long time.  From the size of the craft and the angles as it passed, the craft was not that high in the air.   A few thousand feet is all.  I watched other aircraft in the area and could tell they were much higher and that their light patterns were consistent with regular aircraft while this craft clearly did not have the usual lighting setup.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was leaving location about 15 minutes later I was now on a lease road and I kept watching the sky.  I saw the same craft once again flying in the opposite direction from the first two sightings. Once again I watch it until I can&#39;t see it.  Soon I entered onto a small highway leading to the interstate and I saw the craft once again!  This time I could see the craft from the side and it was clearly triangular and appeared to have an extra marker light &#34;midwing&#34; that could not be seen directly beneath.  The craft appeared to be traveling in a loop that was northeast to southwest.  Possibly a drone?  Clearly not an FAA approved craft. Each time I could &#34;sense&#34; the craft but there was next to no sound, and then only for a! moment, and it moved very slowly.  I called a coworker who reported to me that he has been told by a vacuum truck driver who works the area that he too has seen a craft flying out here at night.  I will be speaking with this person in the morning to see if our sightings are similar.<n>

It was positioned very low in the sky, compared to the stars.  It was at least 5 times bigger in diameter than the brightest star in the sky seen that night.  It didn’t move from its position for about 30-45 minutes (or maybe longer; I can only estimate from the time when I spotted it).  I saw it during my night walk and went back to check on it a couple times (it could only be seen from the hill near my house).  When I went to check on it again after 22:00, it wasn’t there anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No other bright stars were present at this time.  The object seemed to hover around that area only to move only back and forth maybe 100ft?  It would move discretely from north and then move again to the south but never making any big move.  It made no sense when it would get dim or brighter either?  It could be stationary for a time and get dimmer then all of a sudden get brighter. (Like when a plane puts its landing gear light on.)  It appeared to be poised effortlessly for 45minutes in that same area only it would dim and then brighten again.  At one point in time there seemed to be a series of flashes taking place outside the object, this lasted only a couple seconds (like picture flashes from a camera).  Also, when the object was dim the shape seeme! d like a teardrop shape?  At approximately 250am the object had moved eastward and was out of sight from my standpoint.<n>

My friend was leaving at 1:20 am and called me seconds after he had left telling me to get out here NOW, I went out looked n/nw and saw a glittering glowing orange/red series of lights with 2 DISTINCT what I can only describe as headlights inside EACH of the 8 fireballs slowly seperating but staying in pairs, 8 total making a &#34;staggered&#34; like &#34;teeth&#34; formation across the sky about a 1/2 mile wide formation.  They all spread out, moved towards us and then literally dissapaited and vanished, then all the sudden from our right comes from over the houses a BRIGHT larger version of what We saw came over th where these 8 objects had vanished and hovered there, it moved strange very jerky movements but maintained a bee line for the area where the others disappeared the the large one did just what the other 8 did and slowly &#34;flickered out&#34; then vanished.  NO NOISE at! all and it was dead quiet in my neighborhood. It was soo eerie looking in the BLACK sky.  Now at 2:5 am the are where the objects were is all cloud covered now.  I&#39;ve researched this site and there appears to be an actual ufo flap going on in our area, look at the recent sightings in south jersey, all the same I was suprised to also read people saying that it has been happeneing nearly nightly.<n>

9/5/13 23:45|Fairport|NY|Oval|20+ minutes|Flying orb of light casts an eerie silence.|9/9/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101965.html|667|ndxe201309| Flying orb of light casts an eerie silence<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bright oval light flying around 1 mile off the ground and between 1.5 and 3 miles in distance from my back yard, this object is easily visible.  Given the distance whatever created this light was about the size of a school bus in diameter.  This object was changing course in an instant moving at very high rates of speed also hovering completely still and always stayed within view, movement that indicated intelligent changes in direction, for example the light would gain altitude dramatically followed by a pause hovering completely still then a much slower decent, after that the object moved around from east to west in more of a diagonal pattern, the type of maneuvers no conventional aircraft could come close to, and this is definitely not an object being pushed around by wind.  It also changed colors from bright white to red/amber, the flying oval appeared to distort into rectangular and triangular shapes then quickly return to an oval, the entire time there wa! s trail of dimmer light coming down off the object like a tail or an exhaust beam always pointing towards the ground.  The object made no noise and there was a strange silence in my neighborhood no noise from the usual crickets and night time bugs that are always quite loud here at night, only the occasional passing car on a nearby road broke the silence. I brought my girlfriend outside to make sure I wasn&#39;t losing it..  she saw it as well. I attempted to record the event on my cell phone, while recording I could see the light on my screen, after when i reviewed the film there was nothing but complete blackness, another strange thing is I was talking during most of the recording( describing the object) and while there was some other random noises like me standing on some bricks to get a better view, my voice was not on the recording at all!  This thing was out there over 30 mins and it was still hovering in view when we went back inside.<n>

I wondered if it was helicopters close to the ground which can happen since we are near a military runway.  They hover over the whole neighborhood at all hours. I noticed that the lights were moving in perfect unison.  I realized that it was one aircraft and pointed it out to the people in my vehicle.  Everybody saw it and confirmed that it must be gigantic since it was 3 feet across from our vantage point.  If you put your hands out in front of yourself and raise them so that your palms are level with the top of your head making sure your arms are outstretched.  Hold them about 3 feet apart and that&#39;s how big it was from our point of view.  Everybody was saying &#34;WHAT IS THAT?!&#34;  Then the passenger front seat exclaimed I can see it its a giant saucer.  Nobody else could make out the shape but her since the night sky was conveniently the right overcast blackness that it was nearly invisible.  It made NO sound. I opened my window to see if it was a jet or something.  The military was expecting them so it must either be military which is incredible that they bring something like that underneath our noses and not one report because I have checked or they we are friends with them.<n>

We went outside and looked south towards northern California or Eastern Oregon.  It was hard to tell where exactly these lights were coming from.  All we know is that the light flashes were occurring at random moments over the mountains.  The sky was clear, stars were clearly visible, and there was no sound coming from these flashes.  The area where we witnessed these flashes was extremely quiet.  No cars, no loud machinery, etc.  The lights flashed at random bursts.   Some bursts of lights were more intense than others.  They would flash white and some bigger flashes contained a white ball of light in the middle.  In some cases, the flashes extended over the mountains and beamed towards our direction. Each burst was on the other side of the mountains.  These flashes have been going off since 9:00 pm and have continued into the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Very high in the sky, I saw what appeared to be a plane on fire yet it continued to move across the sky at the speed of a plane.  It was more round however than a plane and I could hear no sound.  I then thought that maybe it was a hot air balloon, but it was way too high, and moving too fast for that.  I took video of it with my phone, but of course on video, you definitely lose what it really looked like with the naked eye.  It continued traveling until suddenly it seemed like the flame went out or it simply disappeared.<n>

I was out on my back porch when I stood up to look at the sky and saw a very bright light, low in the sky towards the horizon.  I quickly looked around at the other dim stars and realized this was too big and too bright to be a star.  I was staring at the light for a couple minutes and noticed it changing in shape from what looked a traditional star (shape), circle, and to a triangle. It was not moving but was pulsating, and would pulse hints of red and blue.  I knew it was not a plane; as one was passing over me, closer then the light but was still smaller and dimmer then the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got the light on video for about 2 ½ minutes. I am not so sure how to work the zoom on my phone so it does not do it much justice, but you can clearly see it and even a plane passing by, which looks completely different.  The stars where not visible on my video because they were so faint. I am sure it was not a star or plane.  I had to go inside to but my baby to sleep as he started fussing.  I did not want to leave the light, as I felt it was going to do something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just something I have never witnessed before. It was almost mesmerizing.  I came back outside immediately after I put my son back to sleep and it was gone.  There were no stars even remotely close to the size and brightness of it.  It had been about 10-15 minutes between when I left it and came back. I can send the video if you are interested.  It is not very good video but you can see the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer: 26 year old female, nursing student and mother of an 8 month old son. I am wondering if anybody else in Sacramento saw this?<n>

It was very bright and suddenly vanished.  It was not very cloudy at all, and it was still very sunny.  The object moved slighty and quickly before vanishing.  I scoured the sky trying to spot it once more.  Shortly after I turned on to another road I spotted it again.  This time it was smaller and in a different location.  I watched it as much as possible while trying to drive safely.  The object vanished once again.  I decided to pull over and try to record these objects but my cell phone camera could not clearly pick them up.  I spotted it two more times in different places.  They would move a distance and then vanish again.  There was an unusual amount of planes in the area as well.  Again these objects appeared round and very reflective.  Almost silver in color.  This isn&#39;t my first sighting like this in the Gallatin area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So close together it may have looked like one object at a glanc<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking out my office window towards four peaks as something caught my eye, I thought it was a firework at first but upon a closer look it was not.  A small cluster of white orbs appearred rapidly one by one.  There was probably about 10-15 of them but they were so close together it may have looked like one object at a glace.  They stayed lit for about 4 seconds and just as quick as they appeared, one by one they disappeared.  The whole thing lasted probably 7-8 seconds. I quickly told my collegues (who thought I was crazy)  We watched the same area and about 2 minutes later the same thing appeared in the sky about 20-30 miles North of four peaks this time and much higher.  They were just as baffled as me. None of us had ever seen anything like that in the sky before<n>

It wasn&#39;t moving at all but was MUCH brighter than any thing I&#39;d ever seen in the sky.  We stopped and got out of the car.  It then started moving directly towards us. It didn&#39;t move directly towards us, it banked out to the right and then maneuvered over us.  As it got close, the bright amber light disappeared and all we could see was the very bright brilliant colored flashing lights on the craft.  The light looked so pure and I could see every color of the rainbow in this pure white light.  It made absolutely no noise whatsoever.  Have been very skeptical until now.  This is a life changer.<n>

It was long and shinning in the sun light. It was flying from the west to the east.  I did not think anything of it until it turned sideways while still moving in the same direction.  It appeared to be drifting with the wind.  Then it turned back to its normal position and continued to move to the east of Susanville.  What was strange was that as it moved east out of sight it had a bright white tail light.<n>

There are no airports here.  I determined the altitude by following the sound the craft made, which was a soft, hollow whistling noise as it passed overhead.  Did not sound like any jet aircraft I&#39;ve heard before; it was very quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sky flashed a dim green as craft passed overhead, like heat lightning.

Within the white flashing lights you could see almost every color in the spectrum.  It appeared to be triangle/diamond shaped and made absolutely no noise.  Couldn&#39;t judge the distance and felt disoriented after viewing it. It appeared to disappear in the distance but video indicates scattered flashing lights.<n>

Sky Watch Report<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watch the sky on a subconscious level – very thoroughly and passionately, very focused on the basic layout of the night and day skies around me – it’s innate, I believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything out of the ordinary in the night sky – not for one out of any of the millions of seconds that my eyes have spent glued upwards, lost in the majesty of it all – have I spied anything that even remotely tickled my senses and made some primal alarm go of in the recesses of my modernized human brain, as I experienced late last night in my own backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to smoke a cigarette around 11:30pm, before heading to sleep.  This is routine for me, and the routine does not ever include the porch light at that hour, so it remains a very darkly lit routine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I earlier noted, I have some built-in awareness of the sky in general, having spent so much time looking at its diagram and the layout of the stars, etc.  Last night, as I stepped outside, I was struck immediately by an unfamiliar “star” to the east from me, northeastwardly somewhere.  Upon closer observation, I saw that it was in no way a star, as it was flashing four primary colors in sequence (not necessary in any particular order that I ever tracked though), just: blue, green, orange, red; and white – bright white – also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my roommate outside to show him, as I was taken aback by what I was seeing, especially after I determined that this object was not only indeed, flashing colors – but also was seeming to move in the fashion of being pulled in opposite directions at once – never really making any substantial progress in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It remained more or less, in the same location for at least twenty minutes while we watched it through the scope at low mag. The colors were definitely confirmed that way as well by both observing parties. The magnification also made apparent, the general nature of the object as well. It was observed at numerous points in time as an unnaturally bright white – to color-changing “fireball” traveling at an extremely slow and steady speed across the distant night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several common aircraft were seen flying in between the location of the object and myself at usual altitudes, creating the appearance of the object marinating a shockingly steady and almost stationary position and an exceptional altitude of its own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It remained for as long as I could stay awake – just gradually traveling across the sky in a southward surge that only became apparent at the end of my observations. It was still flashing brightly, had not dimmed at all, all the same colors and appearance as it had when I first spotted it. It was mind boggling and amazing, it was scary as hell. I am still kind of in shock.<n>

It seemed to be far away, but low enough in sky for me to observe these lights moving in a circular motion giving the impression of a round shaped craft.  I stood and watched to see if it was moving away, up or down, or coming closer like an aircraft or helicopter.  However, it remained in exactly the same position and did not change size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few minutes my husband returned home and I screamed for him to come and see the object.  At that very moment another object appeared in the sky, below the multicolored one, but it appeared to be a star.  It slowly started to rise up towards the colored object and eventually was above it.  Then the star type object started to display the same circular flashing, multicolored lights.  We watched this continue for at least five minutes.  When I ran to! get my binoculars and camera, the objects disappeared.  My husband stated that they just faded away.  There were some clouds tonight, but not many, and it was a good clear view of the many stars in the sky, more than we&#39;ve seen in a long time, living in the city.<n>

I looked up to see an object flying overhead.  It appeared to be at 1,000 – 2,000 AGL (I’m at sea level).  It was diamond-shaped, but with soft edges – ie, it looked not-quite round, not-quite a diamond.  Assuming I’m right about the altitude, it was the size of a corporate jet.   Wat really caught my attention was its colors: its right half was red, its left half green - yes, the opposite of navigation running lights.  These colors weren’t on the tips – each entire half of the craft was of each color.  They lights didn’t flash or pulse.  It could have been painted on.  It was silent.  It was moving basically west in a straight line  (tracking the east-west run of the coastline).  It was moving at probably 200 kts, given how fast it traversed my view.  I saw it starting right overhead, and continuing till trees blocked my view, so it lasted maybe 20 - 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a balloon-it moved in a perfectly straight line westbound, while there is always a southern sea breeze.  It emitted no visible exhaust.  It did not glow or flash.  A woman with me saw the same thing.<n>

I am an active satellite and ISS observer and am always scanning the sky for activity.  On this night, three fast moving lights in a delta formation appeared suddenly from the North West and were traveling South East at a rate of speed I&#39;ve never seen before.  They appeared to be satellite-like objects in brightness and appearance (somewhere above the mesosphere) but  were less bright than the space station.  Three things caught my attention that made me think they were extraordinary; #1- their formation #2- their speed, which was approximately 4-5 time faster than anything I’ve ever seen in space and #3- their trajectory was not straight.  As they streaked across the sky they made a slow turn to East and their formation slightly changed.  It remained a delta, but their proximity to each other loosened up slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed them, I immediately brought my wife’s attention to it and we both observed the entire incident together, and afterward shared the same view of what we had just witnessed.<n>
9/4/13 08:45|Waxhaw|NC|Sphere|40 minutes|Multiple red/orange orbs hovering in sky, and an aircraft with orange triangle on bottom, and silent military helicopter spotted.|9/9/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101938.html|708|ndxe201309| Multiple red/orange orbs hovering in sky, and an aircraft with orange triangle on bottom, and silent military helicopter spotted<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of Sept 4th, 2013 in Waxhaw, NC my husband rushed into the house from the garage telling me to come and take a look at something.  Once outside the front of our house he pointed to the sky and said &#34; I just saw a big ball of light fly across the sky and there are still two more hovering there.&#34;  I looked and sure enough, there were two shimmering orbs and above those was a very bright colorful star.  The two orbs were reddish orange in color and were very bright.  They were right above the tree line on the horizon (one on top of the other), I estimate maybe around 20 miles away or closer.  I kept on comparing them to what I thought was this superbright &#34;star&#34; above both of them and was just in awe of how these orbs could be stationary, yet about 5 times bigger than this star and bright reddish orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then slowly, the orb on the bottom of everything closet to the tree line started moving to the right (west)very quickly and was blinking blue and red.  If I hadn&#39;t just watched it be a big stationary orb for about 5 minutes, I would have thought it was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my husband asked me to go inside because people would think we were crazy and we should just forget about it. So, I went inside, but of course had to check to see if there was anything in sky behind our house.  As I walked out the backdoor and got beyond our back porch there&#39;s a silent (I&#39;m sure military) helicopter just above our house headed southwest towards where I saw the orb headed.  There were lights (regular spot light type lights) on the bottom of the helicopter and I could see the &#34;feet&#34; that the helicopter lands with, but couldn&#39;t hear a thing! Just a slight wooshing of air and that was it. I was amazed and ran inside to get my husband out of the garage to come and see-  In the approximately 5 seconds it took for us both to get outside in the back yard the helicopter was totally gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed outside for about two minutes just talking about everything that was going on and all of the sudden above our heads there was an aircraft with a large orange/red triangle on the bottom, (the craft was about the size and shape of a really weird plane), a second mini triangle on the back of what looked like a tail end, and very &#34;plane like&#34; red and blue flashes on what we assume was the &#34;wing&#34; tips on each side of the large triangle. It was headed to the east. The opposite direction of where the helicopter was going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were really shocked and stood in the backyard talking about what could possibly going on... There are military drills around here a lot, so maybe this was a military drill? Maybe the military has developed orb and triangle lighted planes? We are on the brink of war with Syria, so who knows...  So then after about 4-5 minutes we go back to the front of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now there are &#34;heat lightning flashes&#34; to the east (I saw about 4) and the 2nd orb is moving straight upwards. Just going straight up in a line pretty slowly.  Then, it flashed and disappeared for a second, reappeared, and quickly moved west blinking like an airplane just like the other one did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside to call it a night; I clearly knew we weren&#39;t going to find out what these things were.  My husband stayed outside.  About 10 minutes later he comes running in the house telling me to come outside. I go outside and he tells me about a super fast white streak that blazed across the sky east to west, but it was now gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ALSO GONE IS THE HUGE STAR FROM EARLIER!! So, what I thought was a super bright star or planet that was having a good day, was not that at all. No more heat lightning either, everything was now totally calm and normal. What was all this?<n>

Literally almost over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I recall once I looked at the source was a blueish/white light with a bit of a tail, sort of like a spade, but the tail wasn&#39;t as acute. Also, the spade of light was slightly split in the middle by a blue streak. This light source/spade was about 20 yards wide and 30 yards long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I imagine this phenomenon was a craft exploding into acceleration and what I saw was the propulsion like that from a modern rocket ship. Except this was light not fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And it made no noise at all, that&#39;s the most unbelievable part to me, being as close as I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t believe I was abducted because there was no loss of time or bodily marks and such. Not even feelings of fear or unease.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although this was my first of three verified sightings/encounters in a month.

It would reappear in a different area and then reappear half way across the sky from its original position.  Then we noticed a few more flashing lights moving around the original one, all doing the same thing.  Flashing, disappearing and reappearing.   We have seen similar things twice before during this past July and August but I can&#39;t give accurate dates or time. That&#39;s why I wanted to report this sighting while its fresh in my memory.  After a few minutes the lights went south east and past our line of view behind the trees.  These were not known helicopters, airplanes, Chinese lanterns, laser lights or remote control toys.  The lights were high up, they looked like stars that change from white to pale blue. We had clear skies when we saw the lights, so I don&#39;t believe they were objects alter! ed by clouds or atmospheric gases etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more thing, we didn&#39;t hear anything either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for listening : )<n>

The sphere was red in color , translucent, with a bright orange fire like center.  The single object kept at a steady controlled speed about that of a plane at low altitude.  The object moved across the sky making no noise and had no other lights such as navigational lights.  The translucent outer sphere was that of a well defined ball of light.  It stayed on a controlled path from South to NNE direction before disappearing behind the treeline.  This object was witnessed by two individuals over our home this past winter.<n>

When looked at through binoculars, there appeared to be small white flashes of light intermittently around the object, some near to it and some farther away, possibly coming from the orb, but not certain.  This is the fourth time the object has been seen at this same time of night in the same place.

The room was darkened and this observation was made from both a screened window and a pane glass window facing the same direction. I saw what I believe was the planet Venus well above the horizon, but then was immediately startled to observe two very bright, slowly moving orange-colored objects in the sky at a higher level in the sky than the stationary planet.  They were about 5 times as bright as the planet and were separated by several degrees.  They moved at the same relatively slow rate toward me, then above me, eventually no longer visible as the top of my window obscured them.  Their intensity and rate of movement was steady.  I attempted to use my cell phone camera to capture a video, but the objects would ! not appear on my screen.  By the time I retrieved my better camera, the objects were no longer in my sight. I cannot imagine that others observed these objects also, as they were unusually bright and very &#34;orange&#34;.  It was very quiet this night, with no detectable breeze, and I heard absolutely no noises accompanying this sighting.<n>

One was following the other.  I did not see it, but I heard it.  Both were very loud and flew close to the ground (closer than most planes).  He adamantly described the objects as very different from any ordinary plane.  The first flying object had many different shapes on it.  He said it did not have a point on the front, but rather had several square shapes that were spread apart.  It had green and white lights.  My son thought it was a space station, until I explained that space stations fly in orbit above earth’s atmosphere. The second flying object was shaped like a triangle, but moving forward on the flat side (not like a stealth bomber).  It had green lights on one side, white lights on another side and blue lights on the third side.  He said it was much larger than any planes he had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I awoke and needed to go to the bathroom.  I got up and walked across the room and stopped at a sliding glass door to an upper deck and looked out.  The house is surrounded by trees, however looking straight West there is about a 15 degree brake in the trees where I could see the sky.  Looking into this brake about 20 degrees above the horizon I could see an orange fireball coming across the sky at a moderate speed from NW to SE.  This object was about as bright as the moon and probably 1/6th the size of the moon if the moon had been at the same location in the sky.  I proceeded out onto the deck for a better look.  I called for my wife, who was watching TV down stairs.   The object proceed in a straight line for about 60 seconds and then started a slow right turn which brought it’s path to pass behind some tree tops.  My wife and I could still see the object as it continued the turn u! ntil it seemed to be going to the West where after another 45 seconds it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to the bathroom and returned to the doorway after about four to five minutes.  I looked out and again saw the object.  I called my wife and walked back out on the deck again.  The object again was coming across the sky from the NW to the SE pretty much in the same position.  Moving at the same speed, and in the same direction.   As it neared again it started a right turn, however, this turn was a little wider and eventually was obscured by the trees.  I watched the sky for another 30 minutes and never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired professional pilot with a long career flying general aviation aircraft from crop dusters to corporate jets.  I still own and fly my own personal aircraft.  I am very used to observing all type of man made objects in the sky.  This is definitely not like any flying object I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Since it was remaining stationery, what caught my attention was the orange hew and how low it seemed to be, yet not close to where we were.  It was a singular light above the tree line across the street. I couldn&#39;t say what the distance was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eyes on it, my daughter came out and I asked her what it was, specifying what it couldn&#39;t possibly be due to it&#39;s nature.  During that time it  disappeared.  Being it was around the trees, I assumed I moved my sight in a way that a limb was obstructing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter and I walked out into the yard until we spotted it again.  It was a bit lower but of the same orange hew.  Although we never seen any actual movement of it, we would lose sight of it for a second only to find it in a lower position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on about 10 more minutes.  Since we had to keep adjusting our positions to gain sight of it again, we eventually zigzagged our way across the street to the neighbor&#39;s yard.  Had I first seen it at the level it was at this point, I wouldn&#39;t have noticed it because our security lights are of this same color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it reached to where it was eye level, it seemed more of a whiter light.  And at this level it seemed to be in the woods.  Then it was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did see an aircraft flying perpendicular to the object.  I decided to note this when I seen it in the options below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There wasn&#39;t anything glamorous about it.  It didn&#39;t flicker, flash, or dart around the sky. Just one round light that seemed to keep playing peek-a-boo with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did call our County&#39;s sheriff&#39;s office to ask if anyone reported or inquired of this light.  I explained to the dispatcher what we had just seen and she&#39;d not had any calls on it nor offered any accurate suggustions as to what it could be.  No report was filed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 36, married, mother of a 14 year old, and a housewife.  I&#39;m sure that what we seen is something I&#39;ve never seen before and couldn&#39;t relate it to any logical explanation. Unless someone can definitively tell me otherwise, I believe I seen a U.F.O.   I didn&#39;t get excited or anxious.  I just kept watching, waiting for some kind of behavior from it that I could just say, &#34;Oh, that&#39;s a...&#34;  That didn&#39;t happen so I called the sheriff&#39;s office.  It was an odd experience I never thought I would ever have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n>

I wondered if they were Military jets returning to Barns Air base in Westfield but there was no sound and the jets are unmistakable and easy to identify.   I called to my wife to come out and watch and as she did the third and fourth and fifth  lights appeared also traveling at a similar height and speed.  With in minutes all five lights traveled out of sight not ever making a sound, never changing direction and never appearing different then lights in the sky.

The sun was still up and bright, so I knew it was not a start.  I live near an airport, and I figured it was just a plane. As I kept driving, I noticed that it wasn&#39;t moving, flashing, or doing anything.  It also looked to be in a triangle shape, with the point down.  It appeared to be a long distance up in the sky, so it is hard to tell.  I snapped a picture on my phone just to see if I could enhance it, and it&#39;s just a little dot.  After arriving home, it was still in the sky, so I grabbed my camera and took a picture.  I was able to zoom in enough to see that it was, in fact, a triangle.  It had not moved since I first saw it, and did not move while I was writing up most of this report.  The sun set, and the light started to fade, almost as if it were reflecting an object, not emitting light.  It eventually completely disappeared into the dark sky.  It was at roughly 20º into the sky directly North, almost where the star Polaris would be.  (I figured that a star would get brighter, not darker as the sun set.)<n>

Upon observation through binoculars it appeared more diamond shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was traveling along a freeway on 09/02/13 at approximately 18:35 p.m. I saw a unusually bright light in the north sky from Mesa, Arizona.  I made mention of it to my wife who also noticed it&#39;s unusual luminiosity.  Since I have been a night shift worker for 21 years I am used to looking up in the night sky and noticing anything that seems out of place.  As we drove along I notices that the object was above the clouds, since as we traveled some high clouds would come in between the object and us.  I thought this unusual since balloons up that high would hardly be visual.  Since that area in the sky is in the normal route of commercial aircraft arriving to land at Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix, AZ, I thought it unusual that this object was much higher than the descending aircraft who were approaching to land (and below the cloud level).  When we reached our destination in Mesa, AZ at 18:55 we immediately requested some binoculars from the home of my my father! -in-law to observe it more closely.  He complied.  When I looked at it in the binoculars the object seems to have a diamond shape.  It appeared to have lighting from within itself. The object did not appear to be moving at all, just hovering.  I, my wife and several members of her family observed it through the binoculars for several minutes. One member of the family thought it was a hot air balloon due to it&#39;s shape, but observing it myself I could not detect any flickering from the typical flame that normally occurs in the ascent and descent of a hot air balloon.  I observed a flight of an airplane that passed by but I have no reliable experience as to whether it was close at all (the same altitude, etc) to the observed object.  I did notice people in other cars at stop lights observing the same thing from their cars, it was that noticeable.....<n>

Naturally, being close to Seattle-Tacoma airport, many planes flew overhead.  But, the UFO was up way, way, way higher. It was so high that it was almost imperceptible.  From the lake, it looked asterisk-shaped.  It covered distance a lot faster than the others, crossing almost all visible sky in just a couple minutes.  It came mostly from the East.  It did not fly exactly straight, but kind of zigged and zagged.  It looked white.  It flew over the lake and suddenly stopped to change directions. From where I stood, it didn&#39;t look like it turned around, but that it just started flying pretty much backwards where it came from.  The reversal was not a complete 180 degrees, but pretty close.  Zigging and zagging a little.  I believe someone with an involuntary, lifelong Air Force radio implant was at the lake.  I believe when the craft located the source of the radio, it left the area.<n>

I made still frames at various points in the video as explained below, and will release the video at the proper time.  The single object appears to be cylinder shaped, but also looks to be tumbling/or shape changing, but I think tumbling.  When looking at the stills and video, it must be remembered that it was shot at 32X slower than normal.  Due to the high frame rate, it will appear to be going at normal speed.  I refer to it as a “perceptual” speed, that is what the mind perceives it when viewing. Very important to remember that the video is 32 times SLOWER than normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is the small brown dot/cylinder in the sky moving through the lightning event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other aircraft were visible during storm. It was a strong lightning storm, and aircraft avoid those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are trees in the lower foreground. Due to High speed capture, they move 32 slower than normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll give you a little info on the stills. They are numbered by frame.. The 1st frame is 11:02 (11 sec, 2 frames).. In the video it drops from the top of screen and makes a turn into the lightning, passes THRU lightning, (12:21 is inside plasma, you can see the faint dot) and exits to the left (17:09)  These photos you are getting are compressed for web transfer. The originals and video are better quality and more clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video was shot in 960 frames a second, slow motion. Normal Video speed is 30 frames a second. I was shooting a lightning storm facing due north to see what lightning looked like in super slow motion. The Lightning event I captured took ½ second to happen. When the camera shot it, it captured at 960 frames a second, there by, the playback of the lightning is 16 seconds. When I played back the video, I saw the object. The object appears at the top of the screen dropping down and making a curve turn of approx. 85 degrees and heads to the west. I was shooting the video over the top of some trees, at about a 45-degree angle, to at least a mile in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object takes 7 seconds to travel across the screen. If the video was in real time (perceptual speed) it would be going as fast or faster than a jumbo jet (380-600 mph) and is a mile away (due to the 5 second delay of thunder 1000 ft. sec x 5 = 1mile approx.). If perceptual speed is @ 500 mph, then real time is 16,000 mph. The camera shoots at 960 frames = 32 x slower. If the object was only 100 mph perceptual, then it would be 3200 mph. I observe passenger jets daily (airport close by) and they travel slower then this object if the object was traveling the same perceptual. (if I didn&#39;t shoot in slow mo. and the object moved the same in vid as if you were standing and observing)  The lightning event occurred in 1/2 sec real time, slowed down to 32 times slower, 16 seconds to play out the entire lightning event. the object takes @ 7 seconds to travel screen. That means the object traveled the distance in .223 of a second. That is fast. You would never ever see this with your naked eye. I have not calculated the distance traveled by the object yet, and am working on that.<n>

On Monday, 09/02/2013 between 2:30 and 2:45 AM as I took an exit off Greenbelt, Rd to merge onto Baltimore Washington Parkway traveling south towards Washington DC., I noticed two cars pulled on the shoulder with their hazard lights on.  Then as soon as I fully merged onto the parkway, myself and passengers in five or so other vehicles witnessed two very low flying, triangular shaped craft move somewhat slowly along the Parkway and in complete silence.  Both craft looked exactly alike, triangular in shape with three white lights, one on each angle, one red light in the middle and two small green lights towards the back.  The craft was coming toward me as I traveled south on Baltimore Washington Parkway, then turned right running parallel to Interstate 495.  It was foggy that night and we eventually lost sight of the two craft. I was only able to see the two green lights once they turned revealing the back,  underside of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right before the event, I noticed many police vehicles on Greenbelt Road with cars pulled over as well as two cars pulled on the shoulder of Baltimore Washington Parkway with their hazard lights on apparently also witnessing the two craft.  I have never seen anything like what I saw that night and will never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 100% positive whatever I saw was not constructed by man.  I found this sight trying to see if anyone else posted anything from that night as I am sure other people witnessed the aircraft as well.<n>

The area we were in was a country land with a lot of corn fields, trees and open fields around.  We were sitting talking and then one of my friends noticed an object in the sky.  At first it seemed as though it was a helicopter, although it had a huge light attached to the front of the aircraft.  As the object came closer to us it did not look like a helicopter anymore, we noticed the object was flat and as it passed over us we saw it was a flat triangle shape.  By the way, the object was very close to the ground.  We saw one big light on the front of the craft and other white and red lights flashing on it.  As it started moving away from us it went over a tree line and looked like it just went down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This excited our group so we decided to go looking for it because it seemed like it went down in a corn field, as we were driving on back roads we saw a bright light coming from the corn field, there wasn&#39;t any houses at the spot we spotted the light, although it was too deep into the corn field so we couldn&#39;t investigate any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one that was at the bonfire tonight knew what we had just saw. It was too low for and airplane, and too flat to be a helicopter.  We have no explanation as to what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this report helps, thanks for your time<n>

It silently floated along a straight line and continued passing overhead. We watched in awe until it was out of sight.  About 20 minutes later, another approached and did the same, floating in a straight line, making no noise.  Two more appeared in the same way, with the same spacing.  They would appear and slowly float silently above.  Definitely not an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We notified the police as well as the local airport who stated that no reports were made; we checked shortly after it happened and the next morning and received the same answer: no one else reported such sightings.  We took a picture and a video of the orange orbs.  My husband noted that he saw some sort of a triangular shape inside the orbs.<n>

I had just passed tractor supply when I noticed traffic was slowing down.  I looked around to see why, ie &#34;Was there an accident?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1/2 mile up the road in the air above the field between the Captains Galley Seafood Restaraunt and an abandoned old run down building, there was something in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My windows were rolled down and I heard NO noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had taken my dog for a ride to the local fast food for a treat.  My windows were rolled down and he was crying anticipating good, however when we got to the Fort Dobbs hardware store (which is where traffic started slowing down), he immediately became completely and totally silent.  There was just silence everywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the air were two giant gold balls with seemed to emit a very strong glow.  That was all I could see.  The balls were hovering about 30 feet in the air over the field.  The balls floated in the air in that exact position for ar! ound four minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The balls then started to spin around in a circular pattern starting slow but rapidly becoming faster until they became a blur.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then disappeared across the night sky traveling NE in a streaking, golden blur.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I KNOW I am not the only one who saw this.  I am positive it wasn&#39;t because of any tower or anything like that.  I even stuck my head out of my drivers side window to make sure what I was seeing was actually real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listed it as only one witness because of myself, but there were in fact at least 10 other people who saw this craft as traffic essentially came to a standstill.<n>

We first saw it coming from behind the trees, so it was flying relatively low and at a moderate speed.  The color was orange and then the color changed to yellow then white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was changing colors the fireball seemed to get smaller and smaller until it just dissappeared.  We had not had a chance to catch our breathe yet when another made an appearance.  Same exact thing. Exactly the same.  It came from the same direction, same speed, color and dissappeared just the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a moment after the second a third came and this is when the neighbors heard us outside and joined in the observance of the sky.  I placed the call the UFO hotline at this point.  We thought that was it but no more than a few seconds after i got off the phone the fourth came and we were able to video tape it and we had other witnesses for the fourth.  These things had no sound and once we could see them the entire duration was maybe 20-30 seconds each.  I&#39;ve seen many strange things in the sky before but this one was extraordinary.<n>

I returned and heard her saying &#34;What is that!!&#34; over and over.  I looked east and saw in the sky a very large amount of orange/red globes hovering in the sky.  Some were closer and others were father away, in at least 3 layers back into the night sky. The close ones seemed to be usually close, and there were so many of them, that I considered that we were under attack, but they weren&#39;t moving quickly.  They were basically not moving, or moving very slowly.  I went into the house to get my camera.  When I got back my mom explained that most of them had left.  3 remained which were in a diagonal line rather than the triangle formation that I noticed earlier.  One vanished and another seemed to rise from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It wasn&#39;t small like a plane light high in the sky, this orange orb looked big and low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped at the Gardener Lake Dam and actually got out to look at it, there was no noise coming at all from it. It was slowly heading north towards Acorn Acres campground.  I tried to take a picture but with the humidity and clouds in the air it slowly dimmed out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was moving faster I would have thought it was an actual fireball or comet, but it was moving very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was hard to tell how far away it was but it was low enough that we had to stop and back up to get a good look at it because houses and trees were blocking our view.  After telling our son about the incident he said the craft may have been hovering over the Pickering nuclear station.  He listens to coast to coast and says the experts on that show say these crafts are sometimes attracted to these places. After watching it for about one minute each light on the craft faded one at a time starting with the front point.  After that we could not see the craft anymore.

At that height, we should have heard some kind of engine noise leading or trailing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither craft had the usual red and green blinking light or bright white strobe that you see with typical aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the crafts moved overhead, we went around to the back deck and by that time, the crafts had accelerated almost as if they knew we were observing them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reddish orange light caused me to remember a similar craft that my daughter had observed back in 2004 in October.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very unusual, I wonder if the reddish orange light was some sort of thermal imaging or night vision equipment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It might put one in mind of a dark room developing lamp or maybe some type of mylar photo correction film.

They appeared one at a time and had a few minutes between each.  They were silent and did not flicker, the light stayed constant bright orange and the light appeared to be coming from one light source, not from multiple lights on the object.  They moved fast and appeared to be low in the sky but well above the treetops.  It was not like anything I have ever seen flying and no, it was not fireworks, hot air balloon, helicopter, ultra-light, or other know aircraft. The lights flew across the sky on a straight trajectory and stayed at a constant elevation.  No strobe light or headlights or any marking such as would be seen on an aircraft,  No smoke trail or burn like a firework no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We checked out of the store at 9:14 pm and proceeded to turn right on Rt. 20 and left on Clark Street at almost Verlin Street I (the driver) noticed a large orange / yellow ball of light in the sky off to the right and called my mother&#39;s attention to the light. I thought it may be part of a firework display.  However, I realized quickly that it was not going up.  The light traveled from right to left across the sky for a while.  I noticed it was giving off enough light to light up the tops of the trees.  After it moved from right to left it hovered for a while and then went up slowly and dimmed then it brightened and moved down once again.  Finally, the ball of light went directly up very high in the sky before it dimmed or it went up so high the light was no longer visible.  The movement was slow at first then very accelerated.  The ! light was orange / yellow.  Also we stopped the car and noticed it did not make a sound.  We feel it was not a helicopter or a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first rocket fire was seen at 9:15 pm. EDT.  The next rocket fire appeared 10 minutes later in the sky at the same position as the first one appeared.  There were a total of 4 rockets seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each rocket followed the same trajectory and at one point, two rockets could be seen, one overhead and one in the distance.  There may have been more than four rockets.  The witnesses only saw four.  The sightings were made from Provincetown, Massachusetts on Cape Cod.  All four witnesses were sober.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rockets themselves could not be seen.   What was visible to naked eye was a fire ball similar to ones seen from rockets launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in the 1970s and 1980s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses considered the possibility of the phenomena being airplanes.  They dismissed this possibility, as the fire was very bright and burned steady as the rockets ascended.  There were no standard flashing lights as seen on most private and commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have scanned the news sights for other sightings.  None have been found at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses talked with other areas residents, most had seen nothing, Two said they spotted at least on rocket crossing the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are curious about this.  The witnesses did not think these were extraterrestrial craft, and thought most likely a military exercise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you witnessed this, we are curious to know your observations.<n>

It looked like something on fire very high up in the air.  It looked to be about the height of a helicopter but there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There a a lot of trees in the neighborhood and it went behind some heading east and gaining altitude. We went to the front yard where the object seemed to be much higher at this point and had turned heading northeast.  My uncle said it seemed to be changing course as it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was not a trail behind it like you would expect if it was on fire and moving as quickly as it was.  The intensity of the orange/fire would change as well and when it started heading northeast it looked more like a light than a fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Columbus is very close to a major airport and we get planes all the time, there were planes much higher so we could compare the lights and sound and there was no sound coming off this object.

We both watched as it just hovered, neither making sound nor moving.  Then slowly it began to glide north.  It looked like an orange ball of fire with some green in it.  It flickered like fire, then seemed to fizzle out much like the flame does on a candle wick.  It reappeared once or twice before completely disappearing.  From the time we first went outside and saw this thing to the time it disappeared was less than 5 minutes.  We then proceeded to drive to the duckpond, but as we were in route the orb reappeared, it flickered then shot up in the sky and disappeared. Once we arrived at the duckpond  (a 5 minute drive) the orb reappeared and this time a second one accompanied it.  One seemed slightly larger than the other, but both looked like balls of fire in the sky.  Their ! distance from each other never changed, but their altitudes did, gliding smoothly and silently, one higher than the other, both moving at what looked like the same slow speed.  Both orbs intermittently disappeared and reappeared, but finally the bottom orb never reappeared, leaving the orb with the higher altitude, the original larger orb, to glide silently across the sky for miles until it fizzled out and disappeared.  Our entire experience lasted approximately 30 minutes.  Our neighbor’s son also saw it and he described the ball as being a red ball of fire.  I tried to take video of the phenomenon but could not get video to work until orbs disappeared.  I was able to get 3 pictures of poor quality.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately a year ago my daughter and I saw what looked like the same ball of fire in the same part of the sky.  We just got home from the grocery store and stared at it as it first hovered, then slowly glided north and dimmed until its light went out.<n>

Calling my wife and pointing to her saying it is the same ligh i saw in June of this year,  me calling it a UFO, my wife contradicts it by saying that it is a helicopter.  told her to listen hard if she could hear a sound and there was no sound she said.  reminded her of the last time i saw it and showed her.  she left and went back in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> calling her back out to the porch again,  told her to look up and told her that the UFO has moved.  i went down the road to follow the UFO and told her to get the camera and bring it to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i took two pics of the object which i call UFO.  my wife&#39;s reaction was complete surprise when she saw it hovering again over our friends house by the trees.  we stayed a little longer watching then went home.  coz it just disappeared quickly before our eyes..<n> <n><n> <n><n> that night was a moonless and not much stars on the sky and the neighbors dogs were barking.<n>

It was a Lil after 8.  As i turned on the Hwy I can see this bright object in the sky.  At first I thought, maybe it could a star, since the sun was beginning to go down it was not unusual to see the stars at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as I continued to watch this object, I realized it was way to bright and sitting way too low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About that time my wife yelled at me to pay attention to the road and wanted to know what the hell I was staring at.  I pointed up to the bright object.  She immediately said, &#34;it&#39;s a plane, pay attention to the road.&#34;  As she continued to look at the object she said that maybe it was a star.  As I started to tell her that it was too low in the sky to be a star, she screamed out, &#34;Two separate lights fell out of it, two lights just came out of it and are circling around it!&#34;  I stole another glance at it just as the two other light sources sped away from the first object.  One of the smaller objects passed over head. It seemed to reach us in no time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights flashed differently than a normal plane, blinked a lot faster and looked like chasing lights around it almost glittery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As quickly as it passed overhead, it was gone and now, so was the first object we seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t wait to get home to tell my son(since he is skeptical bout things like this).  For the next few days, I caught myself looking for that object again.  I did see it again about a week later. I was at home and it was about 9 at night. I went inside and told my son. We both sat outside and watched.  As we watched, we observed several objects in the sky.  Some could be accounted for regular airplanes but others were different.  We can hear the airplanes as they passed overhead, but the other objects(some looking like planes but light colors were orange and green) we could not hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed watching for awhile, then we seen one that was lower and much bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside got my binoculars.  When i looked up through my binoculars, I clearly saw three lights in the shape of a triangle.  I could also see from the lights glowing off the bottom of it, that it was dark in color and smoothed.  I showed my son and as we watched, there was a huge ball of orange light that engulfed the front of the triangle.  The ball of light came on like an explosion at first(like not there on second then the entire front of triangle was surrounded with this light).  When the light faded out, it was no longer a triangle shape.  It now had the appearance of a regular airplane.  The lights moved and started flashing(although they were orange light), it now had wings.  It actually looked like an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I watched it as it passed overhead without it making any sounds.  Both of us didn&#39;t know what to make of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not saying what i saw was a ship from another world, but I do know, that whatever it was that we saw, was something neither one of us have ever seen before outside of sci-fi movies.<n>

P.D.T.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location of Sighting: 15 miles north of Santa Barbara, Ca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> LATITUDE: 34.46226N  LONGITUDE: 120.02726W El Capitan State Beach Tonight at approximately 20:40, I witnessed a large triangular shaped vehicle with approximately 7 bright but muted or blurred lights* traveling at a slow speed headed due East towards Santa Barbara California. Craft made no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vehicle caught my eye initially because of the color of the lights.* The vehicles altitude is hard to judge because it was dark but if I had to guess I would say approximately 1500 to 2000 feet. If, that guess is correct that would make the size of the craft maybe three times the size of a Boeing 747.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was witnessed by myself and I was accompanied by wife and there were approximately 15 guest of the park who witnessed the craft at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I brought the vehicle to the attention of the group and asked if they were in fact seeing what I was witnessing?  All answered in the affirmative.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vehicle was moving so slowly we all got a good look at its speed, then it appeared to come to a complete stop, but only momentarily.  Then the vehicle began to move in a forward direction but also appeared to be headed in a vertical direction.  We continued to monitor the vehicle its movement was vertical and slowly east. It then began to appear to gain momentum but suddenly it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, I thought it may have been an aircraft of some sort because we are on the approach to the Santa Barbara Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also thought that it may have been an aircraft from Vandenburg Air Force Base, which is just to the north of the park approximately 30 miles.  Although it is my understanding that no flight wing exists at VFB, I have witnessed missile launches from that base, both daytime and night launches, none of those launches were anything even remotely like the vehicle we witnessed tonight.  No craft I have ever seen have the ability to accelerate so quickly that they disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having witnessed hundreds of commercial as well as private and military aircraft I knew this was not any of those aircraft at least of the type I had ever witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must mention that during my career I spent 6 years working in the Mojave, California area, where my office was on the perimeter of the Mojave Air and Space Port as well as our neighbors to the southeast Edwards Air Force Base. I have witnessed thousands of aircraft flying in and out of both of these facilities as well as China Lake Naval Weapons Station which aircraft are in the air almost constantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vehicle that was flying over the Park this evening was like nothing I or any of the other witnessed that I discussed the sighting with tonight had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then traveled to the other side of the park and spoke to another guest who was a retired firefighter and his wife, they too saw the vehicle and were unable to explain the vehicle in any other terms than, &#34;We saw a UFO this evening&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The behavior of this vehicle is like nothing commercial, private or military I have ever witnessed. *Nor was the lighting, the color of the lights were something between yellow and orange and very bright.  Those are not colors normally associated with any aircraft I have ever witnessed.  The vehicle had no strobe or marker lights whatsoever.<n>

What struck us was the yellow flame like color and completely silent sound.  There was no engine noise, it was almost like a flare but it had a very clear pathway across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

9/1/13 20:00|Rowley|MA|Disk|15 minutes|Multiple UFO craft and direct encounter with Orb dispatched from larger ship.|4/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108195.html|779|ndxe201309| Multiple UFO craft and direct encounter with Orb dispatched from larger ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last Sunday night (9/1/13) - I stepped on to the back porch around 8:pm to get a breather, fresh air. Sitting there enjoying my peace, two glaring lights lit up the clouds and I thought - wow - a 747 coming in to land a Logan International Boston.  (Note: I reside in the rural country side of Rowley, MA)  However, the lights got brighter making random motions in the sky and were much too large to be any sort of aircraft (well a thought for the moment) but, within seconds, the entire fields in back of my apartment were lit up as though spotlights had blasted on.  Also, two huge objects appeared in the sky equal distance apart and stationary.  Just kind of stayed there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being a former military pilot, I know aircraft and I also know how the eyes can play tricks on anyone watching planes at night, helicopters, flares etc.  But, these two objects eventually came to a stand-still , were huge - and stayed in place - not moving - lighting up the entire area – appearing as mother ships.  (My best description for the moment) My first thought - if these are 747&#39;s - their on a parallel &#34;approach course&#34; to Logan and not good.  Next, if they were landing lights on (2) 747&#39;s they do not rotate and flicker - they&#39;re constant.  To, rarely do commercial aircraft enter a flight pattern over Rowley as directed by &#34;air control&#34; maintaining a certain altitude and omni/IFR heading guiding them to the airport. Last, generally the altitude is such that they’re not too low should an emergency occur for evasive landing or what we call &#34;go around&#34;.Yet, there sat these huge objects with rotating lights underneath lighting up the entire sky with a bright white. Making matters more interesting - the entire back porch was lit up as though I was under a spotlight - focused on me.  It was the weirdest thing to have happen however, I concluded these are real UFO&#39;s Not to sound foolish but, I ran in to the apartment and grabbed my camera and camcorder and tried to get as many photos as I could.  The camcorder played tricks and worse yet, the two huge objects remained stationary – motionless – no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two ships stayed in position - bright lights flickering. One more object appeared (small organge Orb) and scanned the fields behind.  At the same time, one of the larger ships moved across the Plantation complex lighting the area then returning to its original position massively dwarfing the house directly across the street from the senior residences. (The ship – estimated to be about the size of the complex in its entirety).  It remained motionless without sound - lighting the entire area while the other (ship) remained in it’s original position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the back porch, one of the ships climbed approx. 1000&#39; over the house across the street, which gave me some sort of dimension.  Next, the ship shot to the sky in a split second whereas a bright orange orb dropped from the larger ship’s exit moving over the houses, spot lighting the fields, in such a erratic pattern that I was trying to keep the camcorder on it.  Then, the bright orange orb dispersed about 10-12 smaller orbs which within 2-4 seconds had made a complete sweep of the area.  Then all shot up rejoining the larger orange orb which remained in position..  The sky lit up a bright white, the larger orb remained behind and began to move closer to my direction on the back porch.  There, it remained motionless within perhaps 20 yards of me and emitted kind of a dull, hazy white beam on my position on the porch.  Meanwhile, a car approached on the adjoining road in which the orb backed off and began to chase the passing vehicle – returned and assumed it’s original positi! on in front of me.  The orb itself often changed size but in addition, scanned the lower portion of the apartments below (I living on the second floor) emitting a bright white light which was almost blinding then, backed off slightly raising its position and now it became a “classic face off”.  Thereafter, the orb (rather large now) moved across the street and shot directly upwards in incredible speed.  I’d estimate a split second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fortunately - I have it on video.  The camcorder picked up the huge orange orb hovering over the houses, fields etc. - at almost road level.  At the same instant, the 2nd ship which had remained motionless during the duration followed a similar maneuver – shooting straight up into the sky/clouds (being a slight overcast) which allowed me to observe a distinct “hole” formed in the clouds, the clouds “rolling” – as boiling – where the ship had departed.  The large orb followed – exiting the same path of the large ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this is a bit strange but, seeing these objects was amazing and profound.  We hear of UFO&#39;s and there&#39;s much debate as to they&#39;re existence and being a computer guy and engineer - well – I had my doubts about much however, this is the first time that I saw something up hand which was more than incredible. You might see one I suppose and not knowing what it is - well - it becomes a UFO however - when the whole &#34;freaking&#34; family shows up - you have to wonder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are too many scientists, people of knowledge that have presented evidence but, then again you say - we haven’t caught one yet??  To that they say - yes we have.  Where do you go with it and is there substance?  From what I saw - I&#39;m a believer now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video: http://unexplained.co/videos/ufo-videos/bright-unknown-orb-filmed-over-rowley-massachusetts-1st-sep-2013/2299/<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will admit that thereafter, I did suffer some rather disturbing “physical effects” from the encounter of which can be testified for.  As mentioned, the orange orb and myself had somewhat of a standoff – it being within perhaps 20-25 yards of me (as I sat on the back porch) – it scanning me with a faint white light from hip to face and remained motionless as I. (This is prior to it’s departure).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally, there is much more to the story about my physical condition thereafter – most notably, my lips, gums, mouth had been burned inside my mouth.  Feeling extremely nauseous for the next 3 days and faint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
9/1/13 20:00|Vernon (Canada)|BC||several hours|Night object with flashing red and green lights over Vernon, B.C. Canada.   ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star, we suspect.  PD))|9/9/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101843.html|780|ndxe201309| Night object with flashing red and green lights over Vernon, B.C. Canada<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the same phenomenon that was reported on August 10 by someone else in Vernon.  Last night, around 10:00PM, I was outside letting my dogs out for their usual business.  As someone interested in astronomy as a hobby, I was looking up in the clear sky admiring the stars, particularly the Big Dipper.  I looked towards the horizon and saw what I first thought was an oncoming aircraft.  I assumed it was an aircraft as there was the typical bright light and the blinking red and green lights on either side.  However, after viewing for a few minutes, I noticed that the object didn&#39;t move but appeared stationary and was &#39;setting&#39; with the rest of the stars.  I grabbed my 4&#34; telescope but wasn&#39;t able to make out too much except that the lights appeared to separate at times from the main body.  This could have been due to the atmospheric conditions.  The next evening (tonight) my brother was over for a visit and both he and my wife witnessed the same object,! moving in the same path as last night and still have the red and green blinking lights. When viewing through the telescope, by brother noted that it appears there were flames ejecting at times from the object and surrounded the colored lights.  I wasn&#39;t able to see the same as my eyesight is not as good at night.  However, I mentioned to him that he may be seeing the reflection of the sun off a tumbling object.  I&#39;m very skeptical about UFO&#39;s, but for me, this is an unidentified space object, only because I can&#39;t find any logical explanation of this object.  Does anyone have any suggestions?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star, we suspect.  PD))<n>

9/1/13 19:19|Grenada|MS|Light|10 minutes|"Star-like" light keeps appearing a disappearing at sunset.  ((|9/9/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101837.html|782|ndxe201309| &amp;quot;Star-like&amp;quot; light keeps appearing a disappearing at sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my girlfriend keep seeing lights in the sky around the same time of day.  Her cousin was with us one time before and saw the lights too, so he believes us now.  Nobody I tell will believe me.  They all think I&#39;m seeing things, but how could we all be &#34;thinking&#34; we see the same thing?  Our latest sighting of the light was September 1, 2013 at 7:19 (19:19).  The sunset on that day was said to occur at 7:27, so the sun was still up pretty good. The sky was still very well lit and blue, so no stars were out yet. If any stars were out, they would&#39;ve been in the eastern sky since the sun was setting in the west.  We were driving into Grenada on highway 8 west when I was looking at the sunset and I noticed what appeared to be a star up above the sunset in the middle of the bright blue sky.  This is exactly how it looked the first time I saw it, so I instantly knew what it was.  I quickly tell my girlfriend to record a video with her phone and point out to her where it is.  As I&#39;m pointing, the light does what it has done every other time we&#39;ve seen it.  The best way I can explain what happens is imagine a normal looking star, just in the middle if the day.  As we are looking at the light, it fades out of sight.  Then, about 10 seconds later, it comes back into view!   About 30 seconds after that, it fades out again and this time it stayed gone. We kept looking and didn&#39;t see it again until about 5 minutes later when we were in Grenada still looking for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have seen this &#34;light&#34; about 3 different times now and nobody will believe us.  After we see it every time, I feel like I need to tell somebody about it. I don&#39;t care how crazy people think we are or if people think we are making it up, I know what I saw, I know other people with me have seen it, and there is something going on above Grenada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, to denounce any skeptical ideas anyone may have. I promise I&#39;ve heard plenty. It wasn&#39;t a flashing light from a cellphone tower or any other tower.  This light wasn&#39;t &#34;hovering&#34; above the ground. It was in the sky.  I&#39;m talking miles in the sky.  Higher than a plane. If you can find a tower 5 miles high, show me.  It wasn&#39;t a plane light flashing. It was still daylight outside so I wouldn&#39;t have seen the lights that easily. I have considered it being the sunlight reflecting off a plane or jet, but it&#39;s still just way too high for any of our aircraft. It looks exactly like a star, it just fades in and out randomly. Not on a set amount of time or anything. It could be visible for 5 minutes and then fade out or it could be there for 10 seconds and then fade out. It&#39;s random. I just think its very strange to keep seeing this thing and nobody else notices. I want to know what it is.<n>

I took over 330 photos this evening.  When I took the memory card out of the camera, and was going through the photos, I found 2 photos that recorded an object going across a clearing in the sky. the object came from behind the clouds and went back in behind the clouds in a straight line, but at a Very rapid rate.  I was taking photos in Burst mode, which for my camera is 10 frames per second on idea conditions.  I have 4 photos. One photo before the object time stamped at 6:50:58 pm, next frame with the object timestamped at 6:50:58 pm, next frame with the object time stamped at 6:50:59 pm, and next frame without the object time stamped at 6:50:59 pm.  The object in the photos looks like it is bow tie shape.  The lens I&#39;m using was an 18-55mm F3.5-5.6 SAM. ISO 1600, Lens setting was 18mm, F3.5, shutter speed 1/40th of a second.<n>

I don&#39;t think any of them noticed the one that I snapped pics of, as they were already in trucks leaving the site. I will ask them when I get a chance.<n>

The camera is fixed onto the end of an apparatus which extends outside my window upstairs.  The USB wire is fed into my PC where I view the monitor inside my house.  My monitor was turned off.  So, when I turned the monitor on, right there smack dab in the center of the monitor is this hovering Unidentified phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared for a few seconds in major disbelief as it wobbles slowly heading outside the cameras range of view.  Since this object was moving so slow, I had the grand opportunity to press record AND also to look out my open window to the direction and exact location of this hovering object.  My bare eyes could not locate this object, I was able to see only the birds which fly by CLEARLY on the video.  The object was only visible to my camera, I know this for a fact because of my opportunity to see outside with my own eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I tried to follow the slow moving object, my pull string technology camera controls busted as I pulled too hard I guess.

Looking at the city lights right after sunset We noticed the lights out at Kennecott Copper mine  were really bright much brighter than usual .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We grabbed our binoculars and noticed the big lights moving, pulsating. Blinking on and off at different times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are lights out there all the time. I look at the mine, through binoculars everyday and night. There are roads at the mine and there are lights that line the road and at specific spots where they are digging.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The big light, that we have seen for 3 weeks, appeared  at the top of the mountain right above the mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was there for 5 minutes. The smaller lights at the mine , became really active. Small red and green lights appeared and swirled around.  They were definitely on the part of the mountain where there are no roads, no access.  The smaller lights moved back and forth, up and down.  The larger lights moved into a shape that made it almost look like a massive ship , so strange  20 minutes into this, the big light appeared again.  This time right in front of us.( the place it has usually  been )  It hovered, pulsated, dimmed, grew bight and after 8 minutes, it moved straight across the sky and was gone.<n>

Lasted about 2 seconds.  Further down the road, there were two subtle flashes of light, but on the other side of the road the initial light was on, and closer to the earth than the first bright light.<n>
9/1/13 03:00|Toronto (Canada)|ON|Light|04:00|Bright White Light over eastern Toronto.|9/9/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101802.html|788|ndxe201309| Bright White Light over eastern Toronto.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my dog to the park near my home early in the morning after I got off work in the very eastern part of Toronto.  The park is heavily forested where it is easy to the see the stars away from all the lights in the city.  At around 3:00 AM I noticed a bright white light that slowly but surely rose up from beyond the horizon looking East.  At first I thought it was a star but after looking at it carefully I noticed it moved higher in altitude but then it stopped.  The light was brighter than any other star in the sky, but to the average person it can easily be mistaken for a star.  I had a flashlight so I flashed it on and off 3 times toward the light in the sky.  I noticed it start moving a little while after I shun the flashlight.  This time I noticed it started moving toward me but still at a very slow pace, then it stopped again just hovering up there.  It had to be a few thousand feet up in the air and about 10-20 Km in distance from where I was.  It had no blinking lights, it also didn&#39;t make a sound.  It was not a plane, helicopter, star, comet, or satellite (I used my Sat App on my phone to check), it could have been drone for all I know but the fact is it was some sort of an unidentified flying object.  The light slowly eventually hovered so far high up I lost sight of it, plus there was a little cloud cover.  After going through my records I realized that this exact same light appeared in the sky last year around the exact same time of the year. I captured it on film roughly in the same location, altitude, and time, it appeared 8 out of 11 nights, the last sighting being on September 2nd, 2012.  I haven&#39;t seen it since until now almost a year later to the day.  It also always appears from beyond the horizon around 3-4 AM and it almost always slowly hovers its way up so high that you just lose sight of it.  I will go out tonight to see if I see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

I did actually stood up cause it was moving and There was a house blocking the bedroom Window.  The light formed like a streak.  It seemed like it was going up and down.  I saw the light for like 10 min until I cant really see it cause the house totally block the view from my window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It then started back upwards the went straight ahead and never headed back in a downward motion.  I would not say I believe in UFO&#39;s but I know what I saw was unlike anything I have EVER seen.<n>

The Object was a greenish blue light that was leaving a almost white trail behind it.  The light gave me the impression the object was spinning as it moved through the night sky.  My first thought was “Oh look a shooting star”, but I quickly detained that idea because of the flight the object was on and the color it radiated.  I would say the disc object was no more than 500ft in the air.  Also at the time I saw the object I got a great look at it because of the heat lightning that was occurring during my entire drive.  This is why I was glaring up at the sky on this night because of the beautiful lighting.  The lighting gave me a clear look at this object and all I can say is it was nothing I have ever seen before in my life.<n>

It was the only “aircraft” I had seen the entire day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this date, the weather was a totally clear sky, with no wind whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was what was lacking that made this unusual...  I saw NO wings or tail, just a silver  cigar shape, pointed on both ends.  There was NO jet con-trail, NOR any jet noise whatsoever, as there always is following any other jet, no matter how high.<n>
