Appeared to be nearly (not quite) same relative size as the full moon appears directly overhead.  Object was above scattered clouds at 6700feet &amp; passed behind them, disappearing momentarily behind the more dense clouds.  Appeared over Alaska Range to Northwest traversed night sky and disappeared over Chugach Mountains to Southeast in two to four seconds.  Land distance from mountain range to mountain range approximately 150 miles.  Alaska range 10,000ft + Chugach Range 5000ft +.  I do not believe object was within earth&#39;s atmosphere.  No sound.  No sparks.  No vapor trail.  Object appeared to glow like the flash from an arc welder electrode seen at a distance, but may have been reflection of sun on BRIGHT silver metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Object was moving to the east, generally, so it probably was not a meteor.  PD))<n>
8/28/72 23:15|Bixby South|OK|Circle|app 1 hour|This is my U.F.O. Story This happen to me when I was sixteen years old. I&#8217;m now 44. That was 28 years ago, In the Summer of 1972,|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14480.html|2|ndxe197208| This is my U.F.O. Story This happen to me when I was sixteen years old. I&#39;m now 44. That was 28 years ago, In the Summer of 1972, in the Month Of August on the 28 day.  I have only been driving for 3 month, I loved to go to my Brother House, It was so much different then my house at mom and dads. so that Day I went to spent the day and night with my brother and his wife and kids. To make you understand I was a mid life Baby, My Brother had kids older then I. My neice was 2 years older then I. so I enjoyed the friendship I had with my neice and nephew , they was close to my age. At around 10:30pm we went to bed, there was only one bed in the kids bedroom so we had to lay across the bed to fit, We had two very large windows went the length of the bed and they where very tall windows, this was very old farm house, and just up the road was a very large hill, it was called Coon Anderson Hill. While we where laying in bed we could not sleep it was August and very hot and no air con, we had the windows open and was looking out the windows at the very bright stars, it was in the country and no street light made it very easy to see the stars. time was now getting to be about 11:15pm. and I noticed a very small light in the sky, bluish in color, kind a like the stars where. I thought it was maybe a light from a slow moving plane it was going from the southeast to northwest. I look over to my neice and said do you see that Light over there up in the Sky, She said no, So I pointed it out to her and my nephew , my neice said it look like a light from a plane or something. All a sudden the light started to zig zag back in forth at a very fast pace, then it really got going, It appeared to us to move across the sky in a split second. at this time we knew it was not a airplane, they cannot do this, so as young kids we got really scared and ran into my brother bed room and told him about it , we all went outside onto the front porch and watch it for about another ten minutes or so. then it came to a stop and it was hard to see it because it blended in with the stars. it started to get larger and larger and it appeared to land or go behind the hill. we all jumped into my brother truck to go up to the hill to see if it did land or not, but we didn&#39;t make it, the truck just died and the light went out and would not restart, my Brother said the truck has done that before, he had a weak battery and drove a very old truck that had a generator, and if the battery got low the generator would not put out enough voltage and everything dies he said. but I&#39;m not sure Now if it was that or maybe a magnetic force that did it.. It was very dark and could not see your hand in front of your face, the moon was not out.  Then we notice lights coming from the south and went right over us, it was a helicopter, army one. we also heard jet engine we thought, but no planes in sight, my brother said we need to get out of there and as we was walking back to the house we saw the light it went straight up and went out of sight, the helicopter left to, the next morning my brother went to get his truck that we left and it started right up, guess that old weak battery just charge it self up... I have never shared this UFO story with any official, I was afraid they would think I was A nut case, but with all the other people see weird things I thought I would share this with you…<n>

We were kissing goodbye on the back porch, and we both saw an oval sun looking object on west horizon at 1:15 a.m.  Due to the rolling hills in Wisconsin, you can only see 5 miles in the distance, at the most.  My father was a volunteer fireman, so if there were any fires in a 10 mile radius from our farm my father would have been notified.  I observed there were solar flexes coming from this object and they split from the middle and went to the outside edges of this oval object and it disappeared.  I thought, I am going to keep my mind open to figure out what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My ex-husband and I moved to New Mexico, on September 14, 1973.  In 1975, I was watching a movie of Barney and Betty Hill who were abducted by aliens.  Betty explained when the space ship took off it was engulfed in flames and as it took off the flames dissipated.  This is what I saw in Wisconsin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a beautiful, clear, late afternoon, summer day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed this bright object in the sky, being several hours before sunset, I thought it strange for a star to be visable. I got out my 35 MM Mamia camera, put on my 205 MM telephoto lens with a 2x doubler. I set it up on my tripod and took 6 or 7 color slides of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only movement was the rotation of the earth caused it to move down out of the view finder. I was facing due west looking up at about a 45 degree angle. The sun was below and left of the object, below the ridge west of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived down in a valley with a ridge to my west with an elevation of 850 feet above sea level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to me the object was beyond the atmosphere and finally disappeared in the summer haze on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a super large inlargement by projecting the image 50 feet across the basement onto a ground glass plate and photograghing it from behind the plate. I will send a print.<n>

It was a clear night.  As we were walking a bright round object heading towards our direction.  Without looking at a map I cannot give a course heading.  Anybody familer with the base, we were coming from the enlisted housing development on the hill next to the golf couse and the object was coming towards us.  The mountains being to the left and airfield on the right .  The object was probably at an altitude of 1000 to 2000 ft and moving at a rate of speed that i have never seen before.  I been around military air bases my whole life (I currently work at Airforce base on the flight line and see our  fighters jets  all the time)The object came to a complete stop and then headed in a nintey degree angle to the left and headed out over the mountains slightly climbing and moving at an incredible rate of speed and out of site.  As soon as it was out of site I started to to eliminate any possibilities like a search light, signal flare, military aircraft, shooting star etc etc.. Also there was no sound  at all.  My friend and i looked at each other and said what in the hell was that?  We both ran all the way to the post theater.  Even to this day I cannot give you an explination as to what the two of us saw that night.  All i know is that this object moved at a speed that i have only seen in the movies and that it came to a complete stop and moved in another direction and disappeard in  a blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was lower than the power lines and trees.  Then we saw a beam of light coming up the street very slowly towards us.  We watched as it got closer.  All you could see was the light on the ground, no visible shape or object and no where to see where the beam of light was coming from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light got within a few feet of us I told my friend to run and we ran into our own houses.  I told my family at the time, but they didn’t believe me because sometimes I would make up stories to get a reaction out of them.  So no one ever believed us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I had time to think about it, I realized I had initially thought it was a helicopter overhead.  But it was too quiet and too low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered about it my whole life.  I wondered what would have happened if we had let the beam actually reach us and shine on us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Too bad I was young and scared and ran away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It had circular blinking multi=colored lights, it made no sound and hovered approximately two minutes before moving to the woods at the side of our house.  It had seemed to land but we later found no evidence.  That night after going inside there was a very bright light coming through the window filling the room.  I could not shut it out by closing my eyes and covering my head.  After that I don&#39;t remember much of the incident.We live on a dead end road surrounded by woods.  We were the first house you came to on the road.  Our driveway goes up and you can not see the house from the road, it was just off a secondary road , near the bottom of a mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

8/15/72 01:00|Ellensburg (south of))|WA|Circle|2 HRS|Very large UFO sighting south of Ellensburg WA. Multiple following sightings.|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55348.html|11|ndxe197208| Very large UFO sighting south of Ellensburg WA. Multiple following sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Returning home to Yakima winding up I-82 south of Ellensburg, WA, I noticed many lights in the sky moving below the low cloud cover to the west of me. I-82 climbs a large ridge a few miles south of Ellensburg. It was a very dark night so the many various color light stood out. When they first caught my attention they were a few miles away from my position. The clouds cover was solid and low over the Umtanum Hills. I watched them with interest as I continued winding up the highway which goes over this ridge. My memory is of alternate red, yellow, green, and white lights in a circle with no specific pattern of appearance or distance between.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it might be helicopters from the US Army Firing Center but the lights had no familiar pattern that I could identify. My curiosity caused me to stop my car on the shoulder so I could study the object. At first I just rolled down my window expecting I might hear the familiar sound of the helicopters (which is what I tried to convince myself it must be). Hearing no sound, I then shut off the ignition, turned out my lights and then eventually stepped out of my car. I do not remember seeing another car on the highway going in either direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a light wind blowing from the direction of the lights and I strained to hear any sounds. There was none except that of the wind. The UFO moved slowly on a level plane north of the ridge. Now as the lights got closer I could see it was large and I got more frightened as it got closer. now I knew I was seeing my first UFO.It was approaching slowly but steadily in my direction. There was no decernable sound at all coming from the UFO. I wanted to get back in my car and speed away but I didn&#39;t want to draw attention to myself. I now shivered in the wind but was afraid to open the car door to show any lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to stop directly above me for a few moments. The sky was black with clouds.  It did not appear to be a perfect circle but neither could I say it was eliptical. Size of the UFO would only be a guess because I really didn&#39;t know how high above me it hovered but its size as I saw it there would have more than spanned the 1/2 of the freeway I was traveling, maybe 300 feet end to end as I saw it. I strained to see more but all I could make out were the lights which I guessed was the perimeter of the UFO. The lights were constant and not flickering. Soon it proceeded its tract to my east and eventually moved over the ridge south where I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as it was out of sight I got in my car and raced up the highway wanting to get over the ridge and get another look at it. As I drove I couldn&#39;t help but wonder what the hell I saw, and then began to wonder how long this experience had taken. I hadn&#39;t thought to check the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got to the top and started down the other side of the ridge. As soon as I got to an open area where I could scan the area, I stopped my car and scanned the sky. About 1 mile further down the road from this point is a military parking and staging area. The UFO was not visible but I noticed what looked like the 2 red tail light bars of an older Ford T-Bird in the sage brush beyond the parking area. I thought it odd that a car would be where it was when the two lights suddenly seperated and in an instant went different directions over the hill away from me (a distance I guessed at being about 2 miles away).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Struck in awe at this second sighting, I sat there a while longer. A couple minutes later I saw two lights going through the brush in the same approximate location as the previous lights had disappeared. These lights looked like they were the lights of 2 motorcycles, like 2 riders were racing each other through the brush, except that 1 light disappeared down out of sight and the other shot straight up and dissappeared in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat here for maybe 15-20 minutes wondering if I might see something more before I proceeded south toward home in Yakima. As I was going down a slow grade toward a bridge which spans what I think is called Indian Creek I couldn&#39;t help but notice the area was well lighted. I stopped just short of the bridge. Up the creek to the west, hidden from my direct view I could see the area was well lighted, almost like Las Vegas was just around the bend. I was tempted to jump over the fence and climb the hill to see what was happening. This is government property well posted and part of the Firing Center so I decided it had to be a military operation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded home it was now about 2:30. I called the Army Base, asked for the duty officer and reported the lights and activities up Indian Creek, asking if there were any military exersizes going on. He said there were none. I left out the UFO part afraid they might figure I was a nut. The duty officer said he would send someone to investigate and promissed to get back to me. The following day I called and asked for the same officer and was told there was no such person ever on that base. There was no record of my report and no investigation was noted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In retrospect, it is about 35 miles between Ellenburg and Yakima on that highway. What would have normally been a 1/2 hour drive took me about 2 - 2 1/2 hours. It didn&#39;t seem like I was there that long but I can&#39;t honestly tell you how long I watched the first UFO or how long it stood over me. I went from curiousity to awe to fear and then finally relief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Sterling Ohio<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a  report of a sighting from 1972 I am unsure of the exact date however there should be a record of a newspaper clip verifying the date as well as an unknown witness inquiry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in the summer, august probably as I was home on leave from tech school in Rantoul, Illinois.  Just after basic training in the Air Force.  I lived in a small town in Ohio, Mt.Sterling, about twenty five miles south of Columbus. There is a small creek running through it called Deer Creek, now made larger by a dam project built there in the mid 70’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While on leave from the Air Force my uncle, and two of my friends, and I  decided to go fishing near the bridge on the north end of town. There were stands of trees on either side of the creek bank and open farm fields beyond there. We had been there about 4 hrs camped out with the usual fishing gear and such when around midnight, one o’clock a large shape rose out from behind the trees. The object was approximately 200 feet or more long or I should say around with an indescribably blue light emitting from the bottom. It was the color of a welder arc but not painful to look at, it was more of intense glow than a light. The light or glow was probably 80%as large as the craft was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft made on sound and emitted no heat, nor air movement. It rose approximately 100 feet into the air, and stopped!  It did not wobble or move it just stopped. The craft stayed there for at least 10 minutes and then began to slowly rise increasing in speed the farther away it got.  Its assent was precisely vertical and continued until it was a pinpoint of light. And then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needles to say we were all stunned at what had just happened and decided to make haste out of there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day the newspaper came out and a couple driving on the highway had placed an ad inquiring if anyone had seen anything strange in the sky that night. I was just in the air force, and project Blue book and UFO’s were being officially call swamp gas, so I did not report the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after that I returned to my Duty station in Fla. I have never spoken with the people I was with again, and do not know of there where abouts. So if you would like to track them down you would be welcome to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were less than a hundred yards from this craft, I know of no other report that has been that close, I can understand folks seeing light and other such things at a distance. But we were so close that we had to restrain one of the younger members from throwing a rock at it. He would have hit it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/15/72 01:00|Toronto (Canada)|ON|Sphere|240 minutes|Witnessed glowing sphere land in middle of urban area, had confirmation from authorities.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03565.html|13|ndxe197208| Witnessed glowing sphere land in middle of urban area, had confirmation from authorities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This took place in the summer of 1972, possibly mid-august, in Toronto Canada.  On summer visit to grandmother&#39;s house there, I and my best friend (teenagers at the time) noted that the dark kitchen was lit up like daylight at 1 a.m... but it was strange orange light... running to window, we saw enormous orange sphere more than six storeys tall landing in an open ravine area beyond local business district, which was visible from the window there. We watched for some time as the craft settled slowly into the clearing beyond apartment buildings 2 blocks away... no sound, but so bright it lit up the whole neighborhood. When it landed, one could still see the top of it over top of the apt blocks (hence estimation of more than 6 storeys tall when landed)... We had NO fear, wanted to go down there and see up close, but grandmother and aunt woke up in our commotion and forbid us to go. Grandmother (a retired school teacher) and Aunt (a CBC television costume designer) saw craft as well as us. Called my parents in California to get my Dad to aid in keeping us girls in the house, he remembers this call. Aunt suggested I call police. Police operator answered and I suddenly lost my voice, didn&#39;t know what to say... stammmered umm umm... she said &#34;you calling from Forest Hill?&#34;  I said I was.  &#34;You calling about the flying saucer&#34; I said I was.  (her words)   &#34;Can you see it now?&#34; I said I could. &#34;Can you see the hi rises from where you are?&#34; I said I could. She then said &#34;Everyone in those hi-rises has already called us.&#34;  She went on to tell me that they were telling people to stay in their houses, and that patrol cars were in the area to investigate. We watched for more than another hour, the craft still visible on the ground beyond the hi rises.  Eventually my aunt made us go to bed. We lay on the floor and listened to Toronto all night talk radio, and all the calls were about the sighting. Eventually we fell asleep on the floor in front of the radio, waking at daybreak, at which point we ran down to the area, and found NO signs of anything. No flattened grass, singed ground, nothing.  We tried to call talk radio and got told that  &#34;they were taking no more calls about flying saucers. Toronto is a busy city and there is lots more important stuff going on.&#34; There was nothing in either newspaper (telegram or star) and we called both newsrooms to be told that reputable papers didn&#39;t bother with silly nonsense like flying saucers. We called the police and were told that the night before there were some reports of some sort of prank in our area (Forest Hill Village - an upper class neighborhood in the middle of the city) but that investigating officers had found no signs of anything out of the ordinary. The Sphere was perfectly round, noiseless, and glowed with an amazing shade of pure clear orange light that entirely lit up the neighborhood bright as day.  It took about 20 minutes to land gently in the field beyond the aprtments. The field is still there 20 years later, between Spadina and Bathhurst, this took place just beyond the intersection of Lonsdale and Spadina in the middle of Forest Hill there... After it landed we could still see the top of it over the buildings between it and us, but with no movement and no sound, after a couple of hours we were almost bored, and frustrated that we were not being allowed out of the house for a closer look. The police operator told me that everyone in these hirises (also visible to us) had called them, she seemed to be caught up in it at the moment, I consider the police operator to have verified this sighting to me. I have filed reports of this sighting with a few other researchers and groups over the years, because I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m the only witness still around, it had to have been seen by many people, the police operator told me their lines were ringing off the hook... (remember in &#39;72 they didn&#39;t have caller ID even at the police station, she ASKED me if I was in Forest Hill) Today I am 41, mother of a teenager, work as the station manager of a local cable company community access television channel here in B.C.&#39;s gulf islands... am college educated, don&#39;t drink or smoke... I know what I saw, remember the entire incident vividly. The aunt and grandmother who saw this with me are dead now, but my father is here and alive and remembers the telephone call from my aunt when my friend (who is traceable) and I were so intent to go outside and get a closer look at this &#34;object&#34;<n>

I was on the top bunk in my bedroom when I was awakened out of deep sleep. I then opened the curtain and looked out the bedroom window and saw what appeared to be a white/silver cylinder object hovering in the air. I was scared and facinated at the same time. I had always (and still have) a wild imagination, so I just lay in my bed and watched until it disappeared. I hopped out of bed right after the event ended and got a glass of water to make sure I was really awake. It happened when I was 8 years old (30 years ago) and this is the first time I ever said anything about it. What was odd to me was I expected to hear a news report or hear others discussing it. But that never happened. It was, and is, as if nothing occurred. I am a very logical thinker and not some nutcase. I am well-educated and have a family of my own now and have been very successful in life. That one event still haunts me, though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I put on a doubler and my 200 MM telephoto lens.  I took 7 photos of the object which had no movement other than the rotation of the earth taking it downward out of the cameras field of view. It finally dissappeared in the haze near the horizon.  My house was in a deep valley, so the sun was below the top of the  hill and the object,to the West.  I still had the 35MM slides. I made an elargement of one of the slides by projecting it about 40 feet onto a ground glass plate and photographing it from the back.  The original images are so small it is hard to see any detail.

It was the summer vacation between my second and third years of law school; at the time I lived in New York City where I was attending Columbia University School of Law. A friend of mine from law school had to get his car back to California before the registration expired; he’d invited me to drive across Canada and down the West Coast.  Thus it was that on August 10, 1972 I was seated in the passenger seat of a car travelling west on the Trans Canada Highway in the western portion of Saskatchewan headed towards the Alberta border, a long and quite-deserted stretch of road. It was the beginning phase of sunset: it was still basically full daylight, but the western sky was already glowing a reddish orange. I was gazing northward out the passenger side window when I noticed a metallic object shaped rather like a long slightly squished football but more pointed on the ends (see”P.P.S.” on last page).  It was approaching or arriving, coming down out of the sky which would have been to the northwest of me (it was in the upper left portion of my passenger side window); however, although it was arriving, I had not seen it do a full entry from the sky -- no starting with a tiny speck getting larger -- it just seemed to show up out of nowhere albeit at a distance from which it then approached.  It came in on a trajectory rather like that of a plane coming in for a landing (except that it wasn’t a plane and had no wings): it curved down and out to the right (east) and leveled off flying eastward parallel to the flat horizon. It was going quite fast, faster certainly than any airplane would have, but the speed wasn’t astonishing or attention-getting at that point. I called my friend’s attention to the bizarre object.  Since he was driving, my friend had less opportunity to watch the object; and since we were on a hard-driving schedule to get the car to California, we never considered stopping.  But as we continued to drive, my friend would pose possible explanations as I, who was observing nonstop, would report back contradications as I saw them.  My friend posited several falling object possiblities, such as meteorites, space debris, etc. beginning when I first called his attention to the object. I remember my reply was “How many meteorites stop dead in their tracks?”, for indeed the object’s approach and fairly fast eastward movement ended abruptly with the vehicle suddenly, and without first slowing down, freezing dead still in the sky! The object stayed stopped in this position, which was at that point either north or northeast of me, appearing to hover.  It then fired what appeared to be a tiny jet or other propulsion off to the right (east) and reversed its direction from its arrival and moved parallel to the ground to the west, moving at what seemed to be a fast yet somehow unrushed speed in that it wasn’t as fast as its initial arrival speed. # It then repeated these maneuvers in reverse:  an instantaneous stop, hovering, then a tiny firing to the left (west) initiated movement in the opposite (this time easterly) direction. The object, which by then I was calling a UFO because of its humanly impossible movements, stopped and hovered for a third time.  Then once AGAIN it fired what appeared to be a propulsion firing, off to the right (east), and reversed its direction a second time, except that this time the propulsion firing was slightly larger and instead of just travelling along the horizon, the UFO swept left (i.e., westward)and away (i.e., a bit northward) and UP, DISAPPEARING ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY up into the sky in the direction from whence it had first come!  The speed of this disappearance flight was mind-boggling -- 1,2,3 and it was gone.  Comparing it to even our most powerful end-of-the-century rockets’ launches, where the rocket is visible for quite some time, this UFO had propulsion man hasn’t begun to come close to.  Ditto on the incredible in-air maneuverability which included fast speeds, fast stops, and hovering apparently at will. To focus on the object itself as opposed to its movements, the object appeared to be metallic and shiny and appeared to be brightly reflecting the reddish-orange of the setting sun. (This would account for the object being called a “fireball” in the next morning’s newspapers, though it definitely was not a fireball -- it was bright fire-colored light reflecting off metal.  This would also account for varying reports as to its color being red, blue, or orange -- the daytime sightings and/or sightings at a different angle would not have picked up the red-orange reflection of the sunset’s light.) I have never hazarded a guess as to the object’s size or its distance from me because I have lousy size and distance estimating skills and because even if I had better skills, there was no size or distance frame of reference out there in that vast, flat, and empty plain.  I can only say that it clearly was neither super close (not on top of us and not close enough for me to have observed any specific features on the vehicle if there were any) nor super far away (not a speck on the horizon -- MUCH more visible and observable). I can’t say whether the UFO made any noise.  I heard none, but I was far enough away that there could have been noise I didn’t hear (plus the car windows were up), although I probably WOULD have heard it if it had been as loud as, say, one of the U.S.’s rocket launches.  What also strikes me after the fact is that despite the incomprehensible speed of the departure, there was no sonic boom.  Humans’ jets moving at a small fraction of the speed make dramatic and highly noticeable sonic booms. I have always been clear that the above-described object clearly was a UFO and was of extra-terrestrial/not-man-on-earth origins.  The various “explanations” offered in the newspapers the next morning (copies of two attached hereto), from meteors to other falling objects to fireballs to sunspots, are laughable and don’t come CLOSE to fitting the facts -- such objects do not stop in midflight, hover, and then zoom back up into the sky from whence they came. And it’s inconceivable that it was a secret government vehicle like the UFO’s that turned out to be tests of the Stealth # plane:  since then we’ve been so thrilled at creating a space shuttle that could return to space -- although it had to be towed back to its launch site and put back on a rocket, and we had our problems getting that technology to work; that doesn’t sound like a government with a vehicle that can return to space instantaneously at will from a standstill in the sky!  Plus I’ve already mentioned the dramatic difference in our rockets’ launch speeds and this UFO’s blinding “launch”/disappearance speed. Plus the lack of a sonic boom. However, some time after the UFO disappeared, my friend and I did observe two other strange events which I’ve always said could have been unrelated to the UFO and could have had unrelated earthly explanations -- but I’ve always wanted to learn more because it was so strange that these next two bizarre events followed so closely on the heels of what was definitely a UFO appearance. After the UFO zipped back up into space and after the sun had set, my friend and I were still driving westward on the Trans Canada Highway, probably pretty much at the Saskatchewan/Alberta border by that time.  It was a VERY dark night and the road was pretty much deserted.  As I had all day, I was gazing out the passenger side window (northward).  Eventually a group of phenomenally bright lights, on the ground, came into view:  at that point the plains had some roll to the land, and coming out from behind one of these rolls, so that I couldn’t see the source, was the most dazzling display of bright white lights that lit up all the land and sky around it.  It wasn’t too far above (i.e., north of) the Trans Canada Highway. It was rather like a huge display of klieg light opening up a gigantic glitzy new shopping mall in Texas, except that the klieg lights I’d previously seen made specific spotlights in the sky and often were moving back and forth or around in circles -- these lights didn’t have that spotlight effect -- it was more of a huge, constant, and unmoving, light display. At the time my two guesses were a government installation or a landed UFO; why else would this city-appropriate light display be out there in the middle of nowhere?  When we finally got to a bigger town, Medicine Hat, where we stayed for the night, we asked numerous citizens about the huge lights out on the plains just east of town and just above the Trans Canada Highway, but nobody had a clue what it was, and everybody was clear it wasn’t any permanent building or installation.  I still totally reserve judgement and work on the assumption that the lights were there by the hand of man. In August 2000 I did learn that the Canadian government was rumored to have at one point had a UFO-attraction experiment out of an air base located just north/northeast of Medicine Hat, which project included trying to attract UFO’s with bright lights (Project Lure, described at www.aufosg.org/kijek/page 90 and page 87).  Although the government claimed to have ceased the project prior to 1972, my current best guess as to the massive klieg light-like display I saw is that perhaps either the government or some other private project was trying to attract back the UFO that had appeared near there earlier that evening.  But it’s an open question, of course.  Nothing so clear as my first event. # Now to the third event, which was TRULY strange.  It happened almost immediately after we’d passed the huge bright lights and once again had our dark sky and deserted road.  I looked out the car’s rear window and saw a small cluster or cloud comprised of tiny dots bigger than the water drops in regular clouds or hazes:  the tiny dots were tiny, glowing, neon or fluorescent green lights.  The cloud was small (though big enough that I couldn’t have gotten my arms around it) and amorphous and slightly changed its contours or overall shape from time to time.  Most of the time the green light cloud was just immediately outside the car -- any closer and it would have been touching the car -- AND IT WAS FOLLOWING THE CAR!  It kept its distance behind the rear car window (and slightly up) constant. We theorized that perhaps the car was throwing up a dust cloud and for some reason the dust around there was glowing and green and fluorescent.  But then the cloud moved around to the side of the car and travelled along with us just outside of my right passenger side window!  (By the way I’m from Minnesota and have canoed in Canada -- I definitely know Northern Lights, and this had nothing to do with Northern Lights.) On my next “observation” I do own that I could have been imagining things, but I definitely had the sense of an intelligence in this green light cloud, and it seemed to be an intelligence evaluating me, perhaps to go with it. Until very recently I’ve almost never mentioned this impression to anybody, including the friend with me in the car, because it just seemed so far-fetched (now it seems less so -- see below). In any event I tried to “send” no-don’t-take-me messages to the cloud just in case.  Then the cloud moved back to its original position just up and behind the car’s rear window and stayed with us until the lights of Medicine Hat started to become visible, at which point the cloud started to hang back more but was still travelling with us.  Then we made the turn off the main road into Me! dicine H at and the cloud pulled way back and up and finally left us -- it seemed not to want to go into the town with us. As with the klieg lights that immediately preceded the green neon light cloud, I’ve always said that there could well be earthly explanations -- I’m certainly not ready to swear to unearthliness on a stack of Bibles the way I would vis-a-vis the first event, the flying object. I am, however, intrigued and amazed by my recent (August 2000) reading of documents concerning a pilot and plane that disappeared in 1978 off the coast of Australia after being harrassed by a UFO very similar to the one I saw in Canada in 1972 and just after the pilot reported seeing a green light while the UFO was hovering above his plane (pilot named Frederick Valentich; documents found at www.bermuda-triangle.org/Investigations/UFO_Incidents/Summary_Report). Also, an October 27, 1966 article in the Saskatoon Star Phoenix reported two different people who said they had been followed in their cars for miles by an object which repeatedly shone a spotlight on their vehicle as it was driving (copy will be attached as soon as I get it).  AND recently in Nevada a UFO was seen to generate a greenish blue “fog” 60 feet away from the vehicle (www.filersfiles.com/files/2000/FilersFiles29). (On August 10, 1972 it was a very dark night, the windows were closed, and I was looking only to the north.  I probably wouldn’t have noticed if anything had approached from # behind -- e.g., I didn’t notice the glowing green light cloud until it was immediately outside the car’s rear window.) The morning after our sighting, August 11, 1972, the newspaper stands were full of many different newspapers, all with headlines or front page stories about the August 10, 1972 UFO.  We couldn’t stay in Medicine Hat to learn more because we had such a pressing deadline to get to California.  I do regret not keeping the various newpaper articles we found that day.  I have recently obtained the August 11, 1972 articles from the Medicine Hat News and the Calgary Herald (copies attached hereto).  These report that the object (which they keep calling a “fireball”) was seen that day in scattered points, first throughout the Western U.S. and then in southeastern British Columbia and Alberta; these sightings were said to include one by “a jet fighter pilot flying over southeastern Washington.”  I haven’t re-found the account yet, but I do also remember reading in one of the newspapers that morning that the same object had also been seen throughout the week or weeks preceding August 10, 1972 throughout the Great Plains of the U.S.  I also remember reading that morning that a U.S. Air Force jet pilot had tried to chase it but couldn’t catch it and that he had clocked the object as going a speed beyond man’s capabilities. ((name and contact information deleted))  P.S. I’ve left my friend’s name out as he was upset about at having to admit he’d really seen a UFO and he didn’t want anyone to know he’d seen it, and I have no idea whether he still feels this way about it.  RS Atts.: (1) two Aug.11, 1972 articles from Medicine Hat News (2) three articles from the Calgary Herald (one=Aug.11, 1972) (3) 1966 reports of spotlights following cars in Saskatchewan P.P.S. I have always described the shape of “my” UFO as being a squished football but with more pointed ends.  After seeing photos and sketches of various UFO’s, I realize that what I saw could just as easily have been a disc or classic saucer if tipped slightly away or towards me. # Your form doesn&#39;t allow me to paste in the full description that I had already written!

I was absolutely fascinated and with no fear. Within a minute or two I stood approaching the large window, cupped my hands around my eyes to get a better look into the dark night.  The light hovered directly over a low retainer wall separating the front lawn from the mesquite grove and continued its steady flashing. Suddenly apprehensive I started walking past a wall of windows toward the bedroom and watching as the light followed my path.  The bedroom drapes were closed so I carefully peaked through the opening only to find the light hovering outside the bedroom window.  While watching another few seconds it suddenly disappeared.

I was 19 years old and a first year college student at Northern Oklahoma College. I was plowing late at night because of the hot days.  I noticed a new radio or TV like tower at the west end of the field but I didn&#39;t notice it at the beginning of the evening.  The tower had three red lights and a white light at the top, none of them were blinking.  Then alittle later I saw the tower at the north end of the field, but I blew it off thinking I was confused and lost my since of direction in the plowed field because of the darkness. Then just a short time later I saw the tower floating and traveling horizontally across the sky with the white light in the lead.  The tower slowly circled the field I was in once and then it moved out of sight. I once turned the motor of the tractor off, a 930 Case with a four bottom plow, and listened but could not hear the lights or tower making any noise at all.   The tractor is a diesel and the throttle has to be turned down all the way to stop the motor, I did not however turn off the head lights. It had also moved out of my sight while I was busy with manuvering the tractor and I did not notice the direction it went. I remained in the field working until the tractor was low on diesel fuel then unhooked the plow and started home.  I exited the field to the north on a one lane sand road which cut through another field before it crossed an asphalt road running east and west. Then the same road turns to a north-south county road.  But the most interesting thing happen on the sand road just as I was leaving the field I was working in. A single large white light came over the trees north of me at the asphalt road and came at me like it wanted to stop me on the road. The light was the brightess light I think I have ever seen, it was almost like a thick liquid and I could not see anything else. I was going north and the large white light was going south. I was traveling about 20 miles an hour but, I do not know the speed of the white light. I kept waiting for the light to stop but it didn&#39;t and I waited too long. I thought we were going to wreck so I started to turn to the right and run through the shallow ditch and take what might come in the rough plowed field. That is all that I remember about that night.  I awoke the next morning in my bed and the tractor was parked next to the 500 gallon fuel tank in the driveway ready to be refueled for work like it always was. I do not know how I or the tractor got home that night. After breakfast that same morning when my Uncle and I went out to refuel the tractor, two F-4 Fighter Jets flew over our farm so low we could see the pilots looking back at us, they were going south toward the field I was in.<n>

He appeared to be 7&#39;, wearing a silver/grey military type uniform.  He said, &#34;return to your home, do not come back out til morning.&#34;  He communicated with his mind.  I returned to my home.  I could hear sirens coming to the location where the saucer and man stood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This male appeared as a male not unlike that of a human, he was firm in his request and compelling, though he did not present himself as threatening.  There was no report on the news of this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two to three hours later the police did come to our door and asked my mother to keep all of us indoors that night.<n>
