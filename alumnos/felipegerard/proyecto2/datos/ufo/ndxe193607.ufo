The more I think of it the more it seems it was not a dream.  It was the most frighting thing in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 4/5 years old when the first occurrance happened.  Two/three  creatures appeared in my bedroom at night.  They just came thru the wall and where there.  I was scared to the point of hysteria.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I remember is we where going down the street away from my house towards the nearest corner.  There was their &#34;car,&#34; as I thought it was.  I noticed it was shiny like polished alumimun (not black like all the other cars I&#39;d ever seen) and it appeared to me to be upside down!  The flat part was on top and the curved part on the bottom, like a half sphere upside down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They wanted me to get in and I guess I did although I can&#39;t recall.  After that I was afraid to go to my room to sleep because I was fearful they would come back to take me.  I think they returned maybe 4 times.  I was always near frighted to death each time.  As best I can recall this was over a period of about 1 or 2 years.  Then they stopped coming.In my pre and teen years I was very prone to nose bleeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This in its self was not remarkable except for one occurrence. I was having a particularly heavy nose bleed. and was leaning againist a building letting it just run freely.  Some thing came out of my nose and fell to the ground.  I didn,&#39; pick it up because it was all bloody, but it was maybe a half to one inch long and shaped like a bullet.  I&#39;ve always wondered about that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now 72 years old and have never spoke of this to anyone.  Am I nuts or imagining some thing??<n> <n><n> <n><n> My name is ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
