She was excited about the Rolling Stones being on the Ed Sullivan show.  When she opened the back door so I could see the Stones, the song they were playing was &#34;Satisfaction,&#34; and that is how I remember the day and year, I was eleven years old at the time.  My friend went in to have dinner and I went  over to a darker section of  her backyard to twirl on the abandoned clothes line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sitting on top of the  T section of  clothes line pole, I heard a whirring sound, have read where another witness to a similar ufo used the term “ electrical “ which does describe the sound, and is what I would imagine to be an  exceptionally well built electrical engine, like nothing on this earth. A very low whirring electrical sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up an not far above me, the height was of two garages placed on top of one another, the width was not as wide as a double car garage. What I say was UNBELIEVABLE, I was directly under the bottom of a  saucer shaped ufo, with multiple colored  beams of light pulsating around it; red, blue green yellow and an occasional white beam of light. It had a  bright white light in the center which went off for a spilt second and caused me to strain to see any details  of the bottom of the ufo. Which looked  like a dark gray silver color with a mid section slightly protruding, the beams of light seemed to emanate from holes on the bottom of the ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the lights for four to five minutes though for some reason time had seemed to lose meaning, when the ufo verved to the left of me, paused then moved away and disappeared in a blink of an eye. It  returned as I was still watching the spot in the dark sky where it had left and was above me once again for a brief period and left again the same way as before in a blink of an eye, as if it had disappeared, all of this was noiseless. I got the impression it wanted to make sure I knew what it was capable of doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my friend came out, I said that there was a ufo above me and she looked at me, looked up above me and said, lets go in the garage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is something I never told many people about and suppressed the memory for obvious reasons.  When I began to hear reports of ufo’s and shows on them, the memory came back very intensely and I began to speak about it to family member’s who do not seem to know what to make of it.  I have also had to have cataract surgery, which had ophthalmologist shaking their heads that someone my age, without any family history of cataracts, had them as severe as I did.  Since then have been doing my own research and have read one or two reports of sightings in Bakersfield as well as elsewhere which describe the ufo I witnessed.  At the time this was occurring I was not fearful!  Though now it unnerves me to think of the power they have over us if they chose to use it.  I would like to be hypnotized and regressed back to that night to uncover details I might have forgotten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It does amaze me that our government has not done any survey of people that have witnessed ufo’s.  Personally I know they are much more advanced than us, but my feeling is we may become just as advance if our civilization last long enough.  What makes me believe this is the whirring electrical engine/motor that I heard at the beginning of ufo sighting, was something, man here on earth could one day replicate.  One more thing, after viewing pictures and videos of ufo’s, many seem to be near of above power lines, like they are taking energy from them?   There is so much more I would like to discuss, about what else they have been doing near power/telephone lines, some of it might label me a kook.  I also  would like to learn more, hopefully doors will open up so that we will not feel so ostracized.  I do not feel so alone with all of the other eye witnesses coming forward.<n>

The Record Courier in Portage County and the Akron Beacon Journal in Summit County.  Sorry I didn&#39;t keep the clippings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 10 year old daughter and I were departing my parents hillside home after a tremendous blizzard had layered three to four feet of snow over the ground.  As we pulled out of the driveway onto the street I looked back up at the house marvelling at the clarity of the sky after such rotten weather, and saw a small bright white light descending slowly toward the horizon.  I stopped the car and pointed it out to her, thinking it might be a shooting star, but realizing at the same time it was traveling too slow...appearing to be a controlled approach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached the treetops it decelerated more rapidly and the bright white light took on an increasingly blueish tinge that appeared as a ring of light below the craft.  It slowly settled behind the treetops probably not more than 1500 feet behind the house in a woodsy uninhabited area that we used for riding horses.  There was a large treeless hill back there which must have been where they landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was late getting home to fix dinner so I didn&#39;t return to my parents home but drove straight to mine in Twin Lakes.  I immediately called my parents and spoke to my mother telling her something landed behind the house and to send my teen age brother out to investigate.  She just laughed and said he wasn&#39;t home.  I said send pop.  She said no way will he wade through this deep snow.  In my frustration I didn&#39;t think of calling the police.  Rather I called a reporter friend, John Fowler, of the Record Courier, and asked if he&#39;d had any other reports of a similar sighting.  He also laughed (I&#39;m getting used to it by now) and asked if I was sure it wasn&#39;t the moon.  (Note:  I am a licensed pilot and have several other sightings at various times).  When I assured him I knew the difference between a controlled craft and the moon he asked if he could report it in the paper.  After all this laughter I acceded but qualified it by saying just don&#39;t use my name. (I was running my own business at the time and there are closed minded people you know!)My little news article appeared on the front page the following day headed, &#34;Twin Lakes Woman Sights UFO&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day, as I picked up the Beacon Journal and read the front page report in the local section of large numbers of people in Shalersville watching a large cigar shaped mother ship hover over them for over an hour at the precise time I saw the scout ship, I wondered how John felt missing out on that news?  Those folks watched the scout ships leaving and arriving the mother ship, entering and exiting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What puzzles me is the total lack of reporting on the investigation of incidents such as these.    We all know the famous case of the sheriff&#39;s deputy from our County Seat...Ravenna, Ohio, sighting and pursuing a craft into Pennsylvania for a couple of hours chase.  That poor guy, when he tried to provide the information he had at hand, was ridiculed and eventually lost his job...and maybe even his sanity.  I understand he had lots of problems in his life thereafter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can check on my report through the newspapers&#39; microfiche files.  Sorry I&#39;m not positive about the date. It&#39;s approximate.  I have other sightings and experiences that occurred at different times and other locations if they would be of interest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is currently a very experienced pilot.  Date is approximate.  We have invited her to explore the newspapers to obtain a precise date for the incident.  PD))<n>

For the most part I have kept this information to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was home on leave from the Navy in February 1966.  I had just left my girlfriends house at about 0100 hours in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving east on state route 224  where I connected to state route 44  going northbound through the small town of Randolph, Ohio.  This is a rural area and I was the only vehicle on the road at that time of the morning.  There was snow on the roadway and ground which my headlights lit up in front of my vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden in the black night sky I observed this egg shaped object through my windshield.  It came out of the night sky from the east.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever witnessed.  This UFO came into view with the speed that nothing on earth could match.  As it came into view it stopped just as fast in mid air right over the road I was traveling on.  Seemed as if it had spotted me and stopped to take a look.  It was only stationary for what seem like five/ten seconds.  Then, with the same blazing speed from a standing stop it took off toward the west and was gone in a split second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This egg shaped object was out in front of me and was just above the tree top level.  I would estimate it was down range from me about a mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the UFO was the color of a red hot poker with the yellow, almost white hot color, being in the center.  The blue color being on the outer areas with the red and green colors being closer to the center.  Now here is the odd thing.  This UFO had two other smaller ROUND objects following it and they were the same color.  It appeared as if the smaller objects might have been attached. The smaller objects were approximately at a 45 degree angle to the rear of the larger UFO.  The smaller narrower part of the egg shape was the rear of this UFO which, of course pointed east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not drinking nor do I drink.  I finished my enlistment in the Navy.  Upon returning home I went to college obtaining my Masters Degree in Education an I&#39;m a retired police officer after twenty plus years of service.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw that night many years ago was REAL.  I&#39;ll never forget it.  What ever it was is not of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
