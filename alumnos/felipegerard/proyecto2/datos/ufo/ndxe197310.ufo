My step sister screamed and fell to the floor.  I looked back at her and then back out the window.  It was not there, but then a split second later, it appeared in front of me.  It was about 2-3 feet in diameter.  I looked into it and it went on forever; no concrete thing in it.  I then felt a butterfly sensation in my chest and a great sensation of love and joy.  I had never felt anything like that.  Then i felt 3 hard thumps in my chest.  I felt violated and scared, but decided to wave to it and say hi.  As i did, it left and flew across the street over a house top and it felt like it had ripped something out of my chest.  I have been unable to sleep since.

I saw a soft white glowball gliding at about a foot above the ground moving through our yard.  I said, &#34;Oh my God, do you see that?&#34;  She said yes.  It raised up about 6 feet above ground. I said, &#34;Oh my God, it can see us, it can hear us....it is coming over here&#34;.  My stepsister screamed and fell to the bedroom floor.  I looked back at her and then back at the window.  I saw nothing in the yard, but then this soft whitish glowball crept up from the window below to show itself right in front of me in the window.  I looked into it trying to fixate on something concrete but could not..it was like looking into an endless thing.  Next, I felt this temendous feeling of joy, euphoria of love...nothing I have ever experience in this life.  Then, a butterfly fluttering in my chest.  I became uncertain and then I felt three thumps in my chest.  Each stronger than the one before.  I decided then to say &#34;hi&#34; and wave to it.  It ripped out of my body making me feel like it took something from me. The glowball flew across the street over a house.  My senses for the next few weeks were heightened.  I have not slept well since this happened.  I have had a glowball light enter my dreams only a few times during the course of the last 31 years.  On 10/3/04 it happened and I was slightly asleep, more awake than not.  3:00 am, and it came in a small dream.  My body levitated up to it, I stopped breathing for 10 seconds and returned to my body.  I saw a light when my eyes were closed in the dark, like I had been looking at a light for awhile.  There is more, but I have to go now.  Please have a UFO expert contact me.  Thank you,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I remember the date clearly as I told myself I would never forget. I have told this story to quite a few friends over the years, but have never made an official report. I have always been afraid of the attention this story might arouse, and of ridicule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 19 years old. I was in my front yard in Jacksonville Beach, Fla. looking north. About 5 miles north of where I lived is Mayport Naval Station. I saw a very small red object in the sky that seemed to stay in one position for a long time. Then it would move slowly to another position and stay awhile. I went inside and told my Father about this light. It was too far away to determine what is was. I went back out and watched this light again. It started moving slowly eastward toward the Atlantic Ocean which was only a mile from my house. I went inside and told my Father I was driving down to the beach to see if I could get a better look at this object. I drove down to the beach and parked in a parking lot beside a Holiday Inn in our town. This is right up to the seawall. I looked to the north and believed I spotted the object out over the ocean to the Northeast. But it was tiny, and I could make out no detail at all. I watched this object for maybe 10 minutes. But I could see no detail, and grew tired of watching it. I was standing on the seawall. I turned south to walk back to my car, when I saw a large orange football shaped object coming down our beach. It looked like glowing steel in a furnace. It glowed. It also had a halo or a fog around it that was also orange. It did not appear to be even 200 feet in the air, and was moving slowly northward toward me. We had a pier in our town that was about 1 mile south of my location. This object was closer, because I could see its reflection in the water between me and the pier. There was a car driving up the beach. The object appeared to be almost directly over it. But the car was actually approaching me faster than the object. I would estimate this object was 60 feet long. It appeared about the size of a streetlight maybe 75 feet away. As this object moved slowly toward me, I began to be a little afraid. This was late at night near Midnight, and there were not a lot of people out. There is a stairway on the seawall down to the beach itself. I started to go! down in there, when I saw a man standing in front of the Holiday Inn smoking a cigarette. There was a railing on the seawall. He was leaning against it and looking eastward out at the ocean. He did not seem to be aware of this object that now only appeared to be 3 or 4 blocks south of me. I ran over to the man and said, &#34;Look at that!&#34; pointing. He looked up and said, &#34;Wow, what is that?&#34; I said, &#34;I don&#39;t know, but I think its one of those UFO&#39;s!&#34; The object had stopped now and seemed to just sit still. At times it seemed to glow slightly brighter and then dim. We both just stared. Then the object seemed to flatten out into a long narrow rectangle. Maybe like a cereal box on edge. Even at this shape it seemed to glow brighter and then dim slightly. It stayed like this for maybe 1 minute. Then, it shot eastward at the most amazing speed I have ever seen. It moved so fast that it appeared to stretch like taffy and then turn into a tiny orange ball that shot over the horizon to the east over the ocean. It left a long orange vapor trail that took several minutes to fade away. The man asked, &#34;Do you think that was a rocket?&#34; I said, &#34;No, I&#39;ve seen rockets before, and they don&#39;t move like that&#34; (You could see rockets go up from Cape Kennedy on clear days where I lived. I have seen numerous Apollo launchings and even the Space Shuttle years later). The man asked me if I was going to tell anybody. I said I didn&#39;t know who to tell. We talked for a minute. He told me his name but I can&#39;t remember. I do remember he told me he was from Detroit, Michigan and was down for vacation. I left and drove home. I tried to tell my Father about it when I got home, but I woke him from sleeping, and I don&#39;t think he was quite awake. I told some co-workers the next day, who laughed at me. After that, I didn&#39;t tell anyone for a year or two. But after that, I would tell some friends. I still tell people sometimes, but I have always feared people would think I&#39;m lying or some kind of looney.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just to let you know. I am very familiar with military aircraft. My Father worked for the military as an Aircraft Instumentation Calibrations Technician. I lived by air bases most of my young life, and have seen many odd military vehicles. But I have never seen anything like this object. It was very close. It was not a rocket, plane, helicopter, balloon or whatever. I don&#39;t know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was evening and dark but not too late – I would venture to guess it was bet. 6:30 and 7:30pm.  We saw something that astonished us in the night sky.  Looking NW we saw a huge vessel that was not very high in the sky, over the field in the back of our house.  We lived on a court and there was a 3 or 4 acre field behind our house.  The UFO was about 500 feet up, moving very slowly toward the SE, noiselessly.  I have a very good picture in my mind of it – it largely resembled the typical UFO spacecraft, just like the “Jupiter Two” from the “Lost in Space” series.  On the bottom of the craft were large, lit panels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all remarked upon this – how amazing it was to see.  We knew instantly that what we were seeing was otherworldly.  It was so close, so large, and moving without sound.  After it departed, at a constant but slow speed, I don’t know why we didn’t just all go back inside and call the police.  I do remember that we went inside to tell my father what we had seen (he was home babysitting my little brother), but we then just proceeded to go on to church.  We all compared notes in the car ride to church, “Yep, it looked just like the Jupiter Two” we agreed.  At church we asked folks if they had seen it – only one or two people said they had heard there was some kind of large weather balloon in the area that was being tested.  This was no weather balloon.  It was directly over the field in our backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw.  I’d love to see it again sometime.  Hopefully I’ll have the presence of mind to videotape next time!  (I do not know the exact date of this event.  I thought the year had to be ’73 or ’74.  I just chose this date because I saw some other Baltimore entries.  Specifically we lived in the suburb of Pikesville, MD.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

At the crest of the hill where the cemetary begins we stopped the car, and two of us got out to look at a disc shaped with a dome (typical UFO) object hovering noiselessly over the cemetary.  The object had several porthole windows and the inside had a yellowish light which was spinning from left to right.  I bit my lip to focus on that specifically.  The object was about 300 ft. in the air and about 500 ft. away from us and dead silent.  Cars were whizzing by but they couldn&#39;t see is because is was dusk and looking ESEast made it hard to detect anything.We watched for 5 or 6 minutes and then it started to move towards the bay and outer harbor area, made a loop in the distance and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness and found him to be quite credible.  He reports that he telephoned the Baltimore Police shortly after the sighting, and the female officer he spoke with reported that their department has received approximately 200 calls about the incident.  The wife of the witness also saw the object, and may submit a second report.  Also, the third witness, who now lives in California, may submit a report, as well.  PD))<n>

It was October 21, 1973 at 2:30 in the afternoon.  I was 14 than and working on by bike behind the house when I heard a whinning high pitch sound that caught my attention.  Leaving on a few miles from the local grocery store and the fan fan on top of their roof occasaionally make this sound also.  Realizing that it wasn&#39;t coming from the direction of the grocery store I walked out from behind the house and looked skyward.  There it was hoovering in the sky in a Northwest direction.  It was about 3 miles away. After spotting this object I ran in the house going through the kitchen yelling flying saucer.  I noticed the time on the clock that was hanging on hte wall above the kitchen sink.  I ran arounf the dinning room table to my mother&#39;s china closet and I grabed my mother&#39;s bincoluar&#39;s and ran back outside to get a better view.  With the bincoular&#39;s up to my eyes I could see that it was saucer shape with a dome on top and a dome underneath  slightly smaller than what was on top.  I could also see port holes going around the saucer just below the top dome.  It was silver metalliac in color and hoovering in the sky.   At that moment I could feel the air stand up on my body.  I think because I got such a good view of this object and knowing it wasn&#39;t of this earth.  As I stood there watching this saucer it started moving away from me heading North West.<n>

Back in that day they didn’t have computers, the Internet, or any other way that we were aware of to report such things as this. In order to understand the event it is necessary for me to describe the circumstances. At this time in that area jobs were difficult to come by and those that were available barley paid enough to live on. We lived on a farm and grew our own vegetables and hunted and fished in order to survive. My friends and myself would sometimes supplement our meat supply by hunting rabbits on the roads outside of town at night. It’s not as dangerous as it sounds because as this was mostly large farms at the time the houses were two to three miles apart in places so there was little if any chance of hitting anyone or anything with a small 22 cal. rifle. I had become an expert marksman and it was not uncommon for me to make shots of 150 to 200 yards. Hunger makes you a good shot I guess.  I can approximate the year because I was 16 at the time, The month, November, coincides with the beginning of rabbit season, about the 15th. Obviously we weren’t all that concerned about the law as it was illegal to hunt from a car but if you took rabbits outside of season for consumption you ran the risk of contracting what we called rabbit fever. I estimated the time to be around 2300 hrs. because we didn’t go out any earlier to lower the risk of running across the police, and we had just started. OK, all of that being said, here is the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night in question myself, and two friends, were cruising around in my car with the top down. It’s cold in November but the top of the windshield made a perfect shooter’s ledge to steady the rifle.  The older of the two, a fellow about 25 years old and a Viet Nam vet, was driving. He was a large individual and was pretty much scared of nothing. My other friend, the same age as me, was in the back seat, and I was in the front passenger seat. We had driven a mile or two East of town and had just turned South onto a long straight road. I don’t remember the name but could probably locate it on a map. After traveling about a block or two I saw a rabbit about 200 yards in front of us. I told the driver and he slowly proceeded to with about 150 yards and shut off the engine so the vibration would not throw off my shot. I took my position, acquired the animal in my scope, accounted for bullet drop and windage, held my breath, and squeezed the trigger. The rabbit dropped immediately. A perfect shot. As I put the rifle back between the seats the driver got out of the car, to relieve himself I think. My friend in the back wanted out too so I had to get out being it was a two door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were facing South and to our right was a field approximately 400 to 500 yards wide and I would guess about ¼ of a mile long. At the West edge of that was a line of trees ranging from about 75 feet high to 50 feet high that ran the entire length of the field. I was facing East and my friend from the back was facing West. I heard him say “look” and as I turned around I saw this orange ball floating just above the tree line. I would estimate it to have been approximately 75 to 100 feet in diameter. At this point I’m not scared, just interested. I came around to the driver’s side and just leaned on the trunk and watched. The ball was moving very slowly from South to North just above the tree line. I followed the tree line exactly, up and down as it continued. The object made no sound of any kind. It was completely silent. At this time my younger friend and myself didn’t know what a UFO even was. The object continued to glide along the tree tops until it was straight across from us at which point I got my rifle from the front seat and pointed it towards the object. I wasn’t going to shoot at it I just wanted to look through the scope to see if I could see any better. At that point the object began to change from orange to a bright yellow. The light it gave off was almost like the sun as best as I can describe it. My friend that was driving grabbed the rifle out of my hands, threw it in the car, got in and tried to start it but for whatever reason it wouldn’t start. I doubt it had anything to do with the UFO, it was just junk. Within a few seconds the object seemed to shrink and disappear towards the Northwest. Looking back I doubt that it shrank but more probably just moved away so quickly it appeared that way. I estimate that this whole event occurred over a period of about 20 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend was still trying to get the car started and I noticed that he seemed to be terrified. Not scared, terrified. He was visibly shaking and I think he might have been crying. It was a long tome age. I found this strange as he had seen combat in Viet Nam and would fight anybody at the drop of a hat. When the car finally did start, he put it in reverse and I had to jump over the door to get in because he wasn’t waiting. He wouldn’t even pull up so I could get my rabbit. We headed back to town at well in excess of 80 mils per hour and I was more afraid of his driving than I was of the UFO. I finally got him to pull over and let me drive. I put up the top, turned on the heater, and headed back to town. After he calmed down he began to explain to us about UFOs and having seen them before. I got the feeling that there was more that he wasn’t telling but he didn’t seem to want to talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went and found my step-father, who was town marshal at the time, and started to relay to him what we had seen. At first he thought we had been drinking (we hadn’t) or we were joking. After talking to us for awhile he decided we were serious and sober so he checked with the airport in Indianapolis to see if there any planes, helicopters, ect., in the area and was told that there were not and that nothing had shown up on the radar. He also relayed our report to the Rush County Sheriff’s Dept. Of course nothing ever came of any of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me end by answering the skeptics. I spent a great deal of my time as a youth outdoors in the woods at night, coon hunting, trapping, ect. I have seen ball lightening, it wasn’t that. There are no swamps anywhere near that area. There were no power lines overhead. You cannot see the airport search lights from there. I never saw anything like that before that time or since. Later in life I move to Ohio and became a police officer where I served for 20 years and worked a lot of midnight shifts. I spent a lot of time looking but never saw anything like that again. To this day I don’t know what to make of it but there it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I minute later he knocked on my door and told me to come outside he wanted to show me something.  We want out and he pointed to the sky.  I looked up and there were 5 or 6 objects moving across the sky very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no way to calculate the distance but they looked like stars except they were moving slowly in single file across the sky.  We didn&#39;t really think UFO at the time, we just kind of wondered what they were. We said goodnight and went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day at work (we both worked at the same company) I picked up the NY Daily News the read about the game.  There on the back page taking up half the page was an article with numerous reports of UFO&#39;s, from the US to Russia. I believe the Russians were reported as sending up jets to intercept. Another was the Governor of I think Ohio reporting a UFO flying over the roof of his car as he and his wife were driving down a highway.  If I was to see the same thing today I would probably think they were satellites and maybe they were.  But I found it very unusual that a major publication would have a story so prominently displayed on it&#39;s back cover the day after we witnessed this event. I don&#39;t really believe in people from other worlds visiting us, only in the possibility.    My friend still feels that they came to watch the game.  I decided to post this after reading the last post of a sighting on the same day as mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I was 7 at the time and was interested in space and any kind of airplane. I was actually mad that I had to leave the house that night because of a report that I saw that was coming on NBC Nightly News with John Chancellor that I wanted to see. The report was on the flap in Mississippi at the same time. Subsequently, we found the haunted house and drove by, not stopping to go in, when we turned around to go home and saw a huge bluish-green oval in the sky. People in their cars were looking up and pointing to it. We followed in the general direction of the craft and turned into a neighborhood off Archdale Dr. near Park Rd Park. As we approached a group of trees in a front yard the object seemed to turn and as we cleared the trees the object had vanished. From that point on I have studied the subject intensely. I currently work at CDI Airport and am familiar with all sorts of aircraft. It was no aircraft, civilian or military, that I have seen then or since. It wasn&#39;t a weather balloon, temperature inversion, searchlight, swamp gas, Venus or a &#34;mass hallucination&#34; (my favorite BS explanation).    Half of the city reported it that night and I am absolutely certain of what it was that we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>

This craft was bigger around than the houses and the bottom was lit up, either one big light or a whole lot of lights to light the whole bottom up.  then i remember running down my yard and following about 5 or 6 of them to this field we called Sandy Hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had a very long skinny backyard and at the bottom we could access this trail that went through the woods and at one end it ended up at the stores at the top of Freeway Rd. and at the other end of the trail was this huge giant sand field we called Sandy Hill.  These objects were headed toward sandy hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this experience i remember my mother saying that she was awake and floating overtop her bed, my dad said it was probably some type of spiritual dream, but she insisted it was not a dream and she was definitely awake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember my brother coming into my room, terrified cause he had all these little men all around his bed.  I remember our television could not get a picture at all and my dad and his friend got on the roof to check our antennea and it had been completely broken off by something and could not be used anymore so they took it down and it layed in our backyard for quite some time and we use the rabbit ears antennea that you use to put ontop of the television.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember when i would get near the t.v. or touch it the picture would completely get static and you could not see the picture, i would play around and touch the t.v. quite a bit and my parents would make comments.  I remember for some reason that i started waking up with these splitting headaches that would make me throwup every morning for quite a while.  I regretted waking up in the morning cause i didn&#39;t want the headache.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember something happened to my right shin bone.  What? I just remember i use to roll my sock down and roll my pant leg up so nothing would touch this spot on my leg.  This spot was extremely sore, like down to the bone, but no bruise or mark at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember for some reason this huge thing was really scary and this little thing was scary too but not as scary as the big one. I remember laying on my right side, and remember a needle thing or something. To this day i still don&#39;t know what the big and little things were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the early 90&#39;s i called my brother and asked him if he remembered the little men and he didn&#39;t but he does believe in ufo&#39;s and has seen them throughout his life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember a dream i had in the 90&#39;s that had to do with my leg.  I was laying on an operating table, lifted my head up and seen my leg open in the exact spot where it was sore when i was a kid, and i seen these so called doctors or something around me, mainly seeing eyes around me.  I remember thinking i should get my leg checked.  Never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have many, many dreams of ufo&#39;s and have seen objects while definitely awake.  I find this subject the most fascinating of all time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also in the early 90&#39;s i began investigating my dreams and memories and went to the local library here in cumberland, i asked if they could find out if there were any ufo sighting in balto.<n> <n><n> <n><n> in the early to mid 70&#39;s and i ended up getting articles from The Baltimore Sun and The News American dated October 18,1973 about ufo sightings in baltimore and surrounding counties.  This confirmed my ufo sighting for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/17/73 23:30|Montgomery|AL|Light|15 minutes|Lights appear out of the woods and chase vehicle.|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61173.html|15|ndxe197310| Lights appear out of the woods and chase vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing about something that happened when I was 19 years old.   It occurred on Wednesday, October 17, 1973, on the outskirts of Montgomery, Alabama.    I have always wanted to report it, but I never realized there was a National Reporting Center until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was 19 I kept a diary and I wrote about this incident in my diary.  But even if I hadn’t written about it at that time, the occurrence and the terror we felt, will always be clear in my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my account of what happened:<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 11:30 p.m. on Oct 17 1973.  My boyfriend (who was a sergeant in the air force) and I (a college student and worked full time) had driven out to the country.  We wanted to find a quiet, romantic place to park and spend some time alone together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went to an area where some new roads had been cut through the woods.  An area that was being prepared to build new homes, but no homes had been started to be built yet. Only the roads had been cleared.  The woods around the roads were still thick with trees and undergrowth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove a good distance down the first new road until we came to a small cul-de-sac road that was cut back deep into the wooded area.  We drove to the end of the cul-de-sac and parked the car, facing up hill to the main road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat and talked for a while before we noticed a bright light moving slowly across the tops of the trees in the distance...it was across the main road a distance away.  We both watched this light for approximately ten minutes.  At first we thought it was a helicopter because it would move slowly across the trees and then stop in mid air, hover for a minute then continue slowly down the tree line. Once or twice it disappeared down behind the trees but it would reappear a few seconds later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We rolled our windows down to see if we could hear the whirring of helicopter blades - but there was no sound at all.   Total quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept speculating what it could be as we were perplexed that it made no sound.   It finally moved on out of our vision so we shrugged our shoulders and changed the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not sure how much time passed...maybe 5 minutes but not more than 15 minutes when a bright light, like a huge spot light, flashed across our vehicle.  It didn’t stop and shine on the vehicle, it only flashed across our vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both jumped and said, &#34;What was THAT?&#34;  My heart started pounding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked all around us and didn’t see anything that would have caused a bright light like that to flash on the car.  We looked at each other, both of us frightened, said not a word but my boyfriend cranked up the car to get out of there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we cranked the car, a bright light - about the size of a basket ball - came floating out of the woods - about 5 to 6 feet off the ground - quickly towards our car. I say floating because it wasn’t bobbing up and down like it would if someone had a big spot light and was running with it....it wasn’t making any sound at all so it wasn’t a motorized vehicle, no bicycle could come through those thick woods like this light was...it was floating out of the woods at a very fast speed directly towards the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sped up the hill to turn off of the cul-de-sac onto the main road that lead out of that area.  As we approached the main road, a second light appeared  from the other side of the cul-de-sac and  began pursuit of our car at an even faster rate of speed.   My boyfriend floored the accelerator as we turned onto the main road.    The two lights did not follow the road behind us…..they took a short cut across the woods  between the cul-de-sac and the main road …. I mean straight through those thick woods…never slowed down, never veered or bobbed around….never making a sound…just floated straight across and through the heavy woods and out onto the main road  directly behind our vehicle.     I was panic stricken and screaming to go faster, go faster.     The lights stayed right behind us and my boyfriend was driving as fast as he could on that back country road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached the exit out of that area onto the county road where there was other traffic, the lights vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this incident, all we saw were the lights….we could see nothing of what was behind them.   We heard not a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The few people I told about this story,  said it was quite interesting but had the “weirdo liar“ looks on their faces.   But I know what happened and my boyfriend knew what happened and there was no explanation to what happened to us.<n>
10/17/73 21:30|Warner Robins|GA|Cigar|unknown|Two UFO's sighted by thousands in Warner Robins, Georgia in 1973.|7/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/110/S110892.html|16|ndxe197310| Two UFO&#39;s sighted by thousands in Warner Robins, Georgia in 1973<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on Fairgrounds Road and never heard about this until today when I came across it on the internet.  My family and I have been here since 1995.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came to your website to see if it was listed and did not see it.  The date was October 17, 1973.  It is listed in Brown&#39;s Guide on this page, and this is the article:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.brownsguides.com/blog/weird-georgia-warner-robins-ufos-1973/<n> <n><n> <n><n> First hundreds of observers, largely law enforcement personnel, were treated to intriguing lights which maneuvered across the sky, then two unidentifiable objects impacted spectacularly with the ground, and that was followed by a diving craft which drove two military policemen off the road.  It was only later that the really weird stuff started to happen as reports of aliens were received from across the state.  It was autumn, 1973, and the most intense wave of UFO sightings in American history had begun in Georgia.  The massive UFO “flap” reached Warner Robins on the night of October 17 when two substantial UFO reports were received.  The two incidents were separate, but occurred within thirty minutes and one mile of each other.  At nine p.m.  Lawrence Smith, Peggy Stepp, and her daughter Kathy spotted a large, cigar shaped object about 100 feet above the ground. They followed it down Dunbar and Bateman roads and when they got closer, “I was petrified,” Smith said, for suddenly “! there were two of them. And then they started getting close, and we started getting scared.” The UFOs were heard to emit humming sounds. Stepp began to scream and Smith raced toward a more inhabited area. The craft was ‘about the size of a house,” he said, and “had red, green, and blue lights.” “The UFOs began to close in,” Stepp said, and then, “my God, there was one right behind us. My daughter screamed hysterically, and the thing stopped right above us and put this bright light on the car.” “It was so bright,” Smith added. “I thought it was going to blind me. I have never seen a light like that.” The two adults agreed that the multi-colored lights grew in intensity as the airship approached. “It just hovered there like a helicopter making the humming noise,” Smith said, “and then, it was gone in a flash.” Smith called the Houston County Sheriff’s Department to report the incident at 9:30. Meanwhile, Corporal Bobby Fisher was dispatched to investigate a UFO sighting near ! Elberta and Dunbar roads. He reached the old Houston County Fa! irground s, an elevated area with a good view of the surrounding countryside, at 9:57, and apparently saw the same object reported by Smith and Stepp, hovering above the trees. ”It approached a clear field,” he reported, “and then took off in a westerly direction. It was huge with red, blue, and green lights. I chased it when it zoomed over me. It made a humming noise, sort of like electricity going through a wire.” Fisher, who described his UFO as being “big as a building,” bravely pursued the craft and overtook it on Dunbar Road a mile east of Houston Lake Road. “It stopped there right over me, and I got out of the car,” he continued. “I took my flashlight and pointed it at the thing. Hell, it was only about 100 feet above me. I couldn’t see anything for the bright light. I think I got some type of reflection off of it when I pointed my flashlight at it. That’s how close it was. I thought that damn thing was going to land right there in that field. “I stayed on the radio trying to ! get someone else out there. I didn’t want anyone to think I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO began moving slowly, then raced away “extremely fast.” “If that thing would have landed,” Fisher declared, “I think I would have walked over to it.” Lawrence Smith said that his UFO “sounds exactly the same as the one the deputy saw.” Jim Cosey, executive editor of the Warner Robins Daily Sun, believed that Smith, Stepp, and Fisher “saw something. They sounded sincere and nearly hysterical on the phone.” Cosey rousted three reporters out of bed and joined them on a nocturnal tour around the city that produced no aerial anomalies. Around the time of these incidents, tens of thousands of central Georgia residents reported UFOs that were easily explained. Two weather balloons were launched by the National Weather Service from Texas and Alabama. Measuring 150 feet in diameter, the balloons drifted over at 55,000 feet, high enough to reflect sunlight long after the sun had set. At Eglin Air Force Base in Florida two rockets were launched which released clouds of glowing red, green, and yellow gases at an altitude of six miles. These sightings were spectacular, but they were not UFOs, nor did they explain the reports filed by Smith, Stepp, and Fisher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And on this page: http://www.brownsguides.com/blog/weird-georgia-alien-invasion-the-ufos-of-1973-part-10-gas-bags-and-gaseous/  Most of the residents of Warner Robins are either military personnel or civilian workers at Robins Air Force Base, which is central Georgia’s largest employer, and they habitually watch the skies. Thousands of people crowded the streets on October 17, staring skyward at the spectacle, and the Warner Robins Police Department logged over 400 calls reporting UFOs. All but perhaps two sightings were explained by the weather balloons, but those were substantial reports from four persons, including a law enforcement officer, who chased and were chased by mammoth aircraft. Also, for the record, those sightings occurred an hour after the weather balloons had cleared the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Every 60 days our Army Unit would spend 30 days at Camp May near the Chech border. Tho we would run jeep patrols everyday, one patrol would stay the night on the border and watch the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My group who I was in charge, it was our turn to stay the night on the border. Tho it was cloudy, there were breaks in the clouds that the moon could make it easy to see. I went outside to check the guard that was on rear duty of our hut. As the guard and I were talking all of a sudden a green glowing round ball came out of the clouds and making no noise at all. We were very stunned at first at what we saw. It just glowed off and on and not making any sound at all. It didn&#39;t last long, but at the Chezch border and Germany thats something you wouldn&#39;t expect to see. We both went inside the shack to check with the radar guys to see if they picked anything up BUT of course not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t report it or say anything about it, because who would believe us..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

F-4 Phantom Scrambled.|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104084.html|18|ndxe197310| 3 Saucer shaped UFO&#39;s over Naval Air Station.  F-4 Phantom Scrambled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred at Naval Air Station Memphis in Millington, TN, where I was stationed at the time as a young Marine.  The sighting happened at dusk sometime in mid- September  of 1973.  100 (or more) of us were ordered to change barracks from one barracks building to another.  While walking with my personal gear accompanied by another Marine, I heard someone say, &#34;Look up!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up, I saw a saucer-shaped craft hovering several hundred feet above me.  Although the craft was hovering, it made small darting movements left/right and up/down.  These occasional sporadic movements were so abrupt that it was obvious the anything inside the craft would be tossed around like a rag doll.  Brilliant rotating lights were emitted from the underside of the craft.  The lights splashed in brilliant colors, blue, red, white. etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone else yelled, “Look over there!  There are more of them!.”  I quickly scanned the horizon and saw what looked like 2 identical saucer shaped craft downrange from the craft we had been watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, all of us that were moving gear stopped, set our gear down and simply watched the spectacle unfold.  Many comments were made by many different Marines that these craft were obviously not of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being on a Naval Air Station, a single F-4 Phantom jet was scrambled.   We watched the fighter take off and make a slow turn to the right toward the closest craft with his afterburner glowing.  Marines everywhere were saying things to the effect of “I wonder what will happen now!” or “Man, I’d hate to be that pilot.”  There was a great dread in the air that it seemed that we could all “feel.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the fighter began to approach the closer craft, the craft moved at unbelievable speed and began hovering again almost instantaneously beside the other 2 saucers that were waiting downrange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Phantom jet  rolled to the left and made a high G turn toward the (now) 3 saucer shaped craft hovering some distance away.  As soon as the F-4 started to close on the 3 hovering craft, all 3 UFO’s shot off at great speed and were completely out of sight within 2-3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the craft disappeared, I saw the F-4 Phantom switch off the afterburner and start a slow turn back toward base.  This whole event took perhaps 15 to 20 minutes but it seemed much longer.<n>

The men were playing tag football.  I was sitting in a lawn chair facing due south.  The game had not started and the men were warming up for the game, when I saw what I thought was an airplane flying from east to west in the night sky.  As my eyes tracked it, it suddenly came to a standstill.  I mentioned this to the lady sitting next to me.  She said she had binoculars in her car. She retrieved them, and handed them to me.  When I looked at the object through the binoculars, and discovered it was not just one light, but a string of lights in a horizontal position.  I did not attempt to count the number of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I  and others watched, the object appeared to began turning on its side gradually.  It changed, bit by bit, from a straight string of lights to an oval, and then ultimately to an full circle of lights.  Other people became interested and also watched this phenomenom.  It turned back into a horizontal string of lights, and then moved vertically.  I could see what appeared to be after-flares coming from each light.  The object remained there for approximately 45 minutes moving this way and that, and then suddenly ascended within a matter of a few seconds upward and to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have prepared a rudimentary illustration with Adobe Photoshop to show how this object revolved, and yet remained in a stationary position over Houston.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made no report of this at that time.  There was a lot of debunking going on regarding UFOs and I did not care to get involved.  I know what we saw.  Only in the past year did I send a pencil sketch to MUFON.  I received no reply from them.  It has been many years since I watched this UFO in the night sky, but it still stands out clearly as if I had just seen it moments ago.  Other than my husband, I have no recollection of anyone else&#39;s name who had been a witness to this event so long ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was 12 and lived in the small Tn. town of Englewood. I had been riding a motorcycle most of the day, just following a path on my Grandparents small farm. I was tired and went in to lay down for a little bit before supper. I don&#39;t know if I fell asleep or not? I don&#39;t think I did. I opened my eyes and looked out the window. There hovering above the trees was what I only knew of as a flying saucer. The only way I knew what it was, was from what I had seen on buggs and roadrunner cartoons. By the way we only got 2 tv channels back then. I jumped up and went to the window. Then I went tearing out of the house to see it, while screaming for my Grandmother to come look. I still remember my exact words(Grandma! Grandma! you got to come see this), I ran out from under the trees to get a better look. It was just hovering there at the tree tops not making a sound. Then just as if someone was standing right by my side I heard a voice say to me (you are not supposed to see this). I never felt so much fear in my young life. Then as my Grandma exited the house and was coming toward me it just raised up about 50 feet and shot off like a bullet. I will never forget telling her that I knew she would not beleive me. But to my suprise she said she did, because she had herself several years before that. This has haunted me for years and changed my life forever. I could no longer beleive in the biblical things my Grandmother had always taught me. At age 25 I tried hypno therapy. I went 8 times but could never get pasted what I could remember already. The guy said it was too tramatic for me to remember. But he learned me some relaxation techniques. I later learned I had been abducted many times as a child and lots of things came together for me. I just wanted to share this and say that no matter what anybody might say about UFO&#39;s they are real and so are the grays. Thanks for leting me get this out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Macadam Road maybe a couple hundred feet west of Ridge Road, Chazy, NY. Exact date may be a week sooner or later, not too sure of that but it was early samll game hunting season then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 of us were bird hunting in the area and it was getting dark fast. Done, and heading home, we stopped just to watch flocks of ducks landing in the (sanctuary) ponds to the south/south west of our position on the road. Overcast, maybe 2,500 feet with a steady wind from west as I remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During some of the joking and talking, I saw bright magenta (red) light descend straight down, unaffected by wind and with no smoking trail or sound, to the ground by the pond in front of the tree line slightly to the west of where we were looking and maybe 1/4 mile away, a good guess. It was a brilliant light with kind of a haze surrounding it. Size is hard to say...maybe from basketball to large beach ball in size. As it got closer to the ground it actually slowed down and the light turned off. I assume it was on the ground in tall grasses etc. That is when I mentioned it to the others because they were looking back in my direction as I recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe 5 minutes went by, after swapping a few more stories, I saw the light turn on again and pointed at it...this time all 3 of us saw it ascend straight up, very fast, no sound, no smoke, no wings, no rotor blades, nothing but brilliant pure silent magenta light accelerating into the clouds, seemingly immune to the effects of the wind. Now that is what got my curiosity going, you know, something coming down and soft landing then, later, taking off at an incredible speed all with no sound and in a wooded/marshy area.

It had flashing white lights, was silent and after moving back and forth over the trees and feild shot off at a vertical angle at an  unbelieveable speed.

As I came out of the main terminal lobby about 12:40 am I was with another gentleman to have a smoke. We looked north and saw about a dozen moving objects that looked liked stars in size, but were a distance off toward the north over what we knew was a military base, but as we watched these objects simply did what no flying object we have could do. They would fly at great speeds; stop on a dime and at great speeds would make right angle turns that should smash any inhabitants like a bug from the inertia of such a turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The man I was with was some flight specialist and was able to determine speeds roughly and distance etc, because he was simply trained in such things - I thought maybe he was a pilot himself. But he told me quite frankly that the objects have to be traveling several thousand miles per hour in the “bursts” of speed. They would all suddenly fly into one place as to meet, then fly apart in different direction and stop on a dime - staying there for a short time. Some would fly then other directions and take those right turns without slowing or stopping. You just can’t watch that kind of thing and think that we have any aircraft whatsoever that has that kind of ability. They did seem to glimmer from a bright whitish to other colors, but our distance from them it was hard to distinguish it and then - after near 10 - 12 minutes of watching this “dance in the sky” - they all flew off it different directions like a 4th of July exploding flare shot. And, no - it was no firework show either. Even if it were fireworks - even that is NOT allowed over the military base that we were watching this happen over. I had never known anyone to have ever reported this before now. The thing is - that the very next night on another grave yard shift at about closer to 2 am I saw the very same thing. This time about 5 people were standing outside watching it and I had told them I had seen it the night before as well - just didn’t know what it was, but said - nothing can fly like those things that we have - so it’s something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having had a friend who used to work with NASA I had discussed with him my theory that these are not inter planetary, but rather inter-dimensional and the discussion turned into the color changing issue as they change and right when they disappear from site is at the ultra-violet or infra-red spectrum so the idea of inter-dimensional seemed to fit with that scenario and the idea of the speeds and right turns they could make without getting hurt would indicate this same idea - that, inter dimensionally they could pull this off. So, that’s my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It then started to come toward me and I then thought it was a plane.  I was about to walk into the house and everything changed.  I did not look up but all around was a red light and it was blinking red and bright red in a perfect circle about 40 feet across would be my best guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then held my hand out so see this light light my hands and that&#39;s when I looked up.  It was a sphere and it had low humming sound.  At that time I was not afraid so kept watching it then made a different sound and started to lower just above my grand mother home and a yellow light came on under it and started to move close to me that scared so I ran under the branches of the tree in our front yard.  The light stopped moving so I ran to the front door while still watching this object.  I then open the door taking my eyes off for just a second to tell my mom to look at this when looked back it was gone never saw it again.<n>
10/12/73 19:00|Birmingham (just south of)|AL|Disk|10-15 minutes|Glowing Green UFO seen by myself (mom) and my 4 children very low over our car on a Friday night in Alabama in 1973.|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05966.html|25|ndxe197310| Glowing Green UFO seen by myself (mom) and my 4 children very low over our car on a Friday night in Alabama in 1973.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was listening to Mr. Davenport on Jeff Rense&#39;s show tonight, (3/19/99) and heard him say that he does want &#34;old&#34; UFO sighting reports to add to the data banks.  I thought of calling in to the show, but decided to write it down instead.  I thank you for this opportunity to tell what my children and I saw over 25 years ago. On October 12, 1973, our family consisting of me, my husband, our sons aged 14, 13 and 9 and our daughter aged 7, were nearing the end of our 4 year residence in Birmingham, Alabama.  We were packing for a move to Scottsdale, Arizona, and on that day my husband was away on a trip to Arizona to set up details of the move.  It was Homecoming for my oldest son&#39;s highschool and he and his next younger brother wanted to go to the football game.  Just after 7:00 pm I loaded all four kids into the LTD station wagon for the 2 mile drive to the stadium.  My daughter was in the front seat with me and the 3 boys were in the back. Our street was a long one-block cul de sac on the side of a hill.  When leaving the street you have to climb up a steep incline, south, to the main cross-street at the top.  The 2 streets form a &#34;T.&#34;  Across the intersection from our street was a heavily wooded area with no visible houses or lights. Our duplex was about halfway down the block on the east side of the street. Shortly after I pulled out of our driveway and headed up the hill, a huge, green-glowing hamburger lifted out of the trees across the intersection and slowly moved toward our car.  Because of its low altitude and the steepness of the hill, the sight seemed to fill up our whole windshield.  I called it a &#34;hamburger&#34; because that best describes the shape of the craft as I remember it.  It appeared to be a solid dark metal ship with a row of lights and/or windows around the middle. The whole UFO was surrounded by a luminescent green mist.  As it moved, some of the mist was left behind. As you can imagine, we were stunned and terrified.  Thankfully, I did not lose electrical or engine power in the car.  I turned left into the closest driveway, whipped that station wagon around as fast as I could, and headed for home, all the while screaming to the kids, &#34;Is it following us?!?&#34;  They were as hysterical as I was.  This thing was monstrously close. Within seconds I had pulled into our driveway and all of us got out of the car to look at the UFO.  It had risen a bit higher in the sky and changed direction from its original northerly path.  It was now slowly drifting to the southeast, leaving green mist in the sky as it went. There was NO sound. I ran to the duplex to the south of our building and pounded on the back door.  When the young woman tenant came to the door I excitedly told her to come out and see what we were witnessing.  Of course, by the time she came outside there was nothing left to see but the green mist.  My kids had been keeping it in sight and told me that it just suddenly disappeared. The mist stayed suspended in the sky for several minutes before dissipating. I do not know if there was anything of substance that might have fallen to the ground for collection.  I certainly saw nothing the next day in the daylight. I herded my children into our house and attempted to calm them (and myself) down.  I gave them all paper and pencils and instructed them to draw what they had seen.  (Those drawings were long ago destroyed, but I do remember that they were all remarkably similar.) I got out the phone book to try to find somebody to tell what we had seen.  Nobody. In 1973 I knew nothing about MUFON or any other UFO research entities. So, I called the nearest municipal police department in Vestavia Hills, Alabama.  (We did not live within the city limits of Birmingham.)  The polite, but obviously amused officer who answered the phone told me that he had had no other reports of odd things in the sky, and that what we had probably seen was &#34;an atmospheric gas bomb set off at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.&#34;  I did not buy that explanation then, and I don&#39;t buy it now.  I cannot imagine that such a thing would have obvious solidity and lights or windows. Within a couple of weeks we left Alabama.  Because I was so busy with the details of our move I did not have time to do any investigation of the wooded area out of which that thing rose. I was nearly 7 years old at the time of the Roswell crash and remember my mother telling me about it at the time.  My interest in UFOs began then, but there was always a bit of doubt in my mind.  That doubt was erased on the night of October 12, 1973.  I remember that the first thought that popped in my head when I saw it was, &#34;They really DO exist!&#34; Our children each reacted differently to the adventure.  My youngest son was so traumatized he will not talk about it to this day.  The other boys and our daughter don&#39;t mind UFO conversations at all.  My oldest son has been known to tell about the experience at the drop of a hat.  Our daughter was affected the most by the incident.  She had encounters with UFOs and/or ETs after that time, and may still be experiencing strange incidents to this day.  She has some conscious memories that are very disturbing. We had no &#34;lost time&#34; that night.  After we had calmed down a bit, I actually put everybody back in the car and took the boys to the game.  I don&#39;t know how I did it.  I told them to ask people in the stands if they had seen anything, but of course they didn&#39;t do it. sure they didn&#39;t do it.<n>

Two (2) saucer-shaped, glowing green objects and one (1) brilliantly glowing sphere gliding over the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father, mother, sister and I had just finished dinner. When my sister, who left the table first, went to the front part of the house, yelled suddenly &#34;Mom, Dad - look out over the lake.&#34;  When we heard that, we rose from the table and looked out the kitchen windows.  We observed two (2) saucer shaped objects over the boat landing area, which was located approximately one-quarter of a mile away.  They had a light green aura.  My sister and I ran out behind the house and up the hill to observe from a better vantage point.  When we turned back around to look at the objects, we noticed a third object over the water of the lake, which appeared to be approximately three hundred (300) to three hundred and fifty (350) yards away.  It&#39;s appearance was that of a sphere of approximately ten (10) yards in diameter, that was glowing from within with an intense, pure, bright white light which reflected off the water and tree tops.  The third craft moved slowly in a south-easterly direction at approximately five (5) miles per hour, crossing from the water onto the land and above the trees.  Meanwhile, our attention was recaptured by the two (2) saucer-shaped objects.  While my sister and I were observing the crafts and concentrating on them intently, I noticed that cloud-like formations appeared flanking the objects.  Both craft then seemed to move within the cloud-like formations.  One of the objects and it&#39;s accompanying cloud-like formation faded from sight over a period of approximately five to seven seconds.  The other cloud-like formation was at this point still visible.  Shortly after the first cloud disappeared, the remaining vessel emerged halfway from the cloud-like formation, as if to be playing &#39;peek-a-boo&#39;.  Then I suddenly felt a shiver throughout my entire body, and began wondering where the first craft had disappeared to, and if it were behind me.  I turned to look and there was nothing there.  That was when I realized that I was dealing with something that was beyond my experience. ! We both ran back down the hill and into the house.  When we looked back out the window, there was nothing there.  Though this event seems to be something of a dream, I do know that it really happened, and that it has made a large impact upon my life and the way that I look at things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was a young mom,  hubby was in the Air Force and we were at the AFB.. living in base housing.   He was gone, working,   it was a weekend night, I was feeling sorry for myself, (was summer  or spring, warm anyway)  so I went outside well after the children were asleep  lay back on a lounge on the patio .. just reflecting on my life...  when  there it was ...  did not appear to move very quickly,  I watched it about 10 minutes... even had time to run to neighbors to see if I could find anyone else to look.. but no ....  went directly overhead... could see it clearly, although I don&#39;t know why..  Was not a moon that I remember....  and I knew it was nothing from the base.  Couldn&#39;t understand why the base was not responding .. called the air police to see ifanyone else reported anything...  No one had....   And was told   not to worry, it was probably just my imagination.  However I know what I saw.  Just would like to think that someone else may at some time, have seen something similar ... but it doesn&#39;t appear so ..

The date is based on a similar report I read about in Kevin Randle&#39;s _The UFO Casebook_(p. 141). My mother, grandmother, and I had stopped for dinner in El Centro, CA, and were westbound on I-8 when we observed a very bright, orange light to the north. Soon, the object began to emit a cloud of smoke or vapor, which was greyish- white. The light &#34;blinked out&#34; and then came back on several times during the sighting (I don&#39;t remember exactly how many times), leaving the cloud hanging. The light was stationary (yet it seemed to &#34;move with us&#34; as we travelled down the freeway) and was approx. 20 degrees above the horizon. My mother and grandmother were panicking, I was was very scared at one point and hiding my eyes; it was then that I heard them exclaiming that several smaller lights were emerging from the light, flew around it, then returned to it. Unfortunately, I myself did not witness this.  Finally, the light went out permanently and the cloud dissipated. One strange feature of this event was that our car was being tailgated by a semi during the duration of the sighting, rather relentlessly (I remember we were in the slow lane the whole time, but don&#39;t recall if my grandmother, who was driving, tried to &#34;shake&#34; the tailgater at any point by changing lanes). I&#39;m posting this primarily to find out if anyone else was a witness to this, even though it was long ago.<n>

I asked my wife to go in the house and get my binoculars while I kept the object in sight. I found the object with the binoculars and, of course, it looked bigger. Then, all of a sudden, it stopped, turned crimson red and zipped off in the same direction(south) changing color from crimson red to bright red to bright yellow to bright white then suddenly vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

Certainly strange things happen in Nevada as they do elsewhere but with Nevada being home to area 51 and a history of nuclear programs and black projects it&#39;s notoriety for strange happenings puts it at the forefront.   Small communities generally have little to do for kids except school sports for those interested in them and cruising up and down the streets in their cars. To afford the expense of having cars we had jobs at various businesses providing cheap labor for the owners. It also would supposedly keep us out of trouble. For the most part we stayed out of trouble but, we were teenagers after all.   My friend and I played sports and each of of had jobs at gas stations at opposite ends of town. Back then they were called service stations since we actually washed the windows, checked the oil and filled the gas tank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One school night in 1973 or 1974, I don&#39;t recall exactly, we planned to meet  after work at the stationed I worked at and do a little cruising and drink a few beers from the six pack we had. My friend closed the station he worked at a few minutes before 9:00 and came to the station I worked at which was open 24 hours a day. We got into my car and drove north out of town. We both opened our first beer and listen to the radio and talked.   It was a nice night in late summer and we had the windows down. I had been driving around 35 miles an hour for about 20 minutes or so and noticed the road in front of us appeared white. As I drove into the white area of highway I saw it was snow and I stepped on the brake and slid off the road. Fortunately I had slowed down even more so I wasn&#39;t off the road much. I turned back on the highway and headed south towards town again. I pulled off to the roadside and stopped just past the snow line on the road and turned the car off.   We got out of the car and went to where it was snowing. What was interesting was the snow was creating a slow moving line on the pavement. It was like a wall of snow and we could step into the snowy area and step out. We made a few snow balls and threw them at each other to have a little fun since snow was uncommon to see in our area.   I noticed the snow had reached my car and I figured I should move it forward some since the windows were still down. I pulled it forward on the side of the road about 30 feet and turned it off again. We had both finished our first beer and my friend had walked to the car. We both decided to take a leak before heading back to town. It was about 20 minutes before 10:00. We both had 11:00 curfews so we had plenty of time to get back to town with time to spare.   It was dark out and quiet. As we stood there we looked up and saw a series of lights. It appeared as though they were on something circular shaped and slowly rotating since one would go out on one side while one would appear on the other. It didn&#39;t seem to be moving other than it&#39;s rotation. Whatever it was, it was huge.   We were both really frightened and quickly went towards the car. That&#39;s where our memories end for a period.   The next recollection we have is almost like coming out of a sleep. I&#39;m driving and in front us us are the lights of town. I asked my friend what time it was and turned on the dome light so he could see his watch. It was almost 11:30. I took him back to his car quickly and dropped him off. We both hurried to our homes since it was beyond our curfews.   The next day at school when we saw each other my friend asked, &#34;What the hell happened last night.&#34;  I responded, &#34;I have no idea but it was something weird.&#34;  He said, &#34;Do you think we should tell someone?&#34;  I said, &#34;If we do they&#39;ll think we&#39;re crazy.&#34;  We left it at that and over the years when we have spoken the subject has come up but neither of us can recall what happened during the lost time.   It&#39;s always bothered me that I can&#39;t recall the events of that night but I always kind of left it on the back burner, until recently.   I was having shoulder pain from a torn rotator cuff in my right shoulder and went to see a surgeon to take care of it. He did some x-rays at his office and came to the room for the consultation. He asked if I had been in an accident or had a knife tip possibly broken off in my shoulder. I told him nothing like that had ever happened to me and asked why he would ask such an unusual question.   He said the x-ray showed a triangular shaped object medial to the rotator cuff tear but it was not what was causing the problem. He said he couldn&#39;t tell if it was metal, glass or plastic. He said it definitely wasn&#39;t bone and suggested I get an MRI done.   It wasn&#39;t the first time I had an MRI done, just the first time for the shoulder. During an MRI you can communicate with the technician. It seemed to be taking much longer than they had told me so I asked if there was a problem. The technician said, &#34;There is something in your shoulder that is distorting the magnetic field and I can&#39;t get a clear picture.&#34;  Before the surgery I asked the surgeon if he was going to remove the object and he said he was not because it wasn&#39;t close enough to were he was going to do the rotator cuff repair. I never quite felt the same after surgery. I can&#39;t really explain how except I just have never felt the same.   Two years later I was still having pain in the same shoulder. I went to a different surgeon and he also sent me for an MRI. During the procedure I asked the technician if he was getting a clear picture and he said there was no problem. I asked him if he had the prior MRI report and he did have it. I asked if he could see the same object that the prior report detailed. He said it was no longer there.   So far that is the extent of my story. I would love to find an individual that can conduct regression hypnosis so I can fill in the blanks. If you can be of any help I would truly appreciate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
10/1/73 21:30|Hixson|TN|Oval|1 1/2 hours|Oval, brilliant lights, red glow, windows, metallic, no sound; After we lost sight of it and went to find it, it showed itself to us.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42601.html|36|ndxe197310| Oval, brilliant lights, red glow, windows, metallic, no sound; After we lost sight of it and went to find it, it showed itself to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event took place on the first Sunday in October 1973.  I was a high school senior at the time.  My mother had been visiting her sister that evening.  My aunt&#39;s house is about a mile from the base of an area called &#34;Big Ridge.&#34;  Its a residential area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my mom was going to the car to leave (between 9:30 &amp; 10 p.m.), my aunt walked out with her.  They stood in her yard talking and my mom noticed bright lights coming down Big Ridge.  She told my aunt to look at those funny looking lights on a car coming down the ridge.  My aunt told her that couldn&#39;t be a car; there was no road in that particular spot.  They agreed the lights were highly unusual so they continued to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden the lights (or craft) shot straight up into the sky.  They continued to watch as it zipped up &amp; down the length of the ridge faster than anything they had ever seen in the sky.  Its movements were quick and sharp; up, down, back, and forth.  It would go so far away they could barely see it; then as fast as it disappeared it would zoom back into full view.  At the time, we were hearing about lots of UFO sightings so thats the first thing they thought about - it had to be a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom came home (about a 10 minute drive) and told us what they saw.  My sister, her son who was about five at the time, and myself got very excited and wanted to go back to my aunts house to see it.  So we all piled into the car and went back over there.  When we got there, some of my cousins were trying to see it through binoculars but all you could see was fuzz; it was much clearer with the naked eye.  After a while it got very far away and didn&#39;t come back our way.  My adventurous mother figured out which direction it had gone and said &#34;it looks like its up around Valleybrook.&#34;  Valleybrook was, at the time, one of the most exclusive subdivisions in our area.  This is where it gets GOOD.............<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all jumped back in the car and headed up Hixson Pike toward Valleybrook (about five miles or so from my aunt&#39;s house).  I swear to God somebody/something in that craft knew we were looking for it and knew exactly where we were going.  Theres a large curve right before Valleybrook.  As we came out of the curve we had full view of the subdivision on our left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And there it was, at the back of the subdivision, moving slowly along the tree tops toward the road we were driving on.  I believe that finding the craft in the exact location my mom said we were going to was no coincidence; somehow they were tapped into our thoughts, knew we were looking for them, felt maybe we were going to be receptive to them, and came down to show themselves to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was huge and beautiful and it scared the living daylights out of us.  I don&#39;t think our reaction was one they were looking for because we freaked out.  If we had continued the direction we were driving and the craft had continued on the path it was on, we would have driven right under it.  By that time my mom, who was driving, was frantic.  She was screaming &#34;I&#39;m not driving under that thing&#34; and we were screaming back at her to not drive under that thing - to do something to keep from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Luckily there was a second entrance to the subdivision so we turned left onto that road.  The second house on the left was the only one with outside lights on so we pulled into their driveway.  This put our back to the craft which was hovering at that moment over a small pond at the edge of Hixson Pike.  My nephew was screaming &#34;Oh God, Oh God, Oh God.&#34;  My sister threw open the car door and had one leg out of the car; she was going to run into some stranger&#39;s house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time we pulled into the driveway and i turned around in the backseat to look at it out the rear window it was gone.  Totally vanished like it was never there.  We have no idea which direction it went when it left; it disappeared that fast.  I can&#39;t help but wonder if it would have stayed longer if we hadn&#39;t panicked.  I also sometimes wonder if they still watch me and know when I&#39;m reliving the events of that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHAT THE CRAFT LOOKED LIKE:  It was oval in shape, had a metallic body, small windows around it, in the center of the bottom was a cluster of the brightest, whitest, clearest, most brilliant lights I have ever seen.  That was 30+ years ago and I&#39;ve yet to see any white lights that have remotely compared to them.  Around the entire craft was a red glow.  There was no physical/visible red light (like a bulb); only a glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was being driven with precision along the tree tops and made no sound.  When we first spotted it at the back of the subdivision it was skimming along the tree line behind a row of houses.  It moved slowly and continuous until it reached the road we were traveling on.  Thats when it stopped and hovered over the pond.  It never crossed Hixson Pike; it just vanished into thin air.  We didn&#39;t report our sighting to anyone because we didn&#39;t know who to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we told our story to friends/acquaintances/family in the following days, we were treated like idiots and just made fun of.  After seeing the ABC special last week and finally getting names of people who might be interested in our story, I decided it was time to tell it.  Whether anyone believes what we saw or not is irrelevant; we know what we saw, the story hasn&#39;t changed in 30 years, and will never change.  I only regret that video cameras weren&#39;t available then like they are now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom is now 85 years old and her memory isn&#39;t what it used to be, but one things for sure, she still remembers that first Sunday in October 1973.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It was pitch black and all of a sudden there was this blinding white light that enveloped the car and I remember being terrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I know we are down the road a good 4 or 5 miles from the plant, I don&#39;t remember how we got there, but now we are at the old Oak St bridge.  Anyone from that area should remember that old metal bridge, we were going so fast across it we were fishtailing, it had been raining.  I know we were both terrified and I looked up at the sky and there were 3 or 4 of them following us all the way thru town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finally got to my Aunt &amp; Uncle&#39;s house where we were staying the night, I remember being so afraid to look up in the sky, but as we ran into the house I saw them go zip, zip, zip and they were gone.  I don&#39;t know how else to describe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once inside the house, we immediately started telling the other adults there what we had seen.  Of course we were met with jokes and sarcasm.  My ex couldn&#39;t take the ridicule and so he did an about face and said he really hadn&#39;t seen anything.  As you can imagine, I was furious with him for not standing up and telling them the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later, after we divorced, we met for drinks and he admitted to me that he had seen what I had seen, but could not take the ribbing from the other men in the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

10/1/73 20:45|Waco|TX|Triangle|30 minutes|I observed the craft at close range to know it wasn't manmade based upon my training and experience.|7/20/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/111/S111579.html|38|ndxe197310| I observed the craft at close range to know it wasn&#39;t manmade based upon my training and experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the Fall of 1973, I was taking a doctoral course two nights a week at Baylor Univrsity in Waco.  The class was from 7 to 8:30PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming home in the first part of the week in late September or early October, I saw a low, bright light over Lake Waco.  I concluded it was either a helicopter or the planet Venus.  However, two nights later, I saw the same thing; so I decided to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached the bridge going over Lake Waco, I could the craft hovering over Lake Waco just near what is known as Speegleville Park.  After going west over the bridge, I took the next exit which brought me down into the Park; but as I approached where the craft appeared to be stationary, it turned off its bright lght and began to move to the southwest.  It crossed in front of me and went over the highway; so I decided to follow it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see it settle down in a clump of woods just on the other side of the highway.  I crossed over the highway and slowly drove by the wooded area.  The road curved to the southeast; and I went up about seventy yards passed the spot, pulled over and stopped.  I turned off my lights but left my engine running.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched in my reawview mirror for a few moments when I could see the craft rising slowng and coming in my direction.  It pulled up to my right just on the other side of the fence not far from a telephone pole.  I figured it was no more than 50 feet off the ground at most.  It was black in color, trangular in shape, about 30 feet in lenght and 20-25 feet in width.  I could see the cockpit with a green hue inside and three small heads peering down at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hadn&#39;t been there more than 5 minutes when the craft shown a green light down that engulfed my little VW Fastback.  My engine died and all electrical devices would not work.  I tried restarting the engine and tried turning on my lights and radio to no avail.  It was then I became alarmed and locked my doors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept trying to restart my engine every few minutes.  Finally, after about 15 minutes, it turned over.  I went down the road for about another 75 yards before turning on my lights and doing a U-turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I past where the craft was stationed, it made no attempt to follow me; and I could still see it when I got back on the highway.  At no time could I hear any sound nor see any moving parts.  During that week, the weather was clear and there was enough light to be able make out tree shapes and anything in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3 years later, I saw the same lihgt hovering just about the lights in the south end of a LaVega high school football game.  I wanted to go closer to craft to show my wife and children who were with me; but my wife didn&#39;t want me to go chasing UFO&#39;s.  Having spent two years in the AFROTC and two years in the U.S.Army and flew a couple of times in a helicopter, I knew the craft that I saw in 1973 was not anything that the U.S. or any country had the time.  I even held a Top Secret Clearance while in the military; therefore, I wasn&#39;t one to be the subject of delusions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in 1973 is approximate.

10/1/73 20:30|North St. Paul|MN|Triangle|Two minutes|Large triangular space craft sighted above North Senior High School' football field, in North St. Paul, MN in early October 1, 1973|7/30/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24001.html|39|ndxe197310| Large triangular space craft sighted above North Senior High School&#39; football field, in North St. Paul, MN in early October 1, 1973<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were driving on the local highway that runs through the middle of our town, North St. Paul, MN, and were just coming near the high school&#39;s football field.  Very obvious in the sky, just hovering over the football field was a large triangular spacecraft, at least as big as the field.  It did not make any obvious sounds, but we were ina car on the highway,  so that presents noise of its own.  However, above that normal highway noise, there was nothing unusual.  There were lights on each of the triangle tips.  We stared in awe as we continued on the highway.  Though I wanted to go to my house for a camera to take a photo, my friend was afraid to return to the spot.  We did go to a nearby corner store and called police to report it.  No one took us seriously at either the store or the police.  We did not return to that location again that night.  There were no reports in the paper about the sighting, though it seems apparent that others must have seen it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

10/1/73 20:00|Bloomington|IN|Light|20 minutes|Three large bright white craft  interacting & manuevering rapidly accross a quadrant of night sky.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98371.html|40|ndxe197310| Three large bright white craft  interacting &amp; manuevering rapidly accross a quadrant of night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The year is 1973, and the month is Oct.  It is around 8:00 PM, clear skies and a full or nearly full moon.  The location is southern central Indiana.  I was attending graduate courses at Indiana University.  I was a passenger in the front right seat and my children ages 4 &amp; 5 yrs. were in the back seat.  We were returning from an afternoon in nearby Brown Co. state park, having already stopped for food.. I was looking at the sky out the window to see if I could discern any constellations to point out to the children.  I was startled to see three bright white large objects moving at great speed across approximately a quadrant of the sky.  I asked my friend driving to pull over and stop, which he did; and we all got out to observe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects appeared to be at a quite high altitude but definitely within the orbit of the moon as they several times crossed in front of the moon and were quite visible as they were much brighter.  They were equal in size and appeared to be one sixth to one eighth the size of the moon.  Their movements remained within a quadrant of the sky, exhibiting incredible speed even during right angle turns.  My son commented that they were playing tag, which was an accurate description of their movements.  Several times two of the objects approached very close and began to spin about one another.  This maneuver reminded me of videos I’ve seen of eagles who lock talons in flight and spin about each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This activity continued for about 20 minutes, then they all departed outward toward space and within seconds were no longer visible.  During this event two other cars stopped to observe, so a total number of witnesses was eight.  When it was over everyone looked at each other somewhat wide eyed, and shrugging shoulders got back in their respective vehicles and departed as well.  No one spoke to each other.  I didn’t know any of the other witnesses and never saw any of them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of three very nice reports from the same witness.  PD))<n>

Approximately a week later, at approximately 5pm, I arrived back  home from a Brownie Troop meeting (my mom picked me up and drove me to the house afterwards) and my mom brought my brother in the house to start dinner. For some reason, I decided to not go in the house right away, I was on the side of the house and looked up and could not believe my eyes, I saw the same UFO I saw a week earlier, I looked up and felt paralyzed and did not move for what seemed to be approx 10-30 minutes (it was hard to tell how long it was there).  The disk had square windows that beamed white light, it was silent and quite mesmerizing. When! it left it, darted up at the sky and seemed to silently disappear at an unbelivable speed.  My mom asked me why it took so long for me to come back in the house because she was almost finished making dinner.  I didn&#39;t say anything about the UFO to her because I thought she might not believe it, anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

10/1/73 02:30|Mundelein|IL|Disk|20 seconds|Saw large flying saucer in corn field 150ft away, maybe 15 ft off the ground.  I wasn't alone my friend was with me, Mundelein, IL.|11/14/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115289.html|42|ndxe197310| Saw large flying saucer in corn field 150ft away, maybe 15 ft off the ground.  I wasn&#39;t alone my friend was with me, Mundelein, IL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m now 60 years old and followed some link on a UFO story and thought back to my own experience which I have never written about, and then found this site.  I never reported this or wrote about it because frankly I did not want to be thought of as a crackpot.  I don&#39;t feel so funny about reporting it because I realize that lots of people have made reports.  In 1973/194 it was pre-internet so your only option was to report it to the police, which I figured they would think you were a crackpot so I never reported it.  And after reading maybe 50 different reports on this website, I realize I had a very close encounter.  My story is a bit different than most I have read.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I graduated High School 1972 and then we did everything together, worked at the same places rented apartments together etc. and mostly we liked boys, LOL now that I think back on it.  So we were driving I would say about 2:30 am, it was after the bars closed, but we were not real big drinkers in any event we were not like plastered, just had a little buzz on.  I&#39;ll never forget the road, it was a little country road (paved) and the road made a very sharp left turn, a hard left curve I should say, and where it made that sharp left, straight ahead was a corn field, and when you made the left you were then driving parallel to the corn field, we both knew this road very well and the dangerous sharp left curve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were maybe 75 ft to 100 ft before the curve, now looking straight into the cornfield and had slowed down for the upcoming curve, and this huge (I don&#39;t know any other words to use so I am going to go ahead and use the much over-hyped description) this huge flying saucer came zooming in from the right, it then literally stopped on a dime, (no way could any normal human craft come in that fast and then simply STOP) and then it slowly lowered itself straight down until it was only about maybe 15ft above the corn field.  The thing I remember the very most was the unnatural bright bright bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped the car and we both put our hands up to shield our eyes, it was that bright.  There we were stopped in my car, my headlights shining into the cornfield and before us was this super bright white light, all-lit-up flying saucer, maybe 150ft in front of us.  It just sat there hovering above the corn field for maybe 10 or 15 seconds, then it went up a little bit, not much mayb! e 100ft and then it just zoomed off to the right very very very fast in an upward trajectory. It was like out of there so fast it was unbelievable.  To the right was east, Lake Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my girlfriend and I were literally in shock, we kept asking each other, &#34;Did you see that?&#34; Things were different back then, there was no internet to get information and so the next day we just verified with each other that in fact we had seen it and then we never talked about it again. About a year later I got married and moved out of State and lost touch with my childhood friend. But while visiting my parents recently I tracked her down &amp; we met up. It was so strange but she is the one who brought it up and asked me, &#34;Do you remember when we saw that UFO?&#34; All these years later but both of us remember the main details like it was yesterday. it is not the kind of thing you forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember if it was spinning, I don&#39;t remember any other color lights just the incredibly BRIGHT white light, it was big I would say the diameter was a good 75ft to 100ft. I am estimating that using the width of the road, and remember I was up very close to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized after reading various reports here that I have a very unique experience, most people see flashing lights or if they see a craft it is farther away.  This is the reason all these years later I am filing the report. I didn&#39;t see something in a distance, or simply lights I saw a real flying saucer and I saw it up close, so I&#39;m filling in the report.  I think it was probably in the fall because I do remember that the corn had been harvested but it was not yet snowing out, so my guess would be in September or October and the year would have been either 1973 or 1974.  Oh I almost forgot to add, there was no noise.<n>
10/1/73 01:00|Montezuma|IN|Sphere|15 minutes|We saw a large glowing sphere that looked like the moon, but was obviously not since it was very close to us and could manuver.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45791.html|43|ndxe197310| We saw a large glowing sphere that looked like the moon, but was obviously not since it was very close to us and could manuver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While laying awake one night listening to the police scanner, I heard a report stating that a lady in our town had just spotted a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got in the car and headed to the south end of town where I saw what at first appeared to be the moon.  I realized that what I was seeing was not the moon, but a large glowing off-white sphere that was hovering at tree top level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving east to west until it came to the Wabash river, then it started following the river north towards the bridge.  I wanted to see what happened when it reached the bridge, so I sped up.  I had been pacing the object at about 10-15 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to the bridge the object was no longer over the river.  It was moving rapidly to the south west to the town of Hillsdale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached Hillsdale, which sits low in a little valley, the object made precise turns to manuver through the valley and was soon out of site.  After trying to chase the object, I returned to town where I spoke with the town marshall and a county deputy sherriff.  Both had seen the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The deputy stated that he had initially seen the object a few miles east of Montezuma and thought the moon looked large and close that night.  He paid no more attention until the radio report came in a  couple minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point he looked out the window and did not see the moon.  He realized then, that it was not the moon he saw, but something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all agreed that what we saw had navigational abilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lady who made the initial call had just left the tavern and was somewhat inebriated at the time.  Needless to say, she was very hysterical for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
