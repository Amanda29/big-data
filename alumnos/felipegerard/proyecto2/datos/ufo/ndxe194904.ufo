I yelled to my mother and went on a run to our front porch with my mother right behind me. She yelled to the neighbors who yelled to more until a crowd of us were glued to the disk in the sky. It was low for such a craft. Our house was on a hill. It was east of our house (beyond the now existing freeway) and positioned at 11:00 in the sky. It was standing still, then it would wiggle, at which time the sun would shimmer off it&#39;s silver shape. This behavior repeated itself in the one spot for many minutes. Suddenly it went North in a blink of an eye and was GONE, out of sight. We all were speechless. I estimate the time as to the big tree on our neighbors yard. We could see through the branches and the placement of the sun was southern in mid-day. I have gone back to view this place to be as accurate as my childish memory will allow. It also was in the Post Intelligencer newspaper the next day. I have wanted to find a copy of that photo. We just stared and never thought of a camera when we viewed this silver disk visiting our sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
