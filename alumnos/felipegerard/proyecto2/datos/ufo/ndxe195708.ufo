People were saying it is just stationary and not moving, suddenly it began to move very slowly across the ground at tree level toward us and stopped directly over where we were standing.  I was captivated and not afraid.  Others were saying &#34;it&#39;s the Russians&#34;.  I did not speak I just focuced on the huge object that appeared to be aboiut the size of a football field, blocking out the entire night sky, it&#39;s bright blue white light coming from windows in a horeshoe format surrounding a gear of somekind underneath the object was of interest to me.  I was waiting for some thing to happen, but as far as I know at that time nothing did, after about 20 minutes or so it seemed, it just began to move slowly at tree top level south west over the country side with no noise and no fanfare, as far as I could see, until it slowly went out of sight.  I was told by one of the bystanders it was headed to a air base about 50 miles away.  I drove home and ran into my house where my father was sitting reading...I told him about what I had experienced and he just got up and went to his bookshelf and handed me a paperback book about an accounting of a commercial pilots story of spotting more than one unidentified object in his flying career.  Of course, to this day I read and stay up on serious accounts of this interesting aspect to our universe.  I was seventeen when I had the experience and it shaped my life and has been forever a reference point that nothing can surprise me and has formed a open mind and unlimited potential attitude. The object! was a s oft delta shape and was a matt deep green blue or black, no distingusing features or symbols on the object. I was a massive object, overwhelming, indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/16/57 21:30|Smith's Ferry|ID|Disk|10 minutes|When a disk UFO passes within a few feet of the truck cab, the Air Force calls it a lost missile.|6/3/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75574.html|2|ndxe195708| When a disk UFO passes within a few feet of the truck cab, the Air Force calls it a lost missile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Idaho UFO history includes Cougar Mountain, Smiths’ Ferry.  I have noticed that much of Idaho’s UFO history from before 1970 is totally missing now unless you happen to own a copy of Frank Edwards’ book, &#34;Stranger than Science.&#34;   I cannot find my issue, if I even still have it, but I know one of the entries from personal experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the summer of 1957 my Dad and my Uncle Paul worked together in a post and pole business located one mile west of Donnelly.  In mid-August of that summer they had an order to fill one hundred miles south near Nampa.  The flatbed truck was loaded and they left early one august morning.  When they returned late that night both were filled with an incredible story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When returning from the Nampa-Boise area they took the only route available which was Idaho State Route 15.  Years later the road would be widened and made a bit straighter and renamed SR 55. Uncle Paul was driving and my Dad was the passenger. Traveling north the trip was uneventful until the moment they turned onto Rainbow Bridge just north of Smiths’ Ferry. By the time they reached this area it was twilight or past 9pm. Also, there was no other traffic on the highway at the time. This area is also known as the Cougar Mountain area. At least once a decade, when traveling through the same area, I would ask my Dad to tell the story and point to what he saw. Most recently was in 2003, not too long before he passed away. The story never changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In mid-August, 1957 at about 9-9:30pm, northbound Hiway 15 (55) passes Cougar Mountain Lodge and the road continues following the Payette River.  Both the road and the river become narrower with some zigzagging prior to reaching Rainbow Bridge.  The road makes a sharp right onto the bridge.  At that point my Dad yelled “STOP!” and the old flatbed truck was nearly in the middle of the bridge before coming to a complete stop.  What my Dad had seen was something large and glowing coming right up the river at about the same level above the water as the bridge. As they came to a stop the large object rose slightly to avoid the bridge and missed the cab of the truck by mere feet. Once over the bridge it dipped about 30 feet down to the river then pulled up in a high arc reaching about 500 feet higher than they were, then dove straight down onto the top of a hill. They watched a bit of an explosion, but did not notice any burning of the dense forest. The land had not been logged and th! erefore no roads existed leading to the crash site at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Dad described the object as circular and shiny on top with a nearly flat bottom. The entire disk glowed with a bright purplish color and was traveling up the river and through its arc at about 60 mph. It was half the width of the bridge making it about 100 feet in diameter.  My Dad would seem to be a good person for observation. He was retired from the Air Force with the rank of Master Gunnery Sgt. He had been in the Flying Tigers and when evacuated from China he was sent to school for the Norden Bomb site and spent the rest of the war in the Flying Fortress. He told stories of “Foo Fighters” and the first momentary glimpse of this disk coming up the river immediately triggered his old reaction to those earlier foo fighters. Unable to do anything about the crash, the two men continued north for a half hour reaching Cascade, the county seat for Valley County. There they stopped at the police station and filed a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the evening of the next day an Air Force Officer dropped by the house and explained to my Dad and Uncle that what they saw was no more than a missile that had been accidentally launched from a jet out of Mountain Home Air Force Base, southwest of Boise. The officer added that “You have no reason to be concerned and should just forget about the incident.” I remember looking at the smiling officer and then at my Dad just staring at him for a moment. My reaction was to try to melt in to the background and be out of site for a while. Very calmly my Dad explained to the young smiling officer that he was retired Air Force, added a few details, and knew a missile when he saw one.  He then invited the officer to change his story or leave. That was the last we heard from the Air Force about that incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crash at Smiths’ Ferry was at 44º 20’ 11.57 N and 116º 03’ 27.54 W and by the following day, the Air Force had the entire area stripped clean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My family was summering in Landcaster New Hampshire during 1957. On a Friday night in August My Father,(An Episcopal Minister), mother, brother, the Bishop of Massachusetts, and I were returning home from a 7:00 PM movie in Exeter New Hampshire. It was aproximately 9:00 PM. We were driving along and suddenly saw a light in the sky over the mountains. My father pulled over to the side of the road so that we could get a better look at the light. At first we thought it was a spotlight shining on a cloud. But when we pulled over and stopped, we got a better look at it. It was a saucer shaped object. It was stationery, several hundred feet above a mountain. There was no sound from the object. One edge of the craft was tilted down toward us, and we could see across the top of it. In the middle of the craft was a very bright white light that seemed to pulsate and change colors slightly. From a bright white, to a reddish and yellow. Around the outer edge of the craft were bright white lights also. They too seemed to be pulsating, and changing colors slightly. White, yellow, and red. We watched the craft for a couple of minutes as it stood still above the mountain top. There were scattered clouds, and the craft illuminated the clouds closest to it. Suddenly the craft went from a dead stop, to completely out of sight in about 2 seconds. It took off upward in the direction of the farthest side of the craft, which was higher than the side facing us, and at about the same angle that it had been in while stationery. We all didn&#39;t know what to say or do. We pulled back onto the road and continued home. There was very little talk about it on the way home, but my brother and I kept saying to each other, &#34;I don&#39;t believe what we saw&#34;. &#34;It was a UFO&#34;!At the time I was 12 years old and by brother was 10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were talking about unions and looking up at the stars.  It was about 1 in the morning and the sky was very clear.  We were facing south.  There was a garrage in fron of us and a pear tree behind.  North to South we had about 60 degrees of sky visable.  To the West and East most of the sky was visable.  Suddenly the stars disappeared.  There was no noise.  The hair on my neck stood up.  All I could yell was &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  My uncle and I compared observations, we had the same impressions.  What appeared to be a trianglar shaped, unlit, solid object had block out the stars, all of the stars.  The duration of the blockage was very short.  The object had to be large and very close to completely block out the stars (there was no noise) or massive!  I was about 12.  My uncle was about 30 years older.  We often spent hours night after night during the summer talking outside.  Never before or after seen such an object.  My uncle was unemployeed at the time but had previously worked as a surveyor for the city.  I was, of course a student.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

Hovers then drops down out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My hobby was Astronomy and I would get up late at night to look out of my window at the stars.  It was a summer night I believe in August of 1957. I was looking south toward the massachusetts turnpike and toward the town of Indian Orchard, Mass which cast a glow into the night sky. I was ten years old at the time.  My stargazing was interrupted by a rapidly flashing bluish white light.  I thought it was some kind of firefly but when I looked directly at it I saw that it was on one edge of a black silhouetted cigar shaped object.  It reminded me of a weapon discharge such as a machine gun.  It was &#39;firing&#39; in the same direction of travel as the object and appeared to be slowing the object down as if it were a retrorocket.  The object (which I estimated to be large...at least several hundred feet long) slowed to a halt over the hill.  The blue-white light ceased to discharge.  After a few seconds it slowly descended behind the hill and out of sight (there is a valley there where the Ludlow River (it may be called the Chicopee River actually) flows.  I watched for hours but it never came up into view again.  I had heard that the Ludlow police had seen it in a different area that night at about 3am but never verified this in newspapers recently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1957 is approximate.

I was assigned to the 2343rd Air Force Reserve Flying Center (AFRFC) at Portland Oregon . Even though we were regular Air Force , we had to go to Chico, California with the reserve unit for two weeks summer encampment during the first part of August each year .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not remember the exact time, date or year, of this event, as we went to Chico for 4-5 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the cockpit of a C-46 in a four plane formation that had been out over the Pacific Ocean for night time navigation training.  (Long before GPS) The navigators used a sextant through the astrodome (glass bubble) on top of the aircraft to determine our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had completed the over water training and were headed southeast back toward Chico  which was  35-50 miles distance, when we noticed a bright cherry red fireball coming from the south at a very high rate of speed. It had a vibrating ,quivering motion as it headed north. We were flying at 8,000-9,000 ft. and the fireball passed across in front of us from the 12:00 o&#39;clock to the 9:00  o&#39;clock positions.  It was level to slightly below our altitude. It was about the size of a dime at arms length  at its closest point. As the fireball got in our 10:00 o&#39;clock position it split into 3-4 pieces.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These pieces all continued north , more or less parallel to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we landed at the base in Chico most of the ground crew that were waiting to  park and service the aircraft after we landed had seen the fire ball pass at about a 30 degree angle to the west of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next few days we heard that the fireball was first seen over southern California. After it passed in front of us , the pieces supposedly  joined back together over Klamath Falls, Oregon where it hovered for a short while. Then flew off to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About  that time we had a C-46 transporting  another flight engineer ,who had injured his back , to our home base at Portland ,Oregon.  The injured man and the flight engineer of the aircraft were both close friends of mine.   As they were on the final approach to the base , the control tower called them and told them to make a &#34;go-around,&#34; as a UFO was following them in for landing. They applied power, raised the landing gear and the flaps and made a  &#34;go -around&#34;  to the left.  The UFO followed them down across the runway, then it also headed north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what I remember the UFO was last seen near the Canadian border.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total elapsed time from  Southern California to the Canadian Border was  about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have tried (to no avail) to go into the archives of  some of the newspapers  in that area to find and record of this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, although we have invited the witness to investigate whether he can determine the date unambiguously, as well as contact other members of the flight and have them submit independent reports about their recollections of the event.

8/9/57 00:30|San Diego (north of, at sea)|CA|Disk|15 minutes|At least a hundred miles out to sea, a long time ago, in 1957, a very interesting sighting, after midnight.  First report.|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38386.html|9|ndxe195708| At least a hundred miles out to sea, a long time ago, in 1957, a very interesting sighting, after midnight.  First report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a very old sighting, and one of my reasons for reporting it now is that I have only recently begun to research UFO sightings.  The specific reason is the vortex I will mention in the following report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a signalman in the Canadian Navy, serving onboard HMCS Athabaskan, and our small convoy of seven ships had been on and excercise which carried us from Victoria, BC, Canada, to Honolulu, then San Diego, and home again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of this event, our seven ships were steaming in &#39;line abreast&#39;, at one thousand yards, or half a mile (between ships), and we were all observing radio silence and &#39;darken ship&#39;, which means no lights were visible on any of the ships, and all radar and radio communication was off.  Our ship was the westernmost in the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately a mile, or perhaps more, further to the west, the bridge lookout and I both spotted a very bright, bluish light coming from somewhere low in the sky.  With binoculars, we could make out a rather large, circular shape, with what seemed like portholes around the lower perimeter.  Inside of this circle, near what appeared to be the forward part of the object, was the bright, bluish light, that appeared to be at least as bright as our carbon arc signal/search light, which was rated at twenty million candlepower.  The light was shining directly down into the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon, two officers-of-the-watch and the Commanding Officer were all looking at the object through binoculars.  At first, we all thought it might be a United States military helicopter on some sort of maneuvers, but we were well out to sea, and none of the &#39;Notices to Mariners&#39; (sent to all ships at sea), indicated any sort of military exercises, save ours, in that area.  Furthermore, no helicopter could be as large as this object appeared to be.  By now, about ten minutes had passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Inside the beam of bluish light emanating from the bottom of the object, I personally noticed a vortex, or &#39;waterspout&#39;, (a waterspout is about the same as a tornado, with water inside of it rather than debris) swirling between the ocean surface and the object, and it was my thought that the object was taking on water.  I observed this phenomenon for approximately a minute, perhaps longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Commanding Officer ordered me to train the big carbon arc searchlight on the object, and to await his orders before switching it on.  I laid my binoculars aside and trained the light.  The three officers then took positions as far over the side of the bridge as possible, to avoid the glare which would reflect from the superstructure of the ship, rendering their binoculars useless.  I was then ordered to turn the light on, which I did, keeping a close eye on the object. Of course, I was partially blinded by the aforementined glare, and all I could observe was the bright bluish light.  It seemed that within a few seconds of opening the shutters of the searchlight, the object simply disappered.  At the very least, the lights which had been visible around the object went out, including the bright light aimed at the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Commanding officer then &#39;broke&#39; radio silence and ordered the operations room personnnel to turn on the Sperry radar, set it to a twenty five mile range, and make exactly two 360 degree sweeps, and turn it off again, which they did.  I would guess that two &#39;sweeps&#39; would have taken another minute.  Nothing showed up on the screen.  The officers then held a brief conference amongst themselves, and that seemed to be the end of the matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, on a whim, I looked in the ship&#39;s log, and found no mention of the sighting, and I joked with the lookout that we had seen a &#39;flying saucer&#39;.  In those days, 1957, the term UFO was just gaining popularity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many years later I thought seriously about what I had seen, and then the issue of Crop Circles began to appear in the press.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here are a couple questions.  First.  Could it be that the object was taking on water to replenish a hydrogen supply?  Or even as potable water for themselves?  Second.  As all crop circles seem to have similar characteristics, that is, the grass, or crop, is all neatly laid out in one direction, stems bent but not broken, and in a perfect circle, could it be that whatever made the &#39;vortex&#39; or &#39;waterspout&#39; mentioned above could also make these neat, precise, geometric shapes?  I believe so.  If that is the case, why hasn&#39;t someone else come up with the idea?  I mentioned that I have only begun to think about UFOs seriously, so maybe I missed a report somewhere that provided a plausible explanation for how these patterns are made.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No blue or white flames. It appeared to have no tail such as a comet might display. It appeared to be elevated 175 feet off of the ground travelling at over 1005 miles per hour. It passed over the service school barracks # 519 and proceeded in an E-NE terly direction over the service school buildings, the base swimming pool and missed the water tower by an estimated 25 feet to the right of it ( Eastern side ) then proceeded over the hill and disappeared. I watched the sky over that area for at least 20 minutes and it appeared to NOT return to space. I checked the newspapers and radio stations the next day and apparently I was the only one who saw it. I reported it to the MAA but no effort was made by the Navy to investigate the incident The place was Bainbrige Naval training center in the southwest corner where the service school barracks are situated. I was standing the mid watch 0:00 to 04:00 the time was 2;00 AM on August 4th 1957. the direction was along a line from the NE corner of the junction of rte,222 and rte 276 at Port Deposit MD. to the center of Asbury Park N.J. in a north easterly direction. For closer references on the base, the water tower and the swimming pool might still be there but I understand that all the buildings were torn down because they were constructed with asbestos board.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate that the object entered the ocean somewhere about 12 miles east of Asbury Park and 24 miles south of Long Beach, Long Island along the line I just described. According to my calculations it would have had to pass over the village of Churchville, MD. before reaching My Location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Considering the estimated metalic content of such objects I believe that a submarine or even a surface vessel with sonar should be able to locate this object by following the direction of that line starting at the point of observation longitude 76 deg.6&#39; and 15&#34; by Lat.39 deg.36&#39; and 15&#34; and proceeding 23 degrees E-NE toward Asbury Park. Or they could start at Asbury Park and proceed 23 degrees E-NE along long Island. Considering the apparent observed rate of decelleration not allowing for distance the object might have burried itself in the gravel bank just beyond the boundary of the Naval base. I would check there first before organizing a sea expedition..<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you intend to look for it, any additional help I might be able to provide, feel free to contact me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

8/1/57 12:00|Arco|ID|Disk|THREE MIN.|A surveying crew of five disturbed a landed craft that lifted up during mid day and then flew away after observing us.|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74458.html|13|ndxe195708| A surveying crew of five disturbed a landed craft that lifted up during mid day and then flew away after observing us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Working as a survey crew of five for a power Co. we were surveying  for a transmission line across Idaho going from west to east.  While in the central part we had moved ahead to make a new setting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had just parked our vehicle and was setting up our transit and surveying equipment and some one said, there goes a jet.  We looked to the North and an object was raising up from the lava beds.  It was round and shiny on top.  It was not more than around one quarter mile away and maybe 300 to 400 feet high.  We had just eaten our lunch, so it was mid day.  A very clear and sunny day.  It was a FLYING SAUCER, plain and clear.  We had apparently disturbed a landed craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it with our survey equipment as it just hovered there .  It rocked back and forth while there, apparently observing us.  It was very saucer shaped and never made a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about two or three minutes, it turned away from us to the north and up.  In about three seconds it was out! of sight, very fast.  We were about straight south across the lava beds from Arco Idaho, zip  83213.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was mid summer and 1957-58.  There are myself and maybe two others still alive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not reported at the time because we were on schedule to finish the line survey for a construction crew.  We sure wished we had a had a camera.  It was real.<n>
