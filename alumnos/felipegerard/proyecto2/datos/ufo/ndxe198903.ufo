The object appeared just over the tree line, moved in a straight line over the interstate and then disappeared over the trees on the Eastern side of the interstate.  Speed of object unknown, but as it was low flying, the object seemed to have moved faster than an airplane would have.  It was moving slowly enough that I could tell it had a circular outline as the outline appeared darker than the night sky.  Object made no noise as it moved.  Object also had three lights in an inverted triangular pattern on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/15/89 19:30|Rockfish|VA|Triangle|15 min|Triangle up close.  Uncharacteristic thoughts in my mind.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27986.html|2|ndxe198903| Triangle up close.  Uncharacteristic thoughts in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember this as if it were yesterday.  Please note that the month, date and time are approximate.  I&#39;m fairly confident of the year, however.  At the time I was working in Manassas and was on my way home to Shipman.  To break up the monotony of the long drive, I would often times take back roads home.  This time I turned off US 29 toward Rockfish.  I saw the craft for the first time about two miles before I reached Rockfish. Skies were clear and it was almost, but not quite full dark.  I was about 1/4 mile from a small hill directly in front of me.  I noted what at the time I thought was an airplane moving direcly away from me over the hill.  I could make out distinct red lights.  This would be about 1/2 the size of a thumb nail at arms length.  I expected the &#34;plane&#34; to disappear behind the hill.  All the while I&#39;m getting closer.  Just as I expected the craft to disappear, I saw the craft cross between the top of the hill and my car.  That&#39;s when I realized the craft was coming straight down.  At this point I was directly in front of the hill and I see this thing start to fly horizontally through the trees.  At this point, the size would be about two hands held at arms length.  It had three red lights forming a triangle.  For some reason, it reminded me of the back end of an automobile.  The third brake light was still novel at this time.  I distinctly remember thinking &#34;Hmmmm.... I wonder if there&#39;s a road up there and this is the rear of an automobile.&#34;  Now this thought is riduculous; I just saw this thing come out of the sky and fly through the trees!  I just shrugged it off and drove on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove through Rockfish.  (This hardly qualifies as a town, just a railroad crossing and a couple of houses.)  I was on my way toward Shipman, somewhere near Ball Mountain.  This would be approximately 5 to 10 minutes later.  This thing flew right over my car!  It filled the entire windshield!  It floated across the road from right to left.  It was a perfect equilateral triangle defined by blood red lights in each corner.  These lights would be about three or four feet in diameter, and there was about 30 feet between the lights.  It was just above the trees.  I&#39;m guessing there was about 40 feet from one side of the road to the other and it took several seconds to cross this distance.  I watched this thing float away and it kind of followed the terain at treetop level and had a very peculiar way of moving.  When it changed direction it would point one apex into the direction it was moving.  This appeared as a small rotation.  I continued to watch this thing for ten to fifteen seconds.  By this point, I&#39;m turning around and looking over my left shoulder and was just creeping along.  It finally went out of sight and I drove home and FORGOT IT!  Literally!  I was sitting around talking with my wife, Dad, and Sister and in passing the subject of UFO&#39;s came up.  At that point I suddenly &#34;remembered&#34; the event and described it to my family.  That was also the first time I felt frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started driving this route home every night after this event.  Two more events of note occured.  One night about three miles from Rockfish, I again saw this triangle shape just hanging motionless above another ridge.  This time, however, the corner lights were yellow.  The craft appeared about the size of a thumb nail at arms length.  I stopped the car and got out.  Like my initial sighting, I had the distinct feeling that this thing was aware of my presence.  I watched for about twenty seconds and this thing did that peculiar rotation and descended behind the ridge.  Another night, in the vicinity of Ball Mountain again, a jet flew over the car and it was LOUD and LOW!  It really made me jump!  Now we don&#39;t typically see jets flying low in the mountains at night! It has only been recently that I figured out what was so peculiar and may account for my feeling of being watched.  At all times when viewing this object, it appeared as a perfect equilateral triangle no matter how it moved in relationship to me.  If it were a flat object with lights on the bottom, you would expect the relationship of the lights to change as this thing manuevered.  This was not the case.  If it were a flat object, it had to keep one face focused on me as it moved around i. e. it was aware of me.  I even thought that perhaps the object was a tetrahendon, but the the same argument still applies.  I have never seen this observation descibed in other &#34;triangle&#34; reports.  Have you? I did start having bad nightmares after this event and would wake myself up screaming.  They do not happen as often anymore.  I have no idea if they are related to this sighting.  One other odd thing.  I have never been able since to exactly pinpoint the spot near Ball Mountain where this thing flew over my car.  A couple of spots look almost, but not quite &#34;right.&#34; Believe me, this is NOT a hoax.  It really happened.  I have a degree in physics form the University of Virginia and now work as an aerospace engineer in Charlottesville.  This thing has haunted me for years and I thought it was time to share it.  Thank you for the forum you provide and all you hoaxers out there please take it elsewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the excellent report.

3/15/89 19:00|Tulsa|OK|Rectangle|3 to 5 minutes|Witnessed with a friend, a large, rectangular object hovering at sundown in Tulsa Oklahoma.|5/12/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75254.html|3|ndxe198903| Witnessed with a friend, a large, rectangular object hovering at sundown in Tulsa, Oklahoma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about sundown on a March evening in 1989.  I forgot the exact day.  I was riding in my friend’s Jeep and we were heading back to his apartment.  We were stopped at a red light at an intersection heading east.  Up in the Southeastern sky, it looked like a jet airliner was on fire heading down toward Earth.  The smoke and fire cleared after a few seconds and revealed a large, rectangle shaped, solid object.  It had dozens of white lights along the side.  I want to say they seemed to be windows, because the light seemed to be coming from inside the object, not mounted on the outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to be about a football field or so long.  It hovered at treetop level at a fifteen degree angle slowly drifting north about a mile away.  It made no sound. Everyone in their cars at the intersection was freaking out.  All of this took place over about a minute or so, maybe less. It had drifted pretty far North by the time the traffic light turned green.  That&#39;s when we saw and heard fighter jets (lights out) screaming toward the object from the far Southern sky.  As we hurried to try to get under it to get a better view, we lost sight of it for a few seconds because of the trees on the left side of the road.  When we got to the next intersection, the jets flew right over us, and we saw the object way down the street.  I could see the back end of it.  I would guess it was about a mile away, moving faster and much higher in the sky now.  We knew we would never catch up with it.  Almost as soon as we saw it, it quickly moved very high in the sky at an unbelievable speed, and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later, I went and told my Dad about it, and drew some sketches. We watched the ten o’clock news, as they were going to have a story WITH FILM FOOTAGE of an object seen in the sky that night.  The film they showed was taken by a lady that had been at a local nearby restaurant that evening, and it had that restaurant’s sign in the foreground.  But what they showed looked like a falling star, nothing more.  No word from the dozens of witnesses that saw what we saw.  No footage of the object hovering a hundred feet or so off the ground, or any of the rest of it.  They said it was a &#34;Russian satellite falling out of its orbit.&#34;   When those things happen, don&#39;t they know about when and where those things will fall?  I&#39;m all the time hearing weathermen saying things like, &#34;Keep an eye in the Western sky tonight to catch a glimpse of blah blah blah..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years, I&#39;ve wondered how many other people saw that, and I&#39;ve wanted to compare notes.  I haven&#39;t been able to find anything in any newspaper of TV. archives that even told the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that night, I&#39;ve questioned everything.  I truly believe the government knows much more than we even believe they do.  I hate to sound like one of those conspiracy freaks, but after seeing undisputable proof that we are not alone, it makes me uneasy to not have the whole story.  Anyway, that&#39;s my story, as best as I can remember it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The actual words were, &#34;Houston this is Discovery, we still have the alien spacecraft on VFR&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a reversed speech researcher I was curious to see if the technique of slowing and reversing the recorded transmission would reveal whether or not the message was a hoax (as some claimed), a joke (as NASA claimed), or the simple truth.  In fact, the reversals indicate that not only is the message itself genuine, but the event it is describing was in fact taking place at that very moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve posted the audio so that others can enjoy this unique moment from 17 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://ken-welch.com/Friends/Aliens.html  will take you directly to the page where you can listen for yourself.

It was raining slightly and foggy. About one mile south of the I-45 and Loop 610 Interchange, almost at the Hobby Airport exit, we all three saw a bright green sphere that moved parallel to the freeway, about 150-200 feet from the ground. It didn&#39;t make any sound. The object was almost in the clouds or fog and it cast a bright green glow in the fog and clouds directly over it. The object then changed direction; it turned slightly left and crossed over the freeway, headed south-southeast (towards Clear Lake and the NASA headquarters). When it was on the other side of the freeway, we could also see a deep blue color on the lower 1/3 of the sphere, but the green glow was much brighter. It then disappeared in the clouds. In order to calm ourselves, we all assumed that this was a meteor or maybe an aircraft heading toward NASA that was partially obscured by the fog. This happened 10 years ago and I remember it as if it were yesterday. At the time this happened, all three of us were employed as clinical chemists at a major hospital located in the Texas Medical Center.<n>

3/6/89 01:00|New Lenox|IL|Egg|3 days|1989 Sighting 2 main ships many small (USA, Illinois)|3/11/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26899.html|7|ndxe198903| 1989 Sighting 2 main ships many small (USA, Illinois)<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1989 in New Lenox, Illinois, my mother and I witnessed about 3 nights of UFOs outside of her bedroom window.  I was ten years old and I believe it was early March/late February when this all occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom is a fairly hokey person who believes she sees things all the time (spirits etc.) so when she woke me up in the middle of the night to look at spaceships my first reaction was &#34;go away.&#34;  My dad and sibling wouldn&#39;t get up either.  So she came back to me.  I felt bad at this point and out of sympathy got up to go to her room and look out her window.  She handed me bi-oculars and pointed south of our house over the cornfield.  &#34;There,&#34; she said, pointing in the east.  I saw nothing for a minute or two, but she insisted that I stay.  Believe it or not I saw it zip across the sky and stop suddenly, as quiet as a mouse.  It was like it was playing a game.  I saw it zip back and forth between it&#39;s starting and ending points a few times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We where looking south from northern most part New Lenox which at the time was pretty rural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to wake my dad up.  &#34;If they&#39;re out there I don&#39;t want to know,&#34; he said and rolled over to try to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom and I came to realize that there where two ships.  The one in the eastern part of the sky started to &#39;eject&#39; small &#39;ship like&#39; things to the west of it.  I have more detailed records of all of the &#39;ship like&#39; things and am going to send in the orginal record of this event as soon as possible.  In the west sat another ship across from the eastern ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the Eastern and Western ships started to &#34;do&#34; geometrical patterns. This is hard to explain- but we definately saw geometerial patterns in the sky- moving and changing color. It was eerily silent and beautiful. As it started to become light they seemed to stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day we made records of these patterns and everything we had seen.  I got on the school bus and looked to the east for the main ship and it was there! I wasn&#39;t a very social child at the time and besides who would believe me so I watched it as long as I could in awe of its sleek silver oval shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the bus ride home I saw it again in the Eastern sky.  A plane (a regular plane- not a jet or anything) started to approach it from the Northwest and I became fearful that someone would find it- but instead the UFO seemed to &#34;turn&#34; from the bottom up and blended in with the sky.  The plane passed as if the UFO had never been there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got off the bus and walked to my house backwards keeping my eyes on the UFO which had reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I entered the house and told my mom they where still out there.  We tried to talk my sibling and my dad into watching them with us that night- but they refused.  They didn&#39;t believe or want to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So my mom and I watched the ships for two more nights.  I never saw the Eastern ship in the daytime again.  But I always look there when I drive through town- just incase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We haven&#39;t seemed one since, but I find my self looking at the stars hoping to see a dash across the sky and a sudden quiet stop by a silvery ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said earlier I will try to find the orginal documents and send them to you ASAP.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

3/1/89 20:00|Poughkeepsie|NY|Chevron|1 minute|V-shaped formation on Vassar College campus|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77566.html|9|ndxe198903| V-shaped formation on Vassar College campus<n> <n><n> <n><n> The month and the time listed are approximate.  I was walking across the Vassar College campus from my residence, Davison Hall, to a music rehearsal in the Main Building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first saw the V-shape formation of lights as I was walking near the Strong residence hall toward the Main Building.  It was nighttime and dark outside.  I&#39;m guessing it was between 8pm and 9pm, possibly later.  It was a very clear night.  I just happened to look up and see a V-shape of white lights moving slowly and silently across the sky in formation.  There must have been at least 9 or 10 lights total.  I&#39;m guessing they were about half a mile up, maybe less, maybe more.  I remember trying to tick off the possibilities and really coming up blank as to what I was seeing.  Birds?  No, the shapes were moving too slowly and precisely, and they were lit up.  Planes?  No, there was no noise and no other light.  Helicopters?   Again, not enough noise and lights, and the formation and the movement was too slow and precise.   I thought perhaps it was a military exercise of some sort.  I did not see a wedge shape above the lights or anything to indicate that they were attached to a! larger craft.  They seemed separate, but all moving at the exact same rate of speed.  Some of the lights would &#34;trade places&#34; from one side of the formation to the other and then continue as before, which struck me as very odd.  When this movement occurred, the lights moved at the exact same rate of speed as when flying in the V-shape formation.  The lights continued moving over the Main Building and disappeared from view within about a minute.  There were other witnesses - I estimate that there were at least five other students looking up at the lights.  Some of them commented out loud about what they were seeing, standing in the street in front of the Strong residence hall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After doing some research, I believe that what I witnessed was part of the &#34;Hudson Valley&#34; wave of sightings in the 1980s, as described and illustrated recently in Leslie Kean&#39;s book, UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

3/1/89 01:30|Fort Worth|TX|Light|20-25 Minutes|A bright blinding light followed me for Several miles|5/3/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12729.html|11|ndxe198903| A bright blinding light followed me for Several miles<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a suburb of Fort Worth, Texas and at the time I was living on a fairly rural road by Lake Worth lake and I was driving a &#39;74 Chevy Blazer with limo tinted windows in the rear, anyway I was dating a young lady who lived off a road called 9 mile bridge road which was out in the less developed rural area, I had taken her home for the night and was on my way back to my house at the time (it was about 1:30 a.m.) when I noticed a light in the upper right hand corner of my mirror. Now, 9 mile bridge is a very curvy road with no street lights and all houses set back at least 50 yards, not to mention that the street is lined with woods and trees all the way down. Anyhow, I saw the light in the mirror and at first thought it was a street light so I looked back and noticed there was not a street light or a house light anywhere on the road. I was going 45 down the road and I kept a watch on the light which didn&#39;t seem to move until I got to an &#34;S&#34; turn on the road. As I made the turn I looked in the mirror, the light was gone. Then all of a sudden, it came back in the same area, well I had one more turn so I watched and it did the same thing. Then I came to a major highway (Hwy.199) and proceeded to get on it to get home and when I got on 199 I looked in the mirror and it was gone. So I traveled about 4 miles to the road I lived on and as soon as I was on that road the object was back and it followed me all the way back to my house (about 3/4 mile).I turned in my driveway and pulled up to my garage (my house is set about 100 yards off the road with nothing but woods all around it)and I always back my Blazer up so I wouldn&#39;t have to turn around the next morning, and just as I got finished parking, there was a bright light that came over. It was so bright that it blinded me to the point that I couldn&#39;t see anything around me, but there was not a sound, and the light was gone as it lit up the area. Now trust me, I was working security at the time and always carried a Glock 10mm with 170 grain jacketed hollo! w points with me, so I was well protected. After the light, it was all I could do to get in the house. I was so scared and when I came in I was running from window to window looking out with my gun in hand. My roommate said he had never seen me so scared in all the years he knew me. I couldn&#39;t sleep at all that night and can remember every little detail to this day as of 3/29/2000. That was over 10 years ago. Now I&#39;m not saying that anyone has to believe in UFO&#39;s but I know my experience and that&#39;s enough for me,<n>
