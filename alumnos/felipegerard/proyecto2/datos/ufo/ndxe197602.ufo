The stretch of highway 12 west of Baker to Plevna, Montana is about 13 miles. I remember there was snow on the ground. The moon was bright and in the east as I remember. About 5 miles or so into the trip we were driving along and south of highway 12 about a half mile away or so was a light that if memory serves me correctly was round like the moon which I found odd because the moon was behind us. It &#34;tipped over&#34; on it&#39;s side and was oval and seemed to be going the same speed as the car and I told everyone to look and they did. It went along with us as far as the hill before descending into the valley where we lived. Then suddenly it took off at fast speed and went down into the valley out of our sight. We drove down toward our town and parked near the grain elevator on highway 12 and could see it out in a field about a half mile to a mile away. It was lit up and the whole thing went off and on (lit up off and on) a few times and then in a circle in the middle different color lights came on and flashed and it did this a few times and then nothing more so my dad said he would drive us home and he would go out on the road and see if he could see anything and that was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

2/15/76 20:30|Sacramento|CA|Other|1-2 min.|6 hyphen-shaped yellowish-white objects flying as group but shifting positions from NE to SW (Reno-SF) at approx. 35K alt. and 450mph.|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61477.html|2|ndxe197602| 6 hyphen-shaped yellowish-white objects flying as group but shifting positions from NE to SW (Reno-SF) at approx. 35K alt. and 450mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the top of a building in downtown Sacramento I noticed 6 objects in the NE sky towards Reno. All 6 were identical, shaped like simple dashes or hyphens, and were oriented horizontally, (i.e. like the wings of an airplane, not the fuselage). They were the same bright, yellowish-white color as an ordinary light bulb filament.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they silently flew on a straight, SW path across the sky, they stayed in a tight group, while smoothly and continuously shifting positions in relation to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their speed and altitude appeared to be very similar to that of an average commercial jet at cruising altitude. It took approximately 1-2 minutes from when I first saw them coming from the direction of Reno until they faded from sight in the direction of San Francisco.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Objects were moving at near mach 1 or only slightly less (I am a pilot) and made no sound, flight path was straight and level to slightly ascending. The intensity of light radiating would easily have been in the multi millions of lumen, and had a purity I have only seen in the prismatic seperation of sunlight. On entering the town of Spooner about 15 minutes later and stopping for fuel,(a local policeman had to get keys and reopen a service station) the few people we spoke to had not seen anything unusual.  In 40 years of flying including three years in combat I have seen nothing remotely similar, the sight was so unusual I remember it now as if it were last week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

2/14/76 18:00|Memphis|TN|Disk|2 minutes|Mothership Sighting over Memphis Tennesee on February 14, 1976|4/1/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16938.html|4|ndxe197602| Mothership Sighting over Memphis Tennesee on February 14, 1976<n> <n><n> <n><n> In February 1976, I was enroute from San Francisco to New Jersey to work on constructing a nuclear power plant.  I am a graduate civil engineer and I was employed as an upper level engineer by an international engineering-construction company who had transferred me from the Trans Alaska Pipeline to this nuclear power project in New Jersey. I was on the interstate bridge that crossed the Mississippi River driving east near sunset on Saturday, February 14, 1976, in Memphis, Tennessee.  This was the first time I had seen the Mississippi River.  As I was taking in the sights, I noticed a large &#34;structure&#34; in the distance that was slowly revolving and had slowly pulsing lights, much like a communication tower but it was too broad, it was rotating and it had multi-colored pulsing lights.  That caught my eye.  I was looking east at the &#34;structure&#34; away from the sunset so it was hard to see the mass of the &#34;structure&#34;. The portion of the &#34;structure&#34; I could see was about a thousand feet above the ground.  The &#34;structure&#34;  (defined by a dim outline and the pulsing lights) made a precise vertical rise of an estimated 200-300 hundred feet and then a precise vertical descent of about the same distance.  At this point I was straining to see what supported this &#34;structure&#34; that was making this precise movement.  I could not see any mass or structural support under the portion defined by the dim outline of the &#34;objec&#39;s&#34; mass and the pulsing lights.  I realized then this was not a &#34;structure&#34; but it was an &#34;object&#34; and there was nothing supporting it.  It then began an exact horizontal movement to the west for a few hundred feet and then an exact horizontal movement to the east. I decided to get off the interstate and get directly underneath the &#34;object&#34; to get a better look at it and to confirm to myself there was no structural support from the ground.  As I was exiting the interstate, the &#34;object&#34; began an exact horizontal move to the west.  The&#34;objec&#34; moved slowly at first, then accelerated at an astonishing rate of speed toward the west until it disappeared from sight. The sun was still visible in the west.  The speed of its departure was so quick that I was still on the exit ramp while watching it disappear in the distance.  I heard no sound from its departure nor did I see any evidence of propulsion devices. I later performed a calculation to estimate the average speed at which the &#34;object&#34; departed.  I estimate that the time it took to travel from a standstill until it disappeared from sight in the west was at least 2 seconds but not more than 4 seconds.  The visibility was at least 100 miles and probably more.  That means the AVERAGE speed the &#34;object&#34; traveled in this distance was at least 90,000 mph and possibly 180,000 mph.  If the visibility was 200 miles, these speeds would be doubled to 180,000 mph minimum and possibly 360,000 mph. Description of &#34;object&#34;  The mass of the &#34;object&#34;; was difficult to see when I was viewing it in the east and it departed so quickly that I only viewed the mass for a few seconds.  However, this is what I saw.  The &#34;object&#34;; was disc shaped.  I estimate its girth at 300-400 feet.  The thickness at the middle of the disc was around 100 feet.  I believe the &#34;object&#34;; to be circular at its girth as it was slowly rotating without any change in its outline.  It had multi-colored slowly pulsing lights (yellow, green, and red) on its girth and elsewhere on the mass. I continued traveling on the interstate for a few more hours and spent the night a couple of hundred miles east of Memphis, Tennessee.  I could not obtain a copy of any of the Memphis newspapers to find out if the sighting was reported and published. I have not been back to Memphis since then, but I always hoped to be able to return there some day and research the archive newspapers to read about the sighting. With the advent of the Internet, I performed a search for UFO sightings on the 2/14/76 date to see if someone else had witnessed and recorded the sighting.  The only information I found was about a UFO Crash near Cubatao River, Brazil 2/14/76 recorded by ((a well-known UFO investigator)).  At the rate of speed I observed the &#34;object&#34; to be capable of traveling, it could very easily have traveled from Memphis to Brazil in a few minutes.  I tried to find out more information about the crash in Brazil but to date I have been unsuccessful. I certainly would appreciate a response from anyone who (or knows of anyone who) experienced the Memphis, Tennessee UFO, or who knows about the Brazil UFO crash. I hope to hear from someone.<n>
2/14/76 11:55|Flint|MI|Rectangle|20 Seconds|Spinning White 2'x 4' - No Lights?|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45023.html|5|ndxe197602| Spinning White 2&#39;x 4&#39; - No Lights?<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a story I have told many people but have never had a forum as which to formally report it.  In the winter of 1976, at the age of 10, while living in Flint, Michigan, my friend and I were excited about the big snowfall we had the night before.  We had a good portion of the morning climbing up the T.V. antenna and jumping off the house into large snow drifts.  The snow had stopped and it was just a cloudy day.  We were just about ready to go in for some lunch, but before we did, we climbed climbed up the antenna together for just one more jump.  I was above my friend near the roof top, when a white spinning object, the size of a 2 x 4, approximately 3 foot long came spinning around the corner of the house and then hovered right before us - still spinning - No Lights, just a faint whooshing sound as it spun.  We both staired at it in amazement as it sat there and spun.  I exclaimed out loud, &#34;Wow!  What in the heck is that thing?&#34; My friend replied &#34;I don&#39;t know!  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it!&#34;  We both were very nervous and did not know if we should move.  We both just stood there in the antenna physically and emotionally froze, staring at it.  After about 20 seconds, it spun back around the corner of the house and disappeared.  I remember looking at my friend and just saying &#34;Wow! Let&#39;s go see where it went!&#34;  We both jumped down from where we were on the antenna and ran around the corner of the house to see where it went.  We never did see it again.  We then both ran in and excitedly told my mother about the situation.  She just listened intently and then fed us both a hot bowl of chilli.  That&#39;s it!

Location was a quiet middle class neighborhood street in Fern Park Florida, north of Orlando.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While waiting outside for a friend, I was leaning against the rear of my car which was parked in the street. As I was looking downward, an intense white circular beam of light shown down from straight over head encompassing myself and only a few inches around me. I was startled momentarily and then looked up to see the source of the light which ceased as my head moved upward. Total time from light on to light off was no more than two seconds. The beam was stationary. It had strong edges as a stage spotlight would when striking the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began looking in all directions for the source and witnessed a vertical column of light being emitted from an unknown source, approximately ½- 1 mile to the north. Duration was similar to the first ,two seconds. Again, the beam of light was stationary and didn&amp;#8217;t appear as if it was from a moving aircraft.  It appeared to originate from two to three hundred feet in altitude. Time from my encounter to the second beam was no more than ten seconds(probably less).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time did I notice any sound nor did I see any craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
