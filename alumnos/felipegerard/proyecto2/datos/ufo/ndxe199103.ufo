It was flying in a slow motion and it appeared very big from where I was. I realized that was nothing like I was used to see, for it was flying silently, no noise was to be heard. At that very moment, I was walking my way to the university bringing coffees in my hands to my department with another pal walking with me. I said to him: Look! There! In the sky! He said: where? But he hadn&#39;t had the time to see it for the  &#34;thing&#34;  flew through the air and vanished into the clouds making a curved motion.I had never seen nothing like this before. When I went back to the department,I was shocked livid. I realized that I saw stg. unusual. I felt both weak and strong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

Stopped and then  sped off at lightning speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened over twenty years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After finishing milking chores on the farm and walking from the barn to the house the oldest daughter 13 and her 14 year old brother were walking to the house when they observed a double sphere orange glowing object quietly floating in from the South.  Another son 15 at the time was coming back from taking a spin on an ATV three wheeler.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object came in and then stopped and hovered probably less than 200 yards from the farmhouse.  I had just entered the house minutes before and had sat down on the sofa when a younger daughter came up from downstairs and was looking east out of the picture window.  She was spellbound and commented to me. OMG dad look at this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got up there was a bang and the whole outdoors lit up as if it was daylight and by the time I opened the door the object was gone in a flash traveling to the NE. Sparks were flying off the power line about 100 yards from where the object had hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am to this day not sure if the object bumped the power line or if just the pressure from the speed at which the object left caused the wires to hit each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both sons and daughter who were still outside saw the object and were no doubt rattled by what they had just seen happen.  This thing went from a dead stop to disappearing in not much more than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter went to school and mentioned what she had witnessed and although her science teacher supported her and said she believed the account, it is needless to say her classmates made jokes of it and she pretty much never mentioned it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A neighbor also saw the object cross the road behind their car as they were heading to town that night and there was a report in the Aberdeen, SD, paper that they had sent out a plane that night after several reports from the Mobridge and Glenham, SD, area that witnesses had thought they saw a plane coming down or crashing.  Nothing was found.  All this the same night about seventy five miles away from what we witnessed happened.   Again the object was a lighted double sphere that made no noise until it sped off..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Snow was falling and school had been cancelled the next day already. A snowball fight broke out in the front of our house with my brother and his friend. The back of the house backs up to miles and miles of forest. I decided that there may be more snow back there to make a snowball. I went in to the back yard to (which is about 70 yds and slopes downward into the woods) and noticed the trees in the woods background were lighting up in a flashing manner. I thought there may be hunters back there but the flashing light was way too powerful for any spotlight that local raccoon hunters would use. I thought it may be lightning but only a section of the woods was lighting up. The light was like a fluorescent white color and reminded me of a strobe light color. The woods would light up for about 10 seconds and the light (or beam) seemed to be scanning the section of the woods like it was examining the trees and then would turn off for 5 secs. Then this would repeat. It was tough to see what direction that light was coming from so I just continued to walk towards the woods. Finally I saw the object just below the tree line which consisted of mostly tall pines. The tops of the trees were rustling eerily, and there was a misty object that was disk shaped and bright that slowly moved away and zoomed off fast. No sounds whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I yelled again but no sound,get out, I&#39;ll kill you, get out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The grey ran around to my wife&#39;s side of the bed and I yelled don&#39;t touch her, leave her alone,leave her alone.

I had gone to see some friends play in their band. I was not drinking that night, because the night before was my birthday and I had a terrible hangover, so I was not about to drink again that night.  Once a week was enough for me!  Anyway, I turned on to a road that was the last mile to my home, where the speed limit was 50mp.  About 1/4 of a mile down the road, I glanced up to the right, through my sunroof, because something caught my eye. I noticed an object moving up along side of me, at a high rate of speed &amp; I got the feeling it was trying to catch up with me. By the time I got to my street to turn into my subdivision, it had caught up with me.  As I turned on to the street it began to stop &amp; remained stationary above the area I needed to go to, to get to the street I lived on.  When I first spotted the object I dismissed it as an airplane, because when I glanced at i! t I noticed a red &amp; blue light, and because it was running in the same flight path as all the other airplanes that come into the city. (But what didn&#39;t dawn on me at the time was that it was running in the opposite direction, and it was going way to fast to be an airplane.)   As I coasted to a stop, I realized it was no airplane. Upon further observation, I could see that the red light was larger and darker than an airplane&#39;s &amp; the blue light was larger &amp; darker as well, &amp; they were positioned side by side.  As I sat there wondering what this thing was, I thought maybe if I turned my headlights off, I could get a better look at it.  After I turned my lights off, it turned its lights off too! I rolled my window down some and realized there was no sound coming from it. Now it had been raining that night so there were some clouds in the area, but there was enough light from the moon that I could see the shape of the object. Which appeared to be saucer shaped. As &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; sat! there, it rose in the air a little and sat by a low hanging c! loud and then disappeared behind it. I realize now that it was waiting for me to turn my lights back on. But I was in such awe of what I was witnessing that I was dumbfounded by it. I wish there would have been someone with me at the time, or that I had turned my lights back on.<n>
3/8/91 19:00|Garden Grove|CA|Light|1 hour|4 individual ligths separate from main body, disperse then reunite and are retrived by main body|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57106.html|9|ndxe199103| 4 individual ligths separate from main body, disperse then reunite and are retrived by main body<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of March 8, 1991 at approximately 7pm, my wife and I were on the Garden Grove Freeway, headed west towards home. I remember that date and time exactly because that is my birthday and we were headed to our home for a “surprise” party. We noticed a very low flying bright “diamond shaped” light, flying just above tree level alongside the freeway. It was headed east bound as we were west bound. It was only approximately 100 feet up. At first we thought it was a helicopter because of the slow flight. We rolled down our windows to see and hear it better and we heard absolutely nothing. We then pulled off onto the side of the freeway, got out of our car and watched it. Usually even against a very dark sky, you can make out the outline of a helicopter or whatever, but we could make out NOTHING of any shape other than the diamond-shaped light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it “dropped” four different lighted objects…I first thought they were flares, but after dropping approx. 10-15 feet, each of the smaller “lights” took off in level flight in 4 different directions. We were stunned. We jumped in our car and followed the closest one, which was headed west, which was towards the Long Beach Naval Station. We drove to a high point, at a Mall, where we got out of our car and watched. From this vantage point we were able to track and see all four of the “lights” in the distance. In the meantime, after dropping the 4 “lights”, the main diamond-shaped light turned and headed slowly north/northeast,  in the direction of Anaheim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15-20 minutes, the 4 lights started heading N/NE back towards the main light. We again jumped in our car and followed as quickly as we could towards Anaheim. We then actually saw each of the individual 4 lights arrive at the main “diamond-shaped” light and slowly rise up into the “light” After all 4 were retrieved, the main diamond-shaped light took off at considerable speed to the north where we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do NOT believe in “little green men”. We checked the papers the next day and saw no other reports of this sighting, which is mind-boggling because of its location, and the duration of the incident. I am now a retired physician living in Las Vegas and have never seen anything like it since. To me, the most unusual aspect was that no shape was distinguishable against the night sky other than the diamond-shaped light<n>

Looking as though it was very far away. (across lake Erie, somewhere in Pennsylvania). This object appeared to be going down but in a winding motion, but the light never got larger or smaller. We observed the light until it went to the ground. The ground being somewhere close to the shore of Penn. I am not certain if it went to the water or land. Approximately 1 min. passed before the object started up but at a faster rate of speed, vanishing.<n>

It was clear out with minimal clouds.  I looked up and saw a silver/silvery white object, oval shaped, gliding in the sky at a high rate.  No sound.  It moved perfectly straight and very fast but seemed like it was gliding and almost weightless.  I pointed to it and my mother saw it also.  We watched it for about a minute.  It was so bright in color (silver) that it almost seemed white.  No windows, pefectly oval, nothing like a plane or jet.  As it moved, it seemed surreal to be seeing this, I had never seen any object in the sky like this before (or since).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

3/1/91 04:30|Minneapolis|MN|Egg|10 minutes|5-6 silver, egg-shaped craft desending one by one at early sunrise on Lake Calhoun in Minneapolis.|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12938.html|15|ndxe199103| 5-6 silver, egg-shaped craft desending one by one at early sunrise on Lake Calhoun in Minneapolis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking across Lake Calhoun from a window on the top floor of the Calhoun Beach Club. It was still pretty dark since the sun was just starting to rise. I saw something reflecting the sunlight to the southwest, and at first I thought it was an airplane since it was in the sky and the sun hadn&#39;t risen high enough to touch the tops of buildings or treetops. The window in which I looked from was open and it was very quiet out side, and I didn&#39;t hear a sound coming from it. As I looked I realised it could&#39;nt be a plane because it was too small; or a hellicopter because it made no noise. It was like a big silver egg the size of a small house, and it was wobbling back and forth and up and down slowly above some houses about one quarter of the way around the lake to the left of my view. it then calmed down and slowly started to desend. It seemed to drop in front of the houses but behind the trees before going out of sight. Then, there were more flying to the same area above the trees. First one, then another, then two at once. All were moveing in the same odd way, then slowly dropping down behind the trees and out of sight one at a time. I tried to wake up my friend who was in the bedroom and I brought him out to look, but he was mad that I woke him up and wouldn&#39;t listen. He just went back to bed. I didn&#39;t want to miss this experience though, so I went back to the window to see. In all, I probably saw 5-6 craft that night. I don&#39;t tell many people about what happend, since I recieved alot of flack about it in the past, although I wish I had written down the date and time. That was the last thing on my mind. If there is anyone else in that area of Minneapolis who has seen these craft, plese contact me. I am a sky-watcher now.<n>
