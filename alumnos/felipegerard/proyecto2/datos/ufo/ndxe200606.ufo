This was close to the Mississippi River. It was not moving and you really couldn&#39;t determine the shape but it had amber colored lights in the shape of a curved V. My husband stopped and exited the truck and the object was silent. My husband is not the type of person that would call me and be as anxious as he was. He said his hair was standing up and he almost went to the nearest house just so someone else could witness the object.he hurried to work to see if a co-worker would return to the site with him. he continued to watch the object,eventually he could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At least the size a football fields set up long ways I could not figure out the thickness, it seemed like a sheet across the sky, on the left end was a blue light and on the right was an orange light, we watched the object slowly move from the size of a plane in the distance to the large size move! over our apartment and we went out the front door to see it as it moved passed our roof out of sight so we could continue to watch, it was about 15 minutes before we saw a green light flicker on towards the right side then all of the lights quickly went out and the object moved  out of sight as it left we could see the moon and clouds reappear in the sky. (I very distinctly remember the fact that as it passed over us, it was blocking the night sky’s normal features, moon, stars, light clouds etc.  looking closely it appeared to have a reddish brown color) I’ve waited so long to tell this experience because I could not find any other witnesses and was afraid to be criticized but now I’m reaching out because I think this is important and want my experience to be recorded in defense of this type of experience ( p.s.  my sister went to bed after we decided the event was over… about ten minutes later her boyfriend slammed around the house and came in to my room and said” Where ! is she?!” I replied, “my sister?” And he said “duh where did s! he go??? ” I replied, “She went to bed about ten minutes ago”, he went back to the room and she was on the floor next to the bed in a disoriented state, he asked her where she was and she replied, “here in bed”, but she was on the floor and did not know she was on the floor…?)<n>

I simply cannot recall when it was but I wanted to report this hoping that it may help in some way, some how, even if the significance is miniscule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was parked with a friend off the road on the Clearwater Causeway. We were facing NE and it was later in the evening. My friend was facing me, and I was looking out over the water. The sky was a beautiful deep purple and was very clear. What happened played out very quickly. So quickly, that I did not blink. A bright blue light appeared in the sky. It just appeared, but then quickly got a slight bit larger, as if it was heading towards me. It had to be extremely far away. It was small, but at the same time it was huge compared to what a passing plane would be, or a helicopter. By the way it was not a helicopter light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never ever seen a light that strong or in that bright blue color in the sky before. It stopped and then went up and backwards like in the shape of a slight arch until I could no longer see it. It moved so fast that there is no other technology I can compare it to. You could tell it moved a vast distance when it left. I have tried to find what skeptics would call a &#34;logical&#34; explanation, but I cannot find one. I believe what I saw was a UFO. I have never seen anything before this occurrence, nor after, so far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

At least that was my initial thought. I continued to watch it because I was sitting at a stop light right next to the hospital and it continued to move slowly and rise as it also appeared to change shape and form an eliptical shape. Then as it continued on to the West, it formed a more rounded shape. My second thought was that it was a large black bird of some sort but the more I watched it and began to follow it, the more I could see it was not. I knew there was something else to this object that was more than just strange. It seemingly began to rise but only noticable because there were points of reference on the ground that made it seem to be going higher. A jet passed a good distence above it. It continued to move West and higher in the sky as I followed it. I came to a point where it seemed to stop moving in a Westerly direction and just continued to move higher while sustianing its rounded disklike shape from my point of view from below it. I watched it for another 15 or 20 minutes until it became so high to a black pin point in the sky and eventually vanishing from sight. There were no lights and no other features to this object that I could observe other than it was black and dementionless as it distorted and changed shape. There was no blure as I could see its edges very clearly eventhough they had the tendency to move into and out of position. This is unlike any UFO I&#39;ve ever seen before and completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was surprised by the event and have not reported it until now.  Not sure if this will be helpful at all, but here goes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it was after the year 2003 and before the year 2008.  I was in the parking lot of the shopping mall at Ventura Blvd. and Topanga Canyon.  I was in my car in front of the then PetSmart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My car was oriented towards the south so I was looking at the hills just south of Ventura Blvd. around Mulholland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what seemed to be a small black saucer shaped object rise up out of the neighborhood south of Ventura Blvd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t believe my eyes as I watched this object rise quickly into the sky.  I wanted to grab my cell phone and take a picture, but I didn’t want to take my eyes off the object for fear of losing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright blue skied afternoon with a few white fluffy clouds.  I watched intently and looked around a bit to see if anyone else was noticing and saw no one, just a parking a lot with cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eye on the object trying to figure out if it was a balloon or what.  It did not look like a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It quickly rose and then I could see it way up and glistening against a cloud.  The western sun must have caught it and it was shining now, not black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is it.  I have never even told any friends about this.  I don’t know what I saw, but it was surely strange and seemed to be what I have heard others describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There was no lightning or thunder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were walking along an old road enjoying a gap in the storm.  We arrived at a small meadow and pond where we saw the first of the seven tetrahedral UFOs.  It can from the west, directly behind the sun.  It swooped past and disappeared.  A precession of five other identical objects swooped past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I were frightened and left immediately.  We returned home and passed my wife&#39;s grave, who died nine years ago, on the way.  This is where we saw the final object.  It hovered over the church and rotated rapidly then sped away.  It was shiny greenish and almost seemed to be made of glass.  The objects appeared to be the church is bankrupt and rarely used so there was no one there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we were very scared, but it began to rain so we hurried home.

It was taken by a deercamera.  The deer camera we have takes 3 pictures simultaniusly whenever motion is sensed.  A deer came up and it took three pictures.  In the second picture this object appears in the top right corner.  It is a circular object that has a white face and glows like the moon.  We could see shades of red and blue around the edges when we blew it up.  The thing that makes us believe its a UFO is that it appears to have a face.  It has 2 eyes a mouth and what looks like to be a nose.  NO EARS! Its about the size of a basketball.  We tried to think of a possible explenation but everything we could think of isn&#39;t possible.  The camera was out there for about 2 weeks and took over 350 pictures and this is the only one has this thing in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photos, and we don&#39;t believe that the object, which is on the near side of the nearby trees, is a genuine UFO.

6/30/06 01:00|San Diego|TX|Rectangle|1 minute|In a moving car we saw this 300yd wide rectangle climbing straight up in the sky.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66061.html|20|ndxe200606| In a moving car we saw this 300 yd wide rectangle climbing straight up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a weekend and we were in High School.  There were four of us, Abe, Javier, Spencer, Pat and Jason (myself).  It must have been back in 1996 when this occurred.  I remember because I had a summer job working at a ranch with my step father.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving back from Alice, TX which is a town ten miles from San Diego, TX.  We would go there to look for girls and like the rest of times we came up short that night.  Well, we were about 3 miles from San Diego when a big white bird flew across the rode.  It flew from right to left, then up.  This is what caused us to look in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Abe was driving his small Ford Escort, (he was the first to see it) I was seating in the passenger seat.  Pat was right behind me.  Then next to him was Javier then Spencer.  Unfortunately Pat wasn’t able to see this thing from where he was sitting and now we always giving him crap about not seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, Abe shouts, &#34;What the hell is that!&#34;  I look to see and there it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> High up in the air was this Green Rectangle.  Looking at a full moon it would be twice the size.  The shape and color was awe looking.  I hear people say it’s like being in a movie but it’s not like that at all.  It’s real; it’s out of this world.  I’m feeling funny just writing and thinking of the magnitude of what we were all a witness to.  It’s scary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of it was green for sure, but the clarity of it was what gets to me.  It was like a green you’ve never seen before. The green was almost smoke like but solid at the same time. The smoke may have been the light reflecting off the clouds. The interior of it was black or we couldn’t see it. The size of it!!! I believe with all of my heart, that as far as it was and how big… it must have been 3 football fields wide.  That’s the one thing I’m mostly sure of out of this whole thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving up slowly, straight up, and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The interior of the car which was silent is now loud with gibberish and yelling with, &#34;What was it!&#34; and &#34;What do we do?&#34; it was chaotic for bit but we gathered ourselves and went our separate ways that night.

6/30/06 01:00|Cookeville|TN|Sphere|8-12 minutes|Close Encounter and Sighting.|11/14/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115350.html|22|ndxe200606| Close Encounter and Sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of 2006, my then girlfriend and I were staying with my cousin.  Oddly enough, I used to live with him during my teen years, and being that he was in the military and then a city police officer, he had high powered lasers for his rifles etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can recall many nights sitting outside around 2002 and pointing this laser into the vast sky and thinking what if?  During this get together my cousin had there were many balloons but none with helium and definitely not any that would fit what I am about to tell you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside smoking a ciggerette, we were not allowed to smoke in his house.  I glance over cause i see the still existing patch of woods swaying back and forth.  This was odd cause it was a dry and calm night with almost no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walk toward the road and look to my right and up from the tops of the trees an almost colorless or reflective sphere seemingly floats out of the center of this wooded area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I see this I immediately am drawn to it.  Saying to myself where did this balloon come from.  As I am watching, I realize this is no balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere makes no sound, shows no propulsion mechanism and seems to actively reflect the color of the street light directly it and myself (orangeish/red).  As I keep trying to convince myself this is something earthly, I instantly felt connected with it as if it was intelligent or being controlled by some form of intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself, I have to get my girlfriend no one will believe this if I dont, then it moved in a hovering fashion about ten feet higher from where it was stationary above the power lines.  I mean this thing was like 35-40 feet above me and at one point as close as 20-30ft.  So I went over all the movie lines in my head about aliena once I sensed some sort of intelligent control from this object, like we come in peace and me thinking.  to it I will not hurt you what are you and in a sense, I swear it made me feel safe, empowered, watched over and took off literally in the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it left from a hovering state it flew away ratjer slowly as if gaining.  Momentum but then it hit hyperdrive and cleared one end of the horizon to the other in milliseconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object up close was just noticeably 12-18 ft in diameter had no sound no lights and could.travel at beyond or near light speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is more what felt like dialogue during thus encounter and it would take an interview to really explain how amazing it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since my encounter, My knowledge has increased to a considerably higher status and I have survived a fatal car accident in which I bled out entirely and was helivacced to a specialised trauma unit.  I also have noticed what seems to be increased empathy or maybe a development of telepathy.  I really feel like I hear when someone is thinking, specifically in connection with them thinking of me and only in close proximity.  I swear this sounds crazy but I swear on the lives of my children I am telling you the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s like I sense the things a person does not want to tell me, like I can hear their thoughts about me literally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel whatever it was it was other worldly and was visiting due to a signal that was an.accident on my part and took four and a half almost five years to get a reply for (me shining lasers with the aspiration of reaching e.t.)  It&#39;s like it knew or could hear me telepathically communicating the memory of me trying to send that signal cause i felt like its visit was my answer.  Yes we are here and Yea we hear your desire to communicate, obviously I had considered throwing things at it while it was hovering above me to see what it was.  Not movement no words just the thought of doing it made it move further away and then it flew away when I THOUGHT of getting someone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is so much more to this than I have time to type on my cell but I did want to report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also noted where I lived was next to an abandoned airport in my town that was right next my highschool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE OBJECT BECAME THE SIZE OF A REGULAR STAR IN THE NIGHT SKY BEFORE I COULD EVEN BLINK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distances it covered and way it traveled is unlike anything known to physically exist on earth.  Atleast publically but from there in cookeville it traveled north north east toward and obviously over livingston, tn and albany, ky direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also noted timeframe is fuzzy I would.have to ask my cousin what day he sold his.house and him and i do not speak. so this sighting/encounter may be related.to.others during that year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d like to think since then that I kind of have a guardian or witnessed a recon mission lol<n> <n><n> <n><n> Live long and prosper friends.<n>

IT WAS SOMETHING WE KNOW THE GOVERNMENT DOESN&#39;T HAVE. ON MAY 31,2007 MY FRIEND AND I WAS REPAIRING MY ROOF THEN OUT OF NOWHERE CAME THIS OVAL SHAPE OBJECT. THE OBJECT WAS SMOKY BLACK COLOR WITH A BIG RED LIGHT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIP. IT WAS VERY CLOSE TO US, MAYBE 600 FEET IN THE SKY AWAY FROM US. IT WAS 60 FEET IN LENGHTH, 30 FEET IN WIDTH AND 20 FEET IN HEIGHT. MY FRIEND AND I WAS SHOCKED AS WE WATCH, THEN THE OBJECT STARTED TO COME IN OUR DIRECTION BUT WE LEFT THE ROOF QUICKLY.

On closer inspection ( as I zoomed in on the image) I can clearly see a disk shaped object with a domed top. The object seems to be grey in colour with a dark patch on the base. The picture was taken at about 6pm on a warm sunny day. There are a few clouds in the sky and the object is clearly below the clouds<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was reclining on the back porch talking on the phone when I saw above the high clouds a white object.  It wasn&#39;t a lit up, but rather must&#39;ve been a white surface.  It was not moving as fast as the clouds were, almost still.  It must&#39;ve been several miles up, very far away, since I was not able to make out a shape at all.  I got off the phone and continued to watch it when it disappeared right in front of my eyes.  I was surprised at that.  Then, a few moments later, about 10 degrees east, it reappeared.  It stayed in that position for a few minutes.  I looked away for just a moment and looked back and it was gone.  I searched the same area of sky to make sure my eyes weren&#39;t just straining and it was definitely not there anymore.  After several minutes of searching the rest of the sky I was sure that it had gone, at least from my sight.  It was definitely not a weather balloon or traditional aircraft.  I was perfectly coherent and awake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I could not identify a shape because the light was bright in an asymetrical form. Im going to say it landed because it hovered in a way for a long time at house level. I could not get a clear shot because i did not have a camera at hand and my camera phone had too much glare from the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first one circled three times before taking off. Married middle class, middle aged. House, kids and a cat. We were just enjoying a beatiful summer evening when my husband pointed out the lights. We watched until there were no more, and plan on looking again tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

6/28/06 11:30|Sault Ste. Marie|MI|Cylinder|1hr. 10minutes|Long cylinder shape with chrome mirrored dome top viewed coming apart and reatatching itself over Sault Ste. Marie, MI|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51289.html|36|ndxe200606| Long cylinder shape with chrome mirrored dome top viewed coming apart and reatatching itself over Sault Ste. Marie, MI<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 28, 2006 I was measuring my backyard and preparing it for concrete when a big object caught my attention out of the corner of my eye. It was right over the neighbors house about 600-900ft. off the ground. I estimated that distance by using a radio tower which was right under the object as my way of figuring out how far off the ground it was. I believe that the radio tower is approximately 300ft. tall. It looked to be approximately two maybe two and a half of those towers from the ground. there was no noise at all. I grabbed my 12x50 binoculars and viewed the object for approximately 35 minutes without any movement at all. During those 35 minutes I made a drawing on my clipboard of the object as I viewed it through my binoculars. I wasn&#39;t going to call or tell anyone due to the fact of what other people might think. I figured I would just watch the thing until it took off. This thing was unbelieveable! It was tall and slender with a long shaft coming out from the bottom. On the top at an angle from the top and side was a chrome mirrored dome and there was a chrome gold reflection coming from around that same area. As I was watching the object through my binocs the dome turned towards me then stopped and a small object came out from the bottom of the long shaft and floated towards the top. It stopped beside the top of the craft and orbitted around the it twice before connecting itself to the top. Then the dome turned back towards the direction it was first facing which was NE and it never left that position the whole time. Right then I called my father-in-law, who is a sargent at the city police department, to come over and view this thing as a witness but he was sleeping because he just got off from his night shift. I told my mother-in-law that this was no joke and that they should get over here as soon as possible because there is a UFO over the house and that it was coming apart and reatatching itself. She told me to call the police, which I immediately did. I told the dispatcher who I was, that I was Mel&#39;s son-in-law and that this was no joke, and to send someone over right away because I believe there is a UFO over the house. The dispatcher laughed and said &#34;sure, I&#39;ll send someone right over&#34;. My mother-in-law arrived by herself which was about five minutes after I called. (police never came). By the time she arrived it moved a little higher and to the south and stopped. She viewed it through the binocs as well and couldn&#39;t believe it herself. We both watched it for about 20 minutes before the neighbor pulled in next door. She viewed it for about 10 to 15 minutes before it disappeard into the sky. The dome never left its position facing the NE. It would move a little bit and stop. It did that about three or four times heading south and then it just moved slowly at an angle towards the atmosphere and disappeared behind a cloud. My mother-in-law went home and called the city police department and talked to one of the officers at the desk and asked why they didn&#39;t go out on the call and they said they were never dispatched. So the officers came over themselves after talking to my mother-in-law but by this time we never saw it again. They questioned me and waited a while to see if it would show again but it never did. I know the officers personally and they know I would have never called on something like this unless it was true. My father-in-law talked to the captain and they suggested that I go to your web site and log what I saw. I strongly believe that if the officer or anyone else with a video cam video taped this thing at that close of a distance for that long a period of time, that there wouldn&#39;t have been any other civilian evidence on earth with that much visual detail! Especially when it came apart and reattatched itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was handed the bonoculars to look for myself.  What I saw was a flying object that I could not identify.  It was 2 sections, the front or first section was a rectangle with an off center point ( there is a name for this rectangle that escapes me.) The 2nd section or end was a longer thinner rectangle about maybe 3 times as long with a different surface than the first. The first appeared to be a solid material, the 2nd was a more open con-struction like a cell tower would look. My neighbor saw a piece from the end section go up and attach to the front. At that moment he called the police,who did not respond until his mother in law ( who is the wife of a policeman) called again. I am a hairdresser, age 52. My neighbor is in his late twenties or so, he owns his own company, ((company name deleted)), his mother in law , as I said, is the wife of a city policeman.<n>

The light burned out after about 20 seconds, leaving behind the streak of cloud. As i continued to watch the sky I saw that another object had continued on where the other burned out. This one was less obvious but was also leaving behind a thinner and clearer trail behind it. I turned onto Moorpark Ave. and noticed two people on foot pointing up to the object also. I pulled over and they asked me if i thought it was a plane and i said no, as we continued looking at it the light got closer and brighter (yellow) and kept moving. Then it sprayed some kind of cloud like material (white and streaky, like a rain shower or fireworks, except it looked like cloud material) after that the brightness disappeared but the object was still present, looking like a lightly glowing orb. It continued on and away from us, eventually disappearing over the horizon, in a southward direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First I thought it was a plane, then a rocket, a missle, and it left a huge smoke line across the horizon and a smoke that looked like a question mark were it took off it seemed about a 200 miles away then after a few minutes it&#39;s behind me hovering. Some people traveling in the opposite direction pulled over to watch it.  I got scared and starting driving faster and looking back at it.  It was about a 1/2 mile behind floating like a huge cylinder or cigar shape, a huge pringle can dark in color with 4 lights coming out of it and two were beaming down to earth.  I was about a 1000 to 2000 ft off the ground.  I thought I was going to die or get abducted.  I could not believe my eyes, I have a small video of it.  No one I tell believes me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However, there were no flashing lights. No red, no green, no flashing white. There also was no sound that we could hear above normal traffic noise from I-35 a mile away. Had I more presence of mind, perhaps I would have jumped up and ran further toward the back of the yard to keep it in sight a little longer. Not hearing it, I sort of expected the sound to catch up, but it didn&#39;t.???<n>

I did and shortly after steeping out on the back patio I saw a white round shaped object traveling from the North East to the South West almost straight overhead - maybe 15 degrees off of vertical. The night sky was clear with a few scattered wispy clouds and stars were clearly visible.  The object appeared to be a satellite, but I thought it as a little large to be a satelling and though it might be the space station. It was traveling fast but was very high up so it took a while to move accross the sky. I first noticed it when it was approximately 45 degrees up from the horizon.  I and watched it travel along a straight line until it was approximately 30 degrees from the horizon.  The thought that it could be a UFO came into my mind and I thought &#34;Well, if you are something not of this world then show me a maneuver so I know for sure.&#34;  I really wasn&#39;t expecting it to do anything as I was still sure it was a man-made craft.  At that point I was just about to turn around and go back into the house when it started wavering, then stopped dead and immediately (one second) went back the same direction it came from. I remember thinking &#34;satellites don&#39;t do that.&#34; The object traveled a short distance then stopped. Two smaller objects came out of it and moved downwards, one to the right and one to the left in an upside down V pattern.  I kept my eyes on the larger object and watched as it faded out as if moving away from the earth out into space. It was too far away to tell exactly what it was doing.  I did not find the other objects in the sky after that and don&#39;t know where they went. The time on the clock when I returned was 4:05.  I locked the patio door and pulled the drapes but was a little ancy about going to sleep after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It didd&#39;nt come out verry good because they were moving pretty fast but you can still see them. Then another 10 seconds and they were gone. Since everyone who lives near me had gone to worK this morning, I think I was the only one to see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot be certain as to whether this is supposed to be a serious report.

Earlier in the afternoon on 6/24/06, we were cleaning out my closet and found my night-vision moncular and decided it would be fun to look at the stars through the monocular later in the evening.  At 2354 that evening(6/24/06), we turned off the lights in my single-story condominium and proceeded outside on my patio, which does not have a screen.  I turned on the night-vision monocular and looked upward directly above my head (12 o&#39;clock high position)and was looking at a brighter star and then proceeded to focus the monocular.  Once in focus to my amazement, I noticed movement of a dimly glowing circular object in the reticle.  The object gave off a glow as well in the night-vision monocular and I advised my girlfriend, &#34;Honey, I think there is a satellite orbiting across the sky here!&#34;  I showed her the object that was moving in a west to east straight trejectory across the sky at a phenomenal rate of speed, no turns or deceleration or acceleration were noted, therefore assuming this object was a satellite.  We then proceeded into the house and got online with the NASA website to see if their were any satellites that could be seen in our area but the NASA website indicated there were no satellites visible for our viewing area.  I then assumed the object was more than likely a classified satellite.  To quell my curiousity, we both went out on our patio the next evening (6/25/06) and began to scan the sky in the same area with the night-vision monocular intentionally at approxiamately the same time as the evening before in anticipation of the same orbiting satellite.  We were on the patio, and I told my girlfriend jokingly, &#34;I wonder if we will get lucky and see my satellite again?&#34;  At 2354, myself looking through the night-vision and my girlfriend looking with her naked eye, she shouts,&#34;Honey, what is that?&#34;  At precisely the same moment, the object that she described as being spherical and red in color, came into the reticle of the night-vision monocular that I was using giving off a dim glow.  My description would be the same as the night before, the object was round in shape but I could not determine any color due to looking through the night-vision monocular.  We both tracked the object for approxiamately 3-5 seconds, which once again appeared almost in the same exact area in the sky as the night before.  Once again, the object was traveling in a west to east trajectory but was moving at a higher rate of speed than the night before, as well as performing two sudden sharp turns, one hard turn right then a second abrupt turn to the left and then disappearing behind a cloud lower on the horizon.  The object had no trailing tail similar to that of a shooting star or made any noise whatsoever.  The sudden dynamic turns the object made was incredible, and being a veteran of the U.S. military, I was convinced this was no conventional aircraft.  In conclusion, my girfriend and I are both left with no explanation of what this object could possibly be.  I assumed from the night before, in my mind, this was an orbiting satellite, now we have no clue to what this was and why has it appeared twice at night consecutively, and furthermore, why has it appeared almost at the same exact time???<n>

It traveled fast enough where the light that it was giving off formed a &#34;tail&#34; of its course that lasted a split second.  I am a college educated young professional who has never made any report like this in my life.  I am 100 percent sure that this was not any type of man made aircraft and honestly have never been so scared in my entire life.

When the lighted object passed over us it dropped one of the lighted balls.  We observed the falling light that looked similar to a falling star and we watched and heard it hit the roof of a suburban about 25 ft away from us.  Then we watched the light continue on and drop another before it just vanished.  The object was flying in a horizontal line and did not appear to be ascending or descending.  We went to see if we could find any fallen matter but there was nothing.  There was not even a dent in the roof of the truck.  The loud thud we heard from the golf ball size light surely would have left some kind of mark. We also checked the following day and there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first one was traveling from West to East. It was orange metallic in color and very large,it left no trail or sound. The craft looked like a giant passenger aircraft, without wings or vertical or horizontal controls.  It had no visible openings of any kind.  The aircraft traveled slowely directly overherhead in a streight line. As the craft moved past my location, two smaller objects appeared in the distant sky. One was traveling from the sky line to the North and the other one came from the South. The two smaller craft were white in color and were traveling very fast. The one coming from the North arrived first.  It stopped about Center bottem of the large craft and dissappeared. The second craft,moving from th South,arrived almost at the same time as the first and at the same location;however it stopped and made a u-turn and entered the other side of large aircraft. They all continued on Eastward out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all occured on a clear,star lite late evening night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

6/25/06 14:00|Newport News|VA|Other||Small metallic object hovering low in sky|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51641.html|66|ndxe200606| Small metallic object hovering low in sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was driving eastbound on I-64, 1-2 miles before the Jefferson Ave exit, when I saw a shiny object ahead in the sky.  It was fairly low to the ground, not even as high as a bird normally flies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object appeared to be hovering, although at the speed I was traveling (about 65-70mph) can not be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down slightly as I got nearer.  Object was no bigger than a beach ball, shiny metallic, reflective material, no real geometrical shape, looked like pieces of metal twisted together, seemed to have sharp, angular edges.  Reminded me of modern art sculptures I&#39;ve seen in art museums.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still appeared to be hovering as I passed under it, and angled my left side mirror so I could watch it as I drove away.  It remained in eyesight as I drove further, perhaps got a little higher, but virtually unmoving.  It was directly over the two lane highway, not over the median but the traffic lane itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other aircraft or vehicles in vicinity, object did not appear to be attached to anything.  FYI the Jefferson Lab is located near by which conducts ongoing nuclear physics research, however I don&#39;t think they would test something directly over a busy interstate highway in plain view of civilians.  I emailed the local news stations to find out what kind of devices they use to track weather conditions, etc. but this was no weather balloon and the gentleman responded saying he had no idea what it could have been.  This sighting was also called into the hotline by myself the day after it occured.<n>

It did so due to the fact that we&#39;ve got a very low celing - at 2:08 it was reported to be at 1600 ft. with only a 5 mile visability (It&#39;s drizziling in some locations). It was traveling east to west at a very low altitude and totally cleared my visable horizion in 5 or 6 seconds. No noise, no descent angle, very smooth yet very fast and absolutely no other colors or strobes, just almost the color of a green traffic light. I&#39;ve seen many, many various aircrafts in my life at day and night but this, for sure, was no conventional aircraft that I&#39;ve ever seen. Due to the weather conditions, it struck me as being so very odd that I&#39;d be able to see any aircraft whatsoever in the sky, let alone one this low in altitude and traveling at such a speed(not blazing speed - but very fast but yet so very smoothly - it&#39;s difficult to describe). I&#39;m at odds with all of my logic, so I figured I ought to report it to someone...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After a couple of mins each light in turn glowed very brightly and in turn vanished, then there was a streak of orange light that shot through the sky and they had vanished. We were all shocked and we can all be sceptical at times but nothing would describe the feeling we had when we witnesed something like this i will never forget this as long as i live and now belive there must be something else out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was much lower than a large passenger plane or blimp. No sound was heard. It was low enough that I should have been able to see wings, tail and windows but I saw nothing. The sun was shining directly on the object. It saw it twice in June, each time it was around 7:30 (19:30 hrs). It was in view each time about 30 seconds. The direction of travel was SW to NE. There was no way to tell how big it was except that it appeared to be about a half an inch at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have one airport, Regional. The runway does not accomodate large planes. Planes traveling across Missouri are always at a higher altitude than this object was. Small 2 or 4 seater planes fly over at a lower altitude and it is always easy to see detail such as wings, tail and registration numbers. The engine noise is audible as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this object again on July 4th, 2006. See that report on NUFORC website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what I saw nor can I guess.

I&#39;m sure it was round, but it had something hanging like a baloon string, but it also could have been a light from whatever it was. When my doughter came back to the car it was still up there, but she would not look up and by the time I would have told her again it was past the Post Office, and I could no longer see it,I don&#39;t know what it was, but it was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am well traveled and have seen lots of oddities in my lifetime. The event I witnessed last Saturday morning was disturbing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An employee and I were standing in the parking lot of my business chatting. It was a bright sunny day with spotty high clouds and a very light breeze. I noticed a large number of small clouds suddenly form in the sky to the north just below the upper cloud level.Curiously, these small clouds started traveling downward in an arc. Other small clouds appeared behind the first, and more behind those, forming a steady stream of clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three larger clouds appeared. These cloud objects traveled across the sky in a straight line formation to a point overhead and remained stationary during the entire event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The steady stream of smaller cloud-like objects continued their downward arc at a slowing rate of speed. As they neared our position, the mist surrounding these objects began to disappear, revealing shimmering egg-shaped objects. The skin of these objects were a bit translucient. As the objects lowered in altitude further, this skin became completely transparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects reached treetop level just over our heads, traveling at a quick rate of speed, approximately 50 mph. Hundreds of them passed overhead. The outer skin of these objects appeared to be a membrane of sorts. Inside this membrane, another object appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The inner object was a segmented globe, much like a soccer ball. The outer skin of this object seemed reflective--reflective not of the sunlight but of the sky around it. Struts or wires or something protruded from the bottom of the globe to a pointed horseshoe shaped thing with bright silver flashing lights on the underside. These lights flashed in series from the rear of the object to the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After passing over our heads, these objects headed skyward. They disappeared at a point just below the cloud level.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no flashing light as usually associated with plane or helicopter. The light was very bright, many times brighter as the brightest star in the sky. There was no clouds at all. The air was humid. The size was about 20 to 40 times the one of a star. At first sight, the object has seemed a few hundred feet above the water. I was unable to distinguish any shape. It was stable with no noticeable sound. It has stayed at a fixed point into the air during about two or three minutes. Then it has moved slowly from right to left, near vertically, and went up in the air slowly until it has disappeared completely into the sky, very high as a tiny spot. My young boy and my little girl were with me they has seen exactly the same thing as me. Two other people passing by have asked us what it was. They were curious as us? I think it was pretty near of us near the Quebec’s river side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 11:00 p.m., we have observed the same thing but farther away from Aylmer’s marina. It was looking like to be near the Ontario side of the river. We have seen two light, less bright because further, but it has had the same moves. First, these light were low in the horizon, then it has disappeared the same way has in our first observations. These two lights seemed to be near of each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have seen another light still further away that has the same characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think other people should have seen this, because there was many hundred people there during this evening, because the summer activities there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The later photos show the object coming nearer but both the objects didnt appear to be moving sideways or up and down, the white object just coming closer.The only other way to describe the white object was looking like a hot cross bun!<n>

Same as in the other report, group of 3 to 4 rapidly moving lights acting in unison. They move in rapid circles getting further and further from the center light before stopping then moving rapidly back towards the center light. This time they would go out including the center light when they reached it, then appear in a different place. I watched this for about 10 minutes before it stopped. This time they were red blue and green with the center light being a bright white. There were storms in this area Saturday Sunday and Monday but I dont think the lights were a result of the weather. It was not raining when I saw this but had been within the past hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights??  PD))<n>

It was outlined by 8 white lights, one at each corner and one in between.  Within were another four white lights, also a diamond formation, and 4 or 5 red ones.  The lights were spaced out evenly and symmetrically suggestion a solid shape. Looking around I saw that there was no-one else on the street.  It moved slowly from East to West, making no sound whatsoever, gliding through the night sky. It disappeared from view behind an apartment building.  I followed it waiting for it to reappear on the other side when I realized it had moved far off in the distance.  It’s hard to say how big it was, but my guess is up to a mile wide.<n>

But the only difference was this UFO was moving very slowly across the sky in a sort of floating motion a movement I have not seen matched by any aeroplane. It got to 10:35pm and as I looked up at the tree tops which sit very close to my home in Sunderland which is in the north east of England, UK, I saw a strange light ball UFO going across the sky the UFO was about the size of a golf ball if you were to throw a golf ball up into the air. The object was completely silent there was no sound of any aircraft or any other aviation related craft as the object was completely silent and unlike planes that pass by it had no flashing lights at all. I successfully videotaped the object going across the sky I videotaped for 1 Minute and then the UFO went behind the trees and out of sight. I got to a higher vantage point but the UFO was nowhere to be seen below are a few details about the video that you should all remember while viewing it. When I was viewing the object I had time to think of explanations but none seemed to be credible it is definitely unexplained and the object is definitely an Unidentified Flying Object. I have had many sightings in the past and this one has got to come somewhere in the top three it was amazing seeing this light ball floating in the sky it felt like something off the X-Files TV program.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Video Details: In the video I shout &#34;I thought It was a star minutes ago&#34; that is not true I made a wrong assumption at the time as I had been observing a star that looked very similar moments before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To view the video visit this link -<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.alienationsam.com/MY%20Encounters/Light%20Ball%20Video%20-%20June%2023rd%202006.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We viewed the photo, and we cannot certify that the anomalous object is a genuine UFO.

When first sighted on the horizon, you could only see 2 apendages but when it went overhead, you could see 4.  Shape was not fluctuating or changing like a bunch of balloons but remained steady.  It seemed lower than planes approaching Atlanta Airport.  It seemed to be travleing over 100 miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up to see 3 shiny or white &#34;dots&#34; that formed a triangle.  They were so high in the sky that I couldn&#39;t make out what each dot was. As I focused in on them, I noticed other &#34;dots&#34; flying with the three that were in triangular formation.  I quickly ran over to my neighbor&#39;s house where my husband and my neighbor and another man were working outside building a garage.  I had a hard time finding the objects in the sky again, as they were so high up, and so small.  Finally, we located them.  We watched the three that were in triangular formation change positions and were no longer flying in a triangle.  My neighbor started counting all the &#34;dots&#34; and counted at least eight! They kept on changing positions, moving to the left or to the right. We noticed some in pairs (briefly, then they&#39;d change position again) They looked about the same size as a satellite, that you see at night.The speed they were traveling across the sky was about the same speed as a satellite travels as well (maybe a bit slower).  They were flying from the NW to the SE. We were able to watch them for a minute or two before they were not visible to the naked eye any longer. We heard no noise, and they did not leave a contrail.  A commercial jet flew over at the same time, and the objects we saw were much, much, much higher than the jet was flying.  My occupation is a teacher&#39;s assistant, my husband is a carpenter, and my neighbor is an engineer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was standing at that bank of windows when, to my north-east, I saw two oval objects seem to rise together out of the trees in a nearby neighborhood. What impressed me were two things:  1. The difference in altitude remained very constant. The forward-aft distance changed slightly, but they seemed fixed to each other in altitude from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. Both objects looked identical, but with variations in color/configuration. These changes were seen in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, we have a lot of traffic to and from Ellington airfield, including formation flights of the local Air National Guard. These were most definitely F-16&#39;s as the ANG unit uses, and their relative position/speed was much slower than that of any plane at the apparent alititude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for a description of the objects:  1. Somewhat oval in shape with possibly points to the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. The main bulk was white, the bottom black, and some red on the top surface. The shape and relative proportion of these features changed periodically during it&#39;s visibility to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the objects transit from their position along a rough vector west to possibly north-west. After Two minutes, the objects passed beyond the corner of the building. I was not able to re-aquire the objects in view after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more side note, probably coincidental: I saw flying along the same basic vector, shortly after the objects were obscured from my view, a small aircraft, possibly a helicopter. It was moving much faster than the two previous objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were somewhere in between Riggs and Pecos Rd.&#39;s when my attention was caught by a crescent shaped object above South Mountain. The outside was white and middle appeared to be blue and it was floating on an axis. The object blended into the sky quite well. I stared for about 3 seconds, trying to figure out what this object was(a cloud or a plane, maybe?), when all of the sudden, it turned on it&#39;s opposite axis and went into a &#34;hyperspace&#34; type mode and vanished. I said nothing to my husband until we returned home that evening. He said he saw nothing and thinks that I saw nothing either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

During I saw many odd light movements, I figured we were near a military base so it was just jets and helicopters and what not. After fishing late in the night while heading home I noticed you can only see some buildings between the gaps in the bushes when looking at them from the road. After driving a while withen a few seconds I noticed that once a clearing opened to one house I noticed an orb over the house, lighting the entire building. Leaves were thrown up and I begged for everyone to stop and look. No one noticed and I panicked as I was concerned for the people in the building. I looked back only to notice the light of the orb reached out to the road from beyond the opening in the trees as small as it was. I said &#34;oh my god oh my god oh my god&#34; for about three hours yelling and panicking trying to explain what I saw as we drove by that small opening. Everyone thought I made it up and laughed. *After reading the details of making a r! eport I figured I should note that there was no sound* To the point it was a concern though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I initially mistook that for a lightning but it floated in a up to down direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object occupied approximately the size of 5% of the night sky. Earlier in the day, the day was sunny and a litle cloudy. No sound was emitted from the mysterious floating aurora. The light emitted from the aurora is uniformly white, like a cloud or someone shining a torchlight from the sky.<n>

I was driving into my neighborhood from east to west.  Out of nowhere came a huge green fireball.  It traveled rapidly then disappeared. It only lasted about 15 seconds -tops.  My first thought was not actually a meteor, ufo or comet. It actually was about north Korea&#39;s recent threats to test fire a missile( I did not logically think about distance from N. Korea and the possibility).  I then continued home.I had never seen anything like that before.<n>

It was a shinny silver silver colored object. I slowed to about 20mph and noticed other drivers looking up as well. It was a half moon shaped object that seemed to be changing directions. As i got closer to it I could see the shape, as if when it was level it was very thin. It was turning around, so it went to a 45 degree angle and to a 90 degree angle then very thin again as it went from South to North. It wasnt moving very fast because when I first saw the &#34;sparkle&#34; it was about 45 seconds until the shape started to change and I could see the definition. There were no clouds, birds, or airplanes in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed, over the nearby parallel north-south runways, a very small black object moving in a straight line under the clouds going in a direction from northwest to southeast ..perhaps at an altitude of 1000 to 2000 feet...its speed was that of a slow moving airplane not a jet...but not as slow as a bird...The winds were gusting to 35mph which I had checked on our company&#39;s weather information page prior to taking the elevator to the top floor of the building and the airport was closed at this time for takeoffs and landings. The clouds were literally swirling in 3 directions overhead and windshear must have been pretty strong  ...all air traffic on the ramp had come to a halt and no planes were landing.  This object was big enough to be noticeable but too small to determine the exact shape which was so frustrating though I want to say that it did not look aerodynamic for some reason.  There was no wing flapping motion and even though one of my friends told me it had to be a bird, I&#39;m not certain a bird could hold it course going through a severe thunderstorm without being tossed around or altering its flight path . I would think at this point it would be blown all over the place as even we were being buffeted and pushed around by the winds. Nor could a bird traverse the entire airport In 1 minute as it had crossed the field in a straight line neither moving up or down and as it traversed the airport going south east I could see that the object neither moved to the right or left but continued on this straight axis to the end of the cloud build up....possibly 2 miles away then swung up at the end of the cloud bank and went into the upper clouds in an extreme parabolic path....its flight path was neither typical of a bird or a plane. 1 thing was puzzling and that was even when it was at its closest to terminal A we could not make out its shape yet even when it was far away we could still see the black object....<n>

My boyfriend and I both noticed that it made no sound, and the lights almost appeared to be spinning. Neither one of us had ever witnessed anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly from the distance we spotted an object in the sky travelling at an astounding rate of speed and leaving behind a huge fiery tail. The tail had different colors but mainly consisted of a bright blue. It stretched from one side of the sky to the other and was 20 times wider than the trail a jet leaves! We heard no sound whatever and the object disappeared out of sight in a matter of seconds. Also as we pondered what this could have been we noticed there were numerous planes in the sky. Was this just an coincidence or were they looking for &#34;something&#34;?<n>

During this time I witnessed 10 moving lights. The first I seen one moving light or as i call them Traveling Stars! It was coming from the southeast moving north. It moved slowly, then disappeared. A moment later coming from the west another Traveling Star was going to the east. That as well disappeared. About 5 to 10 mins after that, i seen 3 Traveling Stars in a triangle formation, moving together slowly, then fast then slow again. I called my 22 year old nephew out side he came very fast, by the time he got out there was a 4th, they all moved together in like a alomst box formation, then the 4th disappeared and the 3 continued to move. I asked my nephew if he seen what i had seen and he said yes, and this time i dont know what to say! He was in shock. As we watched them go south, and disappear. 2 more came from the north and south, they were both moving in a slow manner, they were goign straight then the would move to the side. Now the movement goes for all traveling stars. Then when i was about to go into my house, 2 more came from the west and proceded to the east. I have to say this was so crazy.. They seem to come out more if I had my cell phone with me. I have observed this for some time. I think they like the light that flashes on my cell phone. Also there was one traveling star that was flashing it light and then it would disappear, i seen a total of 2 flasher!<n>

It was in the shape of a pulsar with something redish inside of the pulsar golden glow. It was not a shooting star or meteor, no tail no straight trajectory. It approached and then rolled off to my left which would have been due east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No noise whatsover.  I saw 2 windows square shaped.  A red light was shining from both windows.  I jumped out of my car and yelled &#34;Oh My God!&#34;.  I ran to the train track as I was yelling.  It immediately disappeared near a factory.  After a few seconds I saw it on the other side of the factory, but the windows were dark...it was like a shadow. No more light. Whoever was in it had become aware of me.  It made a U turn and totally disappeared after that. The size of the egg was about half of my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was approaching a traffic light when something in the sky caught my attention.  I figured it was a plane but it was moving horizontally across the sky at a fast pace.  It was definately on fire and there was a smoke trail behind it.  I was concerned that it might have been a small plane that was on fire but then I realized it didn&#39;t make sense because it wasn&#39;t falling it was moving in a straight line across the sky.  It was hard for me to follow it because I was driving and I didn&#39;t want to cause an accident.  Nobody else on the road seemed to pay much attention to it.  Eventually it became obscured by some trees and I could not see it anymore. I did not hear any sound associated with whatever it was.  It never occured to me that it could have been a UFO until I stumbled across this site.  I had wanted to read more about the UFO sighting at O&#39;Hare airport.  I am still not sure if what I saw was anything other than a shooting star or a comet.   I don&#39;t think it was a shooting star because this was at least the size of a golf ball maybe a little larger.  But I guess it could have been a comet?  I have never seen an actual comet before (except in pictures) so I have nothing to compare it to. I really wish that I had been able to watch whatever it was more closely but hindsite is 20/20 I guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I am used to looking at the sky at night working midnights, at first I thought it was a shadow from losing part of my night vision due to lights, but she confirmed she was seeing it at the same time. We both felt like it was something there. it seemed to me to be stealthy and observing and my wife and I felt compelled to walk away. I went back 10 minutes later to see if it was a cloud or something, there were no clouds in the sky and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned to a relative to ask if there happened to be satellites at this level, to find out that we were miles upon miles too low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked again and saw the object much futher away, yet still very visible. There were no markings whatsoever on it--in fact, it was perfectly smooth with no indentations, bolts, lights, exhaust, or anything of the ilk. It was floating rapidly in a straight line. No accelerations--just a steady fast, straight dash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A moment later, it was completely out of sight. I had a good 25 seconds to inspect this object, and I know very well that I was not hallucinating. There were no clouds at that level, and it was initially close enough to see with perfect accuracy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What it is, I don&#39;t know--but I do know that I&#39;ve never seen (or honestly, heard of) anything like it before.<n>

The object was stationary.At first I thought it was a satellite in a polar orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After maby five minutes two other objects came into view taking up a triangular formation. It was like light reflecting off a metal surface. The light was flickering and then the two other objects were in focus. The objects remained in a stationaty position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes following this two other objects also appeared to the east of the three objects. The position of the three objects was to the west of the airport and the other two to the east of the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within fifteen minutes the first object left the formation and moved in a southern direction. The speed of the object was slow as if it was taking it&#39;s time with, the remaining objects holding their position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After whatching the moving object I looked back at the remaining objects and another object took up the position to form the triangle with the formation now smaller. Following this cloud cover moved in and I lost the oblects above the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the sightings the sky was clear with unlimited visibility. So, the objects stood out against a clear blue sky. Thinking about it now it seems as if the objects were entering our atmosphere and appeared to be under intelligent control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The tail was white and the ball of light falling was blue and white. My friend about crapped himself and i was freaked a little but it was pretty cool to see. the light was in the southeastern sky came from the middle of the sky down it fell for about  5 seconds and then was gone and this was the whole experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought maybe it was a headlight from a plane or something, but I quickly realized it was too low and too large. Before I could even say anything to my fiance it completely vanished. No trail, no zip, no nothing. Just vanished. I looked around for about 10 minutes to see if there was a plane or something coming out of the clouds ~ looking for a reasonable explanation ~ but there was nothing, so here I am sending you this note.

Witnessed by lab personel as well as 3 physicians and nurses. About 15 witnesses in all. The flying object entered from southeast at rapid rate and came to immediate stop over the city of Boise. It appeared to be at the same altitude that we were watching from, which was probably 2 0r 3 hundred feet higher that downtown area. From our position it appeared to be directly over the State Capitol. From our position, one could not determine its exact shape, because we had mostly a side view. It would be like looking at a disc from its side view. Its height to widith ratio would be like 1 to 300. It appeared to be either metallic or glasslike in nature. I was much longer than any commercial aircraft. It refracted colors sequentially along its entire width, and looked like how windows look from a distance when sunlite refracts off their surface. When it departed, it instantly accelerated at a phenonmenal speed and disappered over Bogus Basin to the north of Boise, about 20 miles from the city. It had no gas trail, and of course we were too far from the object to determine if there was any noise. The peculiar fact was there was nothing in the local news after the event. I was asked to call airport and see if they had it on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked over to the lunchroom checkout counter and used the public phone and called the Boise tower. I was given a UFO report number at Mountain Home air force base and made the call. I cannot recall to whom I spoke, but it was an officer, and he was anxious to receive all the information. After speaking with him for about 5-10 minutes, and answering all his questions, I asked him he he could confirm this sighting. He replied, that they had picked up the object somewhere south of Salt Lake City and had lost it as it moved toward the North Pole. He also willing told me that the object&#39;s speed was in excess of 6500 miles per hour. He said that the airforce had nothing in its arsenal near that speed. he thanked me and I have never told this story to the public before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

While sitting on the swings i noticed a large Red/White/Blue light pulsating about 25 miles away in the sky. I figured it just to be a plane, and i asked my girlfriend, ((name deleted)), what she thought it was and she figured it was the light pole on top of Stone Mountain. The object&#39;s lights where in a pattern just like this...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Red  White  Blue. I still thought it was an airplane, until the lights all fused together making a brilliant shade of red and green. The object then began to move left to right in paterns that no modern day aircraft could handle. The object dissapeared behind trees, but reappeard seconds later much closer to us. The object seemed to be about 200 feet off ground about 200 yards away. As soon as it appeared it dissapeared behind the trees. When it reapeared it had to have been 60 yards away at about 150 feet off the ground. I was trying to capture this in Sarahs camera phone, it was moving slow, and made absolutely no noise at all. I could only see the two lights on either side of it.

I had been viewing jupiter and we were looking to the south. I noticed a light orange colored light moving from North to South at a high speed. I estimated that it must have been moving much fast than a normal aircraft but not so fast that I ruled it out as such. It appeared to be at a very high altitude. I had a pair of bushnell 12X50 binocs handy and I was able to get a good look. There seemed to be two lights. One big one in front and one tiny one in back. I did not see any red or blue lights on it nor did I see the normal type of strobe that are on most aircraft. I asked my father-in-law what he thought it was and he didn&#39;t know, but he said he thought that it zig-zaged a little. I must have been messing with my binocs so I did see that and plus it is hard to hold steady when you are looking at a distant object with binocs. A few seconds later the craft vanished as if it when behind some clouds but there were none. I am certain it was a cloudless night because as most people know clouds affect astronomy. It almost looked like it left the atmosphere. Could have been a plane but it was very odd for one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned my head to the South and thought I saw Jupiter, which I though peculiar as the last time I had looked, it was obscured by the houseporch and I did not think it could have moved that far W/SW in the time we spoke. I got up and saw that Jupiter was indeed still behind the house and this object was a bright as Jupiter but was not Jupiter. Then it began to move, coming out of the area of the constellation Corvus, at a soundless, swift but steady speed. My friend saw it move at the same time and we both, still linked by phone, watched as it disappeared-or grew to faint to be seen- beneath the stars of Cygnus to the North.

It had a solid golden glow on the side points which extended up and down slightly. It looked like the bottom section of the diamond/cross was longer then the top and sides. We couldn&#39;t tell what direction it was moving in. It started moving up and down vertically, in a straight line and then horizontally. We then lost it behind a hill(the island is quite hilly). We drove for around 4/5 minutes before I saw a light on top of another hill and then the other observer saw it as well before it went down behind the hill. Again we drove for a few minutes but I kept getting distracted by a light in my rear view mirror, but no car would come up behind me. The third time I was distracted I saw shadows moving like something was in front of the light. I said to my partner that something was behind us. He looked back and the object was approx. 600ft behind us and 100ft in the air. He got a clear look at it and it was a diamond/cross shape with a slightly longer bottom section. There were golden lights on the two side sections spreading up and down along the vertical section. There was also a red glow on the top and bottom points, slightly spreading up and down along the ends of the vertical section. It followed us for a couple of seconds and then shot off very fast.

This bridge provides an excellent panoramic view of the sky, perfect for capturing images of clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I considered stopping at home first, to grab my Nikon D50, but I could tell I was testing my wife’s patience as it was. To my everlasting regret, we proceeded with my cheap digital camera that I kept in my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got to the bridge and I walked out to the center of the bridge and took about 20 some pictures. The sky was partly cloudy (25% cloud cover?) but mostly blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I finished, I walked back to the other end of the bridge where my wife stood waiting. As I talked to her I noticed two grey spheres flying toward us from the East in tight formation, the one nearest us just above the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew at a constant speed and trajectory from East to West. I was so excited I forgot that I had a camera in my hand. I kept asking if my wife could see them, but she could not. By the time I finally got my composure, the objects had begun to pass behind an apartment complex in front of us. Unfortunately the next mistake I made was to switch my camera to the movie setting, not realizing that the resolution is so poor it would not pick up the objects. I took a short video which is completely useless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many different aircraft in my 43 years on this planet, these objects defy conventional classification. They were not weather balloons, I have seen weather balloons. They were perfect spheres, metallic gray, but not too reflective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured that the reason my wife did not see then was the glare. Despite the partial cloud cover that day, it was actually a very bright day, and I had polarized prescription shades on. As the objects passed through the sky the seemed light gray, as they passed in front of clouds they seemed darker. They disappeared on the Eastern horizon. From the time I spotted them to the time they reached the Eastern horizon was less then a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both independently spotted a metallic, triangular object which appeared to be &#34;hovering&#34; (no discernible movement or jet plumes visible)about about a 15-degree angle in the vicinity of Cheyenne Mountain, home of NORAD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both thought it might have been a large advertising balloon/blimp, but the object appeared to be much too high in altitude (maybe 1/4 mile high) and we could see no trace of attaching ropes or attached cables. We had a very clear view of the object as the skies were very clear that afternoon. We did not see any obvious lights and did not hear any noise. There was no obvious interference on the truck radio and cell phones were not in use.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We viewed the object for about 30 seconds and then lost sight of it when we passed some trees on the side of the road. When our view of the sky was restored (3 seconds time), the object had completely vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a beautiful sunny summer day. I looked up and saw a plane like object and I thought, &#34;That&#39;s cool, that plane is positioned so it looks like it has no wings.&#34; It was a little bigger than a cesna plane. Then it turned so the sun reflected off it from left to right and I could see that it had no wings or tail for that matter. I could see in the light reflection that it was made of silver metal panels and I could see where one panel ended and the other began. There were four panels on the side facing me. It moved a little bit more and the sun reflected off it again from left to right. For that to happen it had to make a turn that a regular plane cannot do. Then it started to fade in the front portion and it continued to the back untill it dissapeared completely. It was like it &#34;went behind a cloud&#34; but there were no clouds, it was a beautifull blue sky. Then it reappeared in the same manner and the dissapeared the same way and never came back.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It wasn&#39;t completely filled so we decided to lay out on the trampoline and wait. I said lets look at the stars while we wait. It was night so we had a flasflight. I said oooooooo look at the star its shining so bright...As we kept looking that star that was shining  bright started to hover and as it hovered in the sky we noticed green red and blue lights...abd this circular figure had 1 big ballish thing in the middle shining brightly...thats what made us think it was a star. I said to my godsisters do you see what i see and they said yes.so we shined our flashlight in the sky and as we did it moved closer to us...so we turned it off and another figure just like it took off before our eyes with the snap of a finger...we&#39;ve never seen anything move that fast. As we looked around at other parts of the sky we noticed about 5 more. They all were hovering and a gigantic circle with their lights bliking...Red, Blue Green Yellow! In that order. And we said that they couldn&#39;t be planes because planes cant hover. And hovering is when something can move but be in one spot. Kind of like floating. This shall go down in history!<n>

Higher than a Skywriiting plane!  Each occurence has been against a crystal-clear bluesky backdrop.  You can make out that the object seems to rotate in place; the sun can been seen glinting off the object as it rotates.  With the naked eye, it appears to be oval; but in the picuture I canptured, zoomed in to 1600%, the object seems to be triangular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each time I would call out my wife to confirm what I was seeing; she could immediately see the object, on both occasions, and it looked to be the same object, in about the same  location in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noted commercial airliners, high flying birds (gulls) and even the Moon; these all  help reference how high the object was.  You would really have to be looking for it with the naked eye or you would simply see a clear blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to have a haze around it not real clear. This is the third Sunday I saw this objects and I compare the brightness to a dim light bulb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1 minute later there were two streaks across the sky. A bright object with a trail to the west of me then I saw another one way out to the east both went in a south direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have noticed that I see this objects on Sundays?  This is the third Sunday I saw this objects and I compare the brightness to a dim light bulb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t report the second sighting on 5/21/06 about 9:20 PM EST or 01:20UTC and I&#39;m almost sure it’s the same object that I have been seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t have a video camera to record these objects but anyone reading this if your near the Boca-Delray Beach Florida area watch the sky to the east on Sundays between 9:00-10:00PM and you may be lucky enough to capture these objects on tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They move around to fast for a Camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not seen any other objects except Sunday Night and I think there is a Pattern to look at here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have looked every Sunday since the first time but some Sundays were cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look at the sky every night and these were not a satellite or plane I know what they look like and how they move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also these objects are totaly silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a small private plane nearby this time and I wonder if anyone in the plane maybe saw or reported something?  I have seen alot of objects in the sky before but these are real objects from elsewhere besides the 2 sightings I had as a kid in the 1970&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s all the info I have but strange that I have seen this 3 times and all on Sundays.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ll keep watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks ((initials deleted))<n>

I looked up and saw the flash fade out.  Once if faded to a certain extent it moved to the right (south).  If u held a ruler at arms length it moved approxamitely 5 inches.  After it moved the the right it completely vanished.  All 4 of us saw the flash but i am the only one who saw the movement to the right.  I am the only one who doesnt have to wear glasses though, so this could be of the impairment of their vision that they didnt see it.  My father commented that it could be an iridium flare that we saw flash in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From my perspective the object was located within the region between the big dipper pointer stars and polaris.  The object did not move in a straight path.  It did not deviate much from it&#39;s location.  It only shifted about in a tight, eratic pattern.  I observed the object for approximately a half of an hour.  I reported my sighting to the Amateur Astronomers Association of Pittsburgh by phone.  The gentleman there said he could not see the object from his location in Frazier, PA.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The best way to describe the light and what it did is to imagine a light bulb 65 watts in the distance just floating through the air. A faint light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then imagine that light bulb turning and rotating towards you and when it was pointed directly at you it was like a spot light like on a police car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was super bright and remained on me for maybe 2 sec. then what appeared to be rotation back down and then very quickly matter of 3 to 4 sec. fade to nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there and though that maybe there was a cloud that I couldn’t see and wanted to see it again but it was gone.

Numerous satelites were seen during this time span.  NO BEAM CAME FOR THE GROUND AT EITHER SPOT, IT WAS JUST IN THE SKY.  It almost looked like it had a nucleus and beams of light shot from the nucleus North and South off of it at both location. Somethimes brighter than other times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was wittnessed by a Pilot and a Marine, and could not explain what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw the object, and went inside to get binoculars for a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was donut or ring-shaped.  The center was hollow, and I was able to see the sky behind the object.  It appeared to be black in color, and traveled from the southwest towards the north.  The object moved at a slow speed (about 30 minutes after the sighting, a large commercial jet flew over our house, giving me an idea of the object&#39;s speed).  I would estimate the speed at approximately 1/6 to 1/8 the speed of the passenger jet.  As it traveled, the object seemed to roll, allowing me to see a profile and a side view of it.  I was able to continue viewing the object through binoculars for between 5 and 10 minutes, until I lost sight of it in distant clouds.  Each of the 4 of us present viewed the object with bare eyes and with binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not appear to be flat, based on my view when I saw its profile.  Rather, the part that seemed to stay at the top of the object seemed raised, as compared to the flat bottom of the object.  The object did not have any visible lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather was clear with ample evening light and no cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My brother went inside to get two pair of binoculars to better see the object.  The object was black and donut or ring shaped and appeared to slowly rotate or spin on a horizontal axis.  You could clearly see the sky through the hollow center as it rotated.  The object moved in a roughly south to north direction and was visible to the naked eye for 5 to 10 minutes.  Using binoculars enhanced what we could see with the naked eye.  The craft had no lights, and did not seemingly emit or reflect any light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried calling the local law enforcement, the local airport (in which direction the object was heading) and the FBI in Quantico, VA.  My calls were either not answered or I was given the brush off and not taken seriously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was approximately 500 to 1000 feet off the ground and moved very slowly as if drifting through the sky.  To give an approximation of the speed in which it traveled, we watched the object cross the sky for between 5 and 10 minutes.  About 10 minutes after the object disappeared from view, a passenger jet was flying in a south to north direction (same as the craft), at a low altitude (a couple thousand feet, probably) and crossed the same area of sky that the craft did in about half a minute to a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Also noticed a white dot/light below the other two moving somewhat faster.  first two did not move as fast as a plane and at one point seemed to be still for about 2-3 minutes.  The white dot moved slower than a plane, too but was faster moving than the red-orange dots.  Note they moved westerly and the closer towards the sun, they did not change in color and eventually were lost due to the sun in our eyes.  This was witnessed by 4 people after getting them to see the first &#34;dot&#34; that was noticeable.  No trail. No noise. No aura. No sound.  Just the &#34;dots&#34;.

I just saw it again, moving slow, slower then a plane, but you know its a craft and I been seeing it do many different moves over the pass months. I seen it blink multpy times from place to place, heading over in different parts of the sky, but mostly it just does a slow control course through the sky. Now its always white object, like a star and there is no other light colors that would suggest this was a plane. I think its some type of govonment plane, since I keep seeing the same type of object or same craft over my street and house. No where else in the town but where I live I see it. It is with out thought a UFO and not like a normal plane. I know it doesn&#39;t sound much like a great UFO story, but its constant coming over my street and everytime I try to film, or grab camara, it always disappers when I come back out(where it is slowly moving across the middle of the sky), So thats all I can report, I just hope someone else has been seening it and not just me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went to check it out.  We watched the film at regular speed the first time and saw several little specks appear and disappear too fast to see what they were.  We slowed the video down to a crawl and watched several small flying craft, that looked a lot like flying oreo cookies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds later this large &#34;line&#34; of lights showed up, the way the light hit it a few times made it go from translucent to kind of a plasma looking thing, all that was really clear were the lights. using zoom, we were able to see it was rotating, and the lights were actually pale shades of green pink and yellow, alternating as it spun around.  It didnt fly straight, rather jumped around, the smaller craft looked like they were trying to &#34;stir&#34; up the air to keep the larger craft concealed.  After examing the film, we decided to go outside and look at the space it happened in,  at exactly 5 am in the morning of the 17th, we saw it appear on the horizon, again the way the sun hit it, it seemed to &#34;uncloak&#34; for a few moments, there appeared to be a shape to this of an egg, the lights going around the middle with the small end towards the top and maybe a quarter of the egg at the big end out the bottom, it was like looking into water. there were a lot of &#34;sparks&#34; that appeared in the sky, thats how fast they were, they only looked like sparks to the naked eye.  again we got out the camera and tried to catch some of it on film.  Then a Second large ship appeared behind the first one, they both moved in a south east direction across the sky, the smaller ships were like a whold armada flying around the larger ones, dissappearing and reappearing again,  it appeared like they would go in and out of the big one, but you couldnt see it enter it, only where it would appear again at the top of the big one.  I only know I was akeptical of what was told to me about what they had filmed the morning before, also at exactly 5 am.  And that in the first light of the day, with the sun coming up, it did something to the way they were able to conceal themselves, this was not a jet trail, and were not falling stars.  And it seems they have a habit of hanging out over the top of the power plant at 5 am.  There seemed to be a distortion of the sky around where they were, magnetic field possibly? My friend has  the camera and the footage taken of this phenomena, I am still just flabbergasted that it was still in the same area two days in a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I continued my walk to the movie store as clouds obstructed the view. As I came back the clouds were cleared and the light was brighter than any planet or star I&#39;d seen. I looked up and saw a dimmer one moving nw. the one moving nw quickly stopped, switched directions and accellerated towards a fast moving satellite. Once it had got close enough it had pulled a fast semi-circlular dodge, and dropped behind it, then it slowed almost to a stop, I had then called my mom out, she came out side to watch it move as well as the first one. We went inside. Then at 00:40, I went outside to see it, I had only saw the first, however, I heard a military jet flying away. Our last commercial jets over our city is at 20:00. Unfortunately, I do not have a film camera, but seeing the one pull evasive manuevers was damn cool.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/16/06 22:30|Fairfield|TX|Formation|4 seconds|4 lights racing across the sky, then stop for a split second, one semicircles the others then all take a 90 degree turn and race away.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51012.html|157|ndxe200606| 4 lights racing across the sky, then stop for a split second, one semicircles the others then all take a 90 degree turn and race away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a perfectly clear starry night we observed 4 objects streaking across the sky from the southwest to the northeast. As they approached, all in the formation changed speed and position with the trailing object second from the right overtaking the other 3. As this happened, all four came to a stop, the one in the lead circled back around, making a right hand turn. This stop and turn took less than a half second. All 4 objects then streaked away to the north/northwest at an incredible rate of speed. The entire event lasted less than 4 seconds, all four objects crossed the entire visible sky in this time. The altitude of these objects looked to be at least at the extreme limits of the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To give a relation of the amount of time involved, I saw the objects racing across the sky and told my brother to &#34;Look at that!&#34; and before I could say &#34;meteor&#34; the objects stopped, one in the lead made a semi circle right hand turn to line itself back in the formation and the other 3 made a 90 degree left turn and raced out of sight. Each object was reddish orange in color and roughly the size of a bright star in the sky. None left a trail, they resembled a satelite as it tracks across the sky, but the speed of them along with stopping, circling and changing directions in split seconds leaves this out as anything manmade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, a jet airplane took a similar route but took approximately 7 minutes to cover a lesser portion of the sky, I mention this as a speed comparison only. The only other object I&#39;ve ever seen with comparable speed were shooting stars. None of these stop or change directions though. All the shooting stars I&#39;ve ever witnessed also left a trail. These objects left nothing in their wake, no trail no sound. Just incredible raw speed and manuverabilty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 4 objects were not trailing one another but were in a formation, roughly equal distances apart and varied speed that changed their position as to which was leading. When 3 came to a stop, it was only long enough for the one that overran the formation to circle back, the 3 that momentairily stopped immediatley resumed the speed from before and raced out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We thought at first it was a plane&#39;s headlight coming straight toward us but realized that it was stationary in that part of the sky; an odd light due to brightness and amber color.  As we watched it for several minutes it slowly began to fade to a barely visible point of light, not moving from that location. At that time my friend said she saw an arc of light in that same area and afterwards a fast up and down shaft of light lasting a second. I was scanning the sky elsewhere so I didn&#39;t see what she saw. There were other traveling lights in that same area but they looked like far-off planes; the sky was very clear.  We could not come up with any explanation for what we saw other than a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went back to call my neighbors so they could witness it with us. We could not tell what shape it was because it was shiny white, bigger than the North star.  It came up from the South, moving in a northeast direction, then disappeared off into the distance. I&#39;ve seen these kind of moving objects a few times before but usually witnessed them by myself or with my daughter. It was a fun experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The third sighting was again during the day.  I still cannot believe this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a passenger in a vehicle traveling through Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.  Literally, the top of the world.  We were headed west over Trail Ridge Road, (the highest continual road over the Rockies that is closed in winter.)  It was a Saturday in June of 2006, around mid-afternoon.  As we approached the highest part of the road over the mountains, I looked out my passenger-side window, always in awe of the majesty of the peaks, and saw a silver sphere traveling silently to the east.  It was probably no larger than a mini-bus, but completely round, constructed of silver panels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving silently and I watched it for a few miles as it continued east through the park.  Eventually it was out of my line of sight because of the mountains, but I cannot get the vision out of my mind.  Like the night time sighting! several years before, the pace of the craft was very slow.<n>

Bright saucer shape. Appeared to be silver but reflecting like a mirror. Remained stationary for the duration of the sighting, but disappeared out of a perfectly clear blue sky when I took my gaze off the object. The lack of movement made the object catch and hold my attention. The sighting was brief, eerie and unexplained.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were arranged in a very flat triangle quite closely resembling Aries&#39; three brightest stars in overall shape moving from northwest to southeast.  The lead &#39;star&#39; corresponded to the one furthest from the other two and was easternmost of the triad.  It was the faintest at a maximum magnitude of about 4.0-4.5.  The central object was brighter by about half a magnitude and always was to the WNW of the leading object.  The final object was brightest at magnitude 3.0-3.5 and was always positioned almost straight west of the central object.  Compared to the other satellites I saw tonight, the triad moved more slowly, covering about 10° in a minute.  The spread of the objects was about 1/4 the actual size of Aries, covering maybe 2° in total width.  The objects passed below naked eye visability a few degrees above Sagittarius, possibly blocked by a thin cloud that was covering that part of the sky.  There was no deviation from straight-line flight, nor was there any changes of relative positioning of the three component lights.  Aside from some scattered clouds, the skies were steady with only minimal light polution near the horizon.  The Milky-Way was very clearly visible, and stars were visible to below 6th magnitude.  Seeing was excellent with virtually no turbulence (stars weren&#39;t twinkling).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also have a very old record of another sighting I made in 1979, coincidentally in the area of Ophiuchus by Serpens Caput, but that time the objects were definitely not satellites, as they stopped and reversed direction.  If I find the note, I&#39;ll make a separate report, as I recorded the date and time of observation when it had happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The driver was promted to pull over when there was a clearing from the trees.  When we pulled over, we noticed an incredible bright light that was very far away but seemed very close.  The bright light was of an orange/yellow tint.  The object was not moving but rather hovering in one spot.  Shortly after the driver noticed the light was dimming.  After the light dimmed out it turned a very vivid orange color and began to move very fast.  Then as it got further away red lights began to circle the bottom of the craft giving away its shape.  It looked like an upside down top.  While it was moving away we noticed an airplane traveling directly for the object which was so close that we thought they would crash.  Then we noticed three other objects in the sky as the main one got further away.  The other three consisted of a very bright white light that blinked inconsistantly in different blinking patterns, all of which were hovering.  Once those began to move they also began to change color  (mainly red, orange, and yellow).  As they got further in the distance we realized that all four objects were traveling in the same direction.  After the objects were covered by the trees, we began to travel further down the road when the passenger in the back noticed another object towards the left of the road which was a bright red at first and then changed to an orange color.  This light, dislike the others was a clear solid light that clearly changed.  At first the three lights on the objects were horizontal to each other, but the further it got and as the color changed it went to a vertical pattern.  When we could not see it anymore, we then drove to our distination not seeing anything else for the rest of the night.  Strangly while we were seeing all of these objects, there was several planes in the air which were completely different then the other 5 objects we saw giving it a distinct difference between an unknown aircraft and an airplane.  This event lasted between 15 and 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My girlfriend was driving directly behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of my interior lights went out in my car.  I picked up my cell phone to call my girlfriend behind me to ask her if my tail lights were still on.  As it rang, the lights came back on and I saw a single light cross the over my car from S to N.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend told me when we got back to the apartment that she never saw my tail lights go out and her phone never rang.  I put the phone down and saw another light cross over my car from S to N.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were white, steady and round.  I was in moderate traffic so I wasn&#39;t able to give the lights more than a glance so I couldn&#39;t estimate speed or altitude.  I assume other people saw them because the traffic in front of me slowed down to 45mph as this was going on.  It reminded me of driving under a plane as it comes in for a landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My radio was off and I didn&#39;t hear any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work very close to Tampa International Airport, right in the flight path.

We saw a disc [bright as moon but whiter] in the sky at about 15 or 20 degrees elevation which my wife an I joked that it could be a ufo but most likely was the moon between two cloud layers.  About 10 minutes later arrived home [mountain top home], my wife got a phone call and I went outside to look for the ufo or moon [It turned out there was no moon or clouds that night]. I saw the ufo at once low on the horizon maybe 10 or 20 miles away and hovering at maybe 1000 ft or less.  I ran inside to get my binoculars [variable 8 to 24 power] and yelled to my wife to hang up the phone and quick come outside.  She could see the ship sparkle with her bare eye and with the binoculars I saw the ship , bright white and sparkling [The moon would have been yellow this near the horizon. I was looking ENE, the moon would have been to my east. My viewing location was 40-40-50 North and 074-57-14  West. The ufo moved around for about 30 minutes or so at low altitude then slowly moved north out of view behind the trees on my mountain!!<n>

This was not lightning, at least like none I have ever seen. There were only a few thin wisps of cloud in the sky; stars were plainly visible. This was a clear night. The light pulsated approximately every 10 seconds and appeared to be rectangular -- standing on end. The flash happened quickly and last approximately 10 minutes. It seemed to change location slightly from flash to flash. I held my hand out and it appeared to be about an inch long when I spread my fingers. It was in the southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Last night as I was standing outside talking on my cell phone in the driveway.  I looked up and noticed a bright single light moving across the sky at appox: 4-6,000 feet.  I have nicknamed this light &#34;flying silk&#34; because it moves across the sky at a seemingly effortless pace that I would estimate to be about 400MPH.  It emits no noise that I have ever heard, it has no strobes, nor aircraft navigation lights of any kind that I have ever observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last nights observation had the object/light moving from Southwest to Northeast almost parrallel to the coast line.  I mentioned it to the person I was talking too on the phone an said something to the effect of &#34;well there it is again&#34; to them.   I consider myself to be a seasoned aircraft watcher and this object is like nothing I have ever seen flying in our area ... again, no strobes, no navigation lights of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the 2nd time &#34;flying silk&#34; has gone almost directly over my house in the last 4 years on nearly the same course.  A 3rd observation of &#34;flying silk&#34; occoured approx. 3 years ago as I was on a walk through the neighborhod.  The object moved at a steady pace of approx.  4-500 MPH at approx. 4000 feet ... East to West ... crossed the beach, went out over the Atlantic and went directly into a huge thunderstorm parked off the coast over the water.  Like it was on invisible rails in the sky.  Again, one easily observable single light, no strobes, no navigation lights, no sounds of any kind, no deviation from its flight path of any kind ... it went into the storm like it didn&#39;t know the storm was there ... or maybe it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we drove home i notices 2 red sphere like lights in the sky. When we went over a bridge near my house you could see a vast area of land the went for about 7 miles and the light sat motionless over the river about i would say about a mile in the sky. Once we got home i sat on my back porch a watched as they just sat there motionless. After about a half hour the one light had moved left from the top light being as they were one over the other. As I watched I could see that the bottom one was moving at an incredibly slow rate. I went inside to get my dad. when i showed him it being as he is a skeptic about everything told me it was a Telephone tower. But there was never any telephone tower in that area ever that I had seen and Much higher in the sky than any telephone tower could reach. I went inside to find my Camera. When i went back out side i notice that they had traveled I would estimate about 5 miles away from where they were and were barely visable. I took a few snap shot but when developed showed nothing. After anouther 5 min they finally disappeared i was 17 at the time and im 18 know and it was the most intense night of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Reappeared (or perhaps the same object) in the same height but to the right of the first object, like it went backwards. This object had the same pattern, didn&#39;t go in a straight line, but slowly dissented while turning slightly like the previous light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was very big in diameter, too big to have come from a plane, bigger than the glare of the street lights which were about 50 feet away.

That was how low the lights were to the highway. That I was going to pass underneath a bridge very soon.

6/15/06 15:00|Fallon|NV|Sphere|30 minutes+|UFO sighting east of Fallon, NV, at Navy target range B17.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is an air traffic controller.  PD))|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94968.html|176|ndxe200606| UFO sighting east of Fallon, NV at Navy target range B17.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Good evening Sir or Ma&#39;am  I have a UFO sighting I’d like to share with you.  First I’d like to establish my credibility.  I’ve been a military Air Traffic Controller for over 24 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve held a secret security clearance during this entire time.  I have an immense amount of experience controlling general aviation, air carrier and military aircraft.  I am very familiar with the capabilities and flight characteristics of many different types of aircraft but especially high performance military aircraft.  There are very few aircraft that I cannot identify; in fact I can identify most aircraft just by their sound.  I am an expert at evaluating three dimensional spatial orientation as well as calculating altitude, distance and speed with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between 2005 and 2008 I was working as an expeditionary and combat Air Traffic Controller responsible for setting up temporary landing zones in hostile areas as well as a Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC).  Most people know us as Combat Air Controllers or Forward Air Controllers.  We designate enemy targets by eye or other acquisition equipment and then direct aircraft to drop or fire ordinance on said targets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until the day of this event, I had never seen a UFO but I’ve always kept an open mind.  I believe that there is too much evidence and too many credible people whose stories collaborate for UFO’s to be a hoax.  I also believe that it would be very naive and possibly dangerous for us to believe that we are the only intelligent life form in the universe.  It’s too immense for this to be true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The events which I’m about to share with you happened about 6 years ago.  During this time since, I’ve been looking for ways to share my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not remember the exact date of this event but it was around the end of June in 2006.  It took place in the desert, in the vicinity of Navy target range B17, located approximately 30 miles south-east of Naval Air Station (NAS) Fallon (KNFL) in Nevada.   This range sits south of highway 50 and is just west of Fairview Peak, which has an elevation of about 14,000 feet.   It was approximately 1500 local time.  It was a bright and very clear day – not a cloud in the sky.  On this day my team and I were acting as the Direct Air Support Center (DASC).  Our job was to accept, stack and hold the aircraft (F-18 Hornets) to the north of the target area until the SEAL JTAC Students were ready to accept a handoff from us and direct them onto their targets.  NAS Fallon is the home of the Navy SEALs JTAC School and they conduct most of their JTAC training at this location.  I want to go on record as saying that I am not a Navy SEAL.  I had my team there training for a deployment the following year where we would support one of the Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU).<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this day the JTACs were using type 1 control.  This means the JTAC has to visually acquire both the target and the aircraft before the JTAC can clear the aircraft &#34;HOT,&#34; meaning the pilot is cleared to release his ordnance or fire his weapon.  Because of the bright sun, lack of cloud cover and the direction from which the aircraft were making the final attack run, it was often difficult to visually acquire aircraft.  During one such attack run, we had an especially hard time seeing the F-18.  Many were shading their eyes against the sun or using a technique that I like to do where you extend your arm and use your palm to block the sun and then look for the aircraft in the gap created between your thumb and index finger.  As I was doing this, the pilot reported he was on his final attack heading but we still couldn’t see him because we were looking almost directly at the sun.  At this time something to my left caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was the F-18 that we were looking for and I almost commented that the pilot was way off course.  But before the words escaped my mouth I immediately knew that this was nothing like I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was a very large chrome sphere.  The word silver does not describe it well enough.  It was really like a chrome or even a mirrored sphere.  I could see the desert floor reflected on its underside and the sky reflected on its top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was larger than any cargo aircraft I’ve ever seen.  It was at approximately 10,000 feet, moving west to east at a very high rate of speed.  It passed the mountain range in a dip just south of Fairview peak.  I had sight of the craft for at least 7 seconds.  It took the craft 5 seconds to cover the distance from where I saw it to the dip south of Fairview Peak.  This distance it covered was approximately 5 miles.  That means the craft was traveling at approximately 3600 miles per hour or 3128 knots or Mach 4.6.  Last I checked, short of maybe the SR-71, we do not have any aircraft that can travel at that speed and if we do, where was the sonic boom.  The craft made no sound.  I’d like to add that while this was happening, the F-18 pilot reported “off target, no drop” and we saw him heading northbound and away from this craft.  So, I am 100% certain that what I saw was not the F-18 that we were looking for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked the other members of my team if they had seen what I had but they had not.  I was afraid that I was the only one who had witnessed something truly incredible.  But, several minutes later, the SEALs were laughing and giving a hard time to a couple of their teammates.  After talking to them I found out that 2 of the SEALs had also seen the sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not use the range at all the following day but we did go back the following night around midnight to do some night work.  While we were setting up our equipment we noticed an orange light at ground level in the target area.  It looked almost like a large camp fire.  I was not the only one to see this light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone who was with us could see it.  This gave us some concern because in less than an hour military aircraft would be dropping live ordnance at that exact location.  I asked if there had been a change in the schedule where the range had been used that day and maybe there was fire still out there and I was told “no”, the range had not been used at all that day.  At this time we used a laser ranger finder to get a good position on the light and found that it was 2176 meters (1.3 miles) from our observation point.  As soon as we pinged the target next to the light with the laser, the light disappeared and then immediately reappeared approximately a mile north of it original position.  It had moved a mile in the blink of an eye.  The light remained for another 15 minutes and then disappeared and we never saw it again.  The entire event lasted about 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for taking the time to read my story.  I must apologize for being so long-winded, but this is only the second time I’ve been able to share my story and the years are long and my memory is slow.  If you have any questions I would be more than happy to speak with you or anyone of you staff members.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

During that time I observe a light dot come out of the planet on the right side, it was a straight path then it made a downdward movement and then a left movement and it kept that path untill it dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stunned since that was the first object I have observe to move close to a planet.  I have observed moving satellites before.  But then I kept watching the same planet and to my sorprice I observed three lights come out one after the other and follow the same path as the first, and dissappeared after a while.   For some strange reason I felt a bit scared and went inside the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It has a very nice view of all downtown and then some, and has a great view of the city.  It was very late for me and was about 3:30am.  My friend had taken off for awhile to go inside his apartment.  While he was gone, I was noticing the historic Emily Morgan Hotel and a hawk- like bird, which seemed to be huge flying around the top of the building that was lit.  I thought it was rather odd, so I keep on looking in that direction.  Before you know it, I was noticing an object that looked like a star that was very bright that just appeared from nowhere around the same area.  It was moving around the same general area and would disappear and reappear and was flying by really fast, I later found out that this was no star.  I thought this was really strange.  Then I was trying to follow it around with my eyes and I was really excited to be witnessing this.  Another light that looked like the same one appeared in another direction below that to the right and it looked like they would appear and reappear and fly away.  I was really excited to be seeing this and hoped that it would last as long as possible.  Later, I had seen a third object that had looked like the same of them appear in another direction (to the lower left), kind of like an off triangle formation.  By this time, my friend had come back and I was hoping that he saw the same thing that I was seeing just to reaffirm and because I just couldn’t believe it.  He saw the same thing that I was seeing.  For about 20-30 minutes, these 3 light objects were appearing and disappearing, getting brighter and lighter, and seemed to be like dancing in the sky between one another.  It was the coolest and most bizarre thing that I have ever witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The 4 objects would gather at the center of the cloud and then disperse very quickly to the edges, each one moving in a different direction and appearing to move in a circle until reuniting back at the center of the cloud. The entire process too about 10 seconds, continually moving out from and than back to center. I parked the car and watched the event for about 20 minutes. They moved within the cloud and with the cloud. They did not travel in a straight line from the center, more of a haphazard movement. It was the strangest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw what I feel was a UFO set of persons. My horse was a foal at the time and I was leading him (like walking a dog) to increase his comfort with people and other animals and noise. He was pretty comfortable and we walked in this place often. All of a sudden he and my dog went on alert. I thought it probably a black bear (we have them around). However, I saw something very strange. The best way I can discribe what I saw sounds silly. It looked like two long, really skinny, frogs standing on two straightened out legs - upright. I tried to make sense of what I was seeing telling myself it was two snakes standing up straight or something. When the two frog things bent over and picked up something (and I saw they had arms) that seemed like it was like a bucket. They both lifted it - looked at me and turned and walked into the woods. Despite the fact the dog was barking and my horse was acting up and rearing and pulling and naying - I walked a little forward trying to figure out what I was REALLY seeing. I saw the grass moving as they walked through it. The one turned and looked at me again - and at that point I was literally dragged back by my horse who broke free and ran all the way back to the barn followed by our border collie.  My phone book is Kecksburg, but I have never been a UFO person. When I was very young I lived in Montgomery, NY and saw a craft of some sort with my Mother, but we always thought it was an airforce craft. Occasionally we have a odd thing go on with sound here, it becomes VERY, quiet and sound carries in a very odd way and we hear some sort of odd noises. It is quite rural. I think I believe in other types of phenomena, but not UFO&#39;s. I would like to know what it is I saw. I have not seen it again and both the dog and the horse get worked up in that spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I live right behind the fairgrounds so it moved from the fairgrounds (that&#39;s where it all happened) it started going above my house. I stopped looking out the window and started walking all around the house and I was either going to wake my mom up but she had to wake up at four or call the cops but that wasnt necessary. I looked through the front window again and it wasnt there. I looked out my back window and the UFO was right above the pond by the Sherwood Forest appartments.I started to gaze in what happened. The UFO got closer to the pond and it started going back the same way it started from. I couldnt look anymore and I was practically shaking so I went in my mom&#39;s bed. I kept hearing noises but I still tried to go to sleep.All kinds of things were going through my head. I was thinking should I fight the alien how will the alien get in and if it did jump out the window maybe and go to my neighbors.Then i started thinking if the alien would take me I would want my mom to go with me so I tucked in closer to her.I fell asleep and then the next day i went to my neighbors and asked if they saw a UFO. They said it wasnt no aiplane for sure and they thought it was either a object that was in the sky or a UFO.<n>
6/14/06 23:00|Seminoe Lake (near Rawlins)|WY|Unknown|15 minutes|Moving stars that lost their light and reappeared.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51009.html|187|ndxe200606| Moving stars that lost their light and reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I love to watch the night sky pretty much anywhere I go.  I am educated on what jets, stars, planets, meteors, and satellites appear as in the night sky.  I have never seen anything like what I had saw that night.  It was a beautiful night, not one cloud in the sky, so what I had seen was in plain view and was not obstructed in any way.  I was looking up at the sky frequently because there were many meteors in the sky.  Then something struck me as odd; a faint star, but it wasn&#39;t twinkling like a star should, so I thought it was a planet, but I noticed similar ones close by it.  That struck me as odd because I had never seen so many that close to eachother.  Suddenly, one just stopped emitting light, and I could see it move away while its light was fading until it became too dark to see any more.  It moved very smoothly.  The others soon quit emitting light (seperately) as well, although I could see that only a couple had moved like the first.  This is when I got my mom&#39;s attention.  I took her away from the glare of the fire and told her to look where I had been looking.  She soon saw what I had seen and grabbed her boyfriend to see.  I began to look where the things had moved in the sky.  I caught sight of what may have been the same ones that had started emitting their lights again, or completely new ones.  I hadn&#39;t noticed one particularly bright one (not twinkling) forming a pentagon with the cup portion of the big dipper.  The first faded sightings didn&#39;t give me enough proof within my own thoughts to label them UFOs, but this one shook me.  When it was emitting light, it was completely motionless.  It stopped emitting light like the others, but that one was so bright, it probably took a full second for it to completely fade out.  It began moving away from its position as soon as it stopped emitting light, and for that split second of fading light, I could clearly see structure.  I have absolutely no doubt that that structure was emitting the light I had mistaken for a bright planet and that it moved on its own accord.  They could not have been stars because they were not twinkling.  They could not have planets because they were too many, they turned off, and they moved.  They could not have been jets because they did not blink, and they were motionless for a long time.  They could not have been satellites because they had stopped emitting lights for a long time, and they were motionless.  They could not have been meteors because they could last for a matter of minutes, as opposed to a few seconds.  Once again, I am educated about what shines in the sky.  My mom, the other witness, was the one who had taught me these things.  I am 17 years old.  My mom is in her thirties and is an eighth grade teacher.  I don&#39;t lie and I don&#39;t mislead.  Also, just so you know, there was no alchohol in that portion of the trip and I wouldn&#39;t drink it anyway.  I usually doubt myself about things like this, but it was so blatant.  With all the information at hand, I have come up with three theories.  The one that would not go beyond what is normally accepted as normal would be that, for some reason, there were many planets out that night, and that there were clouds that I hadn&#39;t noticed.  Then those clouds, blown by the fast winds of Seminoe, blocked those planets; maybe creating some sort of optical illusion that the planets were moving.  This is unlikely because I am sure that there were no clouds out that night and once the things stopped giving off light, they disappeared for good.  Also, because they were so close together, it is unlikely that a tiny cloud could blot them out one at a time.  My second theory is one that is always considered when you think see things like this; visitors.  Their ships were in or just outside our atmosphere, using either their own powerful lights, or reflecting the light from the sun (much like the moon and the planets do) to create the illusion that they are only stars.  My final theory has to do with a state of the art government spying weapon.  This would be the perfect spying tool.  Our enemies would never think that the stars were spying on them.  If these things were man-made, one can only hope that they are those of our own government, and not an enemy&#39;s.  I hope I have made things as clear as they can be made on paper and helped you do whatever it is that you do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I had an apartment on the 3rd floor with a balcony that faced to the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Summer time and after 9:00pm. I had been sitting on my couch watching TV when my show ended. I decided to step onto the porch for a while as it was quiet outside and peaceful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out to the railing. On the other side of the apartment complex were large trees. Coming over the tops of those trees was some kind of a craft. I kick myself now for not having a camera handy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound. It was triangular in shape and had 3 lights on its bottom side. I would guess that it was 60 to 80 feet across. It came from East-Southeast, over the tree tops and apartments at the other end of the complex straight towards me. It could not have been more than 100 feet over the top of the roof of my apartment as it passed over. Never a sound and not disrupting my TV or lights inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had drawn a sketch of what I had seen that night and kept it put away for a long time. In 2008 I was laid off from a manufacturing job in Strongsville, Ohio. At that time I decided to go to school and take Graphic Design (something I had always wanted to do, but had not the time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later found my drawing in a dresser drawer and used it to create a better image using Adobe Photoshop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today is Sunday, December 11, 2011. I am still unemployed and currently living with my mother and step-father in Cleveland (Middleburg Hts), Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:15pm tonight I had another sighting that I could not explain. There were 6 craft in all. 4 in a formation moving to the West. 2 others that crossed each other’s path and moved away from each other with blinking lights that went on-and-off at exactly the same time. I yelled back inside to my mother to come outside. I showed her the 2 lights (the other 4 were already gone). I explained how they were blinking in unison and to watch them for a moment. She did and could not explain it. They were not planes. We are near Cleveland Hopkins Airport and see planes every day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could only see the lights and no details of the craft themselves.<n>

6/14/06 12:10|Koshkonong|MO|Sphere|2 min|A very slow flying orb at  roughly 300' directly overhead spotlighted me.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50953.html|191|ndxe200606| A very slow flying orb at  roughly 300&#39; directly overhead spotlighted me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to share with you what happened to me last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a cabin in the woods in a fairly rural area. Last night, just before I was about to retire, about midnight, I went outside. When I do so afterdark I usually carry a flashlight and shine it just long enough to make sure that there are no snakes in my path, as we do have a few types of vipers here, including the quiet and lazy copperheads that would just let you step on them before they would move. A rattlesnake would make it&#39;s presence known....... anyway, I am digressing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I turned the flashlight out I quickly noticed that there was another light source coming from over my head. It was quite bright, bright enough to leave very distinct shadows on the ground from the leaves on the trees. I noticed that the light source was moving, and looked up in the direction from which it seemed to be coming. Flying quite slowly, and very quietly, directly coming from behind my cabin there was an orb about the size of a beachball. It was a vivid golden color, and it flew nearly as low as a crop-duster airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It shone a light that was most definitely aimed directly at me. After it had passed over me for a very short distance it turned off the light, and it simply disappeared. There was never any sound whatsoever from it as it passed and then vanished into the dark of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a friend that is currently staying here with me, so I came back inside the cabin and told him about what had just occurred. He quickly came back outdoors with me. We both heard a sonic boom far off into the distance as I was giving him the details about the object&#39;s trajectory. I do not know if that was related to the orbs flight. Needless to say, my retirement plants were dashed. I was just a wee bit too excited to go to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to add here that I am in no way an U.F.O. fanatic. I&#39;m not even an x-files fan, for that matter but, I have pretty much always believed that there must be other intelligent life forms in the universe, and that they may very likely have visited our little planet in the past, and still do so in this day and age. Nevertheless, I had not expected to have such an up-close and personal experience, as personal as I would ever like that to be. It was directly spotlighting me from an overhead distance of perhaps two to three-hundred feet. That, good enough for me, thank you! Anyway...... I thought that you might be interested in this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

6/13/06 23:00|San Clemente|CA|Triangle|15 minutes|Strange lights over coast of San Clemente|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50948.html|193|ndxe200606| My wife and I live on a hillside community in San Clemenet called Marblehead. We have a direct view of the Pacific ocean at Dana Point but slightly marred as you move south by rooftops of the homes immediately below our home. At 11.00 p.m. (June 13, 2006), while my wife was asleep, I observed from my second floor bedroom bay window, two extremely shiny objects next to each other. They were hover over the  ocean. However, it was impossible to tell how far from me the objects were because of the intensity of the lights. Each object had the same kind of lights; that is,  three very bright lights organized in a triangular shape. I observed these lights for about a minute or so until the lights of one object faded into darkness like the fade in a movie leading from one scene to the next; a minute or so later the other object&#39;s light&#39;s faded into darkness in the same way the lights of the first object faded. About 30 seconds thereafter, a new light came into view slightly to the west of where the lights of the other two objects faded. Then a second object appeared to the east of the lighted object and then a third light appeared. I immediately woke up my wife, and she observed the three lights. Within a few minutes, the lights of one object faded, then the lights of the second object faded and then the lights faded on the third object. The skyline was dark for about a minute then each object appeared again, about 30 seconds apart. At one point there was five objects (maybe six as I veiewed in a kind of mild astonishment. Three of the five objects appeared to be next to each other and the other two above the other three. I started to toy with the idea that the I was observing one object with different lighting sections. This was a distinct possibility but I can not be certain one way or the other. The whole situation lasted about twenty minutes. At no time was there significant movement of the lighted objects, but there was definitely slight movement. The objects stayed hovered in the same area with lights fading in an out. The fading of the lights did not suggest the object moved away at a fast speed. The lights were either turned off or  covered over by clouds. I would vote for turned off. But I can tell you this for absolute certain: the lights were very bright and they must have been observed by many people. I could find nothing in the newspapers about it. So I got on Google to do a serach under the caption: Strange lights over coast of San Clemente. Ultimately my search lead me to this website and the posting of the above description. I am not into UFO&#39;s and I am hoping the unidentified flying objects I  observed will soon become identified flying objects with more information.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While we were still looking we noticed another bright white light moving from South to the North.  As we watched the light started to dim, and we thought it would disappear too, but then it pulsed a very bright white light, started going dim again, then about 5 seconds later pulsed again.  It did this for about a minute, pulsing on and off while moving very fast across the sky until it disappeared completely. I&#39;m using the word pulse instead of flash because the light, when it happened, would pulse on very slowly, not like a harsh flash, and then slowly dim. This was a very clear night. We saw normal aircraft that night and noted that they were all flying much lower than these 2 objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These stories were the first that I had heard of anyone seeing the bright orange ball that my family witnessed on June 13th at about 945 near the Marina. My spouse and I were enroute to pick up our child from near the Marina, I noticed an orange light in the sky, but dismissed it as a plane coming across the water from Ontario. But after picking up our child and chatting with our friends for a while, and coming around the corner near the Marina there was something odd about the light – it hadn’t yet passed over – as we arrived at Front Street – it was almost overhead – I stopped the car and had to lean over the dash to see it…I asked my spouse, “do you see that?”, he said “yep”, and to our child he asked “do you see it?”, she replied “yes. Mommy, do you see it?” she asked, I replied, “I sure do”. This bright orange light just sat there not moving – and not making any sort of noise. I can safely saw that the size of the light was the size of a quarter from where we sat. We watched it for a couple of minutes until it seemed to “dim away” as though it was going straight up. I dismissed it as a high end helicopter, the Air Show was scheduled for the following weekend, and we certainly didn’t report it to anyone – who would we call in the first place? The police – what would they do about it? The Airforce? – right – our military has much better things to do with their time...but now this is interesting!<n>

The first time that I saw this aircraft I was driving in my car and was pulling into our bulidings parkinglot area and a and I just happened to look to left over my shoulder and not even a hundrd feet in the air was a what looked like a ufo it hovered for two mintues straight and made absolutely no sound. There was also a man outside on his phone who dropped his phone and stood and stared at he object. its lights were moving in a strange pattern. The lights were much like that of an airplane only much brighter and more crisp. The object shown a white light on my car then took off very slow at first ( still not making any noise) then took off very fast. It slowed down then stopped a few more blocks away and once again hovered. Since that day we have seen many more. I assume it is me, and that i am subject of interest. I use the same way to go to work and the same way to get back home every evening, and since that day I have noticed that I am being followed by not just one but several aircraft, and believe me I know how crazy this sounds, but seeing is believing.  when I stop at red lights they stop too and wait and on four different ocassions my light turned green when it shouldn&#39;t have , the other traffic was still going. this has been happening to me for almost four weeks, I haven&#39;t reported it because i thought i was going nuts. I mean it defies everything i was ever taught. I really don&#39;t understand it. I want to ignore it all but the keep showing up and they make themselves all too obviuos, I am just your average hard working loving mom and spouse, and I want this all to stop so much. I want my life to go back to normal, I want ot forget what has happened and move on with my life. Monitor the El Cajon CA valley PLEASE! there is tons of activity. You must be very careful not to mistake them for airplanes, I believe that they try to make themselves appear to be just like an airplane but when , you look closely enough you will see that they are not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was white, oval but slightly flat and the sun gleamed off of it. At first I thought it was a plain but it was far to close not to see any wings or lights.  as we rounded a bend in the road it disappeared behind some trees, but when we got to where we should have seen it it was gone. On the way home I saw it and the trucker next to us seen it to. we passed the same bend in the road and it was gone.  The trucker almost hit a small truck turning in frount of him and his trailor swong to our side of the road and we almost hit him. About 10 secounds later it appeared right in frount of us and as we were watching it changed to grey then black and sort of faded away. there were no clouds around it and very few in the sky.  It was about the size of a mini van. It made no noise and was just floating there.  If it was a bloon won&#39;t it have still been there.  I know it sounds crazy and I wouldn&#39;t have belived it unless I seen it myself, but it was there as real as me siting at this computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

6/13/06 05:00|Southwest|OH|Triangle|4 Days|Strange lights and a "V" shaped craft over southwest Ohio.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51145.html|201|ndxe200606| Strange lights and a &#34;V&#34; shaped craft over southwest Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday, June 13, 2006 at approximately 5 a.m. I was traveling southbound on I-71 through Ohio near mile marker 70 (30 miles south of Columbus) when I noticed a bright white light off to the left (East) side of the road.  At first I thought it was an airplane because I saw a center white light with two smaller lights on either side of the object, like landing lights on wings.  Also, I could tell there was at least one blinking light on the bottom, which appeared red.  As I got closer I could tell the object was stationary at an altitude of approximately 300 feet and a distance of perhaps a ¼ mile off of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When parallel to the object I could tell this was definitely not an airplane, due to being stationary, and definitely not a helicopter, due to several bright white lights being on top of the object as well.  At this distance I could still not determine the exact shape of the object, but could tell that it had very intense white lights on all surfaces, a red blinking light on the bottom and perhaps a blue blinking light on the bottom.  Due to the blinking lights I was not very suspicious since blinking lights usually signal to me that it is some type of known aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued south I saw 11 more of these objects, all between mile marker 70 and 50, for a total of 12.  All had the same description as the one above and all were stationary between 200 and 400 feet off the ground and from ¼ to 1 mile off to the left the road.  Most were somewhat equally spaced in distance as I traveled down the road, but I saw one occurrence of 3 in a triangular pattern with a distance of maybe a ¼ mile in between each.  This area of Ohio is mostly flat open farmland with small gatherings of houses and buildings (maybe 4 or 5 in a group).  All of these objects seemed to be above these groups of houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I approached mile marker 50, I hadn&#39;t seen one of these objects in perhaps 5 miles when I suddenly noticed one off to the left again but this one was moving parallel to I-71.  After a mile or so the object turned southeast and left the area very quickly, followed closely by 3 more of these objects.  They finally faded out of side just before mile marker 50.  I believe these to be objects that I had previously seen so I did not add them to my count.  This was the last I saw of these objects that morning.  I was heading out of state at the time and returned at the end of the week.  While out of town I thought about what I had seen and came upon the idea that these may have been the tops of radio or other communications towers and I would look for these the next time I traveled through the area.  I was skeptical of this idea however since I looked for frames under the lights but could not see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday, June 16, 2006 I traveled back through the area at approximately 10 p.m. going northbound.  I began watching the skies around mile marker 50 to see if any of these objects remained.  I saw several radio towers, but all of these had blinking red lights along their frames and these frames were easily visible in the dark.  I approached mile marker 60 near Jeffersonville and still had not seen anything when I noticed 2 lights on the left side (west this time) of I-71 and they looked very similar to what I had seen earlier in the week.  These lights were still about 5 miles ahead of me perhaps around mile marker 65.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer I could see the lights better and they were on the west side of 71 approximately ¼ mile apart and much to my surprise, one was slowly moving out overtop 71.  Even more to my surprise I knew I was going to be driving directly under the object.  The object was a very pronounced ((??)), with large circular blue lights running along the entire bottom of the shape, perhaps 6 or 7 on each length of the &#34;V&#34;.  On the tip of the object, there was a flashing red light on the bottom.  The leading edges of the object were covered with bright white lights as well as the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not the only person to see this object, since I noticed several truckers and motorists looking up.  Realizing that I was now going only 40 MPH as well as a few people around me, I became aware that this object could perhaps cause an accident.  Because of this fact, and the fact that I now needed a new pair of pants, I called the State Police and talked to the sergeant on duty at the Wilmington branch.  He was very professional and said he would have a trooper report to the area immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if anything was ever reported by the State Police, or if anything else ever came of the situation, I left the area very quickly and have only been back through during the day.  If anyone doubts my thoughts and views on this matter, please let me give you a bit of my background so perhaps you can understand my reasoning.  I am a mechanical engineering student at the University of Cincinnati, so I understand the basics of what is and isn&#39;t possible with aircraft.  I grew up near the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida where my father was stationed with the Marines in the air wing.  Over the years I have seen my share of aircraft fly ranging from biplanes, WWII era prop fighters and bombers, to modern day fighters and bombers including the F-117 Stealth fighter, B-1 and B-2 bombers, and specialty aircraft such as the SR-71 Blackbird and UAVs such as the Predator.  Besides fixed wing vehicles, I have also seen several examples of helicopters from Loaches, Hueys, Blackhawks, Apaches, Cobras, and Chinooks, to private crafts like Medivacs, and other Search and Rescue craft.  Being from East Central Ohio I have had my encounters with blimps (Goodyear) and with hot-air balloons too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that this area that I was traveling through is in the approach and exit patterns for Wright-Patt Air Force base and Port Columbus International, but I have never seen any fixed wing aircraft that can hover or move as slowly as these objects did, or any other aircraft with this distinct shape and light pattern.  Hopefully someone else saw these events too.<n>

The lights quickly came back on again starting from the left, and going to the right. I called my father at that moment, and by the time he reached the door it was gone. We went outside for about 10 mins and it never came back.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a Metal looking color and My friend said that aint no UFO its a blimp but it looked nothing like a blimp. I think they were a little freaked out and in denial over seeing it. Hopefully someone else saw this too. It kind of looked like 2 tin cans and a little tube in the middle. no sound too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was a clear day with unlimited visibility and the object was maybe the size of about 50 feet round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object that at that moment I assumed due to the metallic gray color was a weather balloon caught our attention because it did not move for several seconds.

6/12/06 07:45|Pensacola|FL|Light|30 seconds|Star-like object  horizontally traversing low and slow in the morning sky.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51054.html|210|ndxe200606| Star-like object  horizontally traversing low and slow in the morning sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This may be nothing special to make a report about, but it was just a little queer and unexpected  to see in the wee  hours of the early morning what appeared to be something very similar to a large star that was bright and glittering like the sparkles of a disco ball traversing horizontally within the patchy clouds on an Eastern heading at a speed comparable to a small plane traveling low in the sky.  But then again, it may have been simply nothing more than a plane traveling East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 12, 2006 at 6:45AM in the city of Pensacola, I was at work and looking out through the building&#39;s tinted windows watching the tropical storm Alberta&#39;s clouds moving parallel along the Gulf coast.  I find it interesting to watch these clouds traveling along in bands staying somewhat together as it rotates around the storm&#39;s center.  While watching these clouds, I noticed a big, bright object within the clouds   When I first saw this object, I thought it was a bright star that has yet to dim away as the sun slowly rises higher up in sky.  But that couldn&#39;t be because the sun was already up too high in the sky for any stars to be showing.  The estimated distant from my observation location to the star-like object was no more than a half a mile at the most.  I also noticed that the star-like object was moving at the speed of a small plane, and it was traveling at about the same low altitude as other planes I had seen flying though the area in the past.  In the beginning when I first spotted this star-like object,  it was hard to tell that the star-like object was moving because it was traveling East directly in the path  that the clouds were traveling West.  The intensity of the light stayed mostly the same throughout the viewing as the star-like object traveled away from me except for one moment in it&#39;s travel; it appeared to shine brighter for a few seconds as though some sunlight has reflected off it.  After observing it for a about 10 seconds, I begin to think that it might be a meteorite traveling horizontally, so I calmly shouted to my coworker, &#34;Look guys... there&#39;s a meteorite!&#34;  Everybody rushed to the window and saw what I was seeing.  Then my supervisor said, &#34;It&#39;s probably just a plane.&#34;  Then another coworkers said jokingly, &#34;It might be a UFO.&#34; Then I said to my supervisor, &#34;Yea...  Your probably right.  It could be a plane.&#34; Then my boss told everyone to go to work.  I was disappointed at hearing that because I wanted to continue watching this object until it went out of view. I was only able to view it for about 30 seconds. The only time I seen a plane light up somewhat like a bright star is when it&#39;s windows reflected the sunlight for a brief moment, but still, that doesn&#39;t even come close to comparison to the star-like object&#39;s light intensity which was similar in light intensity as to arc-welding type of light. This star-like object stayed lighted up like a bright star throughout the viewing.  It could have been possible that a plane that was not painted and made of bare, shiny metal flew through the area, and the sunlight  reflected off the plane&#39;s body, and then when the plane reached a certain area in the sky, more sunlight could have momentarily reflected off the plane&#39;s window thus giving it the appearance of becoming brighter for a brief moment then returning back to it&#39;s normal brightness.  The object, in my opinion, was close enough to my observation point that I should have, at the least, been able to see a shape similar to a plane if was a plane flying in the air.  Since I could not see any details that could identify it as a plane, my assumption is it could have been anything traversing the sky.  I don&#39;t think it was a meteorite because it didn&#39;t have any flaring tail. If the object I saw was a plane, this would make it the first time I ever saw a plane stayed lit up like a star at close range while traversing the sky.  I seen planes flying through the area in the past at about the same hour,  but they never lit up like a star.  It would usually light up as to something bright white.  Whatever, I saw it, so I&#39;m reporting it.  I&#39;ll let those who are reading this determine what I saw. It may be simply nothing to continue conversing about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

None of my coworkers had any real clues to the exact identity of the UFO except just presumption without any proof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was located just above the bottom part of the hurricane feeder cloud moving in an eastern direction against the prevailing wind.  It traversed a level course from the time I first saw it until the last time I saw it for at least two to three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its speed is comparable to a slow flying plane, and I estimate the distant to the UFO from us to be about 1/2 a mile in distant and located above the ground at least 500 feet in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occasionally, the UFO appeared to brighten up in sparkling light when it entered into a thin layer of clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never heard any loud noise being produced from the UFO, but the reason may be because all of us were inside behind the heavy glass windows.  I seen many planes travel into a group of clouds, and not once had I ever seen those planes sparkle.  The sighting that morning is definitely one of the oddest thing I ever seen traversing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that sighting, Nuforc has listed 24 sparkling sightings of interest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

One of the aliens came right in front of me (out of no where) grabbed me and that was it i woke up and I couldn&#39;t figure out how long i was out for, but i was surrounded by onlookers of another life form, it wasnt how they make it look in the movies though it was very dark and you could see your breath it felt cold but it was warm. They(aliens) seemed very pleased and not eager to hurt me they couldnt understand what i was saying but for some reason i could almost understand everyword they said. They told me to lay down and relax they mean no harm im going to be safe if ( and then they said something about nasa) doesn&#39;t carry on with there mission, they held me for 3 hours they put me back to sleep to take me back to earth. I woke up in my backyard except for one thing, they left me with a peice of rock from another galaxy. I&#39;ll never not belive anyone who had this type of experience again.<n>

This was just one light like a cars headlight above clouds, there was no sounds and it moved untill out of sight very fast as fast as a Jet plane at low height but, was no flashing lights or sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took 2-3 seconds to cover half the viewable sky. Then 30-40 seconds latter i heard a Aircraft/Jet sound then as i heard this not that load as was high up, i saw flashing red then blue etc lights&#34;plane wings&#34; and what i could make out as a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This possible fighter moved accross same area of sky as the unidentified light, however this took about 12 seconds to cover same distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could this be a fighter on Intercept?  If light was Plane then there was no sound, and a comercial plane would not travel that fast, if it was a plane at great height i.e no sound than light sorce maybe to big, distance covered meant object moved very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at the suspect Plane i heard and saw 30 seconds, traveling at say 800MPH I would say the object moved at 2500-4000MPH maybe faster!  Cant say its a UFO/Alien but for a craft low height it was silent and moved 3 times faster than comercial jet, if it was at aprox same hight as fighter jet then it moved 5-6 times faster, and jet could be heard, light could not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Closing it was not a comet or shooting star as it moved less faster, and shooting stars have tails and move 12,000 MPH<n>

It wasn&#39;t high enough to be a satellite, and to the best of my knowledge, all airplanes have blinking lights.  This object was not blinking.  It disappeared, possibly into some high clouds, though clouds were scarce that evening because we could see the stars quite clearly.  About a minute or two passed.  We were joking around and speculating the distance the object might have traveled over the time that had elapsed when suddenly a VERY bright light slowly blinked high in the sky- at the exact spot our rough calculations had placed the flying object.  It looked like a headlight that had turned on- then off.  It flashed once more and it was over.  Kind of like when kids are playing Morse Code with flashlights.  It was an alarming spectacle because the light was incredibly large for any object at that high of a distance-- and it was much, much larger than any light source that might come from an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Jup|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51619.html|222|ndxe200606| Two lights came in form the south, SW direction the front light was dimmer and the back light was brighter then the planet Jupiter. Jupiter was up to the left of theses objects. The back light did dime to the size of the front light in a count of 10 seconds A thumbs length at arms length was between these two objects as they moved North NE.. No sound as they flew directly over us I had the objects in my 10/50 binoculars I could no make out anything other then light I lost sight of them when I pulled my binocular off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two fairly-dimmed, whitish lights taking the shape of two corners of a triangle, the top and lower left, appeared in the sky.  They headed towards the zenith at a constant speed which seemed to be that of a normal airplane.  As they came overhead, the lower left light turned red and then back to its orginal white color.  About thirty seconds later the lower left light rotated to the front as if the craft was doing a u-turn or somethin of that nature.  After completing its&#39; rotation, the object continued on its&#39; path towards the zenith.  Continuing to watch it became more and more difficult as the lights faded and eventually visuals were lost.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two lights that took the form of two-thirds of a triangle (when looking at a triangle, they would be the top and the bottom left points) traveled in tandem and kept a uniform distance from one another.  It would be difficult to say how far apart they were, but roughly a thumb-length was between them when holding one&#39;s hand up toward the sky.   They moved in such manner at a moderate pace across the sky.   At one point the bottom light turned red and quickly looped clockwise in a circle.  As soon as this action was performed, the light went back to its original color (a whitish-yellow), returned to its original, uniform place in tandem with the other light (the &#34;top-point-of-a-triangle&#34; light), and both continued to move at the same pace, and in the same direction across the sky.  When both lights were back in tandem, however, each began to fade, and both were out of sight within one to two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The moon (almost full/full?) had just rose of the neighbors house.  The clouds were patchy.  I could see from the direction I was sitting (southernly) the Moon to my left and 2 planets (Venus,  Jupiter?) in the middle/right of my field of vision.  I looked up and noticed 2 slightly brighter lights in the sky about an inch apart between the planets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then made a mention that it was very strange those stars weren&#39;t there before, to which the 2 friends looked up, saw and verified them.  At this time, one of my friends noticed they were both moving (at same speed, maintaining the inch or so apart).  As they moved northernly, they became darker. And within 30 seconds, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed at which the lights were going was much too slow to be a plane or satellite, and too bright for it to be a pair of helicopters and not be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curious to see if others saw the same thing!<n>

I saw a crowd in the middle of the street, who appeared to be observing something in the night sky.  I turned the car away from the crowd, and parked my car about a block away and got out. The object was roughly 5 times the size of a star, appeared to make no sound, and was moving to the south. It looked like a large glowing red orb, and was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen.  I spent most of my life near air force bases, and so am very familiar with both military and commercial aircraft.  This one baffles me.<n>

At this time behind the trees across the freeway I noticed what looked like two long planes with no wings moving together at a very high rate of speed, faster than the planes that normaly fly in the area. This movement was different as it was moving North to South and traveling very fast. Most planes are coming from the South and then turn West over the freeway or just the opposite they are coming from the West and then head South. It appeared as if the planes moved in tandem and merged for a second and then disapeared out of view. Also the planes appeared to blend in with the sky as they were in a stealth mode, transpearent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I dismissed it for the moon behind clouds but then I saw that it was a clear night and that it didn&#39;t look quite right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my friend who dismissed the possiblity of an aeroplane or a helicopter because it was so static in the sky. Also there appeared to be a blurred flashing light in the bottom left hand corner of the object that lept accross the base to the other side ever few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After around 2 or 3 minutes of bafflement the object all of a sudden began to shrink in size until it was mearly a third of the size of it&#39;s origional shape and almost circular. Whether that&#39;s because of it moving position in the sky and it&#39;s shape percieved to change as it moved i don&#39;t know. It was too far away to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it stopped shrinking it stopped for a few seconds and then calmly dissapeared into the night sky at a 45 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was never a firm believer in U.F.O sightings but I saw this with my own eyes along with a witness and I&#39;m am at odds with myself to determine what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The driver and I had been parked there for about 1 hour. It was shortly after midnight on a cloudless, moonlit, night. Directly outside the passenger window, about four feet away, a medium height, wire fence, ran parallel to the vehicle. Beyond the fence is an open meadow for about 150-200 yards and after that a distant treeline. There is a single tree, approximately 25 feet high, visible to me through the passenger window, about 50 feet ahead of the vehicle and 40 feet behind the fence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking out of the passenger window. Instantly, the entire world lit up, plain as day. all around. I could see everything, in bright color, as if the noon sun were shining. This may have lasted one second at the most. I don&#39;t remember if I could tell where the light came from as it happened, but afterward I could. It was like when someone takes your picture in a dark room. You have the after image of the flash in your eyes. You see purple and red and blue spots for a few seconds and then they&#39;re gone. Well, after the flash I could see a large after image, further into the field than the single tree, and higher in the sky. It lasted for about three seconds. The after image itself resembled a prismatic tear in open space, stretching about 45 feet in length, and about 30 feet off the ground. The image got smaller every second it lasted until it vanished all together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no sparks, smoke, thunder, flames, heat, sound, electric equipment around, no power lines, no way to explain it away and it left no traces that I could see. It was not particularly scary, but it was definitely intense.

The lights were bright and amber, a long way out and above the horizon, they were moving very slow from north to south,they seemed to be about the size of soccer balls..at the distance they were.  I and my wife watched these lights for around twenty minutes  Until one by one they gradually just went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 72 my wife is 64 we have never seen anything before like this..what (on earth) was this?<n>

A few of my friends and I were walking home from a party about 3 blocks away from my house. We were goofing around and having fun as we walked home. at around 11:40 I looked up at the sky and looked at an object that I had thought was the moon and I thought to myself &#34;Hmm... The moon is awfully small tonight&#34; and laughed to myself. So we got to the corner of my block and walked down the hill to my house when I looked up again and I noticed the &#34;moon&#34; was kind of following us. I asked my friend to look up and she said the same exact thing I was thinking &#34;Wow the moon looks awfully small doesnt it?&#34;. It was emitting this sort of yellowish glow, and was really eluminated. I thought I was going crazy, and it really creeped me out. My other friends then looked up as well and were like &#34;what the hell is that thing in the sky?&#34; and about 12 seconds after they said that it sped away through the night sky, and as soon as it dissappeared it started to rain. I dont know what that thing was or if it was even the reason for it to start raining but I know it creeped me out, I searched google to see if I could find any sphere shaped objects in the sky and it lead me to UFO&#39;S so I searched UFO&#39;s and found this site and thought it was worthy to report my case. This is really uncommon in such an  urban place (or so i thought), I never seen or heard anything like this happening over here, and especially in the Bronx. I thought things like this happened in kentucky or tenessee to backwoods insest-ial cousin families, but when I saw this sphere, this thing move across the sky it creeped me out so much I&#39;m afraid to even set foot outside my door. My mother thinks I&#39;ve gone crazy and the other friends I was with during this night have gone into denial, with the exception of my one friend who is pretty creeped out as well. I keep looking over my shoulder to see if anything is there, that is how creeped out I am about this. I would leave my information for you guys to contact me but my mother will probably try to admit me into a psychiatric hospital or something along that line. I dont know what you guys do or investigate or whatever but I just thought I&#39;d put in my small report. Thank you for your time I guess and good luck . . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

This repeated (shooting stars crossing paths of others which then appeared to start &#39;shooting&#39;, until 5 were moving in total.

There was a lot of airplane traffic that evening but the object was much higher in the sky , and it was not moving just sitting there. I watched this for about 5mins (naked eye),Thinking this thing will move shortly and Ill know what it is. After the 4 or 5 mins I was perplexed and ran inside to get my (deepspace and on a tripod)binoculars. I got them setup and focused in on the object. The object was a perfect sphere, glowing orange in the center and white around the edge. I watched it for about 6mins. and it didnt move,then out of the left side of the object three smaller white spheres appeared and in about 1 min.after that three more white spheres dropped out of the bottom. The objects on the left side were evenly spaced apart, at first so were the bottom objects but then the middle obeject moved out to the left forming a triangle under the main object. Then a small black oblong item dropped just below the triangle of spheres.These things remained this way for several mins.Then the small objects to the left of thr main object started to slowly move away. At this time the main object started to glow abit brighter.Now heres the kicker... The main object then appeared to blowup (for as far away as this was it looked like a massive explosion, it almost filled up the field of view of the binoculars)But then I noticed that it looked more like steam than smoke. Through this steam cloud I could barely see the main object and it looked like it was seperating within this vapor cloud. In an instant all objects were gone,the cloud acted like a vortex and everything was just gone.Nothing fell from the sky. There were no clouds that day , clear as a bell. I am only about 15 mins from Greensboro International airport,I have not checked with them yet to see if they picked it up on radar. I also saw this object two more times within a two week period of the first ! sighting and have a witness on one of the other sightings.  About me, I am 50 years old I own a recording studo and have been an amature astronomer for about 40 years and have seen countless meteors,three comets,almost anything you can think of but nothing like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As i watched for several more seconds, as it just went on and on into the horizon until i could not see anymore, the only thing that i really had time to do was say &#34;that was fast!&#34;...thats when the other people turn and said &#34; what?&#34;....it still gives me chills to thing about it! , i have them as i type this....i don&#39;t know what it was, but i do know, it was not a helicopter, nor blimp, not a balloon, not any airplane that i am fimiliar with. I saw that russion satelite enter the atmosphere, back in the late 80&#39;s and this didn&#39;t look like that. it was not a shooting star, for they happen in just a streak and its over. and it appeared that it was not that high up, like in space...more like the altitude of private planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Immediately 100ft from that spot the same orange light appeared ,then disappeared. Then around a mile to the left,one orange light appeared thenwas gone.2 more immediately appeared then were gone.About a min. later a little more than a mile back right 1 appeared then was gone,then within a few feet 1 more appears then another 1 and they were gone.  About 5 mins. later the craziest thing I ever seen, over the lake now all in the sky there were 10 different lights total that just kept appearing one after another fading in and out there were trails on a few of these. At this point I have chills running through my body.My friend was able to get a picture while I was running around freaking out. Then it all stopped.

The object was completely still in the sky, during the time we traveled just over one mile.  We came around a bend where the treeline obstructed our view and the object was gone.<n>

I was looking up at the cumulos clouds gathering and saw 2 saucer shaped crafts just hovering motionless. I knew they were not birds because a plane flew underneath them, too high to be birds. After a minute or so watching them hover in the same spot, they darted to the nearest cloud for cover it seemed. I waited for them to come out on the other side, or same side and they never did. This seems to be on-going southwest of Chicago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Next thought, its an airplane, but it wasn&#39;t moving.  I grabbed the binoculars and observed that it pulsated white, red &amp; blueish green.  I called my daughter to take a look and she noticed that it was moving very slowly in kind of a shuffle.  A little the left/West and then a little further to the right/East.  I called a neighbor over and he stated that no way was this a star or an airplane.  I watched for several hours as it repeated the pulsating and a graduale motion to the East...the opposite direction than the stars.  At one time an airplane flew between me and the object, with no reaction from either.  As I called it a night the white color to change to amber--could have been dust in the atmosphere--whom knows.  That was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We both jumped out of the vehicle and stood in awe of the red glowing thing floating in the sky.  It didn&#39;t make any noise.  It was large.  It seemed to be in two parts, or at least to appear that way.  It disappeared very quickly.

As it flew past me at approx. 2-3 thousand feet, it was glowing a brilliant bright white, with no other colors visable. It continued towards the north at a fairly fast pace. It was absolutely silent. I could discern a shape to this light (object). It looked like a disc, where the brightness of the object was much brighter at the top and bottom, the middle was a little more subtle.<n>

I took my dog for a late walk at a marina in Key Largo FL. The clouds had moved from my vantage point and I could see stars. At that moment, With the naked eye, out in space I noticed six points of light in a circular posistion. I know the objects were in space because it was almost as if they were amongst the stars... they were not as bright as the stars they were dim(glowing). The perfect posistion amazed me! they seemed to be slowly floating to the North-East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They also seemed to stop for a period of time and then continue. They never twinkled or changed color. After a while I went inside to call a friend who was also in Key-largo, but he was asleep. I looked out my window and I was shocked to still see them! eventualy the cloud coverage came back and i could no longer see them! did anyone else see this?  Very weird!!!<n>

I had an experience in 2006 that had a major impact on my view of reality.  I don’t tell many people about it, but thought that if it might aid your research that I would share it with you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 6, 2006, I went out into my back yard to have a cigarette.  I went outside at about 11:00 pm.  Three hours earlier there had been a thunderstorm that went through the area.  I am a bit of an amateur astronomer, and I truly enjoy viewing the stars at night.  On this particular night, the sky had been washed clear by the storm and the western night sky was gloriously filled with stars.  I remained outside to let my eyes acclimate to the darkness so I could see the stars better.  The arms of the Milky Way were solidly visible.  I must admit that I was a little excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 11:25 pm, I noticed movement to the south about 20 degrees off of the ecliptic.  There were three white lights in the shape of a triangle, moving in concert from south to north.  I smiled, amused that the sky was so clear that you could even see satellites passing overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the thought occurred to me that satellites don’t travel in packs of three.  Perhaps the International Space Station I rationalized.  Satisfied with this rationalization, I continued to watch the lights steadily traverse the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights reached approximately the center of Corona Borealis (although they were much higher in the sky), there was a brilliant white/blue flash.  The flash was elliptical in a vertical orientation.  The flash was so bright that it faintly illuminated the entire neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did a double take, unsure of what I had just seen.  I looked at the spot where the flash had occurred, and one light was continuing on the original trajectory to the north, at the! same speed as before.  One light had disappeared, and the third light had reversed course and was headed south.  It appeared to be (the best way I can describe it) “dripping” blue sparks and traveling in a jagging fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it in disbelief for about 15 seconds and then returned my gaze to the light traveling to the north.  Just as I acquired its location, the light sped to the horizon, covering roughly 1/3 or the sky, in literally the blink of an eye.  It disappeared beyond the horizon, out of my field of view.  I quickly looked back to find the light that was traveling to the south, and it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house, excited at what I had just witnessed.  I was headed to the bedroom to wake my wife, but reason got the best of me.  What was I going to do, wake her out of a sound sleep to tell her that I saw lights in the sky that aren’t there anymore?  Logic settled in, and I returned to the back yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I anxiously stared into the sky, sweeping the path that the lights had followed.  Nothing… I remained outside, enjoying the stars once again.  About 10 minutes later, two lights appeared, traveling along the same route as the original three.  They were side by side, and seemed to zig-zag periodically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured that perhaps my eyes were becoming fatigued and that it was my eye movement that gave the appearance of the sudden jerky motion.  I used a 4x4 post on the deck for reference and watched them carefully.  They were indeed zig-zagging periodically.  There was no discernible pattern or time period that seemed to accompany the sudden jerky movement.  Perhaps these were satellites or the ISS I rationalized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued on at about the speed and perceived elevation of a satellite.  The two lights continued, side by side, from south to north until about 10 degrees above the northern horizon.  Suddenly, both white lights glowed brilliant red and zipped off in opposite dire! ctions, one headed west, and one headed east.  Nothing else happened in the next hour, and I retired to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize that this is a little late to the party and probably won’t do you much good in your quest.  But I really did have to tell someone that wouldn’t judge me as some kind of whack job.  It was cathartic even though it probably wasn’t of much use.<n>

6/6/06 22:00|Portland|OR|Light|15 minutes or so|It was just starting to get dark on tuesday night. I was walking up the stairwell in my dorm, and noticed a strange bright white light|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50999.html|260|ndxe200606| It was just starting to get dark on tuesday night. I was walking up the stairwell in my dorm, and noticed a strange bright white light between two of the tall identicle apartment buildings on the riverfront of downtown Portlad. At first I thought it was a bright star, but there are very few stars visible in Portland, and it was far too bright. I then though that it was maybe just a plane, since the flight pattern goes that way, but the light wasn&#39;t moving. Slowly I noticed it move. It took about three minutes for it to slowly move behind the left apartment building. I then decided to walk up a floor or two, to see if I could see it since it hid high up on the building. I caught a glimpse of it again, and yet again it hid. I did this a couple more times and it kept hiding. It . Finally, It dissapeared or went behind the  building and I wasn&#39;t able to catch a glimpse of it anymore. I ran and grabbed two of my friends. I returned with them, about two minutes after losing sight, and there it was back where it originally was not even  moving. My friends and I sat and watched it for about two minutes. It sat there motionless for about a minute. Then slowly started moving and gaining little speed as it traveled to the left again. It then began to dim. It dimmed completely before being blocked by the building. I had this sort of weird feeling that what ever it was knew it was being watched, so it kept hiding. I think bringing the two other friends convinced it to vanish. The apartment buildings are about a half a mile from my dorm, so we decided to walk over there, but saw nothing.  While the bright light was going on, I also noticed a pulsating red light flying in a circle over and over to the right of the it, but didn&#39;t think too much about it.  While walking back from checking out the apartment area, I spotted a red lighted craft, maybe a plane or satelight flying above. Whatever it was it was fast, and high in the air. It made a total pass of the sky within 2-3 minutes or so. Later on the night, me and one of the other witnesses spotted one of the pulsating red lights where the bright white light was. it was fling in irregular patterns. sharply left and right and up and down. Sorry for the jumbled mess, but I&#39;m writing this really late at night, and I totally forgot about reporting it and didn&#39;t want to forget to in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Now at the same time there is a 747 flying east to west heading for sky harbor airport, I could see the headlights and the blinking lights on the plane. The white sphere had no blinking lights what so ever it was soild white and was alot brighter than the headlights on plane. I continued to watch as they crossed pathes with each other, I was not able to tell if they were at the same altitued because the sphere was just in fornt of plane. As the plane went past me I couldn&#39;t see the headlights any more but I could still see the bright sphere as if it was a ball of light. The object continued flying south into some thin clouds. When it got into the clouds they lit up all around it. Then it got into a thick cloud and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore , I stood there for a few more minutes waiting for it to come out the other side of the cloud, and it never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At around 03:50, a faint star appeared to move to the north.  It was just a point of light, with no trail.  The object seemed to slow down when a second object appeared and began to move towards the first object.  When the second object got fairly close, both objects continued north at great speed across the night sky.  About 10 to 15 min later, a third object was spotted moving north.  All objects seemed so far away and appeard to be in outer space.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Neither would go out, which is very unusual. Just before heading to bed I heard an immense crackle very close outside like a static charge. (The windows were open). I went to bed without investigating... which seeems kind of odd, but maybe I was just frightened. I awoke in the morning to find one of the dogs had gone to toilet in the porch (rather than go out the night before).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night (0100 on 06/06/06) at around the same time again, I went to the porch to let the dogs out and again, neither would go out. I stood on the porch and looked at the sky and broke wind. Immediately I thought &#39;oh... i don&#39;t want to frighten them&#39; and immediately, before I could even process this strange thought, saw a craft fly from above me to the North. It was in view for about a second... it wasn&#39;t going super-fast..... i saw enough of it to be able to recall it. It had several lights on it and was about the size of the moon in the sky.... maybe not so high up?  What&#39;s odd about this comical tale is that I appeared to know something was there before I saw it... I have absolutely no idea why I would have that thought enter my head after breaking wind!  Maybe nothing to do with this but Sonora has a lot of static electricity.... I am always getting shocked when I go shopping off of metal or material. Also, the cell phone reception here is very staticy... our TV reception is always getting lost. Sometimes it&#39;s good, others it&#39;s completely dead. We had 3 different engineers visit and they can&#39;t see anything wrong with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been as honest as possible in recalling events (as can be seen by the reference to breaking wind!)<n>

I was at the intersection of Royal and First St. and saw a light that was definitely not like an airplane, it was too large, the color was more yellow and completely steady (not flashing). The light appeared to be circular but slightly oval with barely visible light lines darting from the most accute point of the oval. The light moved very slowly and made a zig zag pattern in the sky that was definitely not that of an airplane. The light was definitely unlike any helicopter light (again, not flashing) and that is the only other flying object it might have been judging by it&#39;s pattern of flight (ability to weave back and forth at sharp angles).I was only able to witness this for five minutes, from 23:57 on 6/5/06 to 00:02 on 6/6/06. I had to continue my patrol and felt I would appear foolish to call in a UFO sighting to my dispatch center or local law enforcement.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I commented to my wife, &#34;Hey a UFO&#34; just teasing of course as I assumed it was a plan.  I continue to watch the craft as it move slowly across the sky.  The shape was cigar possibly disc.  Notibly with a white color not metallic.  Not totally convenience of what type of craft I contined to watch until it change direction of 180 degrees without slowing or speeding.  It was no turn, almost as if it bounced off a wall.  The craft intially was head West to East now was heading East to West at no change of speed.  I watched it until out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Expert opinion years later would state that it most likely would have been aircraft from Simsbury or Bradley Airport in normal air traffic zones.  The object in the sky was very shiny, which I became reminded of when using aluminum tape recently.  Based on expert opinion it most likely would be an airplane, just reflecting a high amount of light.  This is not abnormal in itself as the sun is bright at these times in the summer, the unsettling detail was that the airplane itself was so glowing with shine.  This brightness has not been observed since this event years ago in 2006.  I would state that even though it apparently leans towards a normal aircraft, it was so shiny with luminance that I have not been able to explain.  There were other cars on the road, though I am unaware if anyone else thought anything of this airplane incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were about 15 minutes into our drive when I glanced out the drivers side window to the east and saw a teardrop shaped object that appeared to be falling in the sky, and left absolutely no trail outside of the taper to the teardrop &#34;point&#34;. The object was about 3/4 white and the center of it was a dull black, almost a matte black. I was watching the object, about 30 seconds after I saw it we heard fighter jets flying. we saw 4 jets flying directly at the object, and the closest air base is about 100 miles away in Brainerd. The jets flew directly at the object, which appeared to be slowly descending about 30 degrees above the horizon. At this point the jets had appeared to be closing in. Suddenly we heard another jet, and looked to see 3 more (i think) jets flying toward the object. I would estimate that the object was somewhere above central Wisconsin. As the jets are flying, we looked toward the west and saw a bullet shaped silver craft that appeared to be burning atmosphere. Then another fighter jet flew toward the west. The object descended past the tree line, where neither of us could see it anymore. The object in the west has taken a turn and headed south where we lost track of it in the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I then noticed two thin but very distinct tornado-like &#34;tendrils&#34; extending from the cumulus clouds in the north. (skies were partly cloudy with puffy white clouds but sunny). These formations were not dark though like regular tornadoes but as white as the clouds themselves were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, as I watched with facination these &#34;cloud ropes&#34; form and twist and then dissipate all in a matter of about 3 or 4 minutes, I said in my mind, &#34;If you are really out there somewhere (meaning the aliens or just &#34;the Other&#34;) then please let me see some evidence of your existence. I will help you in any way I can if I only knew you existed.&#34; I was really sincere in this &#34;telepathic SOS&#34; and continued watching the area where the cloud tendrils formed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my utter surprise, no less than I&#39;d say 20 or 30 seconds after I thought this, a bright starlike object came from over those clouds. At first I figured it must be a jet or something, yet it was very bright yellowish and heading in a south easterly direction towards me. But the light of it did not dim as it traveled and over the entire time I saw it it never flickered or flashed like it was reflecting the sunlight. It was just like a very bright star only during the daytime!<n> <n><n> <n><n> So after about 4 minutes it reached a position to the right of overhead me in the blue sky (about 2 o&#39;clock) and then slowed down and stopped! That instantly ruled out jet or airplane or satellite for me! Then it started traveling to the west towards the 12 o&#39;clock position directly above me. As it did so I watched huge patches of white mist underneath the cumulus clouds start moving rapidly together to the area of the sky underneath this object. Then the object went behind a big cloud directly overhead of me and I watched as parts of even this big cloud swirled in distinctly circular patterns at the edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few more moments of watching I couldn&#39;t find it anymore and my mom then arrived and we left.<n>

She noticed a dark object moving  slowly overhead and brought it to my attn.        I couldn&#39;t actually see it until it stopped, powered itself up with pure brite light,  and projected a straight beam of light in front of my house but up the street about 100 ft for about a second and a half until the beam.....now get this.....dessapated apart...like in particles.   Silent, spherical and metallic in shape, about 1000 ft above us and hovering, it started to move again slowly and in the same direction before it paused the first time.

6/4/06 22:15|Chicago|IL|Disk|60 seconds|Silent wobbling disk with white-illuminated underside moving southwest above downtown Chicago|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50834.html|297|ndxe200606| Silent wobbling disk with white-illuminated underside moving southwest above downtown Chicago<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing on my west-facing balcony on an upper floor of the east tower of the Marina City condo buildings in downtown Chicago (the famous &#34;corncob&#34;-shaped buildings), speaking to a friend on the phone.  My view is to the north and west with a 22-mile horizon view, broken by the ABA (former Quaker) building to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked absentmindedly to the northwest sky and noticed a small, silent, disk-shaped object flying steadily on a southwestern trajectory about a quarter of a mile away and about 600 feet above the ground (it was higher than my balcony and close, but moved behind the 600-foot tall ABA building while I watched it, giving me the opportunity to judge its height).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The top and sides of the disk were completely dark, but the bottom surface was illuminated completely with a brilliant white light, as if a spotlight were shining on it from below.  The disk proceeded steadily in speed, but wobbled as it went, something like a top spinning slightly off its axis, so that every couple of seconds the illuminated underside rotated or leaned into view and then rotated away, but without the craft losing any forward momentum.  (The wobble in the disk looked a lot like the wobble you see in the various news videos of the disks from the daytime mass-event in Mexico a few years ago, which is what I immediately thought of as soon as I saw the object).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 seconds the object moved behind the ABA building and I waited for about 30 seconds for it to reappear, which it did, much further away due to its southwest trajectory and still moving at the same speed and height.  After another ten seconds it disappeared from view completely behind Marina City&#39;s west tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was speechless throughout the incident, prompting my friend on the phone to ask what was wrong.  I explained everything I saw and spent several hours watching the skies from my apartment that night, but the object or another like it did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my apartment, I see hundreds of planes flying to and from O&#39;Hare and flying along the flight path to Midway, as well as helicopters (traffic, police, etc.) all the time, every day and night.  I&#39;m very familiar with the airport flight paths and aircraft lighting schemes, as they&#39;re part of my nonstop view out of my windows and off of my balcony.  What I saw last night was like absolutely nothing I have ever seen flying over Chicago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My binoculars aren&#39;t that powerful but it looked like some type of flying object.  The object was heading Northeast.  All of a sudden more of these strange objects appeared from behing the moon and started a formation heading Northeast.  This continued for about 15 minutes and then they all dissapeared.  I believe they went higher into the sky so they were no longer visible.  Each of the objects looked the same.  They were about twice the size of a star and appeared to have lights.  At one point, my boyfriend which witnesses this as well, thought that they might be balloons.  But they were so high in the sky that I don&#39;t think that is possible.  Also because of the fact that they appeared to come from behind the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was a plane, because it was made out of shiny metal and seemed rather large and only about a few hundred feet away from me.  I didn&#39;t see any wings on it and I didn&#39;t hear any sound.  At arms length it was approximately 3 inches in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were some cumulus clouds in the sky, so when it passed behind the clouds instead of in front of them, I was shocked.  It was enormous!  Possibly 400 to 500 feet in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it might have been a helicopter or low flying plane, but it was a very quiet night and the object gave off no noise. I quickly ran back inside and grabbed another employee to come look. When we came back out, the object had stopped in the air about a mile from our location. We watched for about thirty seconds, then there was a flash of light and the object took off at great speed in a southerly direction. The object was egg shaped, or possibly an elongated disk, emitting a pale blue light. The light flash was also pale blue, just significantly brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

If Military, why maneuveurs over LA?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clear, light blue skies, well lit still by sun, half-full moon in the sky over Hollywood / Los Angeles area.  My brother and I were sitting outside enjoying the evening.  Told him to check out the star and moon (which were right next to each other, the star was JUST outside the crescent, as if cradled) and he said &#34;that can&#39;t be a star, it must be a planet, it&#39;s so light out.&#34;  Then it started moving, we said, &#34;Oh, it&#39;s a plane&#34;.  But then when it came to a complete halt, we said, &#34;um.  ok.  do helicopters fly that high?&#34;.  Then we noticed another one going perpindicular, which seemed to appear out of nowhere (our eyes were PRETTY focused on the clear section of sky in our view).  Then we called our friends over who were setting up a tent in the backyard and we all watched for a while.  We then saw three more of them appear and fly in a standard V formation and then re-form at LIGHTNING speed (very very high up) into a few other odd formations and then dissapear.  These thing came into and out of view in a split second.  My friend checked them out with his binocolurs and said it appeared &#34;round&#34; with lights front and back.  Ok, i know, sounds like classic b.s.    Well, if they&#39;re planes, what in the flying hell are they doing such incredible stunts right over central Los Angeles for?    I tried to reach the FAA and Homeland Security at LAX and got an answering machine!  Lovely!  I spoke with someone (in the flurry of numbers i called) at a local airforce command station who said they had no flying going on in the area at the moment and ref&#39;d me here!  Nice one guys.  Gathering enemy threat in the skies? Cool, ref it over to UFOCentral! Jesus.  Not putting this site down, it&#39;s just that i&#39;d expect a little more from their response, let alone the FAA and Homeland Security.  After around 25 minutes more they were all gone.  They did not fly off north or south or east or west, they just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took pics but no luck, took video and got some of it - you can check it out here, but if i get too many downloads, i&#39;ll have to cut it.  I hope that someone will archive it and post it elsewhere if it&#39;s of use.  When you watch the clip, at 4 seconds into it you&#39;ll see a white dot in the top left quarter of the screen (you&#39;ll see the unfocused power lines running diagonally, follow the wires to find the white dot).  You&#39;ll see it, over the span of one second of film, it moves to the left across the power lines farther left and upwards.  (I&#39;m not saying the craft moved that fast, it was my camera motion that moved quickly).  Anyway, admittadly, the film proves nada, only that we thought we were seeing some very very wacky stuff that none of us (4 of us in our thirties and 2 children) can explain.

Took 3 photo&#39;s that point in the same direction trying to get the best shot. There is a mountain which is apart of the 7 sisters which I was informed were volcanic. I was using this mountain in my photos for the effect and it is approx 1-2 km away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the last photo taken, I looked into the Veiw Finder and saw an object that appeared to glow and an oval shape with a dome on the top. When I took the photo I did see a object move but by the time I looked up after taking the photo no objects were seen. No Noise was noted during the time of taking the photographs and the day was clear of cloud cover with no wind. ( small amount of clound at the base of the mountain) I showed the phtotgraph to my Wife and then also to the people who owned the accomadation we stayed at the following day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I develpoed the photo&#39;s that I took the next day and came aware that with each photo I took there were objects in each frame. The second photo I took has 3 objects heading sky wards which are also oval shape and have a metalic look about them. They seem to be following each other back up towards the sky from the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also another 3 in the same photo which are higher in the sky and have a different shape which is hard to explain. There is also another few objects that you can see when you zoom into the photo, and I do not recall seeing any stars at that time of day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had another smaller white object just above and to the right slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I called my friends over to explain what I was seeing.  The small object then seemed to move diagonally across the path of the bigger one and come to rest just below it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this stage we all stared to see a lot more of the smaller objects randomly scattered in the sky surrounding the large one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At a guess there must have been 12 to 15 of these smaller objects slowly appear.  None seemed to move, they just faded in and with in 5 minutes they started to fade out again leaving the large white object to slowly fade out by itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing lasted for approx 15 min with 9 other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was day light with a clear blue sky at the time.<n>

The object was heading south along yonge street south of highway 401 in toronto. it was roughly at the height of a traffic helicopter, but it was definately no traffic helicopter (it was a saturday afternoon, there aren&#39;t any traffic copters up on the weekend) the object was shaped like a capsule (drug capsule) and had two antenna like spikes sticking out of the top. the object moved in a controlled fashion, up and down and side to side. at first i thought it might be a blimp, but after watching it i conclude it was no blimp. There was absolutely no sound coming from the object. if anyone knows what this was please tell me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We then realized there was another object, smaller in size but same altitude (20K feet)flying a little behind and above the airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The type of movement and flying pattern was different than that of the airplane.  It looked more steady, perhaps slower speed.  As the airplane continued towards a north-easterly direction, the object drifted more towards the southeastern direction.  We tohught it could have been a helium balloon that had gotten loose.  However, at the same time a smaller airplane (private plane) flew around the same direction as that of the object and then we realized this strange object was definitely a lot higher and could not possibly be a small balloon as we could see it on its steady course and round shape (it looked white from our point of view).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my wife and I (and small daugther ) kept our eye on the object, it suddenly stopped and it &#34;sat&#34; there for a few seconds.  It then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
6/3/06 13:45|St. Peters|MO|Cylinder|5 minutes|Saw 2 objects in broad daylight within 20 minutes|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50879.html|308|ndxe200606| Saw 2 objects in broad daylight within 20 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in this area from out of state visiting relatives.  On this Saturday afternoon, I was running some errands with my 4 year old son, driving east on Old Hwy 94, when I looked to the north and saw a vertical white cylinder cruising from west to east.  It appeared to be about 3/4 of a mile away and at about 2000-2500 feet above ground.  Its proportions were about 1 to 5, so I guess it was about 6&#39; wide by 30&#39; tall. It was moving steadily at a speed equal to or greater than that of a twin engine propeller-driven airplane, so I would guess 150-200 mph.  I worked my way through an intersection and then pulled to a stop in a parking lot for a better look.  This thing cruised and then quickly slowed to a complete stop, where it hovered for maybe 10 seconds, then traveled straight up at about half it&#39;s previous speed for about 1000 feet, then stopped and hovered for maybe 30 seconds, then began accelerating to the east again at 150-200 mph.  I watched its departure until it went out of sight.  It remained very bright white the whole time, and as it moved, it never looked thinner or flashed brightly as if it had edges, so I think it was a cylinder.  The sky was sunny with a broken ceiling of alto-cumulus clouds, with moderate winds out of the west.  The object remained below the clouds.  The object was traveling with the wind, but maneuvering unlike a balloon or anything else.  I continued with my errands, constantly looking up to the sky as I drove around town.  After a few minutes, I stopped at a Sonic drive-in for lunch and parked so that I could look to the north-west.  I began eating my lunch while looking up through the windshield, and was rewarded almost immediately (this was 20 minutes later)when I saw a dark round object flying from west to east.  I got out of the car for a better look and saw as it was approaching and then passing almost directly above, that it was round when viewed from below and a flattened oval when viewed from the side.  It was shaped just like a glass piece from the game &#34;Pente&#34;.  This object was bronze-colored (a dark blend of green, brown and gold).  As it made distance, I could see that the top was highly refective of the sun.  I wanted to rule it out as a toy balloon, but it wasn&#39;t.  As it traveled, I gained a sense of its approximate height and distance and surmised it was not small and low to the ground, but higher, larger and faster.  It wobbled as it flew; listing 20-30 degrees but never flipping end over end.  I would guess it was at about 1000&#39; above ground and maybe 8&#39;-12&#39; in diameter.  I later called the St. Louis FAA Fight Service Station which offers detailed weather conditions for pilots.  The briefer told me that at that time the cloud ceiling was at or above 5000&#39; above ground, the winds aloft at 3000&#39; were at 18 knots (approx. 20 mph) from the west.  This told me that although both objects were traveling with the wind, they were cruising on their own power 8 to 10 times faster than the wind could push them.  I feel lucky to have seen these things, but returned to the family reunion not saying a damn word about it.  I&#39;ll tell my son about it when he&#39;s older and will look up to the skies a lot more often.  I am 45 years old, a private pilot and I work as an architect.<n>

It was 0300 Mexaco time. I looked out of the port hole in my state room and saw 3 what appeared to be lights in a straight line just below the water surface. I made sure all the lights in my state room were off because I wanted to eliminate any reflections. They were keeping pace with the ship and right below my port hole window. After approx. 10 min. they began to head away from the ship as if to go around the bow. I was on the starboard side of the ship and we were headed north by north/east. They headed tword the horizon at  45degrees away from the ship and they were still under water. As they got closer to the horizon I lost sight of them. I continued to look tword the direction they were headed. All of a sudden I saw three lights above the horizon and they were going straight up. They continued to climb straight up for I would say approx. 5000&#39; or 10,000&#39; then they did a hard 90degree left turn parallel the horizon. When I saw then turn the first thing that crossed my mind was &#34;come back&#34;. When I thought this the three lights (in a straight line) reversed direction at a very rapid speed. The lights then formed a perfect triangle as they appeared to gain altitude from the previous turn. They dissapeared after making the triangle pattern. The time between the hard left turn, and the triangle dissapearing was approx. 25 to 30 seconds. The total time I saw these lights was 25min.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could tell the craft was moving in the same direction I was. I saw small lights of reddish orange in what appeared to be the back of the craft. It was about the size of a large home. I have never seen any craft that ever loked as unique or as impressive as this one. I looked at the craft for only about 10 seconds due to my driving at night. The craft quickly disappeared. When I arrived home, my brother in law discribed seeing the same green craft coming out of the sky and hovering behind trees about 5-8 minutes before I saw the craft. He mentioned that while he was driving, another car in front of him must have seen the craft also because they put on their brakes and slowed down. He thought it was going to crash on or near the road due to it&#39;s descending angle towards the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was  very high up and I could not see any shape but it had an orange glow/colour to it. I would normally think it was an aircraft,(it was moving at about the speed an aircraft would) but the reason this one caught my attention was because it was silent and dropping objects, about one per minute or two. the objects it was dropping started off as orange glowing lights , (the same colour as the flying object) but they then dissintegrated into nothing. Similar to how a firework dissapears before it hits the ground.  I called my wife just in time for her to see it emitting a final object before it faded from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing I can think of is perhaps it was a military exercise, as there are military bases in Wales. Has anybody else experienced a similar experience?<n>

On this day was overcast with storms in the area, but it never rained where I was.  My coworkers and I were always watching the sky to see if there was a rainshower near by.  At about 15:00hrs I spotted an object in the distant sky which I thought was a helicopter approaching to a landing strip about a mile away from my location.  I noticed that the speed at which the object was approaching was very slow and I proceeded to ask my two other coworkers their opinion of what the object was.  The responses they gave me (a hawk, a baloon, a kite, a blimp) were slowly being eliminated as the object moved closer to our location in Harlingen, Tx.  The best description that I can give about the object is as follows.  It was black in color and had a triangular shape.  At one point in my observation, it seemed as if it was a convetional private jet airplane that was out of control because it had a faint sound of a jet engine and was rotating as it made its approach.  As it moved closer, I began to notice a disturbance that encompassed the object; a light orange colored aura.  It also left a trail of disturbed air also tinted in orange which demonstrated its movement.  At it&#39;s closest point, five other coworkers joined me in the observation of the object.  the object was approaching from the ESE and took a turn to the WSW and began moving away from my location at almost the same speed as the approach.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The only reason the craft was so visible was the reflection it gave off but the reflection did not show the exact outline.  However the reflection(s) allowed use to visually follow the craft while my friend and I kept asking each other, &#34;Have you ever seen an aircraft do that?&#34;, over and over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Al was over Saturday evening and I saw my first UFO.  Craziest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.  I still don&#39;t believe it was an Alien thing but it wasn&#39;t any typical aircraft.  The speed and its maneuvering looked impossible.  It chased two planes over the airport going two different directions, dodged another and then dove close to the ground and proceeded south all in 10-12 seconds.  It was at dusk so the sun was going down but shinning on the vehicle.  It was white and no lights of any kind.  It had to be a pearl white or like that reflective 3M white tape or sign material.  It was not shiny metallic but definitely white but a halogen white.  It did not have a vertical stab, rudder and it was a little hazy so there was no way to make out any detail.  There has been a lot of activity at the Ft. Carson and Peterson since this weekend.  My guess is that it is some sort of new flight vehicle and they were testing it.  It was likely also very stealthy so I assume it was likely not picked up on radar, especially considering what it did and the speed involved.  It was directly east when I saw it and farther out than an approach for the airport.  It came around and come up behind the first plane and veered off coming around to approaching the second plane coming in at a right angle to the first plane.  That was an &#39;S&#39; shape that covered more than 12 miles.  Then it went south and dodged a plane on approach while in a steep dive.  After it came close to the ground it leveled off and proceeded south.  It did this all within 8 seconds, no longer.  It did not seem to lean into turns as an aircraft would and looked like it stayed level.  Neither Al or I could make out its shape except it did not have a rudder.  The only plane that I know that could do this would be an F-22 but there was no sound.  Something maneuvering that fast should have made some pretty noticeable throttling jet engine sounds.  If the F-22 has noise suppression maybe, flying an experimental pattern and painted pearl or reflective white.  My guess and feel after just watching the Thunderbirds at graduation is it was traveling just under mach one.  Also it did not change speed either in the hard maneuvers or when it dove.  It just looked really odd.  Neither Al or I took our eyes off of it until we could not see it any longer and just started laughing.  He&#39;s retired Army advanced radar and communications technician.  The F-22 has vector thrust but it makes a lot of noise and it still looses speed in hard maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing this was not was winged aircraft, even an F-22 with vectored thrust.  It made maneuvers that only a helicopter could make but at a speed that had to be just below mach one at 7000 to 10000 ft. elevations.  The two sincere giveaways that this was a special craft was first it flew over an municipal airport and Air Force Base with no lights and in two flight paths of other aircraft and came very close to the rear of those two plane with no clearance lights or landing lights… all very illegal for either military or civilian aircraft.  The second giveaway was either drastic changes in direction or elevation did not change the velocity of the craft in the slightest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a believer in extraterrestrials, an engineer and would have to see either an extraterrestrial or their craft closely before I could possibly believe.  Someone owns and operates on incredible aircraft for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly we both see a white/yellowish light traveling south at an incredibly high speed (approx 1000mph or more). The object did not descend or slow down. It was traveling at a constant speed at approx.a  few thousand feet high. It was very quiet outside and the object did not emit any sound whatsoever nor did it have any blinking lights nor a headlight. We continued to watch the object until it left our field of view, not losing speed or altitude. I have seen many strange looking objects in the sky before which were explainable by either natural phanomena or conventional aircraft. Unfortunately, this object did not pause in mid-air nor had made any right angle turns, but I believe it was worth reporting, so hopefully you can give us some kind of insinght or info regarding our sighting. Thank you very much for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. Both of us were sober at the time of the sighting and do not have any interest in making pranks nor making false reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly it sounded like a helicopter as it was approching. i stood to my front yard and looked over my house, South, and saw it heading my direction, North. When it was close enough the noise changed to a Humming Pulse. It wasnt moving very fast, about 100-200mph. Altitude approx. 150-200 ft. Suddenly stopped completely approx. 600 ft. past me. Spaceship was in shape of an H  very flat. with a light in each corner, and a smaller light in the center of the ship. I went inside to grab a witness, and as i was moving away, it took off six times faster than it was moving before.

It was a glowing oval/circular? The glow was a greenish brite white. It was in the sky north of us. It was a little far away to tell what the EXACT shape was, but close enough to know that it did not make any sound.  It was odd, was moving way too fast to be a jet, or fighter aircraft of any sort.  I have never witnessed that type of light on ANY aircraft I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed it and pointed it out to the small crowd.  We talked about it as we saw it.  It was flying at a distance that put it over trees that lined the creek that runs behind the apartment complex.  It tracked from the point I noticed it WEST, to the East where id did not travel to the horizon, it stopped at one point, dead stop, staitionary, it did some erratic movements- sideways, up, down, diagonal.  These movements were darts, not slow movements.  It headed north and started to go behind the trees.  I ran around the side of the building to not loose it, but it had dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I knew of this site earlier, I have told a few people about it.  It was an awesome experience, I have read on here people seeing multiple UFO&#39;s, I hope I get the chance to see more!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was around eleven p.m. and the weather was clear.  We were looking at the stars when we noticed what looked like a satellite traveling across the sky from South East to North West.  I estimate the angle was about eighty degrees up from the horizon.  The speed of the object (still thinking it was a satellite) seemed consistent with a satellite in orbit.  After observing it for few seconds, it slowed down and stopped.  Then it seemed to come lower and became brighter and larger.  The color was a bright golden light. The object then seemed to grow considerably brighter, so much so that it illuminated the ocean in front of us, maybe two three miles out.  Then it seemed if the light became a beam of light as if searching for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started backing away from this as the light started coming in our direction. Of course we did not know what to think, we were just caught up in the moment as we have never seen anything like this.  The object’s altitude by now appeared to be about 20,000 feet. (I make this reference as I am a commercial pilot).  The light the object was emitting was coming nearer and we started walking backwards feeling a little concerned now. Then within what seemed a second or two, the object and its brilliant light collapsed upon itself and it appeared to climb back to what an object in earth’s orbit might be, and sped off at an extreme velocity and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

6/1/06 22:00|Cape Coral|FL|Unknown|4 seconds|I know where these balls of light are probably sitting right now.I know the island they are under.NO JOKE|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51926.html|322|ndxe200606| I know where these balls of light are probably sitting right now.I know the island they are under.NO JOKE<n> <n><n> <n><n> We we&#39;re fishing in between mangrove islands in one foot of water with no lights on the boat. we ran wide open looking for deeper water so we could stop and ended up in an area no one would probably be foolish enough to go. my friend has his 5 yr old son asleep with us,Having no running lights or components working we were nestled in to a place where we knew would keep us pretty far off the beatin trail.My friend was fishing facing the mangrove island, I was facing the open area towards other islands and a piece of the mouth of the haurbor was in view. my friend said &#34;W-T-F&#34;,I looked at him and laughed .He said &#34;Are there fire flies out here?&#34;, I focussed in to the island in to the tree&#39;s for a few and didn&#39;t see any ,(I grew up around them) He said &#34;If there&#39;s no fire flies out here then we need to get the f--k out of here !&#34; To which i again laughed at him (He became scared of what he at first thought was a fire fly) I told him to epect that we probably were not alone ,between piracy and visitors ,He interrupted me and told me he didn&#39;t believe in any of that shit. I told him that I did and he should.I told him I was not leaving and that we were the hostile ones.We continued fishing.    I was sort of focussing on my line and the water and A SOLID BALL OF LIGHT ,as impressive as the moon,came from in between the island my friend was facing and the next island up,lower then the tops of the the mangrove tree&#39;s.   It showed up Quick and quite !  I looked up just as quick and focussed on it and my first thought was&#34; we&#39;re busted&#34; and I pointed at it and yelled &#34;God damn that is a bright light for somthing that doesn&#39;t make any noise&#34;And it TURNED OFF,   I followed it&#39;s path with my fingers waiting for the &#34;vessel&#34; to cross the lit up part of the harbour so i could see what it was and there was no vessel where one should have been. Where i was fishing gave me a view from my 1 o&#39;clock to 3 o&#39;clock of the stars touching the lights of the habour in the far distance,,that section of my vision was well lit..Nothing broke my vision of the stars and lights  The &#34;vessel&#34; that made a light like that would have to be big enough to be seen with out lights on.    This was a solid ball of light that can only be described as a smaller moon with no face. It did not project light as if to light up the way,,There didn&#39;t seem to be a filiment in the center making it brighter in the center  There was no glare off this thing at all and it did not make any sound at all.   We should have heard a vessel befor we saw one.We made sure of it when we chose that location.This thing was on us with the snap of a finger and I got a good look at it.  After yelling to him and pointing at it i said&#34;DID YOU SEE THAT ?&#34;  &#34;YOU DIDN&#39;T SEE THAT FU__IN BALL OF LIGHT JUST RIGHT THERE ?&#34;  He looked at me and shook his head.Just then my friends big reel started screeming ,We jumped up and he set the hook on somthing big,,We were scrambling around,Iwas moving poles ,pulled the anchor ,raised the motor,,after acouple of minutes we landed this big Searay.We were let down that it was a ray,,Meanwhile we had coasted or blown into the mangrove island to the point where we couldn&#39;t use the motor to get out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had no light to speek of ,all the poles were tangled and the foliage was trying to take things over.We sat there and reflected briefly on the catch.I was back to the light thing and excitedly asked him if he saw it or not and he sort of shook his head no. I asked him what he saw when he thaught he saw fire flies and he said he didn&#39;t know and repeated once again that we needed to get out of here. I looked in to the island and focussed my eyes and asked him if he thought someone was on the island and he told me you couldn&#39;t get on the island and that there wasn&#39;t really any hard surface to stand on like some of the other islands we had seen.I asked him what was behind the island and he said nothing or another island. I asked him why it was lit up towards what seemed to be the middle of the island and he said he didn&#39;t know.  i pointed my finger towards the middle and down  and asked him &#34;Does it seem to you that there is light comming from the island and said there was.....Straight in to the 11oclock and down was lit up but there was no actual light to be seen but it was with out a doubt lit up.....I could see pretty far in there but couldn&#39;t see what was causing the light.    My hair stood up and felt like i was somewhere i wasn&#39;t safe to be and much to my own surprise was very concerned in getting the boat out of there quick. I had a very strong feeling we were about to be boarded by somthing i couldn&#39;t see and grew scared for the first time in years. I wasn&#39;t the same person who said he wasn&#39;t leaving. We used our net to pole out to open waters and left with our eyes focussed on the illumination coming from under the mangrove island.The Ball of light that I got a good look at came from under and i&#39;m sure out of the other side of the mangrove island.  Not only did I see it but i remember where the island is and I know they were there when we left ,uder the mangrove island.You would need a helicopter to lower you in to the middle of the island with a wet suit on and diving gear to check it out but i&#39;m sure you could get samples off of the vegitation At some point arroundand definately under that part of the island.They have what must be a good spot to bed down in under there or it is an entrance of some kind that they use to surface without being spotted.They travel below the brush line and go between and around the islands and not above to stay un seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As it shot it&#39;s way on a Northwestern path it burned itself out.  There was no sound, and no smoke or vapor trail.  It was intensely bright, very noticable in the dusky evening sky.  It was not completely dark out as there was still a bright western sky.  It&#39;s path was a straight line going from Southeast to Northwest.  Looking East, East being twelve o&#39;clock, it was sighted at one o&#39;clock and shot to our northern side burning out at the eight o&#39;clock position while traveling in the same straight line.  It may have been a meteorite, but never have I seen one that was so bright, incredibly close or large, that lasted for several seconds.  I only witnessed it for three to five seconds, who knows how long it was visible since we had just walked out side?<n>

We both noticed at the same moment a bright orb moving slowly across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said it was probably a plane, but I was sure it was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched for a couple seconds as it moved across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then out of nowhere the light shot downward, and then to the right, and streaked across the sky then disappeared. It appeared to make a right angle turn at very rapid speeds it was gone in a split second, and the streak lasted only about a second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both stunned!  We knew that it had to be a UFO because no aircraft that the U.S.A. is capable to go that fast, let alone make a right angle turn in a split second.  There’s no doubt in my mind that what we saw that night was in fact a UFO and the answer to the question are we alone in this world is no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pretty soon everyone is going to know about it because it’s only a matter of time until we find out if their hostile or if their friendly.  What do you think their doing up there?  Studying us?  Looking for weakness?  Mapping our world for future plans?  The answer is out there and I want to find out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It moved slowly to the north and faded out of sight over a period of about ten minutes.  When we first saw it, it was directly over head. I thought maybe it was the ISS but I checked NASA&#39;s website and the ISS was no where near where we were looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It caught my attention because it was bigger than anything else shining in the sky and a lot brighter.  I had to interrupt their conversation twice so that they could take a look at what I was seeing. My mom’s house was located in a large area where the only lights you could see outside were the front porch lights if that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer to my mom’s, which meant more darkness, the one bright light seemed to change into about 8-10 colorful lights all blinking in a row. This caused my mom to stop the car on the road and we all proceeded to get out of the car and look up at the object. It was a round shaped, saucer like object, however only half of the circle was lit. It seemed very quiet and it was right above our heads in the sky. It almost seemed like it was planned for us to be right underneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we snapped out of it, I told my mom “Let’s go tell the guys, they will never believe us! Hurry before it goes away!” I wanted my step-father and husband to observe this UFO so that they wouldn’t think we were crazy when we told them about our sighting. We rushed back in the car and drove to my mom’s about 7 seconds away from the sighting.  As we ran out of the car and made it to the porch the UFO flew off at a speed I had never before seen in my life of anything in the sky. It was in the next city in a matter of 2-3 seconds I believe.  Of course as we came inside to explain what we had just witnessed they laughed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The jet appeared to be 7,000 to 10,000 ft altitude and may have been on approach to an airport in the New York City area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the aircraft move northwest a silver object caught my eye moving northwest to southeast. The object was at a very high altitude. It appeared to be oval. It left no contrail and it was moving at a fast speed relative to my position on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object cross over the sky and I lost sight of it after about ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions were very good with an unlimited ceiling and no clouds.

I could not sleep so i walked outside and sat down on the front stoop.I was looking up at the stars in awe of how crystal clear the sky was.Suddenly i saw a pattern of lights moving toward me with incredable speed,the lights were bluish almost the same color as the stars and appeared to be moving around one another.It happened so fast i did not even have time to think about what i was seeing.The pattern of lights came directly over me quite low and as they passed i saw a dark perfect triangle with one bluish white light on each corner.My mouth dropped involuntarily I thought about calling someone from inside the house but i was so stunned i could not speak.The triangle was the fastest moving object i have ever seen(besides a shooting star)and completely silent,no rumble,no breeze.I tried to make sense of what i had seen.I blew it off as a low flying stealth bomber.I told myself that the lights had only appeared to be moving around one another because it had approached my location on its side and flattened out as it passed over.This explanation satisfied me until i described it to my father in the morning.He assured me that a stealth flying that low would have made some sort of sound.Also i do not believe that stealths or even concords can move at that rate.Also the shape and configuration does not match.Even though the event lasted barely 3 or 4 breaths i will never get the image out of my mind.I am happy to find a place to talk about this in a way that is taken seriously.I have sent a second report in of a diffrent nature that happened a bit later.I hope that these reports will help to lend some validity to others that may be similar in nature.I have lived on the outer banks of north carolina for sometime and there are many here who have seen these things in the night sky but very few talk about it.I stopped telling these stories in the face of ridicule and disbelief thank you for providing me a place to lay them to rest..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

6/1/06 02:00|Bodie (near)|CA|Circle|2 hours|The object was approximately 30 feet in diameter; it appeared as a round sphere with yellow and orange pointed shafts of light eminatin|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58642.html|337|ndxe200606| The object was approximately 30 feet in diameter; it appeared as a round sphere with yellow and orange pointed shafts of light eminating from a bright white center;the spheres of light moved around the white center rapidly in an eratic movement. The object was aopproximately 30 to 120 feet off the ground ; it moved in a fallen leaf pattern coming close to the ground and then going higher. It looked like it was searching for something over an area of about 300 yards. It traveled back and forth, up and down, over the area for about two hours until a little after 4:00 am. It was approximately 150 yards away from me, but then started to move closer to me as it continued to move back and forth, up and down. When it got about 100 yards away from me I heard a noise coming from it that I had neaver heard before. It sounded like a variable tone hissing sound which caused me concern for my well being. At that point I hid in the sage brush, looking up occasionally to observe it, until the object suddenly dissapeared about 4:00 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

As I noticed this, I told my girlfriend who had spotted the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon further observation, I thought the objects looked more like stars, as they were small and appeared to be white lights.  My girlfriend maintains that it was a single, solid object with lights on the leading edges.  Regardless of their shape they continued to fly straight at a constant speed in a westerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon the formation (or possibly one single craft) broke apart.  The objects on either side took off at extraordinary speed to the north and south respectively until they were completely invisible.  Soon the leading object did the same, flying straight ahead to the west.  These objects were moving extremely fast, and apparently at an extremely high altitude.  They literally took less than a second to disappear completely from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pleas note that the date and time of this sighting is NOT exact.  I was not aware of this resource at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

She has worked for the state previously, but now works at a daycare part time.  She would never fabricate a story intentionally and I have never heard her say anything else anywhere near as un-explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO reported sighting in Lexington, SC June 2006 Sighted by ((female&#39;s name deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interviewed by ((husband&#39;s initials deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This interview comes on account of a recent (in fact today) sighting by my wife.  Since she had seen a previous sighting some years before, I wanted to compile the two and submit them to the web.  This information below is about a sighting she had in the summer of 2006.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Spooky, Near Earth Space Station  When my wife first told me about the sighting, she said, &#34;I think I saw the space station.  It was really weird!  I had no idea what to think back then, her description though fascinating, boggled my mind, so I basically ignored it.  Now I will document that sighting.  Today I interviewed her;  &#34;It looked like something you would see in a movie.  &#34;It was big.  I could see the &#34;person&#34; in it.&#34;  If you stretched out your arms straight out at length, in front of you, you would have to spread the fingers about 16-20 inches to equal the apparent length of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How far away was it?  It was close?   “It WAS close!  I didn&#39;t look at it long at all, I simply gasped in shock, and turned around and shut the  door behind me quickly.  All I can say is that it was close!  I saw a “person” with “spiky hair” in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What direction did it move?  “It was just above the row of “red-tips” (an evergreen shrub of the south U.S.) and it was either hovering or moving slightly to my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What time of day was it?  “It was midnight.”  What time of the year?  “It was about 2 months after we moved here.”  So that would make it June 2006?  “Yes that sounds right.”  What happened?  “I was on the phone with my friend Melissa.  I didn&#39;t want to wake anyone else, so I headed outside.  I opened the side (deck) door, stepped out and there it was.  I said &#39;Uh-oh!&#39; and turned right around back inside.  I told my friend that I was going to bed and hung the phone up on her right there and then.  I went to bed.” 	“Some days later when I explained to my friend what happened, she said “sometimes you can see the space station.  Maybe that was what you saw.”  But she didn&#39;t realize this thing was so near that I could see a &#39;person&#39; inside it.  But it made absolutely no noise at all.  What was it?!?”  Description:  	Based upon the witnesses description and testimony, the interviewers best guess at size would be approx 8 feet high by 20-25 feet long, rectangular about 2.5 to 3 times as long as it&#39;s height.  “It was white with two large windows directly facing me.”  (Based upon the drawing, these windows covered at least 50% of the exposed area.  There might be about 1.5 feet around the edges (and separating the two), all around the windows comprising the rest of the object.  There seemed to be two seating areas, and a “person with spiky hair” sat on the window to my left.&#34;  What was &#34;he&#34; doing?  &#34;There was a control panel that &#39;he&#39; was &#39;guiding&#39; the craft with.  Any lights?  There was a “regular” yellowish light on inside it, with no lights on the outside.” What was on the other (right) side?  &#34;Nothing.  It looked the same as the left side, but no-one was there.  I just saw the one “person.”  Conclusion:  	Myself the interviewer (and husband) know that the story is either an apparition or completely true, but not a work of fiction.  My wife would never make something like this up.  So I wonder what would be the best cause for the sighting? The best match for a man made object would seem to be the cockpit of a large dirigible.  But Amanda saw NO dirigible along the top of the object, and this would have been a much larger portion of the object, but nothing like that was seen.  And the sited object was very low, and CLOSE and it made (she insisted time and again) absolutely NO noise.  Myself (and the family 3-4 years later) have witnessed the travels of a dirigible in the surrounding area about town, and that dirigible maintained at least 400-500 feet above the trees and moved very noisily at maybe 25-35 MPH.  It was flashing a red “billboard” advertisement.  I would have to estimate that the sited (UFO) object was only 200-250 feet above the ground, and only at most the same linear distance, as there was the view of a “person with spiky hair” at the “control panel.”  Unknown Flying Object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SAME WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rectangle with two large portals and a figure at the controls up VERY close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is an amendment or addition to a previous report I submitted about 3 days ago.

I was listening to my iPod while looking up at the sky which was crystal clear blue with no clouds when I noticed a tiny silver round object hovering above. The object was at such a high altitude that it was hard to keep my eye on it. It moved slowly in a south-east direction but would stop and hover completely motionless every so often. I pointed it out to my girlfriend who found it hard to see at first because of the high altitude. She eventually saw it as well. We watched it for a little longer and eventually ignored it as it was hard to track with the naked eye. We are both professionals living and working in Manhattan and really have no reason to fabricate this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
