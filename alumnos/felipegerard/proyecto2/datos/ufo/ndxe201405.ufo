5/31/14 23:30|Traverse City|MI|Sphere|2 minutes|Three dark orange/red spheres over Traverse Bay, MI.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109882.html|2|ndxe201405| Three dark orange/red spheres over Traverse Bay, MI<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 23:30 on May 31, 2014, I was sitting on a couch in a dark room watching a fire in the fireplace; I happened to glance through a window (located on the north side of the condominium) up into the dark night sky (there was little moonlight outside,  I believe we had a waxing crescent moon) at about a 45° angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed three dark orange spheres out in the distance come into view; they were descending, traveling southward in a fairly straight-line formation toward me from a northwardly direction.  The three spheres were spaced about the same distance apart as they descended toward me.  As they descended they appeared to begin a slow sweeping arch toward a southwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15 seconds the second (center) sphere appeared to release three small (pin-size) spheres from directly beneath it; all three spheres fell equal distance apart for 3–5 seconds prior to totally, instantly, disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three dark orange spheres—each appearing to be slightly larger than a pencil eraser—continued their slow, sweeping southwestward descent.  As the three spheres were beginning to level off while continuing to turn (and while they were just barely north of my position) I stepped out onto the deck to get a better view.  The distance between the three spheres appeared to expand. As the sphere in front started to move in a more westward direction and began to gain altitude the middle sphere released three additional small (pin-size) spheres from directly beneath it; all three of these spheres also fell equal distance apart for 3–5 seconds prior to totally, instantly disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lead sphere began to pull away from the other two as it gained altitude as it traveled in a westward direction; the second (middle) sphere also began to gain attitude as it traveled in a westward direction.  The third (and last) sphere appeared to slow as it gained altitude while also traveling in a westward direction away from Traverse City.  I watched the three spheres until they were completely out of sight…gaining altitude as they continued traveling in a westward direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three spheres appeared to be fairly far away from my location; I would estimate they never got closer than Grand Traverse Bay and remained beyond the Peninsula while making their sweep from the northwardly to the westward direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spheres appeared to glow.  They did not have discrete/separate lights or lights that pulsated; I did not hear any type of noise come from the spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the three main spheres for approximately two minutes.  The two sets of spheres that fell from beneath the second (center) sphere instantly disappeared after 3–5 seconds.<n>

He was yelling about something in the sky.  My wife went out first because I was preoccupied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my wife started yelling for me I thought something was wrong because of how she sounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to the front yard ready to take care of who ever was causing problems.  My wife told me to look in the sky and I saw a huge redish orange ballon the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought maybe a comet or something of that sort but then it started moving away from the earth towards space.  After it started moving it only a few seconds before it was completely out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always believed in extraterrestrial beings and have been studying the subject for close to a decade.  I have always hoped to be lucky enough to see something like this but never expected to really see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So far I have asked 20-30 people if they had seen anything in the sky last night but so far we are the only ones.

The object was like a fire or candle.  It did not appear as hazy or with an aura around it though I wouldn’t say the sphere shaped light’s edges were extremely sharp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was over the lake, about a few hundred feet beyond the bridge and a few hundred feet higher in the air relative to us (on the bridge).  It glowed brightly but not in a blinding way like the headlights of a car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving horizontally and didn’t seem to be moving up or down.  It glided in the opposite the direction we were heading. It moved smoothly and within the car I could not hear it making any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately we couldn’t pull over to get a longer look (we were driving on a fairly busy highway over a bridge.)  When we were able to turn around we went back over the bridge but the object was no longer there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark out, 10: 36 pm.<n>

Some of the orbs were in a triangular formation of sorts, at least two of the orbs were flying alone together and as i watched the orbs move at least two just seemed to vanish in mid flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then two of the orbs that were in one of the triangular formation vanished .<n>

At first I thought that they were planes lined up ready to make a landing, but then quickly realized we were a little too far out of the city for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, I realized that each light seemed low in the sky for a plane, then I noted that each seemed to be orange in color with no flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noted that as we passed under them that they each seemed to be travelling quite slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner and I both observed the lights and both thought that they were very unusual and did not appear to be planes.<n>

There was a party going on at the house behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up to go inside when I looked up into the sky and saw a group of six or seven lights moving toward us from the south.  They were moving in a Northerly direction not unlike conventional aircraft.  The thing I thought was odd was their shape and color.  They were all identical; circular, orange at the center with a yellowish ring around the edge with 2 very small flashing white lights opposite each other along the rim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the group moved across the sky it seemed one was lagging on behind and caught up with the rest of the group.  They had no sound at all.  When they met together as a group right above us, they started to disappear one at a time, which I thought was kind of odd.  It was a partly cloudy sky that night.  I could see some stars so I don’t know if they climbed and went through clouds or exactly what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what their elevation could have been.<n>
5/31/14 22:00|Frankfort|KY|Circle|5 minutes|10+ silent orange flying objects in strict formation for 5 minutes then disappearing.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109942.html|13|ndxe201405| 10+ silent orange flying objects in strict formation for 5 minutes then disappearing<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observation of Unidentified Flying Objects in Franklin County, Kentucky<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday, May 31, 2014, at approximately 10:00 pm my wife and I observed 10 or more orange balls of light in a perfect straight line formation at an altitude of approximately 1000-1500 feet.  The balls of light seem to appear one after the other and were not all visible initially.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All but one of the orange lights stayed in formation the entire time we watched.  One of the lights rapidly accelerated next to another orange light and remained side by side with the other light until they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange lights were flying northwest, were evenly spaced approximately 200-300 yards apart and silent.  We watched the lights for approximately five minutes until they made a turn towards southwest and disappeared as they were moving away from our location.  The orange objects did not have any strobes, sound, red or white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have worked on numerous military bases, have been an investigator for the state government for more than 13 years, traveled internationally and have flown on private and commercial planes and helicopters.  I have never observed flying objects like we saw on May 31, 2014.  I am 100% certain they were not “Chinese lanterns”, helicopters or planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flying objects had to be controlled by intelligent life due to the exact positioning of the objects, formation and the rapid acceleration of one object next to the other that remained side by side until they disappeared.  I have observed planes and helicopters flying at night and these were definitely neither.  The sky was clear over Frankfort and little to no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before reporting this incident we consulted with two Air Force Officers and they are unaware of any aircraft that are silent or displays orange lights rather than the traditional lights used on aircraft during flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had serious reservations about reporting the incident because I have never believed in UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what these were but, by reporting this incident I hope to find some answers no matter what they may be.<n>

I happened to look up a little after 9:30 pm because there were fire or some sort of emergency sirens going off close by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lower on the horizon I saw what looked like 5-6 fireballs in the sky.  They were appearing and reappearing at random.  I told my husband to take a look and the two of is watched them for almost half an hour.  It was especially scary because of those fire sirens we were hearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned on the scanner and it ended up no being related. It just looked like balls of fire burning up, but they barely moved.  They would get brighter then die out. I&#39;m not sure of the same ones were getting bright, dying out then brightening again or if they were all separate objects.  Airplanes were flying in the same general direction and they looked nothing like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no streaking across the sky like meteors.  None of them shot up like fire works or anything.  They were very far away, but you could tell they were very high in the sky and  extremely bright.  My husband and I both got on Twitter to see of we were the only ones seeing it.  It was pretty visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We used our iPhones to determine it was toward the southeast from us.  They were just over and under the tree line from our view at our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was truly the most amazing unexplained thing I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the lights were completely gone by 10:00 pm.<n>

Most flew in pairs, with one light following another.  Each pair would fly over and out of sight, and then another pair would fly over shortly after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a total of 8 or 9 of these lights over the course of about 15-20 minutes.  The strange thing about them was that they were very bright and did not blink, but at times appeared to flicker slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There also seemed to be an area of more diffuse light immediately surrounding the bright light.  The light was equally bright viewed from all directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hard to say how close they were, but they seemed fairly close as they went by, and no sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Different from any other aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shot a short video clip of the last one that flew over.<n>

It couldn&#39;t be seen with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I videoed the 3 objects in the sky forming a triangle.  The lights were green, red, and white.

Well, almost ready.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As promised I was ready for the next nights event.  If the objects re-appeared I would accept them as planets.  And so it was with much anticipation that I took a chair amongst the cactus to examine the evening sky.  The time was 2025.  Oh the disappointment!  For there they soon appeared in nearly the same place and in the same triangular formation.  Oh well, I’m not the first to be duped by atmospherics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But wait?  These look just like two planets and one star?  These 3 are no where near as brite as on the previous night, and there is no red “navigation” light attached?  What gives here?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must also report that my Mac went to a black screen immediately following my report on your web site.  It took 3 days and 5 tech’s at Apple to solve the problem.  “I’ve never seen this before, What’s this?  This isn’t right…”  Those and other comments from Apple while trying to restore the computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Naw, must have just been planets and atmospherics.  Unless someone was hiding in plain site.  And I will admit that that is a stretch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Advise if you would still like the drawings &amp; photo&#39;s to follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

Since I was driving, I couldn&#39;t get a good depth perception.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew right away that they were the same things I had seen sitting on my deck a few summers ago only that time there were three and they were much lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would guess that they were larger than a basketball but not bigger than exercise ball.  Both times, they were moving faster than the wind current and seemed directed. I never did figure out what they were and still can&#39;t.<n>

I live right off A1A, 200 yards from the ocean in Daytona Beach Shores.  In a direction of SSE, we saw what I thought to be a rocket.  Not to miss the night launch, I called into my wife in the house to come out and see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most rockets disappear quickly here in the general direction they are launched, but even with taking her time of half a minute to come out it was still visible.  Only at this point instead of moving up in altitude, becoming more and more dim, it was moving across the horizon about 45 degrees high over the ocean until it disappeared at ENE.  It was an orange ball of flame like seen in launches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate it traveled from Cape Canerval to Jacksonville (160 miles) slightly off the coast in about 90-120 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t find and information of a launch at 9:38 on 5/30 and would like to note heard no noise at all like when a military jet flies over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m convinced it was a rocket flying over the coast but can&#39;t find any record of a launch so I&#39;m reporting it as a UFO.<n>

She did not know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First object was stationary then very slowly tracked behind aria hotel.  Couple from NJ saw a brighter stationary object in the sky.  Thus one was also stationary.  Got very bright then dimmed somewhat.  Went on for a few minutes.  It would have been brightest star in the sky flashing if it was not in the middle of the bright day.  It was up very high not moving.  Lasted a couple minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few high flying planes passed at same time.  They left con trail and we&#39;re moving.

5/30/14 00:30|Woodridge|IL|Triangle|~2  minutes|Amateur astronomer observes two unknown objects over Chicago suburb.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109830.html|44|ndxe201405| Amateur astronomer observes two unknown objects over Chicago suburb<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the first object, traveling northeast to southwest straight from my house front door.  It was 5 lights in the shape of a triangle, or from the angle I saw it the shape looked like a &#34;backwards&#34; checkmark.  The 5 lights changed from a very bright (soft) white color to all 5 turning red with no dimming in between.  It was either white or red.  The lights pulsed all at the same time between white and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew in a direction I haven&#39;t seen flown by aircraft in my area.  The object moved very slowly and made no sound.  After a minute or so it disappeared behind trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a minute of the object disappearing I saw the second object. I saw it exactly in the sky where I first saw the first object. The pulsing lights, colors, apparent height, and speed were to me exactly the same as the first object.  It stayed in my view the same amount of time as the first object, and disappeared over the same area in the trees as the first.  Later when I was! thinking about this I came up with the idea (possibly) this was actually one object and I saw lights on the front and backside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I don&#39;t remember seeing the stars in between the lights being blotted out.  I wasn&#39;t even looking for that at the time because I assumed it was two separate objects, especially since it would have been a massive size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FYI, I am an amateur astronomer for about 20 years and have fairly good observation skills. The things that strike me about this is the number of lights and their colors, how the lights blinked in unison with no dimming in between, the slow speed, no sound, a different flight path from normal over my area, the fact the second object (had they both been airplanes) would have been flying in the &#34;air wake&#34; of the first, which I think airplanes avoid.<n>

I live out in the country in South Spokane, and I went out past my yard and house to edge of woods to hear the owls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up at what I thought may be very bright plane or maybe satellite but the movement was like NOTHING I have ever seen before.  This light was almost falling slowly in the north eastern part of the sky.  Almost a 60-70• angle above horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would &#34;fall&#34; or orbit downward in a feather like trajectory, swaying from left to right slowly and then stopping perfectly still with no blinking lights or sound of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it would start up again never really following a pattern but seemingly heading downward toward the horizon.  Then it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a lifelong satellite watcher and can say it was a bit bigger or at least brighter but not much.  It had absolutely no flashing lights and when planes or helicopters are that close there is sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure what to think.  Does ISS behave this way?<n>

I stood in the middle of the street, hat off, looking up, turning around and around expecting to see this LARGE aircraft that my ears suggested should be just a few thousand feet up.  (I am a Commercial Pilot, have heard many large aircraft, but could NOT compare this &#34;engine-mechanical&#34; sound to this &#34;imagined&#34; 747/B-52 size massive aircraft I could NOT see.)

The flash lasted only a few seconds, it was a light blue color and was very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was bright enough to light up a huge portion of the sky, very interested to see if anyone else saw the same thing and possibly have details I was not able to see.<n>

This lasted for about 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next day I was up at 7:45AM feeling like I had alcohol poisoning..felt as if every part of my body was in agony down to the molecule.

But they were lighting up, in an orange color.  And as i looked at them, they weren&#39;t bashing their wings.  They were flying around like a plane.  They were flying in 8-circles for about 2 minutes before totally disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This may sound very wierd, but i am sure that i saw it because i wasn&#39;t the only one who saw it.

He called out to me and said “Dad, something is flying around outside and I don’t think it’s an airplane, it’s kind of freaking me out”.  My wife and I made it outside in time to watch about 30-45 seconds of two (think welding arc) intensely bright white lights flashing and flickering then turning solid and back again before disappearing behind the ridge line.  They were at slightly different altitudes and to far apart to be two lights of the same craft, but moving in unison.  They had no distinguishable shape, and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Altitude was 500–1000 feet.  Speed fluctuated from something faster than a typical light aircraft to perhaps slower than stall speed for a light fixed wing aircraft.  Direction was roughly west to east and a mile +/- from our location.  After losing sight of the objects we hopped in the car and drove to see if we could follow but ultimately found nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the third UFO sighting we have had in 9 years of living in this area and the first we have reported.<n>

The sky was clear with no cloud cover. There had been a meteor shower the previous night.  So while I was walking I was looking up to see if their were any comets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was looking up I saw a bright orange fiery light appear in my direct line of sight.  It looked high in altitude, maybe 500-1000 ft.  While I stared at it with disbelief a second one appeared behind it.  Then a third and a fourth.  All four seemed to travel in the same direction.  The first one moved on a bit faster than the rest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recorded the incident on my iphone.  I did some research on Chinese lanterns and how people mistake them for UFO.  With the videos I watched I can say with certainty that these were not lanterns.  They did not start as a faint light in the distant and get closer as a lantern would.  The sky was clear and dark and the lights just turned on at around 1000 ft.!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After researching UFOS reported I found this website.

I was with immediate family members at my parents house.  (My parents and my wife saw this activity)  They&#39;ve lived in the same Cul-de-Sac for just over twenty years, and have never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The easiest way to describe what we saw with these sightings, is that they were orange and continuous.  Orange Orbs is the definitive term.  It was so surreal, and it was kind of like a cannon shooting off lighted orange cannonballs silently in the dark of the night.  It was one after the other.  I&#39;ve been an avid researcher of UFO&#39;s and the paranormal for about five years and have heard of this activity, this was of the biggest surprises but I&#39;ve seen them before where I currently live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while, my dad proceeded to the front of the house, and watched them go on for about 30-40 minutes.  I actually have a 25 second video of the incident where I caught two on my iPhone.<n>

They were very low, making no noise, and moving vertically and horizontally in maneuvers not possible by conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were eventually joined by a third orb that came out of thin air and then all of them shot upward and disappeared quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This experience left me feeling uneasy for the rest of the evening..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

But, there were no green lights and these lights were WAY larger and MUCH brighter than air craft lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen lights this bright in the sky and I worked much of my career at LAX in the AOA (Arport Opertions Area, where the planes and runways are).  So, I know what air planes look like and how they act in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited expecting it to move like an airplane, but it held its position perfectly still, then slowly began to move to the Northeast.  Then, not as if traveling at a high rate of speed, but rather it just disappeared as if someone turned out the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was several times larger than air planes observed in the same location.<n>

It was really high and moving very fast and I assumed it was a satellite, as I had seen them before with my naked eye.  However, this time, as it passed over me, it slowed down and zig-zagged.  I have never seen that before and then it shot off to the north very fast. I have seen lights in the sky, was able to see the international space station and have been able to identify everything I have seen, but this, this was different.<n>

Said it was round and concaved in the middle.  My daughter was using her camera taking pictures of the planes and zoomed in on the object and took a picture.

At about 45 degrees east, north east I noticed an object in the sky.  I thought it might be a bald eagle circling for its prey.  However, the object was too high in the sky to be a bird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked further I noticed the object was hovering above something, as if it was observing something.  After noticing that the object was not moving, and having concluded it was not a bird, it suddenly zoomed off due east at fantastic speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen any aircraft that operated like that before.  It was either a government test vehicle (which I highly doubt) or a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one half an hour later I noticed two high flying jets going both east to west and west to east at a high rate of speed.

I initially assumed it was a pair of geese flying together at a high altitude.  I thought one flew off to the left but one remained, which didn’t make sense and gave me pause.  As I concentrated on the object, I realized it wasn’t a bird at all but something round, shiny, and stationary.  I took a picture of it with my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my yard, which is 40 miles NE of Sacramento, the direction was ESE at 45 degrees.  The altitude and actual distance were difficult ascertaining because I lacked a point of reference.  Judging from aircraft throughout the afternoon, I would assume it was higher than a helicopter and lower than a jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called and left a somewhat animated message for my fiancé about this, then ran into the house for my glasses and binoculars.  I was afraid to leave the site I was standing for fear it would be gone when I returned.  I have to stress here that when I first saw the object,  I was only wearing protective safety glasses, not prescription, yet could clearly see it was round, white, and shiny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the binoculars it was round like a ball, white, shiny, with bright light on the top, which could have been the sun’s reflection.  Sometimes the light became brighter, sometimes dissipated completely.  It was difficult to tell but it seemed as though there was something grey on the back of it that would occasionally be visible.  I wasn’t able to visualize any apparatus or ropes dangling from the bottom of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In an attempt to eliminate the possibility I was imagining this, I called friends who were one mile away.  They saw the object, with the same coordinates, also stating it was shiny and unusual.  They gathered additional people to evaluate this, ensuring that the entire town would eventually be as crazy as we were.  I watched a couple of YouTube videos on weather balloons and read two articles, but I still wasn’t able to tell if this was a balloon or something else. The weather balloons online drifted and, while the photographers had to continually adjust the camera to follow them,  I didn’t.  What if it was Venus?  Or worse yet the Moon and I was creating perplexities out of the rational?  The mind is capable of creating any reality it wants to so I have tried to remain as logical about this as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local airport.  I was told they had no reports of any sightings or weather balloons in the area and they expressed concern about flight paths.  I was asked if it could be an advertisement but it was much too high for that.  I was given two numbers for the FAA.  Since it was Memorial Day, the offices were closed so I left messages.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained stationary for over three hours, completely undeviating in location, my point of reference being between two trees.  The sun’s position was changing over my right shoulder and back, this was not.  By 1500 it began slowly drifting East, remaining at the same altitude.  It became increasingly difficult to find it in the sky until it eventually disappeared from view at 1630.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I received return calls from the FAA this morning.  One person said it was likely a weather balloon, while another encouraged me to contact NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was told someone else reported a similar sighting, only 24 hours prior and 1 ½ hours north of mine.  It is now 1200 on May 27.  There is presently nothing in the sky where this object was yesterday.  That, coupled with the fact that it traveled east, eliminates the planet theory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose a logical explanation would ensure our sensibilities.  The unexplained though, would make our current perceptions of reality a lot more interesting.<n>

I could not feel any breeze or see any stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a  red-orange light in the northwest, moving relatively slowly to its northeast.  It seemed to curve to a more northerly direction.  It looked about as low as a typical small airplane or helicopter, but there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not discern any features such as corners that would indicate shape, but it seemed to have perhaps 5 or 10% of the Moon&#39;s apparent diameter.  The intensity was steady.  It looked nearer and brighter than an overflying aircraft light, and the color was less intense red, with an orange hue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for maybe a minute or two and it grew dimmer as it moved away, then I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An hour and twenty minutes later there was a brief heavy rain shower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am age 64, military veteran, work in a technical job, wear bifocals.

5/25/14 23:30|Port Perry (Canada)|ON|Other|10 seconds|Two black "silhouette" craft viewed over Lake Scugog, Port Perry by 2 witnesses.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109709.html|102|ndxe201405| Two black &#34;silhouette&#34; craft viewed over Lake Scugog, Port Perry by 2 witnesses<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday May 25th, 2014 two unidentified flying objects were seen flying overhead of my friend and I in Port Perry, Ontario, Canada.  This was at or around 23:30 hours local time (daylight savings time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was clear skies (there had been some cloud cover approximately 30 minutes before) and the stars were plainly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of these craft could easily be described as “chevron” shaped however I chose to identify them as “other” on your form because there were nearly rectangular.  I’d best guess if you drew a line through the middle of the chevron it would be no more than 10 to 15 degrees swept back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were pure black in colour.  Likely a matte finish as I saw no shine or gleam on them.  The thing that made us notice them is they had 4 or 6 very, very faint red lights glowing on the bottom each craft.  They were extremely faint and almost unnoticeable.  There were no aviation lights of any kind (red, green or white) blinking or solid (other than the very faint red glow under each craft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two objects were observed by us while we were standing next to our car in the parking lot of the Joe Fowler Memorial Park.  Lake Scugog is approximately 40 feet from the parking lot to the east.  Use Google Maps to help visualize this if needed.  The Park is on Water Street in Port Perry just north of Hwy 7a (Scugog St).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two crafts.  I will identify them as Craft 1 (closest to us) and Craft 2 (further from us).  Both craft were heading a course of nearly due north (north north east) at an estimated altitude of 60 to 80 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both appeared to be identical in size and shape however I cannot swear to that.  Their dimensions would be approximately from “wing tip to wing tip” 30 feet.  The width of the “wing” would be approximately 3 to 4 feet.  The height I don’t know.  I didn’t notice anything note worthy about them and they blended in so well with the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All you could see was a silhouette and extremely faint red glowing lights under the wings.  Their speed I would estimate at 30 miles per hour.  There was NO noise at all and there was no wind at all this evening either.  So they were in fact dead silent.  Not even wind noise that one would expect something that large moving through the air at that speed would make.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not air propelled craft (jet, electric or prop)! as at this close a distant no matter how well engineered there would be some noise made by air disturbance causing a craft of that size to go that speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were standing beside the car facing Lake Scugog looking up at the night sky.  Craft 1 was spotted first and then approximately 3 to 4 seconds later we noticed Craft 2 slightly behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point Craft 2 appeared to be following directly behind Craft 1 (about 200 yards) but took a slight course change to the east (Craft 2 did) by approximately 50 yards.  It did so at about a 45 degree angle.  It travelled for 100 yards or so after the course correction it took then sped up and caught up to Craft 1 and trailed directly behind it (approximately 10 yards behind Craft 1).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again it closed the gap with no noise or sound and I’m guessing its speed would have been a short burst about 100 miles per hour.  It did this in 1 second or less (so it seemed as I obviously wasn’t timing it).  However it would be accurate to say it did it “immediately”.  Again there was no sound.  Not even a faint “swoosh” of disturbed air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crafts continued heading north at approximately 30 miles per hour until they were out of sight.  From first sight until we lost sight I would guess this event was 10 seconds or less.  It’s so hard to say for sure but it wasn’t +/- 3 seconds of the estimated duration for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish we had photographic or video evidence but we don’t.  And even if we had a camera and the presence of mind to use it there would be just no way they would have been visible in the picture.  The human eye was strained to notice the very slight difference in contrast between the sky and the crafts.  Again if it wasn’t for the odd faint red glow we never would have seen them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m lousy at drawing pictures but if you’d like a rendition of what I saw I would be more than happy to draw it, scan it, and email it to you.  It’s not physical evidence but circumstantial may be better than nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I forget I would hazard a guess that these crafts were unmanned just due to the small size of it.  I couldn&#39;t notice how thick the wings were but I do know for sure if they were thick enough to hold something human sized I would have certainly seen that on the silhouette.  So because I didn’t notice it I’d guess 1 foot give or take a couple inches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have checked &#34;I would like to be contacted by an investigator&#34; however without any physical evidence I feel it may be pointless unless there were others reporting similar activity in the area recently.  Email is the best way to contact me.<n>

I stopped to find it out my patio window, thinking it was a police helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked outside into my back yard, the object stopped in midair, hovering for about 10 seconds, and moved in a different direction.  My daughter had just gone upstairs to bed and I quickly called for her to come down to see it with me.  My wife also heard me and also came downstairs, and all three of us watched it for almost 10 minutes go in different directions, and then descend below the tree line and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly it would shoot up into the sky again and would travel across the low horizon for what must be several miles and then stop and return back very fast and begin to hover again.  This repeated for several minutes.  My daughter captured it on her cell phone but it looks like only white lights on her camera.  After about 15 minutes, we stopped seeing it.  I am not certain at this point how valuable the image taken from the cell phone is until I am able to study it this morning.<n>

I regularly watch aircraft from the back yard and track the ISS at its higher flight paths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first seen the object, just a small light as bright as an average star,  It was 70-80 degrees above the western horizon and 30 degrees south of due west, tracking SSE to NNW.  I thought it might be the ISS because it was much to high (small) and fast to be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved across the sky it seemed to disappear for a few seconds and then reappear as though there were clouds,  There were no clouds! This happened three times from when I first saw it and when it reached a point about 40 degrees north of due west. It was then that the brightness increased exponentially,  Bright white increasing the apparent size by at least ten times, this lasted about one second and it was out of my sight.  The object never varied from it&#39;s track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went to check ISS tracking information and found it couldn&#39;t have been that. I then checked satellite flight tracking. and found this info for today, [ Idefix and Ariane 42B  10:28:00 pm	SSW	 10:32:02   29°3.8 (dim)]  This is 30 min. too early and way too low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After thinking about it I believe what I saw was not the craft itself but rather the hot, burning exhaust gases.  This would explain both the &#34;disappearing&#34; as the thrust was released and the increased brightness as extra thrust was applied.  I don&#39;t know what it was but I would sure like to know.<n>

One was white, and one was Orange and they appeared to be moving away from one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the White one got closer to my location I could see that it was a plane, due to the red and white blinking lights on the bottom.  The orange one had vanished from sight at that point.  I turned back to look at my fishing pole and I noticed that the orange one was now flying a crossed my field of view. as it flew past there was no sound, no blinking lights.  It was a very bright orange, and it bobbed up and down slightly at times as it flew passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No markings or lights that would be seen on a commercial aircraft were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was also moving at an odd speed for an aircraft.

There was a large mass traveling north to south (according to the compass on my phone).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights moved across the sky, one of them would drop every few seconds.  The large mass moved towards another group of lights that seemed stationary.  The lights the mass moved towards were grouped in kind of a line, but all through this time a few of the lights left the formation and dropped down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After all the lights grouped together, they moved together east to west (again, a guess according to my phone), all along dropping a few along the way.  We watched until they went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all agree it was strange that the lights stayed still and came together, then changed direction and moved off together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to film it with my phone, but the video just looks black.

Warren, MI.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three very bright lights go by overhead, one at a time.  My 2 dogs were barking to go outside, so I slid open the patio door and let them out, and saw a single bright light through the tree&#39;s to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was fireworks because some people were celebrating Memorial Day, but as it continued in a straight line from south to north and got past the tree, it did not act like a firework.  It moved smoothly in a straight line, much like the space station does, and appeared to be very high up, but that is just a guess because I have no reference point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see no structure, just a very bright light. Brighter than Venus.  More like a magnesium flare type of brightness.  So bright the I saw prominent spikes of light from the central bright dot of light.  It was a pale orange, yellow in color, and flickered like a candle flame, from so bright that it looked like spikes coming out of it, to so dim it looked like a fading ember of coal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it fade out to the north, I notice 2 more coming along the exact same path from the south.  They were spaced about 8 full moons apart, and repeated across the sky in the same manner as the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I was scared, but when they did not seem to alter their path in any way, did not stop, just kept going on their way, I was excited, but did not want to leave the scene to get my camera, because by the time I found it and came back out, it would be gone.<n>

I noticed a red circular light coming from the southwest going in a straight path going to the northwest and then it just disappeared over the high school.  It was a silent, singular light.  We had a carnival across the street and the Bethpage Air Show at Jones Beach that weekend.  I don&#39;t know if that attracted this thing.  Lucky for me, my son was in the kitchen and I called him to look so I had a witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night at about the same time I saw a silent circular white light along the same path but then another circular light came from the north going south and they passed each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t watch both of them so I continued looking at the one going north.  Again it disappeared over the high school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have another witness for this night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next evening the carnival was gone and there were no additional silent lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Approximately 35-40 miles.  We were at approx. 8300, facing north.  Off a 4wd road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at approx 8pm and started making camp before dark.  My son pointed out a very bright light to the north of us at ground level.  I told him that it may be a vehicle with bright lights on a dirt road in distance.  Our view that night was very clear all the way to the Wind River Mountains approx. 40-50 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After setting up tents and making a fire we sat facing the north and almost immediately, a second light appeared and started to move erratically above the ground.  A third, and fourth light appeared and would pulsate and then disappear and then reappear.  Once all four lights appeared in a perfectly spaced line at approx our same altitude.  Maybe a mile or two across.  Perfectly spaced.  At times two would come together and  seem to dip below the hills and move very rapidly up and dance in the sky.  I have no idea as to size so distance was hard to judge but I would guess 5-10 miles out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them for 3-4 hours.  No sound.  At times would move farther out but would come back. Lights on and then off.  We did not have binoculars and tried taking a video with IPhone.  It did not come out all that well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in my late 50&#39;s and have spent allot of time in remote areas and have never seen anything like this.  At first we were somewhat spooked but they seemed to never come closer than what I estimated above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them until approx midnight and went to bed.  We had no cell service, or I would have notified the sheriffs dept. that they were missing quite a show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We camped out at a lower altitude the next night facing same direction hoping that we may see them again.  Nothing the second night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An expierience that I wil remember for awhile.<n>

The object just appeared and didn’t seem to originate from any direction.  It was a white yellowish in color and was brighter in appearance of other aircraft in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a piece of trash or a balloon in the sky as it slowly drifted east towards my direction.  I went inside and got my Sony A330 DLSR with Sony 75-300mm lens and was able to get one good pictures due to forgetting my memory card in my computer.  Getting my camera out was just to see if I could zoom in and see what it really was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time I told my wife there was something in the sky but thought it was a plastic bag but made the offer to come out and take a look.  The drift was almost like a sudden wobble and pause motion as it moved east.  In Northern Las Vegas it’s pretty common to see a plastic bag or balloon caught in the wind.   What made this different was how bright it was at the same time I could see the direction of the wind due to the dust in the air with my sun glasses and it was traveling against the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the bright object slowly made its way over Nellis AFB.  It accelerated at amazing high rate of speed to the south and the object vanished.  Faster than any known aircraft I know of and rivals shooting stars and satellites.  There was an aircraft taking off from McCarran International Airport which was near in location of the object but the two were probably greatly separated by altitude and distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in the United States Air Force and living on Nellis AFB and I can watch aircraft from Nellis AFB coming and going, as well as the air traffic lanes for takeoff and landing from North Las Vegas Airport and McCarran International Airport are great reference.  All there is a commercial air traffic route over Las Vegas as well so I get to see a lot of different aircraft at different altitudes and speeds.<n>
5/25/14 12:00|New York City|NY|Oval|4-5 minutes|Small grey/silver metallic object, mostly circular in shape seen hovering and moving slowly at high altitude over the Hudson River.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109776.html|134|ndxe201405| small grey/silver metallic object, mostly circular in shape seen hovering and moving slowly at high altitude over the Hudson River<n> <n><n> <n><n> While spending Memorial day weekend in the Long Island/NYC area, I visited the USS Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum.  The day was Sunday, May 25th, 2014.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After touring the top deck and interior I made my way down the stairs to the adjacent dock area.  There were already multiple news and tour helicopters making their way up the Hudson River, while a US Coast Guard MH-65 was performing a Search and Rescue Demo (for NY Fleet Week) over the waterfront so naturally I had my eyes towards the sky, at just after noon (anywhere between 12:00 and 12:30) I noticed a small object at high altitude over the Hudson.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I suspected it to be merely a balloon, however after examining the object for a few seconds I noticed it appeared to be considerably larger than a normal balloon and it was hovering in place as if not affected by the present winds which a balloon would be.  Its coloration was also interesting, it appeared to mostly be a metallic grey or silver on the! surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to my father who quickly dismissed it as probably being a balloon (although he said he couldn&#39;t see it very well).  I began snapping photos of the object with my IPhone 5. I estimated the objects altitude to be around 4,000-5,000 feet because it was a lot higher than the helicopters flying up the Hudson but much lower than the occasional passing commercial airliner out of JFK airport, I had no way of guessing the objects size due to its distance and lack of anything close enough to it to compare it with, though it did appear to be larger than a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes the object began a slow flight path moving diagonally but remaining at the same altitude, I began backing up to keep the object in view while taking pictures but it soon passed over the deck of the Intrepid and out of sight.  Although I didn&#39;t run into any other witnesses I think it is unlikely that I was the only one who saw it due to the sheer number of people in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon uploading and reviewing the photos on my computer the following day, I noticed several things that I didn&#39;t notice while viewing the object,  The first few pictures showed exactly what I saw, a small rounded shiny metallic object hovering.  However, as I looked through the pictures I noticed the object had a darker, shaded edge in some pictures giving it more of a definitive shape (this may have been due to the sun reflecting from the other side of the object) while in other photos the object appeared to be very bright and shiny.  One of the photos the object is completely dark except for a small ring of light in the center that appears to be generated by the object, the rest of the object appears much more like a structured craft here with less of a circular shape and two corners on one side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The final photos show the object again to be metallic and silver with the upper half being brighter (almost a whitish blue) and the lower half being a darker grey, there are also several dark patches on the edges of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been intrigued by the UFO phenomenon but have mostly remained a skeptic however I am questioning it now.  All I can say is that while knowing a lot about aviation and can easily identify most airplanes or helicopters, this object I witnessed and photographed did not move like or resemble any normal aircraft that I have seen in my life.<n>
5/25/14 12:00|San Francisco|CA|Sphere|15 minutes|Small sphere observed over San Francisco Bay.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109727.html|135|ndxe201405| Small sphere observed over San Francisco Bay<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were on a ferry heading from Larkspur, CA, to San Francisco, CA, on the way to the SF Giants game.  We were nearing the Bay Bridge, in the water between Treasure Island and the Ferry Building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a commercial aircraft flying high overhead, heading south.  Near that plane I saw what at first appeared to be a smaller plane in the distance, but near the same trajectory of the commercial airline.  I thought it seemed a little close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The smaller object appeared to be white in color with a non-descript shape.  The commercial plane continued on it&#39;s path, and the small object was observed to be higher up and not moving in a direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed the object out to my wife and she also observed it.  At that point, I began to question what it was I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then seemed to be moving very slowly, across the bay (west to east), all the while the ferry was moving south under the bridge and so the precise motion of the object was difficult to dete! rmine.  However, as we continued to watch the object, it seemed to be extremely high up and more overhead (I had to crane my neck in order to continue observing it). The object appeared to be shinny, round; a sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was small in size, being so high up.  It was not moving position that I could tell, not on a trajectory across the sky. It seemed to be staying directly over the bay.  I continued to observe the object for about 15-20 minutes.  I tried to take photos of it but it was too far away for our 200MM lens to capture it.  The sky was completely clear, bright blue, no clouds, sunshine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object eventually just seemed to disappear, and I could not find it in the sky.<n>

Just north of my location and about a half mile away was a hill.  To the south of me and another half mile away was another hill opening up a geological saddle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 degrees up from ground level, without being able to determine altitude, distance or speed, I noticed what appeared to be 3 points of light in a triangular formation, emerging from behind the northern hill.  The lights were yellow to orange in color moving (again depending on distance and altitude) quickly in a southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another two lights emerged immediately following the first three, then another three in the same general formation as the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were all moving in a southerly direction.  The second group of three broke from the overall formation and headed either east or down.

I also ran into the house and grabbed my 40D Canon camera.  I carry it with me pretty much everywhere.  I shot this image with a Canon 100-400mm lens on May. 25TH 2014 @ 12:30AM from Edmonds, WA.  We had gone outside because they had said on the news that there was possibly a meteor shower that night and we might be able to see a few of them.  When we stepped outside this is what we saw immediately.  This was no meteor...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It approached from the west at a very high rate of speed, came to a dead stop with no hesitation or slowing down.  It then zipped miles to the left, stopped and zipped miles the right, came back to center-point to a dead stop again.  Then it started flipping and shooting all over the sky and this is the image I caught.  I had no idea it would of been this detailed until I had opened it up on my computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Who knows if it was aliens or a black government project but it certainly was nothing we have ever seen before.  It was certainly an anti-gravity craft because nothing in the U.S. arsenal could pull this off in the sky.  Especially a human-being with all the G-force on the body.  It has a bright blue-white aura or haze around it, left a trail which is evident in the image.  We were in shock to say the least.  After it was moving all over the sky for a about 3-4 minutes, it came to a stop.  We watched it for about 15 minutes sit stationary until the clouds started covering it up then went inside and viewed the images.  We are wondering if anyone else in the area saw what we saw.<n>

Wife was frightened<n> <n><n> .<n> <n><n> <n><n> While swimming in the pool (with my husband) I saw a glowing yellow/orange light, very bright, it almost hurt my eyes.  It did not make a sound.  I pointed it out to my husband and it just kept coming towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving very slowly from west to east.  It was almost like it was floating.  It moved up and down in a way a plane cannot move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It turned north and moved toward the mountains behind our house.  It went into a cloud and you could see it turn off its light as soon as it moved into the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few more minutes there was a second one.  This one was more reddish than orange it moved the same way and made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard some neighbor say hey there is a UFO, maybe a few houses down.  I was so scared I got out of the pool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband watched it very closely and this second one turned off its light before getting to the cloud and he could see it was big and egg shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be quite eloquent and serious-minded.

Stayed in the same location in the sky for about 1 minute.  In that time it became brighter and seemed to rise from its location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light concentrated to the center of the object and the light began to pulse.

Five of us were sitting around a campfire about 11:00pm when a very fast moving orange ball came out of the east toward us then curved and went to the north.  When it disappeared we noticed there was absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 10 minutes later, another orange ball on the exact same flight path came at us and again turned to the north.  The orange ball looked the same whether it was coming at us or going away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about another 10 minutes and a 3rd ball came at us.  This was from a slightly more southern direction, but it followed the 1st two lights toward the north.  I don’t know if this was the same light making a large circle or if it was actually 3 different orange lights.<n>

I was driving east and the lights appeared to be moving very slowly in a southern direction.  This was how I realized that they were not fires.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on how their position relative to me changed as I was moving, I would estimate their position to be approximately 1 mile away and ½ to 1 mile in elevation.  They appeared to be moving over the interstate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the lights for about 5 minutes, until I passed beneath the interstate.  Upon reaching the other side of the interstate, I looked back and the objects were gone.<n>

The sun was just begining to set. My Neighbor&#39;s daughter was playing two doors down and something in my head had told me to look up towards the horizon.  I&#39;m in a partially vegitated area with large trees, so if I were to just lok in that direction, trying to look for a specific object, chances are that I would not have been able to spot what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was smoking a cigarette at that time, and as I said, &#34;Something in my brain had told me to focus in that specific direction as if I was being told so.&#34;  As I looked up, my neighbor&#39;s child said, at the same time I saw it and said, &#34;Mommy! Mommy! Mommy, come here quick!  Look at pretty green light in the sky!  What is it?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She came out and immediately started to panic and thats when I said, &#34;Am I really Seeing this? Am I crazy or are you seeing this too!&#34;  There was a very bright, pulsating chartruess spherical object, moving at a high speed, and very low altitude.  It was a very bright neon like color sphere and it made not one sound.  I cannot tell you how big it was but, it was literally pulsating with light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was an airplane since I live just down the road about 10 miles from a small airport.  The name of the airportis, Hillsboro Aviation.  (So if you need to call them to see if they picked up anything on radar, you have te name.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it went over us, there was absolutely zero sound.  I even tuned into background noise to make sure there was a jet exhaust sound.  Absolutely zero noise!  And the strange thing was, being so close to an airport, theres constant air traffic.  When this approached, there was not one aircraft in the sky.  So we would have heard it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran out to the to a clearing and watched it continue from it going northbound.  I contined observe to se if I could make out any form of object.  It immediately came to a hault in mid air.  By that time, it was very close to the airport and then it began to flash and get brighter. It sat there for a good two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time, I decided to make a run for my phone to snap a shot.  As I came back out and was fumbling with my camera,  I looked up, and it made slight turn and began to move, then it took off at a blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time I&#39;ve seen these spheres.  I&#39;ve seen blue ones in the Tillamook National Forest coming home from Salmon fishing.  And they were in the forest, then bolted out into a meadow.  They moved so fast that the trees swayed as they exited the forest and were spinning around the sky, then disapeared into orbit.<n>

There were 5-7 objects, bright, round, with a definite orange/red glow to them.  They were obviously very far away from us and I could&#39;t guess at their altitude quite honestly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to say the best way to think of these would be to imagine seeing the constellation Orion in the sky, but the stars were bright and orange.  Of course it wasn&#39;t this exact shape but there were something like two lights, left to right, then below another two, and then on the bottom of the formation at least two more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were headed west, southwest and we were basically at Timberlake (the lake, not the city) Virginia.  I looked at a map and I&#39;d guess the lights would be somewhere close to Smith Mt. Lake or between that and us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there in the car watching them and I was really flustered and didn&#39;t know what to look for.  Had this been a regular occurrence I would have paid more attention to the details.  I can say that there was some movement among the individual objects, but very slight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them for at least five minutes.  They kind of just faded away one by one and there was a large cloud formation they seemed to get lost behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I drove in the general direction as best as the roads would allow but we never did see them again.  Definitely a very intense few minutes and I only wish I could see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh, the color would be exactly what you would expect from a hot air balloon come to think of it, that fiery red/orange flame color.<n>

The distance from us and the object placed the object around the county airport.  There were one to two light airplanes in the vicinity.  The object increased its altitude and its speed to avoid an oncoming airplane.  The flight path was a stretched out arc stretching several miles.  It increased speed dramatically and the light started to flash as it moved over the town and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went inside to talk about what we saw then went back outside at approximately 9:36 PM.  Then we saw either the same object or another craft of the same type and it followed the same flight path and took the same actions as the previous object had done.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were of unknown shape but they had a single bright orange light on them.  The same kind as a street light and as the light we have on the side of our house.  There was also a slight glow or haze around the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Attempts were made to capture the phenomenon on video but were unsuccessful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We except for my 5 year old sister are all believers in aliens.  My dad was a storm spotter, and both me and my brother are listeners of coast to coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if this helps but we live close to a nuclear facility, and about 100 miles from Fort Campbell.<n>

I saw what appeared to be a round ball of fire hovering in the sky above the Louis Joliet Mall here in Joliet, IL.  It was red or red-orange in color with some yellow streaks in it.  It literally looked like someone picked up a flame and somehow enclosed it in a globe.  It looked like it was at about the height that a helicopter would fly at but did not appear to be moving.  The mall parking lot has large lights on tall poles and this was much larger than the lights and seemed to be almost perfectly round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled off into my subdivision which has a lot of trees and drove slowly down the street and could see it on and off between the trees and I stopped once to look at it. It didn&#39;t move and I rolled down the windows to listen for sounds of a airplane or helicopter.  I heard nothing.  I drove further up the street and lost it momentarily because of a large group of trees and then stopped at a large clearing and had an open view of the sky to the north.  Nothing was in sight.  I drove a block back to the south to a school parking lot so I could see in all directions and nothing was in sight.  The thing had completely disappeared in a matter of about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything like this and never heard of any UFO sightings that fit this description but I&#39;m convinced that this was not any kind of an airplane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a retired educator and I think I&#39;m pretty observant.  This is the second time I&#39;ve seen a possible UFO but the first time was nothing as spectacular as this and it was in Minnesota.

We suspect he is a very good witness.  We still do not know what the object was, despite the multiple witness reports from people who observed it.  It does not make sense to us that a high-altitude balloon would stay in one part of the sky for many hours.  The winds aloft are usually constant, and would have caused a balloon to drift with the wind.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday May 24, 2014, between 1600 and 1800 hrs. I saw a UFO.  I was in the driveway in front of my house in Plumas County, California.  I noticed a hang-glider overhead with a large whitish wing.  It was refracting the sunlight and almost glowed.  I got my little 10 x 21 binoculars for a closer look.  Perhaps it was a new type of fabric, polyethylene?  It looked cool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed a small white dot in the sky off to the North, at a bearing of about 10 degrees and an elevation of about 40 degrees.  Was it another hang-glider way off in the distance?  No, this thing was above the commercial jets that frequently fly over here.  So it must be a Balloon!  It looked spherical in the binoculars, maybe a little doughnut shaped.  It must be at least 50,000 ft. altitude and slowly moving West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my brother who lives ¼ mile N of me so he could confirm the sighting.  He got his binoculars and saw the same thing.  He suggested I get out my old 4.5 inch reflector telescope with a 28mm eyepiece.  It needs the mirror recoated, so it doesn’t get out much, but despite the dust it worked pretty well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh My God!  I wish I had a picture of what I saw.  It was a balloon alright, a very large, maybe 500 ft. diameter balloon with lots of pleats and a payload.  Was it Google?  I called Chico Municipal Airport (50 miles SW of here) to see if Google was in town.  He did not know of any balloons in the area, but did go out to take a look, without success.  Google had used Chico for test flights of balloons for the Loon project.  Loon balloons are about 50 ft. diameter. T his was no Loon this was a Condor!  The balloon was pumpkin shaped with lots of gores and load tapes, perhaps 80 or 100?  It looks like a super [pressure type, probably flying at around 100,000 ft.  Brilliant white where it got direct sun, and some greyish areas, shadows.  The payload was dark (photovoltaic panels), suspended by lots of load tapes, and quite small compared to the massive envelope.  The underside of the balloon looked different, greyer and wavy, perhaps the gathered fabric of the payload recovery parachute.  The gores were quite curved on the top, billowed out, maybe semi-circular.  It also appeared to be rotating counter clockwise, but I am not sure about that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 1800 hours, it went behind the large pine/fir trees to the NW at a bearing of 279 deg. and an elevation of 38 deg.  I cannot take pictures through the telescope properly, but I do have a photo of the small white dot and an attempt to use macro focus through the eyepiece.  There may be an opportunity to scale the object using digital technology.  I am 60 and not too computer savvy but I will try to email the photos to you.  I have looked at hundreds of balloon photos on line but I have not seen anything quite like what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called your UFO Hotline on the 24th and left a message.  Then I called Google and talked to a man riding his bike in Florida he claimed the big balloon was theirs and as far as he knew I was the only one who has seen it, interesting.  He then said let’s call the UFO Reporting Center and we did.  He left a message, that I am on also, stating that we need an investigator to come out to interview me.  Wow I didn’t expect that, so they want people to know about this thing?  We talked for over an hour, like the game 20 questions.  Some of what he said I do not necessarily believe; like the “Mother Ship” may be 2 miles in diameter, that it uses solar powered thrusters, that it comes down to pick up water to ionize, that it works with HARP, that they are looking for coltan (among other things) which occurs in my area, do I want to sell my property?  I had given him my address.  Really?  So we know it was a balloon, but is it really Googles?  How big is it?  What are its capabilities?  I look forward to figuring this out and very much appreciate having your organization to work with.<n>

The closer it came to me overhead, the neighbor&#39;s dog began to bark.  This oval went from west to east to south to north and then disappeared from sight going to the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a faint halo, like a force field around this object and as it got closer to the sun, a metallic like shine could also be seen.  Its speed was tremendous and its ability to turn and twist in different directions was astonishing.  It was completely silent and about the size of a jet airliner and probably about in same altitude as a jet airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I were categorize the object I just observed, I&#39;d say that it is exactly identical to the objects filmed in the 1950 Great Falls, Montana, film, but more oval in shape.<n>

It seemed to be highly reflective and was easily visible though seemed to be quite high.  It was very small and since it seemed to be holding its position it was not generating much attention despite the large number of people on the beach.

After taking it for a ride I parked in my driveway and was sitting in my car thinking that I’d have to replace the radiator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed 4 people walking in front of my car on their way home.  I heard the neighbors across the street and I guess they were having a little get-together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they walked down the street about 75 yards I was sitting in my car with the door open when suddenly I saw a very low flying craft just above the tree line descending into the adjacent neighborhood.  I thought that was odd because there is no airport or landing strip there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not look like a typical airplane or helicopter, and made no noise at all. It had two bright red lights in the front and one white light at the back.  The red lights were alternately pulsating or blinking.  It was sort of a triangle shape although I couldn’t see any definite form to it, but that was the impression I had, some sort of triangle although I can’t be certain of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a story from the guy that replaced our garage door opener that an older couple he did some work for said they saw a UFO come out of the retention pond in back of their house and silently fly over the trees and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The retention pond is about 1-2 miles from my house.<n>

It was a clear sky and we could see all the northern constilations.   At around 1:10 am as we were both looking south I could see four orange coloured, what I thought were fire balls that came from the south and passed overhead and headed to the north and dissapeared just above the horizon.  I would describe the orange lights as being in a chevron shaped formation but without the light at the front of it.  The lights appeared to travel in a formation as if they were  connected  together.  The lights were only visible for about ten seconds and traveled in a straight line as if it was following an orbit.  The lights did not leave a trail like a fire ball or meteorite does .<n> <n><n> <n><n> About ten minutes later a satellite  passed over following the same line.

The UFO was moving NNW to SE at a steady pace.  I would not necessarily have thought UFO, but several things struck me as odd:  Firstly the size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO appeared to be HUGE.  I have no standard of comparison for something in the sky, however, this was much bigger than any plane or helicopter that I&#39;ve seen in my experience.  The only other conclusion I could come to is that it was flying low, but even still that wouldn&#39;t explain the sound, the hushed blowing sound that accompanied it.  There was barely any sound to it, like when you run a clothes dryer with a load of towels.  (Sorry, just using things I can compare it to here!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up videos of B2s at night and flight shows just in case I may have seen one of those for some reason and the lighting doesn&#39;t resemble what the videos show, although the shape is similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for lights, there were 4, 2 on each wing tip, 1 white, 1 red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I had a camera set up facing north for the meteor shower, and had my phone on my person at the time - once I saw the object I stood transfixed.

I rounded a street corner in my neighborhood and a light up in the sky caught my eye.  I stepped out into the street for a better view and observed a lighted object streaking across the sky from right to left.  I was facing Southeast.  It was not cloudy out, but there was a haze in the sky where the object appeared.  There was no rain falling, and stars could be seen.  The object moved fast, and had a straight trajectory with no arc as it maintained a parallel path with the ground.  There was only one object.  Due to it being lit, I could not make out the exact shape; however, the lights were confined to a rectangle-like formation.  The light was white. I could not discern the distance above ground, however it was lower than a typical airplane or jet and there was no sound.  The speed was extremely fast.  I would compare it to the speed of a jet seen at low altitude, only perhaps faster.  It was visible for approximately five seconds and then disappeared.  I looked around me for other witnesses, but there were none.<n>

I was sitting in the rear driver&#39;s side of our vehicle but looked out the drivers side window and did see a huge, very brightly lit object.  It was not a linear shape as I expected to see, but an oblique yet rounded object of massive size with blinding lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband could not look at the object very long as he was driving, and the lights were so bright, dangerously so.  My daughter clearly saw the object and was becoming somewhat excited by it&#39;s unique, unexplainable nature.  I only had a few seconds of vision before it (or we) moved beyond my line of vision.  My daughter in the front passenger seat continued to track the object for several minutes through the front windshield until we moved beyond it and her line of vision was also lost.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon coming to the I-5 interstate (approx. 20 minutes later) we took the south bound exit and continued traveling towards Los Angeles.  After a few minutes my daughter once again asked if we saw an object in the sky.  Initially my vision was again obstructed.  I could not see out of her passenger side window so instead I started looking out my rear side window.  Off in the distance I could see bright flashes of light and a thick cloud mass.  The flashes of light were not streaks of lightening but the kind that is more horizontal and widespread.  There was a noticeable tingle in the air and the heavy cloud mass looked like it was rolling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my daughter if she could see the light flashes and clouds and she said yes, then suddenly I looked towards the front the the windshield and could clearly see a triangular object flying low towards the passenger side of the vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving very fast and changing directions and stopping in short spurts.  There were bright red and white lights pulsating from the craft.  It was not only triangular in shape but the craft moved in ways I had no explanation for.  From side to side with no arching and up and down with no regard to speed or conventional pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter was able to track it once again from the passenger side of the vehicle and she also started to film the object while describing it to me.  It now looked as though there were multiple objects flying through the sky, some very high and very fast.  This went on for some time and I could now smell and see cattle stockades out of my rear passenger window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The triangular object then flew back across the highway very low and ended up on the drivers side of our vehicle where it stopped near an overpass.  We all exclaimed that whatever it was it could cause a wreck flying so low and over the highway with the bright lights on.  The lights of this craft were not as bright as the ones on the craft we saw on State Highway 152, but they were certainly bright enough to be a potential hazard and a distraction for drivers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter decided to report the object to the California Highway Patrol which she called on her cell phone.  The time was exactly 10:15 pm and we were at the Coalinga exit.  She explained what she had seen and was transferred to the correct person by dispatch.  She told them what she had seen and of her concerns about the danger to traffic as well as the unsettling, unexplained nature of the craft.  Before she could finish she was abruptly told that there was a airstrip nearby and the receiver hung up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This experience has stayed with us and has become a very real, yet unexplainable, part of our lives.  We have never felt compelled to document an experience like this before.  We have never before called the Highway Patrol or Police from a moving vehicle to report something unexplained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter&#39;s video is very dark and it is difficult to clearly see anything but flashes of light.  Perhaps someone with better technology can clean up the picture and make out discernible shapes and offer some insight into what we saw and experienced on May 22nd, 2014.<n>

The object originated in the west sky, while watching the object continue east, it slightly turned and started heading southeast until it faded out of site. i would estimate the time frame to be around 25-30 seconds.  The object made absolutely no noise what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point I dropped the binoculars down to see if i could actually see the object with my naked eye, it seemed possibly 100-150 feet above me.  I would estimate the size of the object to be the size of a lear jet or helicopter.  The size of the object was kind of hard to exactly determine because of the speed of which it was traveling.<n>

There was no sound as we braced ourselves for the sound of impact.  The lights were very crisp and bright, and we got a perfectly clear view of their movement toward the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so frightened upon seeing this that I honestly feared for my life at the time and could barely bring myself to stay outside to witness whatever may have come after these objects landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We often see stationary blinking lights scattered over top of the mountains that surround the area, and after seeing this object we noticed at least 10 of these stationary star-like lights move around the sky toward the strange orbs we just watched, as well as several air planes all headed the same direction.  (I realize they may have been headed to an airport and not the orbs we saw but the orbs were most definitely not landing at an airport, as no such air port exists where the orbs headed)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am by no means crazy, nor is my nephew, and seeing these lights changed my life forever as I TOO now have witnessed something truly paranormal and not of this world and I can undeniably say that this was no hoax, and in no way could it have been explained by swamp gas, weather balloons, flares, or airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ARE near Camp David where there may be government testing but I can&#39;t fathom what kind of man made craft could have produced this kind of sighting.<n>

When I woke it was dark out already and I decided to go outside to get some fresh air.  It was around 21:35 when I woke and saw my alarm clock before walking out.  As I was headed outside I heard our neighbor call out to my mom in spanish, &#34;hey, do you see that over there in the sky? what is that?&#34;  As I heard this I paced to get to my mother in our front lawn who was looking to the distance in the southeast direction from our home.  And I saw it. It was a bright blue-violet light, flamelike- like a flare. I watched carefully to try to figure out if it were a place or manmade craft by its signal lights but there were none.  It was just one big blue-violet light. It would slowly change color from blue to violet and back.  And it was falling towards the horizon and slowly out of sight before the houses in the distance.  But as it fell it would suddenly stop and start climbing again, and fall again, with each attept it would rise less until it fell out of sight. All of us were stunned, I knew it wasnt a plane.  What got to me was how it felt, from my perspective like an organic life form stuggling to stay afloat.  Like as if it were slowly passing out or giving up.  For when it rose it did so with almost a pull of spirit until it gave up again.  I have been searching online to see if anyone else could have seen it but I guess it was only us.<n>

We both saw the first one coming out of the SSW, viewed for about 2 mins as it headed NNE.  Thought it was a helicopter at first and then it was overhead and there was no noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a yellow/orange incandescent, flickering glow.  Object was square/rectangular and the glow was circular and emanated from the center.  It went horizon to horizon in about two minutes.  Estimate speed at 80 mph, altitude 5,000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we lost sight of the first one, my wife shortly after said, “Here comes another.”  Same thing, perhaps a little lower in altitude.  We followed it until we lost it.  Lasted about 2 minutes too.  It appeared to come from the same SSW location, but went more westerly than the prior craft.  Speed was equivalent to the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, no noise whatsoever.  Eerie yellow/orange glow.  No other observations to report.  Never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought possible drones?  Light f! lickered much more than regular light.  Almost resembled fire.  Way too fast for balloons.  Very strange.

At first I thought, hum it’s too bright during the afternoon for a star to be visible.  The object just appeared and didn’t seem to originate from any direction.  It was a white yellowish in color and was brighter in appearance.  I went inside and got my Sony A330 DLSR with Sony 75-300mm lens.  As I got outside it was gone and I couldn’t spot it but figured on keeping my camera if something else came around for a picture.  As a lawn care technician came to work on the yard sprinklers I looked to the northern sky and the bright object was there.  I mentioned it to him and in broken English said yeah I see it, and laughed a little bit.  I was able to get a few pictures of it but being a very small bright object in the sky that looked like a bright star.  I figured just a couple would do and I don’t have video.  After wa! tching it for about 15 minutes, and It accelerated at amazing high rate of speed to the North and the object vanished.  Faster than any known aircraft I know of and rivals shooting stars and satellites.  The lawn care guy didn’t hang around to watch but he got a look but I guess he had to get back to work.  Also not sure if the bright objects at different times are the same or different because I didn’t see it move from the eastern sky to the northern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in the United States Air Force and living on Nellis AFB and I can watch aircraft from Nellis AFB coming and going, as well as the air traffic lanes for takeoff and landing from North Las Vegas Airport and McCarran International Airport are great reference.  All there is a commercial air traffic route over Las Vegas as well so I get to see a lot of different aircraft at different altitudes and speeds.<n>

It had no time to blink more than two to three times, and had I not been facing in the right direction at the moment it happened, the event would have taken place too quickly to have been even noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whether it was within or outside the earth&#39;s atmosphere, it was traveling at a breathtaking rate of speed.<n>

The two outer lights were flashing red, but flashing every 3 seconds and at the same time.  The middle light was white and moving in all directions, it looked like it was a UFO being followed by two other UFO&#39;s guarding it, so I ran downstairs to my brother, so we went outside to check it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was about 1 mile wide and moving south east at about the same rate or faster than a regular aircraft.  We tried to call my brothers girlfriend because she has seen UFO&#39;s that look like this one but the call wouldn&#39;t go through the servers, after it was moving north east towards Spokane, Washington, I saw another small one but with out the white light in the middle.<n>

I grabbed my binoculars but it was difficult to focus on.  It moved steadily to the south/south east and was finally obscured behind evergreen&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few moments later another one appeared at the same elevation and moving the same speed and direction......I had my binoculars and tried to focus again,  it appeared that there were visible yellow flames at the bottom of the object through the binoc&#39;s but it was too difficult to tell what it really was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had been near SEA earlier in the evening and flights were landing to the south indicating there was a south wind.  These objects were moving steadily to the south and thus didn&#39;t appear to be balloons which should have gone northward in a south wind.  The time of 10 pm is an estimate......it could have been between 10 and 11 ! pm.  It was dark out............so readily visible in the night sky.<n>

I saw what looked like a green orb running parallel to my car (I think I was going about 35-40 MPH), maybe at about 60 degrees to my left, on the opposite (East) side of the road (I was traveling South).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think, even though it would move in a straight line, it would appear in front of certain objects, and behind other objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for maybe a few seconds a most, and then it suddenly flew off really fast, and I think it left a very soft, green, light trail behind it, which faded away quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is the last detail I recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 22 years old at the time of this report; not on any medications besides allergy relief.<n>

Then minutes later a 4th moving W-E at high speeds<n> <n><n> <n><n> This oddly is the second report am writing within 10 days.  I&#39;ve been observing the skies since I had a strange sighting in which I posted in the previous report from North Reading, Massachusetts on 05/10/2014.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am hesitant to report this feeling people might be critical being that its is so soon after my first report.  Anyways, this anomaly happened as I was looking at the stars in the Peabody, Massachusetts, sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The stars were very vibrant that night with minimal forecast. at approximately 20:30 hours I observed 2 star-like objects moving at high speeds (as fast as a plane would observed 300 ft up)  These object were moving in unison together high up as stars would be and never moved away from one another.  The objects were moving from the Peabody sky towards Danvers which is from South to North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 3-4 minutes later an additional star-like object was flying at the same speed and in the same direction.  Then oddly enough I witnessed a both object this object flying the same speed, but in a completely different direction from Peabody to Salem which is West to East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects could be mistaken as stars if it wasn&#39;t for their high moving speeds but not as fast as a shooting star.  These objects were moving is steady as a flight would be but the distance from myself seemed to show that these objects were flying at astonishing speeds. I looked at the Satellite and Space Station travel path of this day which does not match these times and flight direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Completely odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If there are an explanation on these objects or if these objects are believed to be UFOs, I would appreciate if someone could contact me through my email ((e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks you!<n>

Shortly, the two orbes went east. One led the way the other followed.  Then the other that I couldn&#39;t see came back to follow the others.   I woke my mother from her sleep.  I didn&#39;t want to be the only one seeing this phenomena.  I wonder, did anyone else see what I saw.  Many people here go to sleep late.<n>

Slow and low, grey metallic bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was listening to music in bed while staring at the night sky through my window when a Diamond shape aircraft flew right over my home, it was quite low, to the point where the lights on the craft weren&#39;t a blur; I could see them clearly and detailed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There where 4 lights in each corner, they were pretty huge lights, they were a cool yellow.  Sine the aircraft flew right above me i was able to see underneath, the bottom was a metal grey.  I would say it most likely resembles a TR-3B but I recall it being a diamond shape and no center light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did make noise that could easily be heard almost like a blow-dryer on a really really low setting. It flew real low and real slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to get out of bed go outside stare at it a bit, come back inside to get my mother, and return outside to continue watching it before it disappeared behind the mountain that is a mile and a half away from our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although it disappeared we can still hear it clearly for the 5 minutes.<n>

About one minute later, two of the lights faded than disappeared. about another minute later the remaining light disappeared as well.  The lights we not similar to the spot light of a helicopter searching the ground nor the blinking light that are usually found on the planes wingtips (Buttonville airport is nearby).  No sound was heard whatsoever while those lights passed above us (we stopped the car engine and parked on the side of the road).  The lights source were quite large (larger that as you might see the source of a helicopter searchlight from the ground) and were not cold (towards white) but warm (more yellow).  Sky was clear (no clouds) and stars could faintly be seen  because of the light pollution.  The lights couldn&#39;t have been from planes because they flew too slow and couldn&#39;t have been helicopters because there was no noise (also flying in formation?!? - maybe millitary?!?)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They looked just like some of the less-bright peach-colored stars in the sky that night, except they each seemed to maintain a constant speed. We noticed each one to the south of us, about 60 degrees above the horizon, and we watched each travel over us, then fade away when they reached about the same point (about 60 degrees above the horizon) to the north of us.  They traveled  on parallel paths, and each covered the 60 degree arc in about 20-30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One had just passed overhead when it stopped and made a hairpin turn and faded out almost directly overhead.  Another flared at one point, and we thought maybe it was a meteor, but then it resumed its normal star-like state and continued on its paced trajectory. Another abruptly turned on a very bright light that seemed to shine down toward us for a second or two, then abruptly turned it off.  (We were pretty sure at this point they were not satellites.)  As we watched the lights travelling overhead, we both saw, peripherally, a very bright white light to the north-east, traveling vertically, down.  It flared, faded, and flared again before vanishing.  It only lasted 1/4 of a second.  A coincidental meteor?  At one point, as we stared up toward the south, waiting for the next star-like light to appear,  I suddenly saw one materialize right in my field of vision and fly over us much closer, as if it were only 1000 feet up, instead of 10-30,000 feet, it seemed.  It, too, was the same peach-like color, but rather than a pin-point, it was round--the size of a cherry tomato held out at arms length.  It was so close and moving so fast that I only saw it for half a second before it vanished directly overhead, but, when it was visible, it was only half-materialized--I could see through it. Light-bending tech?  They were all completely silent.  We felt no ominous feelings, no unpleasant nervousness--only positive excitement.<n>

I looked up and saw a large, triangular shaped craft moving north to south.  It was moving at a steady speed.  It was lit up around the edges with white lights.  It made no sound whatsoever. Since it was at dusk, I could clearly see the outline of the craft, although the craft was below what sunlight was still coming over the horizon.  It continued south without incident until it could no longer be seen.  Size estimation, across the base of the triangle, at least the wingspan of a C-5 Galaxy.<n>

We were just sitting there after having gone for a brisk walk and I noticed something coming out of the sky from the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three red lights moving in a westerly direction.  It appeared they were in a formation.  Behind them was another three, and then another three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it appeared that there was a total of 12.  The first 12 one by one disappeared into the night sky.  Then there appeared another set of 12 coming in formations of three.  Those 12 disappeared into the sky too.  There was no sound, no motion, no flickering of light.  There was just 24 solid red lights that vanished into the sky.<n>

They were travelling rather slowly and did not have any other flashing lights like you would normally see from an airplane so it struck me as odd.  They made no sound and moved very slowly.  I then noticed 4 more of the same lights coming behind them from the same direction.  I quickly ran in to the house to grab my two kids so they could see them too.  When we got back outside there was another group of 3 coming up from behind the second group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My view in that direction is partially blocked by some tall pine trees so I was only able to see the lights through the breaks in the trees as they moved toward us.  I moved my position to get a different angle so I could see them better after they passed the trees, but they never appeared on the other side.  I then went back to my original spot where I could then see another small group approaching but the first few groups were nowhere to be found.  I followed the lead light in that group to try and see where they were going and it basically seemed like it made a slow hard left turn, travelling away from my vantage point, until it faded from view and the others followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total I saw 5 or more groups totaling approximately 16 or more lights.  All were in groups of 2 to 4 and traveled in a similar path in what looked like a loose formation of sorts.  I have never seen anything like this before and in hindsight I wish I had thought to count exactly how many I saw.  I was so surprised at what I was seeing that it never crossed my mind to count how many lights or groups I was seeing.  Each of the lights looked very similar to what an ignited flare looks like, just more orange in color than the vibrant red of a road flare.  I spend lots of time outdoors and love looking at the stars in the night sky. This is the first time I have ever seen anything that I could not identify.<n>

They started appearing one at a time and took a kind of formation as they rose into the sky, first there were three in a triangle formation a space then four in a rectangle formation, they three more until twenty three appeared and moved gently across the sky and disappeared into the night sky.  They moved at the same rate of speed and in the same direction, while they disappeared at varying spots across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time I noted we could see the stars clearly in the sky, an airplane traveling from the South East to North West through and passed the red lights.  The interesting part was the red lights never blinked like the lights on the airplane and we noted that while the airplane was moving away from us we could still see it in the distance while the red lights completely disappeared at various points of the sky.  I did try to take a picture of the lights – un! successfully – the lights did not show up on my I-phone and subsequently did not show up on the pictures I took.  I suspect the lights were too small and too far away.  I am not sure if this is an actual UFO siting but thought it to be rather interesting and unusual experience for me and my friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two other people watching as the red lights cross the sky and multiple walkers in the park noticing the lights as we watched.  The total duration of the siting approximately 4 – 5 minutes.<n>

I usually sleep with the curtains closed, but this time I left one side of the curtains pulled open.  (From my window I look north onto the south side of the Hollywood Hills.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this night, which had been clear to partly cloudy, it caught my attention that the clouds appeared to have a warm hue and I found it odd that I could make out the shapes at such a late hour.  I figured that the clouds were lower than usual and thus reflected more of the city lights.  This was the reason why I was staring out my window for about five minutes while in bed rather than trying to fall asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 2:45am I saw what appeared to be a satellite pass into my line of sight at about 20 degrees above the horizon traveling from west to east.  About 1 second after appearing within my vision, it stopped abruptly, roughly above the North Hollywood area.  This was not a helicopter.  It was not blinking red and blue lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I initially thought it was a satellite but its intensity varied greatly to that of a very faint star and it mostly emitted a bluish white light.  For the next 2 or 3 minutes the light would flicker/fade in and out irregularly.  At times, I could not tell if the light was moving while it faded in and out or if there were one or two OTHER lights on either side of it also behaving in a similar manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky quickly became overcast around this time as clouds blew in from east to west.   When these clouds finally passed, I woke up my roommate, but only to point out what where obviously stars.  The strange light was nowhere to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was looking at this object move erratically, I thought that perhaps my adrenaline and excitement were causing my eyes to shake.  I would repeatedly look away from the object to focus on the lights of buildings, street lights, and radio masts, scattered along the Hollywood Hills.  These appeared quite normal and steady.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course, as I got back in bed after about 5 more minutes of scanning the sky, I continued to look out my window.  As I did so, I witnessed a cloud/ cloud-like object form from a small silver orb into a curved-rhombus shape and dissipate right before my eyes all within 1 minute.  I have never seen a cloud behave this way and my heart was beating incredibly hard at this point and I began to feel very disturbed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am hoping that other witnesses can confirm what I saw.<n>

The body was orange/red (with spikes of light, like a star) with a faint light (cone) shape in front of the aircraft. It was moving slowly in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then seconds later, 3 more objects moved in the same direction as the first one.  They looked the same as the first one, and but they had a faint cone of light surrounding them.  I could hear a subtle engine noise.  They were all about 1,000 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a fifth one was seen, moving in the same direction as the other 4. At first I thought they were balloons, but they moved faster than balloons, and I don&#39;t think balloons will come from the ocean onto land, nor travel at night.  There was really no wind to speak of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They all disappeared from sight when traveling eastward from my direction. The lights didn&#39;t blink, nor were any normal colors seen (white, blue).  What struck me the most was the bright orange/red color, and the cone of light surrounding the main body of light.  My best guess is that they were drones, but if so, why fly 5 of them in the same flight path?  I was able to take photos, and also recorded some of the objects with my digital camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD))<n>

This object had three lights on it with there being two green lights one on each side with an red slow flashing light on just one of the sides. My first thought was an dubble propelled Helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once about home, I noticed this object wasnt moved much at all.  I then got home outta the car and by this time I was running to look at this object as best I could with it being dark and by this time the object had moved over the little town of Waltonville.  This object that I had thought was maybe a Helicopter wasnt one because the object made no sound once so ever.  As the object moved from being south near Nason to moving West NorthWest over Waltonville, it then moved faster northward toward Mt. Vernon.<n>

The altitude was probably 500-1,000 feet, and the speed around 75 miles per hour.  It was slightly egg shaped, but more round than an egg.  It glowed bright orange, and it looked like a small version of the sun.  It moved silently away to the Northeast.  Range was less than a half mile and probably more like a 1/4 mile as it passed by us.  My wife, my son, and myself all saw it.  I went in to get a camera and while inside my son saw a second one pass by, slightly farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed by it dropped off a smaller version of itself, that slowly descended to the ground. Only my son saw this one as it was a distant dot by the time I got out.  But right at that time, a third orb approached from the northwest again, on about the same path, but closer than the first two.  This one was less than 1/8 mile away, and you could clearly make out the slightly egg-shaped form, again glowing orange, looking like a small sun.  The speed was again probably 75 mph, maybe a bit more this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife also witnessed this object.  There were multiple normal aircraft small and large visible in the sky at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fumbling with my camera in the dark I didn&#39;t get it focused and taking pictures until it was well over a mile away, but using the zoom feature, I got four decent pictures.  The image I will attach is a collage of those four pictures, reading in chronological order from top left, to top right, to bottom left, to bottom right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a slight greenish color to the bottom of the orb by the time I got the last picture.  All objects moved silently past.<n>

As we were on the balcony we noticed in the much further distance to the south/southeast very high in the sky 2 then 3 then 5 black sphere shaped objects moving way to slow to be planes.  They also had no lights or anything on them like we can see from the planes circling heading to and from the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued to move very slowly in the same direction.  Two we lost sight of then remaining three held a perfect triangle shape until a third seemed to disappear in a clear section of the sky and the last 2 moved behind a cloud and then were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Objects were to far in the distance to pick up on my camera.

5/18/14 20:32|Glen Ellyn|IL|Unknown|10 seconds|A single small jet contrail moving very fast and gaining altitude.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109455.html|295|ndxe201405| A single small jet contrail moving very fast and gaining altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Report from May 18, 2014  I am reporting this event witnessed by myself alone outside.  It was so unusual, I thought it would be reportable.  I have never made a report like this before.  I am skeptical of UFO’s in general, but believe that people like myself report unusual occurrences in order to find out the truth regarding such occurrences.  There may be a plausible explanation for certain occurrences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired firefighter, living in the suburbs of Chicago.  I am a U. S. Army veteran.  I have a college degree.  I have always had a keen interest in military aviation and space travel.  I have been to many of the annual Chicago Air and Water Shows at the Lake front.  I watch the skies for jet travel, local and transcontinental, and recognize the “circle route” when I see it.  I also have friends who are airline pilots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday, May 18th, in the evening, I witnessed what I would call an unusual occurrence.  I was at a local dog park with my Golden Retriever.  It is located at 185 Spring Ave., 60137 (41.865944, -88.044325).  This park has a large open sky area.  At approximately 20:32 hours, right at twilight, I witnessed what looked like a single jet contrail moving across the sky at a very high altitude.  I could not visualize the aircraft, but it seemed very small.  The surprising fact was that the front of the contrail, was moving faster than anything I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The contrail itself was smaller than a commercial aircraft contrail that I have witnessed, single, hazy, and white.  The background of the sighting was blue sky and I was facing north.  It also was evaporating at a fast rate as it crossed the sky.  It was moving from the north to the east, at a heading of approximately 100 degrees.  It disappeared in a very few seconds.  The altitude appeared to be as high as I have ever seen a commercial aircraft.  The aircraft appeared to be moving three times faster than a commercial flight.  The aircraft may have been in a circle route, because it appeared to be gaining altitude in a straight line.  The contrail stopped, and disappeared without any further sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So my first thought is maybe a military fighter jet.  I have seen them before at this approximate altitude.  What was missing was the roar of the jet engine.  No sound came from this fast moving aircraft.  That is all I remember at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Respectfully submitted<n>

His back was to the window as I was facing him and the window.  The window looks to the northwest towards the Rose Quarter/Moda Center.  As I was talking to him, a flash from outside caught my eye.  It was bright red and took up a very large portion of the lower sky.  It was throbbing like a strobe light and changing colors with each throb.  I shouted, &#34;Look at the sky!!&#34; We both ran over to the window and for the next maybe four seconds, watched as the colors changed.  Then it was just gone.  My first thought was it was some kind of event going on as it&#39;s not abnormal to see spotlights in the sky for things like that.  Then I remembered that it was 3:20 AM and the entire city was pretty much shut down. I&#39;ve been monitoring news sights, asking facebook, etc and have found no answers whatsoever. Northern Lights is the closest looking thing I can describe it as lookin! g like but that&#39;s not what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anybody else see this or have you seen anything similar?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t stop thinking about it and would love to hear any opinions on what you think it was??<n>

As I was driving North, it kept getting lower and lower and I&#39;m thinking, it&#39;s going to either land or crash.  As I turned and started heading East, I saw another one...as I was driving about 55, It appeared to be moving to the east also, but that could have been an optical illusion as it was so large.  There appeared to be smoke trails following it.  I arrived at my destination and walked around the side of the building where another customer approached me and asked if I was ok...I pointed to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see 2 of the very large bright lights, and as we watched the surrounding sky was turning different shades of pale red.  After I came out of the store and started heading North again, I noticed a group of people in  a parking lot watching one and taking pictures. I stopped and asked if we were getting invaded and they were like...maybe...I drove home heading West and saw 2 of them...one got  lower and lower and finally went out, but the other appeared to be traveling West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived home and looked North and could one through the trees.  I ran inside for my camera, but when I got back it was gone.  Walked to the end of the road and the other was gone too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this at 12:45 am - 1:10 am.<n>

I thought it was strange, as jetliners usually have green and red lights, and white headlights, never orange.  It made me move closer to the windows, and here I discovered that there was not only one, but multiple of these red-ish orange lights gliding silently over the sky.  They were flying with the wind from north to south, and were not making a single sound.  I counted 4, before turning around and yelling for my mother to come have a look.  When we both got outside, I saw that there were 3 more light, just behind the 4 first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother, amazed and intrigued, told me to get the binoculars, and I ran inside to grab them and took them with me up to the second floor to have a closer look.  But they didn&#39;t help much, as even through the binoculars, the objects just appeared to be orange lights with a red center.  I couldn&#39;t see any shape or other characteristics.  While up on the second floor, I saw an 8th object following much further behind the other 7, and taking a slightly different direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s impossible for me to say how big or how far up the lights were, but they appeared much bigger than the stars, and they were up high enough to enter the few clouds there were further to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

The dots were completely silent.  Upon looking closer at the dots, I noticed that to each of the 5 dots, there were 3 orbs composing the dots.  The orbs were making weird circling motions around each other.  The craft(s) were moving east.<n>

The objects appeared to shimmer in their medium grey colour against the night sky but not vividly, more fuzzy or hazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not hear any obvious sounds, which might indicate a regular type of aircraft; it was very quiet outside and no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the objects moving slowly on a north northwesterly direction from my location.  I watched the objects for about 7 (seven) seconds when they became obstructed from my view by the tall building I was standing by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to the furthest edge of the parking lot to visually engage them again but there was nothing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate their elevation to be somewhere between 1000 (one thousand) to 1500 (fifteen hundred) feet high. I estimate the size of the objects to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 (sixty) to 100 (one hundred) feet down the longest side of the triangular shape and the back or tail end of somewhere near 125 (one hundred and twenty five) to 150 (one hundred fifty) feet from tip to tip at the tail. They were a stout looking shape with an estimated height of about 50 (fifty) feet tall. The objects were flying in an orderly formation one ahead of the other but not trailing each others slip stream. Each object flew behind and to the right of the forward object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects moved in the direction of the pointed front with the (V) trailing behind or to the back of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other aircraft heard or seen in the area. I watched the sky for several more minutes but did not see anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following morning while heading to my car from the hotel, I observed 4 (four) men who were wearing what appeared to be flight suits with shoulder and chest crests but I could not see the detail of the writing on the crests.  The suits were zip front tighter fitting than a coverall with visible zipper pockets/pouches on the sides and legs.  The color of the jumpsuits was grey but not camouflage.  The 4 (four) men got into a plain black suburban type of truck with blacked out windows.  For some reason I did not take a look at the license plate to determine if it may have been a military service vehicle.<n>

As we were getting out of the car, I saw 4 bright orange lights moving across the sky at an altitude of a plane.  They were evenly spaced and flew across the sky in a perfect row at the speed of a plane flying by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a fifth one appeared into sight more of a distance behind the first four.  Then a sixth one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They passed in a line one following the other until out of sight behind the trees.

Stopped the car and got out, and the orb proceeded to go south faster than anything I have ever seen until it was gone in about 1 second.  There were starting to go off but this orb was way higher up and farther away in a different direction.  The way it moved made absolutely no sense it would switch direction instantly.

I immediately took out my cell phone to record, but it didn&#39;t appear on the screen even though a much dimmer star to its left showed up.  At first I thought it was a plane on fire, but then it started elevating and curved its direction roughly 45 degrees.  Even at its greatest distance I could still see the flickering which closest resembled fire.  There was no sound emitted at all.<n>

When I looked up into the sky to see a what appeared to be very intense redish/orange ball of light coming out of the North heading due South across the sky.  This object was flying at an altitude that appeared to be just above the mountaintops when I first spotted it.  I ran inside an had my wife come out into the backyard to witness this event.  The object seemed very rapidly ascend into the sky with the glow dissipating as it ascended.  I was able to capture this event by recording it on my cellphone.  When it reached a certain altitude, the object started to dim and appeared to flicker on and off twice, then it appeared to be a black craft triangular in shape very high in the sky.  This craft then disappeared from sight.  As I turned to go back into the house, my wife had called to me in a loud excited voice and exclaimed that another redish/g! lowing object was flying the same pattern and route as the first.  We were able to also video tape this object as well.  I had instructed my wife to retrieve our son&#39;s telescope but was unable to bring the object into focus with the telescope.  We videotaped this object as it rapidly ascended and suddenly disappeared out of sight.  During the videotaping, I was able to video an aircraft flying high above our house roof with its blinking lights to clearly show the contrast between the aircraft and these two objects that we saw and filmed.  The very interesting but disturbing thing about this encounter is, that we had seen the same phenomenon approx. 3 miles East of where I live the later part of last summer while riding our motorcycle.  We pulled off the road with 4 other vehicles and we all watched in amazement as 5 of these objects did aerobatics unlike anything we had ever seen.  They like the two comparable objects we had seen tonight ascended rapidly and seemed to vanis! h into the atmosphere.  I had made a report of last summer&#39;s sightings on the MUFON site.  I had since been trying to make sense of this.  I had first heard of this site from the Coast to Coast A.M. radio program.  I started listening to Coast to Coast after the first encounter.  I would very much like to have a follow up concerning these sightings and I will say that it sort of unnerves my wife and I, especially being that we have witnessed this phenomenon twice.  Also of note, on both occasions, these objects did not make any discernible noise whatsoever the whole time they were visible.<n>

5/17/14 21:05|Los Angeles|CA|Circle|5 minutes|Formation of 4 round/oval craft over Los Angeles at night (no strobe lights).  ((NUFORC Note:  Pilot report.  PD))|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109494.html|314|ndxe201405| Formation of 4 round/oval craft over Los Angeles at night (no strobe lights)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I landed at Hawthorne airport in Los Angeles at approximately 9pm in a small piston airplane.  I parked the airplane and was waiting for my guests to arrive when I noticed what appeared to be 4 aircraft approaching from the west.  They caught my attention as they were dimly lit with steady lights (i.e. did not have any flashing lights) which is not typical of aircraft (airplanes/helicopters typically have flashing lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was somewhat hard to determine what the craft were as they were coming towards my location so at times it appeared as though they were craft coming towards me, and because of this viewing angle, it also appeared as thought someone may have simply let go of some circular balloons that were floating &#34;up&#34; and may just be reflecting city lights from below (as objects at a constant altitude that are approaching you in the sky also appear to be moving &#34;up&#34;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the objects moved much closer I was able to determine that the! y were not balloons floating up but were indeed a formation of 4 separate objects flying from west to east directly overhead.  The craft flew directly overhead at what appeared to be considerable altitude (it&#39;s extremely difficult to judge, but I would estimate anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 feet in altitude.  It was very difficult to determine the shape of the craft, as it was night time, but the craft appeared to have lights on the bottom that either outlined a somewhat circular shape or would &#34;move&#34; in such a way as to be consistent with a circular TV screen with various pixels turning on and off.  They were clearly all separate craft as they flew in loose formation and changed position in relation to one another, but generally maintained a somewhat traditional formation consistent with a group of aircraft (i.e. all moving in the same directly with somewhat equal spacing, with the space between the craft roughly 5-10 times the length of each craft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to move generally in a straight line at a speed consistent with a highe r flying jet or a lower flying helicopter, yet the shape of the objects was neither of these things, and the light patterns of each were slightly different.  The light patterns almost appeared reminiscent of the large TV type display contained on the side of the Goodyear blimp, yet much more dimly lit.  One craft appear to be completely constantly lit in a circular shape.  The center was dark with increasing light towards the edges and slight color variation moving form center to edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other craft shared this same general characteristic and color pattern, but the &#34;lights&#34; themselves were not steady state (i.e. the entire circle was not always &#34;lit up&#34; at one time).  One craft was lit in such a way as it looked light a two bladed helicopter rotor slowly spinning and fading a trail of fading light behind it (i.e. one line drawn across a circle that rotated and cast a fading trail behind).  This appeared to rotate at a speed of roughly once every 3-5 seconds ! (i.e. MUCH slower than a helicopter rotor system).  This object was the third in line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 4th object had a light patter which appeared to be a somewhat loosely drawn triangle which seemed to constantly &#34;morph&#34; and change position and shape within the context of the larger circle (like a screen saver on a computer screen).  The objects did not appear to make any noise, however this is not unusual of aircraft in the area as the wind, distance, and city noise can easily drown out aircraft noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a helicopter and jet pilot with 14+ years of flying experience and do not believe these craft to be civilian helicopters or airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a substantial amount of time to observe these craft (several minutes?) and attempted to take photo with my iPhone, however given the distance and the night time, I was not able to get a quality photo (again, to be expected given the conditions and equipment used).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the craft had passed overhead, and while they were still in plain view towards the east of my location, I called the Southern California Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), 858-537-5900, and asked if they were tracking any formation of aircraft in the area.  The controller initially said they often routed &#34;downwind&#34; traffic for LAX over my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I indicated that the objects I was referring to were not downwind airliners headed to LAX, but rather were a group of 4 strange objects which now appeared to be well east (perhaps over fullerton airport) and were continuing to travel east bound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> TRACON employees indicated that they were not tracking any objects in that area, and said they were &#34;Looking at the radar right now,&#34; and did not see anything that fit this description or any other unusual traffic or radar targets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects continued to move east and eventually faded from view (as any aircraft would).<n>

As we watched them moving, some began to move more quickly and in direct paths.  After a few moments, a few more came up from the horizon.  They lasted about 5-6 minutes before fading out.  They varied slightly in brightness. They were completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation seemed like something directly out of a classic ufo sighting tv show, and this being such a rural area, the only other thing we could imagine they could be were chinese lanterns, or other flame driven balloons.  They arced up a bit as they traveled, and we observed that they were arcing with the prevailing winds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Let me say I have seen many planes come out this path or make their approach to land at Midway airport, but this was no plane.  I seen planes past by this area for a lot of years, but again this was no plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane because it had 3 lights on each corner and 1 one on the bottom middle.  The light on the bottom sharply blink a very bright light and omitted no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my mom, is that a plane?  She said, that&#39;s not a plane, it don&#39;t look like a plane.  She said, it has a weird shape to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking at it as I got off the California exit, passed a container yard then I didn&#39;t see it anymore.

At a stop sign we noticed a bright Red flickering object in the sky; both she and I noticed that it was moving steadily to the NE.  I recall that neither of us was able to find the normal green and red alternating blinking of an airplane wing, only the orange-ish red that flickered like a flame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jokingly we expressed that it must be a UFO and drove to the Gate of Heaven Cemetery on York St, to get a better view.  When we arrived the object was completely gone, despite a totally wide open nearly cloudless sky, we were not able to track the object or see it in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I looked back, I saw what I believed to be two helicopters with red lights shining flying in the area from which we had just come.  My wife and I immediately thought that they may be pursuing the object, and I thought I heard a faint sound of an engine, which my wife pointed out, was in fact an airplane flying di! rectly above us, compounded by highway noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment, I realized that the objects, though they were rising in the sky, didn&#39;t seem to be getting any closer.  It was then that my wife and I realized that they were 2 of the same objects we had chased, and we started taking photos and video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects were lit like fire, and flying in formation directly up.  At one point the first object turned off its light, and I thought it had disappeared.  The second object remained lit for a short time, but then also turned its light off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to see the first object, totally blacked out traveling towards the left of us, it seemed very fluid and steady paced, but I noticed that it seemed to be almost an oval that was rotating very slowly.  As I filmed it, it seemed to descend slowly into the field opposite of us about a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We immediately jumped in our car and drove to where we believed it to be, but it was not visible, since it had gotten dark, and the second object was also no longer visible.<n>

I kept looking up at it as I was driving, wishing I had a camera to photograph it - I enjoy amateur astronomy and I enjoy photographing the moon.  Anyway, while I was stopped at a light on Spring St, I looked up again, and I thought I saw a fast moving commercial aircraft gliding between my view of the moon - I was just thinking about what a great shot that would make, when I realized that the plane had no wings - nor any discernible tail.  It was a very long, cylindrical object, round at both ends, and it was moving VERY quickly.  I&#39;ve lived in this area my whole life, I KNOW what aircraft moving in and out of Avoca International Airport look like.  Avoca would&#39;ve been north of my position at the time - this object was moving due east - maybe east/south east.  It glimmered and reflected light from the sun. It was a ! very smooth, metallic-looking object - the best description I just gave to someone a few minutes ago was that it looked like mercury moving across the sky.  I continued onto where my wife works to pick her up, and I was transfixed with this thing.  Now, this may have been a perspective thing, but I swear to God the thing stopped dead in the sky and HOVERED for a moment. I contemplated pulling over into the parking lot of Home Depot to get out of the car and look at the thing, but I continued on.  When I began ascending the hill to get to where my wife works, it went out of my view behind the building.  I had a good idea of its trajectory, so after I got my wife into the car, I drove to the other side of the parking lot to get a better view of the sky, and it was gone.  NO aircraft moves THAT quickly.  There was plenty of distance to the horizon versus the point in the sky where I&#39;d seen it last. It was NOWHERE to be found.  The sky was mainly clear, no clouds for it to have moved! behind.  The thing was just GONE in a clear, blue sky.<n>

I initially thought it was a star then I noticed it moving.  After I started watching it I then noticed that there were 2 more objects sitting relatively close to the brighter one.  I stated to move away from my apartment building to get a better look and the object started moving away from my sight and behind a tall group of pine trees.  I positioned myself at an angle to continue observing the object when without sound it shot across the sky towards Huntsville. I turned to go back into my apartment when I realized threw light had returned at a much lower altitude and moved just above a tree line about 100 yards from where I was standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my wife about the sighting when she woke up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening around 21:40 we were both outside smoking and saw a very similar object dancing around in the sky but it was much further away than the 3 I saw this! morning.  This isn&#39;t a hoax or sham, nor is it an attempt for attention.  I spent 10 years in the military and have seen some strange things out at sea but I have never really been an up close witness nor was I a solid believer until today.<n>

I was star-gazing when I saw what at first appeared to be a helicopter flying through the sky.  I believed it to be a helicopter because the UFO was composed of white lights angled downward like a helicopter with it&#39;s nose slightly tipped as if it were flying forward instead of up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally, it was seemingly flying at an altitude typical of helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point in time I point out the object to my friend who also began to observe it.  The object moved through the sky at a steady and quick pace and moved in the same direction throughout the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After roughly ten seconds of observation, the lights began to spiral around each other while still moving in the same direction as earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights moved closer together and spread apart, and I realized that if the UFO was a helicopter, it would&#39;ve been out of control and it would not have been possible for it to maintain its altitude, speed, and direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After roughly thirty seconds more of confused observation, the lights spread out from each other, farther than they had before, and faded into the night sky.<n>

Most often appeared white or red.  Objects were bright, and seemed to glide in circles separately.  No discernable patterns to color changes or movement.  After 15-20 minutes, objects seemed to drift farther away and then out of line of sight due to neighborhood trees.  The objects seemed very close at none point during the sighting, but made no sound.<n>

I ran outside to call my dad who also witnessed the event.  As we went to reach for our cameras to document the evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two craft moved backwards very slowly until they could not be seen anymore.  It was weird because they were not planes and the craft seemed to have no directionality in their movement, except when they retracted and moved off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the crafts, as I assume they were, appeared to be a in a triangular almost dome shape.  The top and sides where clearly illuminated in a bright red, almost the color of a red stop light.  The bottom of the crafts, had no illumination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no sounds emitted, nor where there any sudden fast movements.  It almost was as if, they appeared out of nowhere and then moved away.<n>

The top was maybe a bit larger than the rest.  It was like a little piece of illuminated string hanging in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was way up in the sky by itself and seemed to be completely still.

An hour later when she picked me up from the station in Venlo I explained her more about the sighting and then suddenly I saw the object again and pointed it out to her.

5/16/14 17:15|Calgary (Canada)|AB|Oval|~10 seconds|White semi-transparent oval-ish object moving at high speed directly opposite direction of airliner.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109528.html|351|ndxe201405| White semi-transparent oval-ish object moving at high speed directly opposite direction of airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday, May 16, 2014<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside in my backyard in Calgary, Alberta, about 5:15pm and noticed that airliners coming out of YYC airport appeared to reaching higher altitudes faster than what we normally see in take off patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched one airliner as it banked from its southward climb out to a westward direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately one minute later, I noticed another airliner which remained climbing out in a southward direction and appeared to be at a surprisingly high altitude for just coming out of our airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched that airliner move past the directly vertical position my eye caught an object moving in exactly the opposite direction, south to north, at what appeared to be a high altitude at a speed at least equal to the airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was white in colour, with a bit of an oval shape about it and with a degree of transparency towards the middle.  It appeared smaller than the airliner and I at first thought that it must be a bird but there were no wings and none of the typical motion of a bird.   The flight path was very straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in my field of view for approximately 10 seconds and having ruled out it being a bird I wondered if it might perhaps be a balloon being pushed along by a high altitude wind even though there was no wind at ground level and when I have seen weather balloons or kids balloons in the past they have all displayed some degree of buffeting motion being pushed along by wind.  In this case the object had a solid trajectory as it travelled along.  No sound from object.<n>

I pointed it out to my wife, the object was in the southern sky what looked right next to the moon, the object moved west toward the moon then dipped as if it was tracing the moon, making a “U” maneuver.  The object moved westward further then dipped straight down southward and stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object stopped it hovered in place for a few seconds and small flash of light emitted and the object then disappeared.

They just look as lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they would climb altitude the light would dim and when they would drop in altitude the light would appear as one circle beam.

It came up from the tree lines to the right of the road very suddenly, and I thought it was a firework, but it hit the point in the sky that it looked like it would descend or blow up, but it them moved to the left across the road in a slow straight line.  Giving off a tale very much like a comet does, except you could see it seem to be breaking apart and leaving a beautiful trail behind it, it then disappeared behind the trees on the other side of the road.  But it seemed almost too low in the sky that when I was driving under it it did not seem much higher than the trees it just flew over.  That sky was dark, the moon had not come up yet, and it was actually beautiful.<n>

They came from the N.W.   It looked like from the shore of Lk. Michigan to just before Zeeland.  Though they each came separately.  They both stopped,  hovered,  and disappeared the same identical spot.  Lasted about 15 min.  They didn&#39;t flicker or make any noise.  Just about sun down.  a little after.  Moved very slow.<n>

It rapidly descended in a straight vertical line until out of sight.  It looked like it was falling as there was no horizontal movement at all.  The whole thing lasted 2 seconds max.  It did not appear to be a falling star as it was too large, too low and falling too vertically.  Seconds later, a helicopter which had previously flown over the park, circled back and began flying over the area where the object had descended out of sight.<n>

It had a bluish tint.  I could not figure out whether there was more than just one, because as soon as I went into my yard to get a better look at it, the object was nowhere to be found.  The object looked exactly like a giant star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no sounds from it.<n>

They also had an orange aura around them. I watched the objects for about 30 seconds and then watched the ball on the left move up a bit, with the other ball of light immediately following around one second later. The orange lights moved up for about three seconds and then fizzled out quickly. Lights appeared orange in color but have a whitish tinge in photos (shot with iPhone 5).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I head out to the balcony to see what she was talking about and yes in fact there were 3 white lights in a triangle formation hovering in the sky, motionless,<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was very clear absolutely no clouds very calm wind and there was some air traffic but more than usual for the airport nearby you could clearly see what were clearly planes or a helicopter these lights were not a conventional aircraft.  Of the three the one in the center was the largest and had the most distinct shape, that of a diamond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it appeared to be one large craft but after looking at it for about 3-4 minutes the lights began to separate and move away from each other slowly at first, then in a blink of an eye they seemed to have traveled a good distance from each other.  They stayed at a relatively far distance from each other at this time, and stayed in position from what seemed to be an expanded triangular formation.  At this point the lights went from whitish blue to flashing red, green, and blue.  Sometime after watching the lights sit in place for a while I heard a jet fly by south of the house I looked and did in fact see a jet, what was odd Is that this aircraft was at around the same distance away but I could hear it where as I could not hear the 3 strange objects when they moved.  Two more lights appeared after a while but these stayed closely together one was hovering over the other and to the side at a small distance almost like it was supervising over the object below it.  Some pictures and video was taken but the quality is not good the lights I observed can be seen but the shape is a bit distorted.  All the lights eventually began rising slowly straight up into the atmosphere and eventually disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a side note I did observe the house pets (cat and dog) acting very erratic, running around and specifically the dog running up my leg, 2 more dogs from some neighbors also began barking.<n>

We have never had a UFO encounter of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Husband and I were driving South bound on the Bend Parkway.  The sun was getting close to setting and the skies were clear and beautiful.  Suddenly we both saw a large, reflective, oval, disk-shaped object appear in the sky with a fuzzy &#34;haze&#34; around it.  It looked like it was flying on the south end of town between the Bend and Sun River area, perhaps near China Hat Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disk appeared smaller than a plane but the shape and the brightness of the reflective material was what really caught our eyes.  It was also moving very fast and we were both astonished because we’d never seen anything of that shape or speed in the skies before.  It lasted for about 10 seconds and then suddenly disappeared completely!  This is when we got pretty excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both exclaiming with astonishment when about 4-5 seconds later, it reappeared!  This time travelling much faster and lasting approximately 7-8 seconds before completely disappearing again.  It was amazing<n>

WTF?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else happen to see this?  If you put your arm out it was about 1/2&#34; in size or so , close enough to see it there, then gone, there was no clouds, nothing to block view of area in sky ! to weird..<n>

In Bozeman, MT.  It appeared from Hyalite Mountains.  The triangle was blinking red lights; strobe style, one after the other in order. ..triangular lights.  The UFO was traveling east towards MSU campus then it disappeared behind treeline.  I followed down the road on foot to see it further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the UFO was gone!  Not even 2 min after that i see a tiny yellow object shooting across the skyline going west.  I stayed outdoors to observe further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 min later @ approx 12:30 am, the same triangle object (red lights blinking) was traveling in the opposite direction it was before; not East, but West; same direction as the yellow object went.  It seemed as though this time however the yellow object was leading the red triangle UFO because the UFO followed the triangular object West.  When i observed yellow object both times;  The yellow object (circular, star shape) seemed to travel very fa! st. ..it went east the first time (same as UFO) it went west second time (as it seemed to lead UFO.  (I don&#39;t know how to explain this except I think the yellow object must have somehow went eastward (very fast) again because the second time I saw it was when the UFO re-appeared it seemed to lead the UFO westward; (Or maybe a different yellow object seemed to lead the triangle O Westward!!!) (For Bozeman residents; towards four corners).  Anyway it was another encounter. . same location; different date, year &amp; time; much different shaped UFO craft, however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please Bozeman residents report your witnessing to this!

5/13/14 23:00|San Diego|CA|Light|10-12 seconds|Ball/orb of light dripping "liquid fire" pulses and then streaks of into night sky|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109522.html|388|ndxe201405| Ball/orb of light dripping &amp;quot;liquid fire&amp;quot; pulses and then streaks of into night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking my dog as I do almost every night I witnessed an unexplainable, for me anyway, event in the sky. It was what some might call a fire ball or orb of light, but there was something else going on as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I continue let me say that I live near a military air station, as well as a smaller but busy local airport. I am accustomed to seeing all manner of aircraft, both at night and during the day, such as; Osprey (with the rotors up like a helicopter), giant military transport planes, light/personal aircraft, small personal jets, fighter planes, and helicopters of all kinds.  I know very little about aviation but this was nothing I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event happened in the eastern sky, and appeared to be fairly close.  It lasted about 10-12 seconds total, but was already happening when I looked up.  At first I thought what I was seeing was a meteor falling and burning up very close to the ground.  There seemed to be debris falling and burning up in the sky like something breaking up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, after maybe half a second or so, I noticed two things.  1) It was not falling but stationary.  2) The brightest point of light was at the top.  At that point I thought maybe a firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The debris, for lack of a better word, was almost “dripping” from the ball/orb of light.  It seemed to have a liquid quality to it.  Not at all like what you would associate with a firework.  It almost looked like burning/melting plastic being poured or dripping/falling into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then thought maybe it was a lantern burning up and the dripping was just thin paper on fire and swirling around, and the ball/orb of light was the heat source for the lantern.  But the ball of light remained stationary and the “liquid fire” kept falling; so much that it would be hard to believe this was all paper from a lantern or that the lantern would even be able to maintain its elevation while loosing that much of its structure.  The same would go for any aircraft. It was just so much fire.  It also did not seem to be consistent with what I have witnessed as a flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point it has been maybe 3-3.5 seconds.  The origin of the “liquid fire” began to glow very bright and appeared to grow larger.  It also, at this point, started to pulse alternating between a dimmer light red-orange color and a full, bright true-orange color.  The “liquid fire” increased in volume and also seemed to pulse along with the ball/orb of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed this way, very bright, for a couple of 2-3 seconds and then the dripping “liquid fire” stopped.  The ball/orb grew even brighter and more well defined. It pulsed a couple more times; finally sticking with the red-orange color, and shot off heading east at a very high rate of speed.  I could see it for 3-4 seconds before it was too small to be visible anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound that I would say could be attributed to this event.  This is in a suburban area and near a highway so there is ambient noise.  However, it is also in a valley and air traffic is usually amplified not muffled or masked.<n>

It appeared to be on a level flight so it wasn&#39;t descending.  It did not fade, like you&#39;d think a meteor would.  It streaked across the sky, over the moon, as low as 15-20K feet, but no sound, no trail.  Very strange.  They&#39;re testing drones around here, so we think maybe that&#39;s what it was?<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;re a college-educated, middle-aged couple from the Midwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband works in Information Technology and I work in Office Management.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;ve never seen anything this bright and colorful in the night sky.<n>

I am an avid sky watcher and weather spotter for the national weather service...  I was very curious after the first one.  I paid closer attention, to see if there were any sparks or tails, which there were none.  At this point I determined these were not fireworks or falling stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First single ball, then approx. 30 seconds later, another about 4 oclock from the first and 3 inches away by the naked eye.  The third was smaller than the rest, back to back with the 2nd and was very close, slightly right and lower. (5 oclock)  Approx. 45 sec-1 min went by.  The 4th was farther left than the 1st by 2 inches. 15 - 20 sec. later the 5th orb appeared 7 inches away from the 4th, farthest right of all. (4 oclock)   I would consider this to be a distorted Z pattern... shorter and wide.<n>
5/13/14 21:57|Galesburg|MI|Fireball|1-2 minutes|My friend and I saw a fireball and experienced some sort of psychological phenomenon.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109544.html|391|ndxe201405| My friend and I saw a fireball and experienced some sort of psychological phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before 10pm, I was driving my friend back to Galesburg from Kalamazoo, MI.  As I usually do, I turned South onto Fullerton Ave from West Michigan St. to drop him off.  He opened the door to get out, but then we both noticed a glowing red orb in the sky ahead of us, just over the trees, on the left side of the road.  The object looked to be at least a few blocks away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said, &#34;What is that?&#34;  My friend replied, &#34;Maybe it&#39;s just a plane?&#34;  We both got a peculiar feeling.  He closed the door and we drove South down Fullerton Ave toward the object.    Luckily, there&#39;s an empty field a block away on the South side of Blake Blvd, adjacent to where we parked the car on Fullerton.  We turned East at the intersection of Fullerton Ave and Blake Blvd and parked the car on the South side of Blake Blvd, next to the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we pulled up we realized the object was closer than we thought and was more or less hovering over the field. We then began observing  a decent sized object that looked like a ball of fire in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I agree that we observed the following: It flickered somewhat like a candle and was bright orange.  The object was very low to the ground and looked to be well below the cloud ceiling at 1k-3k.  The sky was completely overcast at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object we observed did not have wings, a tail, any visible means of propulsion, any cylindrical shapes, right of way lights, strobe lights, a propellor, jet engines, etc.  The object was not an airplane, helicopter, ultra-light aircraft, etc.  It didn&#39;t resemble any known aircraft.  The only light coming from the object was an overwhelming red/orange/amber glow that flickered and didn&#39;t appear to be attached to anything, but was the object itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object wasn&#39;t blowing around in the wind, like a chinese lantern, but seemed to be hovering around very slowly, under it&#39;s own control.  The wind speed at the time was 7 mph from East to West.  The object didn&#39;t make a sound; it was completely silent the entire time we observed it.  As we started walking toward the object, it appeared ! to be hovering Northeast, in a straight line.  However, my friend says the object was flying Southesat in a straight line.  We demonstrated to each other that we both knew which direction North was from where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We don&#39;t know how to reconcile the difference in direction, but agree the object was hovering in straight lines.  I estimated its angle of elevation to be 40-45 degrees at the time.  It remained at a near constant angle of elevation.  Twice or three times during the time we observed it, it appeared to stop and remain stationary for short periods of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned on my cell phone camera and began running toward the object to take pictures.  My friend stayed closer to the car and continued observing.  We watched the object flicker for a short time, getting brighter and dimmer while hovering around.   I snapped two pictures.  They&#39;re both time-stamped at 9:57 pm.  The object appears in both the shots, though the lighting is poor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I took the pictures, the object appeard to move in a short straight line and got dimmer.  When it did, my friend and I simultaneously got a distinct feeling the object was going to disappear, though he and I hadn&#39;t said anything.  The object then remained stationary, got incrementally dimmer and faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on, at 11:30pm, I had driven back to Kalamazoo and to work for the night.  We hadn&#39;t had a chance to talk about what we&#39;d seen, as I didn&#39;t want to be late for work at 11:00pm.  My friend and I got online and started taking about it.  In discussing what we&#39;d seen, my friend said, &#34;It was weird when I knew it was going to disappear.&#34;  I agreed with him.  I felt the same thing.  Then we realized we&#39;d had that feeling at the same time, as if we&#39;d had the same thought or feeling &#34;together&#34; somehow.  We agree that whatever happened to us was very strange and very difficult to describe.<n>

Some would immediately disappear without moving and another would appear.  All in the same spot.  We watched these for 30 minutes before they disappeared for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched every night after without success.  The lights appeared at approximately 9:30 PM to about 10 PM.  This is the very first time either one of us had seen something so strange and we were excited.  Had a phone camera but the quality is very, very poor.  It was simply amazing!<n>

I happened to look out to the west and noticed a light dancing over the wood line.  At first it appeared like something similar to a stunt plane.  But then I occurred to me that its 9:00 pm, and the object was doing acrobatics at an extremely high rate of speed.  The object stayed a white colored, until it would ascend and immediately change to a strange blue color.  Now, when I say this object moved at a high rate of speed, i literally have never seen something move that fast, its almost mind boggling.  After about 5 or 6 mins of acrobatics, the light grew dim, and shot upwards into the atmosphere at an unbelievable rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother observed this event too, we&#39;ve never seen anything like it in this area.<n>

At first, I thought it might be a balloon, but it seemed to be just a bit too large for that!  I say that, because, though it had some distance to it away from me, I would say it was maybe about the size of a popcorn kernel held about a foot from my face!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for some time, and also got the attention of someone I work with, to view it as well!  Came to find out, 2 others I work with, had already seen it!  I stated previously that I thought it might be a balloon, but, after watching it for a few minutes, I watched as it turned to the left, and it had length to it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, at first I thought it to be spherical, but that observation has changed now, to be close to cigar or cylindrical in shape!  Distance at that time, would be approximately 2 miles distant, and about 1500-2700 in elevation from my location!  It was moving at a slow rate of speed, but increasing in elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were high thin clouds in the area, at about 4-6000 feet above! I watched it for a while, but was busy with other things, though I tried to keep sight of it as much as I could!  My vision is okay, but one witness stated that he has 20/15 vision, and he knows that it was not a balloon!  And he saw it long before I had! Hill AFB is close by, to the south!  I wonder if they saw it on radar!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have witnessed things in this area before, and have made reports!  And I know others who have seen things as well!  One of the witnesses to this event, stated that he sees objects quite often in the area!  One thing of note, as I was watching this...object, it did make a sudden move, and seemed to increase in elevation of I would say, a couple of hundred feet, in just a few seconds!<n>

The object was a sphere or orb, white and semi translucent. The object appeared no bigger than a soccer ball.  The shape was very clean, not distorted, a perfect orb or spherical shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first assumed the object to be a plastic bag or seagull but the object stopped in midair in what appeared to be 15 – 25 mph winds heading South by South East.  The object was at an altitude higher than a six story building but lower than the aircraft taking off at the nearby San Jose Airport.  Several commercial aircraft, 2 or 3 mostly 737s were visible during this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved in an erratic behavior dropping 50 – 60 ft and then climbing vertical another 50 – 60 ft.  The object moved right to left in a 50 yard area and then suddenly headed south and vertical in an upward motion at a speed much faster than the surrounding aircraft, birds, or insects that I observed.  Another way to characterize the speed, I have worked closely with F-18 Hornets and have never seen them capable of travelling at this speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I doubted my observation several times thinking it could be a plastic bag, a bird, a drone, an insect, or even a piece of flying pollen.  None of the above items match the flight characteristics that this odd craft showed as it seemed intelligently controlled, capable of stopping and moving about in any direction, at any speed despite the winds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no visible clouds, no light shining on the windows of the building that I observed the object through.  I have never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no visible propulsion system, jet intake, propellers, or anything that would indicate the power source this craft used to move about.  If I had not been staring where I was at that exact moment I never would have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Sun was out and not much of a breeze. We were driving down a very busy street in boise by the mall.  I noticed what looked like a grey colored airplane flying low toward us but to the left and slowing down.  I commented to the driver that plane looks like its going to crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as we drove down the 35 mph street the grey looking airplane came to what looked like a complete stop in the sky above some residental houses on a hill behind some big businesses.  We had hit a red light.  The airplane hovered over the tree line looking like it was decending.  I turned the radio down.  There was not a sound to be heard, other than the other traffic.  We stared at the grey, hovering too low and not moving, way to silent aircraft.  I noticed there were no propellers or moving parts of any kind.  The tail of the plane looked like it had a double fin, like a car spoiler.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a very logical minded person who can find an explanation for almost anything.  This dumbfounded me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked with a good friend who works at a crop dusting outfit, and explained him this story.  I asked his opnion.  He said that sounds like a bona fide UFO.<n>

It wasn’t moving very fast. It looked like it could have possibly been spinning or moving in small circles at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed like it was very high up in the sky. Higher then a plane or bird would fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my husband what it was. It took him a minute to spot it. Neither of us could identify what it was. I’ve never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch it for about 5-7min.

I had a strange thing happen after, that somehow appears connected.  I was siting on my porch. The night may have been a bit overcast.  I was thinking about what I observed on the 8th of May.  I was looking south when just about 50 feet off the ground a black object whizzed by my view and disappeared over the roof of the house.  It was about 20 feet in front of me. It was travelling east.  Less than a second later, from over the roof the object shot out in a southerly direction and headed south.  It was travelling directly away from me.  Of course the speed is the key. You could barely see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was questioning what I had seen when it first went by and over the roof.  I can only describe it as a black opaque sighting.  I first thought it had to be a bat or bird.  I realized that was impossible.  This object had to be solid, but was going so fast it looked as a blur.  The blur was about 8 inches wide, not just thin.  While I was trying to figure out what I saw, it obviously changed direction in a micro-second and shot off south.  Exactly away from me.  Now the black object had mass.  Going away from me, it appeared as a small black dot. About the size of a golf ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What ever this was, it appeared that it &#34;triangulated&#34; over my house.  It did apex my location.  It appeared to be a deliberate destination.  This is the most interesting part of the phenomenon.  It appeared mechanical and with purpose.  It appeared that my location was it&#39;s destination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke with my son about it days later.  He related that he just viewed a video from Boston that was about the &#34;rods&#34; phenomenon.  He suggested I look at the same video. I viewed the video and I concluded that this was exactly what I may have witnesses.  I am sharing this only for purposes of facts, surrounding the UFO phenomenon and the &#34;Rods&#34; phenomenon.  These both appear related, at least in my case. I think this is very important to document.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no conclusions to these 2 occurrences, except I do think they are related.  I questioned what I seen, and am 100% sure I seen it.  I know I did see what I described.  I seen it a night or two before, but thought it was birds or maybe it did not happen.  When I seen it this time, I took notice and I knew it was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The key point is, when travelling across my view, it was a blur, then going away from my view, it had mass and was a black dot.  That in itself indicates very strongly that it was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date and time is approximate.<n>

In fact the low frequency throbbing--repeating approximately every one second--seemed to vibrate my entire body.  It was as if I was immersed in a vibrational field that permeated me, as opposed to the sound propagating through the room from one direction or another.  Yet nothing else in the room was apparently vibrating, not even the windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sound was unlike anything I&#39;d ever heard or felt before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found the low-frequency throbbing to be extremely agitating to the point of being intolerable. So I was compelled to get out of bed to locate the source. I&#39;m on the 2nd floor of a 3-story condo unit so I initially thought the sound might be caused by someone in a unit above, below or beside mine -- from WHAT I had no idea. The sound was totally unlike anything I could identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As usual, my bedroom door was closed, having to open it to check things out. But as I walked around the dark condo I could not locate the direction of the source of the sound, which appeared to be uniform in intensity throughout the 2-bedroom, 2-bath condo. The sound did not appear to be coming from any perceivable location -- either outside the condo or inside from adjacent units.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter slept in the middle bedroom with her little dog and, glancing in, I did not see any movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I&#39;m usually of a rather calm, deliberative nature (being a scientist), this low frequency throbbing nevertheless agitated me in a way that is difficult to describe -- more so than, say, from someone using a subwoofer above or below me which can cause the floor or ceiling to resonate. The emotion I felt was not so much from being incensed that someone would make such noise in the middle of the night. Instead it was from the sensation of my body being violated in a bizarre manner. I was having a reaction like I would if I suddenly discovered that I was covered in leaches but wasn&#39;t able to remove any of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unable to locate any likely source of the sound -- which was of constant pitch, intensity and periodicity -- or conjure up a hypothesis as to its bizarre nature -- I reluctantly went back to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must add that when I initially awoke to the sound it was as if I had only slept for a moment -- awaking from a blank, dreamless state. Likewise, I have no idea how long I lingered awake after returning to bed. It was as if someone flipped a switch and suddenly it was morning. This is quite unusual for me when I usually remember multiple dreams every night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Subsequently, I was amazed to discover, upon listening to &#34;Coast-to-Coast&#34; radio at 1:20 AM on May 30th, that another person (in Pryor, Oklahoma) had experienced this same low-frequency throbbing that he said &#34;vibrated through me!&#34;   	--MY DAUGHTER&#39;S EXPERIENCE --  	I didn&#39;t mention anything about this bizarre phenomenon to my daughter that morning, other than asking her why her dog was sleeping in the hallway. That was when she asked me: &#34;Were you standing in my doorway last night?&#34; Puzzled, I replied: &#34;No, why would I do that???&#34; Looking disturbed, she said: &#34;SOMEONE was standing in my doorway last night and it creeped me out!&#34; 	 	Asking her to explain, she said she woke up a few minutes after 2 AM to go to the bathroom, using her cellphone light to navigate. Curiously, her dog was not in bed with her but was instead standing at the end of the hallway, next to my closed bedroom door. She picked him up and carried him back to bed with her, only to have him immediately jump down and nervously pace the room before running out. This highly unusual behavior spooked her, as the dog is a creature of habit, sleeping with her all night, EVERY night during the 2 years we&#39;ve had him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point she perceived a dark presence standing in her doorway -- apparently on the threshold of her perception -- and in a panic she shined her cellphone light at it but it was gone. But when she turned the cellphone light off, she could sense the dark presence lurking there again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Frightened, she turned on her nightstand lamp and again the figure was gone. Eventually she got up to see if maybe I was up and about (and maybe playing a trick on her). She saw that my bedroom door was closed (as usual), but that her dog was now curled up on the hallway floor in front of my door. This is something he only does when my daughter is having a sleep-over with a girlfriend, or when her boyfriend is in watching TV with her and I don&#39;t want the dog in my bedroom. Otherwise, at bedtime, the dog dashes into her bedroom to sleep with her on her bed -- all night long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So that particular night, the dog was acting like there was someone in my daughter&#39;s bedroom! But because the terrier wasn&#39;t barking or hiding under the kitchen table, he was reacting as if the presence were benign -- as he does with my daughter&#39;s friends. At such times he comes into my bedroom to be with me. I must emphasize, the dog will NOT stay in my daughter&#39;s bedroom when ANYONE else is in there (except for me).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter went back to bed, leaving her night-stand light on and barely sleeping all night. But her dog stayed in the hallway, sleeping on the floor, which is where I found him later that morning when I opened my bedroom door to come out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point I asked her if she had heard any sound that night, like a deep throbbing, and she said she didn&#39;t hear anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter was deeply disturbed by what happened that night, and kept asking me if I had played a spooky trick on her or something, hoping I&#39;d say &#34;yes&#34; and admit it. Of course I hadn&#39;t. I had only walked by twice and glanced in once when investigating that horrible pulsating sound, which she would have heard if she were awake. At that time the dog was still in bed with my daughter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The behavior of our dog leads me to believe that my daughter&#39;s experience with the &#34;presence&#34; came AFTER mine (with the throbbing sound). At the time of my experience, the dog was still in bed with my daughter, but during her experience the dog ran out of her room to the end of the hallway, sleeping there until I opened my bedroom door to come out for breakfast. If her experience had come first, when I went to investigate the throbbing sound, I would have found the dog sleeping in the hallway outside my door, which he wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now my daughter doesn&#39;t want to talk about the incident. The story she told is greatly out of character for her because she has no interest if not an outright aversion to such &#34;creepy&#34; things. Recently, in fact, she got quite angry at her boyfriend for taking her to see a horror movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter&#39;s second experience:  	Unfortunately, the story is not over.  The following morning (May 13th) I asked her if she slept well (code for: &#34; Anything unusual happen???&#34;) and she reluctantly admitted she had another &#34;weird&#34; experience.  She said she woke up at almost exactly the same time as the night before (2 AM) and looking through her doorway saw a kaleidoscope of &#34;strobe lights&#34; as if flashing behind a fractured, stained-glass window.  She made a drawing of what she saw (she&#39;s quite a good artist, her room is full of her paintings). This startling phenomenon lasted for only a few brief moments but left a profound impression on her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, her dog had inexplicably left her room to sleep on the hallway floor in front of my closed bedroom door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following and subsequent nights (without exception), the dog was back sleeping in bed with my daughter -- all night long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No, my daughter does not do drugs or drink alcohol or smoke -- it&#39;s contrary to her very reserved, shy, conservative nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a scientist I can only say the phenomena my daughter and I experienced are a great &#34;unknown,&#34; and quite possibly &#34;unworldly&#34; or &#34;other dimensional.&#34;<n>

I thought earthquake, and then realized, no, that was the sound of a huge &#34;jet&#34;.  I have heard this sound on many winter nights during intense storms, multiple times at night (when we usually have no aircraft flight patterns.)  It is intensely loud, like thunder, and very slow (the sound can last maybe seven minutes!) I have always assumed it was jets avoiding storm damage by flying at lower altitudes, combined with some effect of the clouds that increases the sound vibration, length and level of jet propulsion noise.  When I realized this was the same sound, I was very excited to finally see what was causing it! It was a beautiful starry night,cloudless, even warm for our area at 65!  I couldn&#39;t spot anything off the back deck (southfacing), so I headed for the front porch. Headed almost perfectly north was &#34;the jet&#34;.  Only, this jet was made up of four white points o! f light at each of its four corners! Yes, four corners!  These light were steady (not blinking). I have never seen a square 737 before! It was traveling &#34;slowly&#34;, ahh, slower than a commercial plane, at about the cruising height of Cal-star. In it&#39;s center was a pulsating red light that looked perfectly &#34;airplane&#34; like and rhythmic, except of course, that it was pulsing from in the middle of a very large, very slow-moving square.  It was, as I have already mentioned, very, very loud, but in no way similar to the sound of a helicopter which has a &#34;choppy&#34; thunking quality to it. It was not silent, like a drone.  It was deep in tone, steady, and gigantic sounding. It brought to mind aircraft carriers at sea, only flying overhead! It dissappeared at our nearby tree-line, though its sound lingered after I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in the rural pacific north-west, sixteen miles inland from the coast.  There are no other sounds at night out here besides crickets, frogs and the occassional owl.<n>

As I turned the corner and cleared the few trees I saw it had moved, at that time I proceeded to following, to make sure it wasn&#39;t an airplane.  While following it down a long straight connecting road to the next town; now in Dracut MA, I noticed my radio went to static as I got close to it.  At this point I was close enough to see it looked like a very thin cross shape with an orange/amber colored light in the middle.  Once I got that close it would speed up andove to the other side of the street.  Always stayed at the tree line. The closest I got to it looked like the curved disk shape became more prominent and thought I could make out two faint smaller green lights on either side of the middle orange one.  It got faster and finally sped up so much I had to let it go, didn&#39;t want to speed.  Seems like it was heading back toward the direction of the next closes river.  It made no soun! d that I could hear, but many birds were chirping and flying about.  Quite more and louder than usual.  It&#39;s smooth movements from one area to the sky to another was nothing like I&#39;ve seen any aircraft do before; and would slow down, speed up, and hover, from one second to the next.  Exciting stuff!<n>

I looked up in the sky  facing West, and saw this very large ball of light.  By natural instict, I hit him and yelled, &#34;Check it out a shooting star!&#34;  He turned around and missed it.  It fell behind a building in a direction toward downtown toward Lake Erie.  I thought I explained that it wasn&#39;t like a normal shooting star.  It was MASSIVELY Larger.  Another student was on campus by us and he looked at me asking if I saw that thing fall in the guy.  I agreed.  And we just looked at each other and he said, &#34;Do you think it was a UFO?&#34;  I said, it clearly wasn&#39;t a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both discussed and shared Identical description of the falling object.  It looked at if a massive form of light was behind a cloud, it changed colors rapidly from like a lilac, to a turqouise, to a seafoam green sometimes more than one color at once, it was just fluidly multiple colors.  The size was clearly bigger than! any manmade aircraft. It gasous size was probably the size of our sun during the winter sky.  Like the size of one&#39;s thumbnail.  Big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both saw it fall in the same direction, down toward Lake Erie, but it fell behind the large building on campus.  It moved quietly and at a constant speed, the direction appeared though as it was crashing, but it fell being the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I guess it best to sum up we saw:  A large light source much bigger than a man made air craft crashing through the sky covered in a turquoise/violet/seafoam green light.<n>

I thought it was a plane at the first instant, but knew something was off immediately after.  It had slight changes in trajectory.  At one point, I saw some things either break off or drop from it, though the detail was impossible to ascertain due to the sheer luminosity of the object, and how faint the objects falling from it were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for a few minutes, dumbfounded.  My friends couldn&#39;t figure it out either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was strange, is that the sky beforehand did look strange at sunset and moon rise. there seemed to be very distinct lines in the sky that seemed otherworldly, toward the  east.  It was like watching sun rays at dawn, but it was running from north to east.<n>

It was in a stationary position in the sky and oval shaped bright white light in the center, small reddish lights at the bottom surrounded by a transparent sheer light with a definite oval shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disappeared so I drove to the bottom of the hill and saw it again but in a different position.  There was a plane flying low and another higher up  I circled back up the hill and we spotted it again but in a different position to the extreme left of the original sighting again stationary in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We snapped a picture with our phone. The first sighting appeared as a bright white light in the center with a sheer haze around it. The last sighting the haze appeared to have changed color slightly and looked slightly blue I wasn&#39;t sure if I didn&#39;t notice the color the first time or not.<n>

The Moon was 2 days shy of being full yet there was still plenty of stars to see on that clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a couple quick flashes directly under the Moon and quickly came to the conclusion it was a satellite.  Then, I saw the object heading East and knew right away it was moving too fast to be a satellite.  After about 3 seconds, the object shot 90 degrees and suddenly stopped.  I thought to myself, &#34;way too fast to be anything man made yet too slow to be a shooting star or other space garbage.&#34;  Not to mention, it didn&#39;t &#39;burn out&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment, I knew it was not of this world.  The object moved up and down and then headed to a bright star.  I later learned from my phone app, Google Sky Map, the star was Vega located in the constellation Lyra.  I could barely see the object as it seemed to closely orbit Vega.  About three minutes later, the object headed North and I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole sighting was as if I was looking at a dim star/satellite that was moving at different speeds.  All I can think of is how fast that object must have been going to travel the distance it did in such a short period of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, if it was a craft of some kind, how could I see it with the naked eye?  My only conclusion is it travelled through some worm hole?  Maybe it wasn&#39;t a craft but a form of energy?  I am reporting this in hope that someone else saw it too.  Very interested in if anyone has any thoughts on what I saw also.<n>

Sun had set about an hour earlier.  There is a row of townhomes about 12 long, and we are second from end.  We overlook an undeveloped lot which could easily fit two football fields and it is owned by blue collar contractors or landscapers.  There are a few shacks on the lot, occupied, and lots of trucks.  No lights in this lot or for miles off the back deck and during day you can see clear to Shenandoahs because we are situated at the top of a hill.  We had one light on, and candles and no neighbors were out back or had lights on. An object flew quickly over everyone at one point which I didn’t see, and I came out of house and joked that it must have been a bat.  My sister pointed at a white light in the distance and it looked like a plane approaching Dulles Airport.  But it wasn’t approaching, just staying still.  The light turned red or green and the object starte! d moving again.  There was no sound we could detect but it continued to change colors every 30 or 40 seconds and fly in the area off the back deck, staying a good 1,000 feet or more away and then moving but staying within range of this back row of townhomes most of the time.  Flew over us once or twice and circled back and the colors were always either white, red, or green.  This continued for almost 15 minutes and we got nervous that someone was videotaping.  We stopped watching it though and it went away.  No pulsating light or noise, just solid light, hovering, and fast movement.<n>

I pointed out the objects to the other guests.  1 other saw all 4 objects and 2 others saw only 2 objects.  The 4 objects remained stationary, roughly in a line, for a period of time.

The weather conditions was sunny with no overcast in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I was driving around a bend when I came to a clearing which revealed the sky, an unknown object and the horizon.  The first thing I noticed was this bright, silver and extremely shiny, metallic and circular object located mid-horizon straight ahead of myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object could not have been missed even if you lacked all attention.  This object seemed to have been hovering probably in the vicinity of 15,000 feet from the ground and was the size of roughly 3-4 times the circumference of a mid-sized commercial jet.  I would of liked to observe this object longer than I had but unfortunately had to drive out of the objects view and then I noticed as my attention came to, a Massachusetts State Trooper at my rear bumper.  I did observe this unknown bright object enough to know that it was completely immobile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at this object waiting for it to turn to see its profile view in search for wings and or exhaust smoke which failed to show.  I was in awe as I viewed this object and I&#39;m sure the other cars on the highway was too as the traffic was low but yet present.  This object cannot be described as anything but unidentified and as it was airborne/flying I have no issue labeling this anomaly as an Unidentified Flying Object.  I am grateful to have viewed this UFO and would like to see if there are others who have shared this same experienced and will report this.  Anyways, keep your heads up and your eyes wide open.

5/10/14 23:30|Put-In-Bay|OH|Oval||While camping on Put-In Bay I saw a strange blue-green light in the night sky.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109607.html|427|ndxe201405| While camping on Put-In Bay I saw a strange blue-green light in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While camping at South Bass Island State Park, better known as Put-In Bay Island in Northwest Ohio, with my wife, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law we were sitting around the campfire talking.  In truth I had drank three beers over the course of the night; so, yes I had drank alcohol, but no I was far from drunk.  The weather was clear. I was looking eastward while everyone else was looking towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking out and suddenly a blue-green oval light passed out from behind a stand of trees in to a clear patch of sky.  It looked to be about the size of a diner plate from my point of view.  I would say the angle was about 60 degrees.  There was no sound. It moved for a couple seconds and then seemed to disappear as if it was moving fast away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe we have been visited by intelligent life from another planet and it requires evidence to convince me otherwise; however, I do not know what it is I saw.<n>
5/10/14 23:28|Westlake|OH|Oval||Translucent craft with intermittent orange/red light.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109322.html|428|ndxe201405| Translucent craft with intermittent orange/red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident I’m reporting occured at approximately 11:28 pm, Westlake, Ohio, May 10, 2014.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed outside of my window an orange/red circular light approaching, traveling at 30 degrees NE (heading towards Lake Erie, which is about 3 miles from here) somewhat low on the horizon.  It caught my eye because this is not a typical path for planes or other aircraft, plus it was relatively bright. The light had flashing that was uncharacteristic of a plane (growing bright and brighter, then dimming) and at some moments the light would go dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I went outside to get a better look, and suddenly the light (or craft) vanished for about 2 to 3 seconds.  The light reappeared, then we noticed what I can only describe as a small ball of light “falling” off the bigger one, for about one second.  This smaller light was also orange/red and left a slight trail.  After this, again, NO lights at all for about one second.  We lost sight of anything, then suddenly we saw what appeared to be an unlit craft.  It seemed as if, in order, the light was turned off, the craft went invisible, then appeared but was a translucent/opaque whitish colored oval.  It was almost directly overhead at this point, and lower than the altitude of what a plane would be, but definitely higher than the altitude at which a helicopter would travel.  The shape seemed to be an oblong, oval shape that sort of tapered at the front.  My husband describes it as an obscure oval.  It’s hard to estimate how large it was, but if we were able to determine ! a shape, then that alone should give an idea that it was fairly big.  There was absolutely NO noise associated with it, so I can say with certainty this was NOT an airplane or copter.  At the altitude it was traveling, we would have heard engine noise for sure.  I’m not a good judge of speed, but it seemed to be traveling somewhat faster than a commercial plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point it went over my building and I attempted track it by running outside (I’m on the third floor so this took time) but by then, whatever we saw was gone.  Neither my husband nor myself have ever seen any unidentifiable aircraft before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an occasional night skywatcher and I know space weather when I see it, and what we saw was not anything like meteorites or typical space weather at all.<n>

I stepped on my back porch to smoke a cigarette, and noticed an orange sphere in the sky.  I thought why would someone be lighting a flare over a neighborhood, and then the second sphere came into my view and I thought flares don&#39;t move like what I&#39;m seeing.  Then a third object came into view, then a fourth one, and then a  fifth one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was taken back for a minute, because there was no noise of any kind.  The objects moved horizontally without any of them slowing descending as a flare would.  This is when I knew that I was witnessing something that was out of the norm.  All I want to know is what was it.  If any one else has had any similar experiences in Louisiana please make post.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I counted 26 and everyone else counted between 25&amp;30.  They was quiet, liveng in a quiet town and neighborhood, planes can be heard easily.  They had no sound, they was flying in sequence &amp; came in the numbers. I swear I&#39;m not lying.  They came so close to our apartment complex that I was scared of an aerial attack from another country...  But they wasn&#39;t planes.  I seen them up close and it wasn&#39;t like anything I&#39;ve seen before...  I have a crappy video. (Night time) this has occurred three times now.

She and my son-in-law were at the hospital for the birth of their second son.  I went outside to enjoy the stars and moon and give thanks for the events of the day.  I live the city so the night sky here is clear.  Off to the east over Lake Huron (based on the distance), I saw a single flashing light in an oval shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, I thought is was from a small plane but is was hovering and swaying a bit.  I kept watching it to see what it would do, and the--Zoom, it flew to the southwest in a flash  with a trail of light and was gone.  I don&#39;t know how long it was there before I went outside, but I watched it for about five minutes (the time it takes to smoke a cigarette).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am retired from the United States Air Force and had been stationed at Wurtsmith AFB, Oscoda, Michigan, until its closure.  I had heard for years about the existence of UFOs from my colleagues in the Air Force but never experienced it myself until last night.<n>

It was flying low and had no sound so I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane or a helicopter the white lights and red lights were not blinking. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was looking at! It was very strange I live in a very populated area so someone other than myself had to have seen it too.  However, I have not heard or read of any other sightings of this craft for last Saturday evening.<n>

The object came into view to my right (East) and traveled the entire span of the sky at a high rate of speed fading to my left (West).  I have seen many Meteors enter the atmosphere and this was entirely different.  It glowed red/orange and appeared to be burning.<n>

As it quickly came closer it clearly was not a flight of birds or bats not an identifiable bird; and the &#34;W&#34; resemblance was assured, moving with the &#34;W&#34; parallel to the ground and moving toward the two points at the bottom of the W.  No typical banking maneuvers were noticed, meaning the object did bank and/or pitch up, just not with the co-ordination nor symmetry associated with fixed-wing aircraft nor fowl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it neared, still flying erratically, the object looked a muted white even translucent.  The &#34;W&#34; was not with sharp lines/edges, rather more rounded and muted/hazy with visible striations fore to aft along its entirety every 5% or so.  The flying &#34;W&#34; appeared as one unit, no flapping, no noticeable moving parts, no exhaust or trail of any sort, no lights nor glowing and no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object proceeded to nearly overhead the open patio and as I stood up it quickly altered course and went over/behind a 30&#39; tree (which provided perspective &amp; parallax, so I report it at low level).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked over under the tree and observed the object completing a turn back toward the tree. As I walked toward it, it turned away and proceeded back on a zig-zagging northeasterly track.  Observer has seen some very large white owls in Arizona, and this was not that.  If it was organic, nothing distinguished it as such.  Observer had previously observed what were deemed &#34;The Phoenix Lights&#34; on more than one occasion, including during daylight hours.  This &#34;W&#34; is quite unlike those phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer&#39;s background includes many thousand hours of commercial piloting experience.<n>

As I was turning left from the red light out into the road I seen a UFO that looked to be on fire.  It was about 100 feet long and about the and about 20 feet high.  The color was orange, yellow and fire just like when out space ship come in our atmosphere hot.  It looked as tho it was going down jus beyond the tree line.  It seemed like the ship had all control.  I also seemed as it was trying to get down quick.  The ship lit the sky up around it the entire time .It was coming from the south and heading north east.  It was very dark outside at the time and traffic was busy .The flight path was over I-75 (major interstate) that runs between Chattanooga Tn Atlanta Ga. plus about 20 foot along side two large truck stops &#34;Pilot &amp; TA&#34;!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure more people seen it than me because the way everyone slowed down and the way they were driving plus the quick reactions of wonder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I noticed them through my living room window. I am use to lots of air traffic around here so didn&#39;t think to much at first.  Then the orange lights got me and they were not flying in any of the normal flight patterns.  So I went out on my porch to get a better look.  Not an airplane, not a helicopter.  They both were up pretty high but close enough that I could see very clearly that I did not recognize the shape.  I was mostly focused on the orange lights and trying to rack my brain of what aircraft might have those kinds of lights.  There was absolutely no noise.  The craft was silent.  Seemed to be moving along side by side one a tiny bit further back from the other.  I went to get my camera to take a picture, but they were gone when I went back out.  Never seen anything like that before.  Not with orange lights like that.  It was only one bright orange light or a cluster not co! mpletely sure about that.  Just wanted to report what I saw.  No one I know could explain what it might have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I am a teacher and like my privacy I prefer not to give my name at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was looking straight ahead dragging on my cigarette when out of the corner of my eye in the direction of a half moon, light caught my eye, (sky lit up).  I looked up to the half moon and observed 2 basket ball sized objects flying on my side of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were yellow/orange in color. I could not believe my eyes. I jumped off the chair and turned to run into my house to get my girlfriend, who just went to bed.  I stopped and told myself that it couldn&#39;t be.  Let me look again to verify.  I looked again and there they were traveling east.  I estimated the speed and thought I would have a few seconds to get ((girl&#39;s name deleted)).  I wanted her witness an event of a lifetime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran about 20 feet from the porch to the bedroom and yelled get out here! I then ran back to hope it was still there.  They were gone.  I ran down to the driveway to look on the other side of the house,nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I would have stayed now. I was so excited.  The event was so unbelievable. The 2 objects were moving like they were floating effortlessly, but were travelling in an eastward direction at a good speed.  From my sight they were basket ball sized, about 1/4 size of the half moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seem to just appear in that location and were 2 separate objects one behind the other. I made sure I was seeing what I was, by taking that second look.  I first thought when I looked away, that I better check in case I was seeing something not there.  When I saw them again, I was so excited at what I was witnessing.  Unbelievable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was clear in the spot I was looking (south west), with broken clouds to the west.  About 60 degrees.  I can&#39;t help this feeling I had: when planes go by in the sky, they appear to be working hard to maintain flight.  These things were so different.  You get that distinct feeling that they are floating effortlessly, although traveling fast, interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a little embarrassed as, I reported an event that happened in 1988 on May 8, 201, to this website and this happened the next day.  I find that a little odd myself.<n>

They would have been very easy to miss if I hadn’t gone out to specifically look at the night sky.  The brightness of the moon may have made them appear dim also...very bright night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two V formations. One formation of 7 circular looking lights, with an additional V formation at the side of 3 lights. No sound.  Moving probably as fast as a fighter jet?  I really couldn&#39;t tell what their altitude was… It seemed about the attitude of a commercial jet. Moving S/E to N/W.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They disappeared over the tree tops before I could get anyone else to come out of the house to look at them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Just as I got up to get a better look away from the tree, it appeared smaller and dimmer.  Originally it was white and round, the size and brightness of a 1/4th sized full moon, nearly but not quite directly overhead, maybe up 75 degrees looking towards the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A moment later it looked like a dim star in the same spot in the sky, perhaps climbing straight up although the speed would have had to be exceptional.  Then immediately after dimming the object started moving exactly due south at a consistent speed.  I perceived it as being at an extremely high altitude and high rate of speed.  About half a second after I realized it was moving I saw another object identical to the first in fairly close proximity coming from the south and headed the exact opposite direction right by it at the same! speed and apparent altitude as the original object.  Both objects very gradually became dimmer as they moved away in opposite directions and maintained the same heading and velocity until I couldn&#39;t see either anymore.<n>

A green &#34;light-fireball-oval&#34; dropped from above emanating a lime green hue.  This UFO object fell no farther than 50-100 feet from me.  I looked and looked for it but I do not think it even hit the ground.  I figured....shooting star that burnt out just before the ground, or roman candle.<n>

It seemed to be coming from the sky, but I was unable to pinpoint any source, it was coming from everywhere.  It was very reminiscent of sounds I heard growing up by McCord Air Force Base when the planes would test their engines, unlike the planes I couldn’t feel any vibrations, there was just the loud sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was surprised at how well the windows had blocked it as it was very loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not a UFO but I felt it was strange enough to report somewhere.<n>

Two would shoot out to the east and west, while the others moved around near the center.  Then, four seemed to form a square, because it sort of created arched beams of light between them.  They honestly looked like spotlights, only there was no trail of light going from the ground to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I don&#39;t think a person could move one of those giant spotlights that fast.

These were square -or rectangular-shaped objects (irregular) moving clockwise at a medium pace.  Sometimes they would come together and then come apart.  My husband and daughter saw them.  I tried to videotape them, but the sky was too black.<n>

I then look in the same direction, towards I-20 West bound.  We noticed a round orange light that appeared to &#34;fade&#34; on, then got really bright and then &#34;faded&#34; off with several smaller whitish lights around it.  They moved side to side then up and down in a diagonal motion.  After a few seconds the orange light then &#34;faded&#34; back on for a few seconds and back off again.  Still seeing the whitish lights around it, but only for about 15 more seconds and then it was gone, appeared to move off in a westerly direction.  There was no sound during this time, however, just a few seconds after the lights were gone, there was a &#34;humming type noise and the dogs in the area started howling and then all of sudden it was silent.  I reaffirmed with my husband, who is a HUGE skeptic, that he too in fact just witnessed the same thing that I h! ad.<n>

The objects had no lights on but appeared to be a very light brown/tan in color with a subtle glow around each of them.  At first I thought they might be birds- but in the short seconds I caught them flying overhead, I noticed one seemed to disappear then reappear, and I also noticed that one or two of them flipped themselves around once in a circle while still staying in the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the crafts appeared very defined- I was not able to make out a definitive shape, but was able to make out that they were some kind of intricate vessels with lines indicating either beveled edges or some kind of craftsmanship.  I would estimate they were moving at a speed of about 150 miles an hour or more,  It&#39;s hard to estimate exactly but they were moving very fast.  I had dropped my laundry and tried to follow where they were headed- the most I could see was that they were heading south towards Inglewood/South Central.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I pulled out my phone to video it, it was too late and I thought it was a once in a lifetime chance I couldn&#39;t miss a second of.  My phone froze when I got inside and tried to call/message people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later a helicopter flew overhead in the same general direction- there was no way it would&#39;ve been able to catch them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an insurance agent in West LA.<n>

Although there were no reference objects the craft seemed to be flying fairly low though and judging from my perception of the crafts height it&#39;s size, I would guess, was about the size of a shopping center parking lot.  However, high it was it appeared to be larger than my house which is 20x40&#39;.<n>

After appearing to hover in the southeast object moved VERY slowly to the northwest for 2 or 3 minutes until it disappeared behind some large trees, airspeed was far to slow for any winged craft to remain airborne, it passed directly over my house and as far as I could tell it was completely silent.  When it was directly overhead a long triangular shape could be discerned with a large very bright light on each of 2 corners and 2 dimmer thin long lights in the middle between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They were orange.  They were approx. at 2 oclock and were not that far away.  They came on 3 at a time in a horizontal  pattern.  3 then the other 3 and then the other 3, one after another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see they were encased in something  like a light housing.  It&#39;s very hard to describe.  I could see the set of three light sitting in a row.  There was a piece of metal or something above them and below.  I could see no other outline.  They were over the water to the right of DI bridge.  They were bright and there  was no sound.  I slowed down and opened the window thinking it was a helicopter or something.  There were too large to be on a helicopter.  There was NO sound.  Then they were gone.  They did not fly away...they were just gone.<n>

It has been seen in this Brandon, fl area for the last 3 nights. Police helicopters, planes, military fighter planes have all came near the object.  The first night a helicopter or fighter plane got right infront of the ufo and then both crafts went down towards the ground in unison.  Never seen anything like it, if your in the Brandon, Tampa Florida area pay close attention to the sky at night for this &#34;star&#34; looking objects are in the sky as I type this no bs!

Simultaneously, our eyes were drawn to a series of lights over the Gulf water just off shore.  The lights were in a line formation of four and four across.  There were as bright as the headlamps on a truck.  In seconds, the lights went out and a glow appeared overhead and then the lights were gone.  We listened but did not hear anything resembling an aircraft or ultralight.  We stayed outside for approximately 10 minutes but did not see anything else.  This was a very bizarre event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have lived on Dauphin Island for approximately 8 months and have never seen anything like this.<n>

The moon light however,illuminated an oval shaped object that appeared to dip down and dive out of sight.  If I could describe it to anything, it would be the Millineum Falcon.

In photo, a ball shape is seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:30 pm on may 8th, 2014, I walked by my bedroom window and a large white light over the mountains caught my eye.  The mountains are located near lake compounce amusment park.  This area is not near the park and is covered in trees.  The white light looked like a sunset against the dark sky.  It stayed white for over five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my camera to take a picture and then like a light switch the light turned a dark orange.  It stayed the same sunset shape slightly over the mountain.  The light never moved at all, just changed colors.  From my point of view it was the size of a sunset.  The light was very large others must have seen it.  I was afraid it was a forest fire...but the orange light didn&#39;t grow and I didn&#39;t see or smell smoke.  I didn&#39;t hear anything either although I was a few miles away.  The last I saw the light was 9:45 ish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to the window at 10:00pm and a fog rolled in and I couldn&#39;t see the top of the mountain.  My photo is dark I couldn&#39;t see the large round shape, however I lightened the photo and in the center of the light I saw a disk shape floating above the mountain! I didn&#39;t see a disk with my eyes... only in the photo.  It&#39;s not a plane because it did not more once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t hear any reports of fires in those woods.  There is no reason that I&#39;ve found for that light.<n>

I hike the trails several times a week mostly in the evening around sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening I saw what I classify as a blue orb of some kind.  It turned a little red but mostly blue.  What was amazing it was broad daylight not even close to darkness the sun had set in the western sky behind the mountains, so I call it twilight before darkness.  I hike to a small mountain berm directly behind my complex maybe 200 feet at the top of the berm.  The trail starts out east and I reach a ridge line at around 500 feet, then goes north as a switchback to the north east to the back side of the berm.  After reaching the ridge line I have line of site view to the North and east.  I can see distinctive parts of Tempe, Chandler and Mesa in the distance.  I can also see 4 Peaks and Superstition Mountain in the distance 50 miles from those view points.  I have live in the valley since 1980 and the area very well and have flown in and out of Sky Harbor many times.  This blue orb was at least I estimate to be 5-8 miles off in the distance.  I first noticed in my hike when I reached the first ridge line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I hiked higher I was able re verify visually where exactly it appeared to be.  It was not is some remote part of the valley but right over very residential part of cities.  The orb would shoot as high and several hundred feet..with no pattern ..like taking a flash light and just shining on a wall and rolling my wrist as if play with a cat chasing the light on the wall.  The orb could shoot strait up and zoom directly back down to the ground as it was playing with the buildings on the ground.  It turn red sometimes but mostly stay blue.  It would disappear completely for several minutes and re-appear.  My hike from the ridge line to next ridge line was to the North and North easterly direction to the next ridge line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total time it was viewable was maybe 15 minutes.  I witnessed this from approx. 7:20pm to around 7:36pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went on up to the top of the berm and the lighting condition with the sun had changed..darker..the orb was no longer visible at the top.  I am curios to know it other people sited this event also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listen to George Noory Coast to Coast I have heard other reports to the east toward San Tan Valley recently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a good 20 miles to the west of San Tan Valley area/Queen Creek.<n>

Sometimes they would pair up and cross each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were very high up in the sky and at that altitude it is unlikely that jets can move in that formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched as they moved back and forth then slowly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to take a video but it didn&#39;t show them due to the bright sunlight.

As I came around a winding bend, hovering over a housing development was a object that was approximately 500-700 feet away.  I stopped on the road as no one was coming and quickly took a picture through the window of my car.  The shape was that off a stealth or drone and there were multiple lights and colors.  One predominate light, was round and larger that the others and was green.  The other lights were small rectangular lights, yellow, red and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound as a helicopter would project.

They were blinking, flashing and started to go off and on.  Then all lights came back on and stayed on until craft left area.  It was hovering over Mesa, AZ, for about 30 minutes, then the ufo looked to be out of control, in trouble because it went from hovering to vibrating, bouncing, shaking and spinning wildly, it would go up and then down slightly, and then it turned 180 degrees on its side and and started spinning wildly.  It would alternate between being top up and on its side, but always appeared to be out of control, it was at about 40K ft in the sky, and was about 20 miles west of Apache Junction.  It stayed in that area of the sky and w/in a range of about 5 degrees for over an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it was in the erratic stage for about 20 minutes, 3 more ufo&#39;s arrived on the scene, 2 were the same size as the one in trouble and the other one was a smaller one, the smaller craft flew up under the troubled ufo and then disappeared inside of it, the smaller ufo remained inside the troubled ufo for about 10 minutes, and never exited the craft.  Then all four ufo&#39;s left the visible sky.  Just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On May 8, 2014, at about 8:30 p.m. a ufo with the same description as the one in trouble on May 7, 2014, was hovering in the same area of the sky, and a second ufo joined it, after about 10 minutes, they both left flying east.  They flew at @ 40 ft and had about 10 miles or so space between the two crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter and grandson both saw this activity.

I noticed as I waited for them to come back into clear view, that they seem to be disappearing.. .When they did come back into an unobstructed view, there was only one light or object, which soon began to fade away and was gone...I had taken noticed that there were a few wispy high clouds here and there, but I checked for stars in the general area and could see stars...<n> <n><n> <n><n> For decades, on clear nights just after sunset, I&#39;ve looked for satellites in the sky, these were not even close… There was no sound of helicopters, no sound of prop or jet engines...No sound at all, no flashing lights...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did come back again from time to time to check to see if any more could be seen, and nothing was...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw, I just don&#39;t know what it was I saw...It&#39;s my hopes that maybe someone else may have seen it, or that there&#39;s an explanation for what I witnessed...<n>

It was moving very slowly, and much, much lower than an airplane. It was completely silent.  It was flickering an orange-red color, like a flame, but not in any flashing pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it went above me, it reminded me somewhat of a jellyfish, like a ball with a light inside.

There was no noise and they appeared to burn out after about a minute.  About ten minutes later two more appeared and in less than a minute burned out.  I have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents had seen something similar when they visited the panhandle before about two years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

5/7/14 18:25|Calimesa|CA||5 seconds|Rocket sound wooshes past me at a tremendous speed only about 5 ft off the ground.|5/8/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109257.html|504|ndxe201405| Rocket sound wooshes past me at a tremendous speed only about 5 ft off the ground<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:25 pm I was just finishing washing my car.  I had pressure nozzle on the hose for a strong stream of water.  I heard something but I thought it was probably the nozzle making the noise.  Something caught the corner of my eye and jerked my head to the left which was north in direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned of the water and the noise was still there but I couldn&#39;t see anything.  The sound was like a rocket going a tremendous speed but low to the grow.  I looked for an object and I saw the neighbor that lives across the street from me about 50 ft away from me coming from the north.  By the sound of this thing I thought it was going to hit her and I started to shout out to her, but before I could she stopped suddenly jerked her head to the right and stepped back.  The sound waS TRAVELING WEST TO EAST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She yelled over to me and asked if I had seen anything, I told her I wasn&#39;t sure but that I certainly heard it.  She said what was it and where did it go?  She said that she though! t it was going to hit her and she hurried up her driveway and into the house.  I stood there shaking like a leaf.  The whole thing had happened in approximately 5 seconds and it was gone.  At the sppeed it was going it should have hit the house across the street or the neighbor standing in the street.  In a distance of 60 ft the sound stopped and whatever it was was gone.  It is the strangest thing I have ever seen or heard of and I wasn&#39;t sure who I should report it to, but I was so frightened by the event I had to report it to someone.  I haven&#39;t talked to the neighbor today but the way she hurried to get back in her house, I knew she was upset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every word I have typed is true .<n>

I looked around me in the sky and sure enough in the eastern sky was a black dot but I thought it was a bird.  So I continued dunking and the feeling persisted.  But simultaneously dog started going crazy in our neighborhood.  I was really creeped out so I look around and the oval wasn&#39;t in the same spot it was right above me in a haze( like steam coming off the road on a hot summer day)!  My sister was watching.  We were unable to move, in awe.  It then shot over to the northwestern sky at immeasurable speed.  And that&#39;s when we started capturing pictures.  We took two of them.  It then shot out clouds of smoke, we tried to take pictures but the camera died even though it had full percent because we charged it for my basketball dunking shoot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then diasppeared at the snap of a finger, just like that!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever since the sighting I&#39;ve been really scared to go back out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

With nowhere really else to report what I experienced, I thought at least I could submit it to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The morning of May 7th, around 5:45am atlantic time, I am slowly awaking from sleep for no apparent reason.  I am laying in bed listening to this overwhelming sound coming from outside, it&#39;s a steady low rumbling hum sound that does not change in tonality it remains constant.  This part is a bit ridiculous, but before I was fully awake and had all of my senses, I remember feeling this great sense of comfort and peace and warmth for no reason but I was attributing it to the sound, like the sound was making me feel relaxed and loved...becoming more awake, and noticing the sound didn&#39;t disappear or fade out, a thought popped into my head &#34;that&#39;s a spaceship&#34;....now fully awake, with the sound still as constant and loud, my boyfriend rises up from bed and says &#34;thats a spaceship!&#34;....at this point, I lost the feeling of love and warmth and actually started to become scared, this whole topic of ufos and aliens is frightening to me and I don&#39;t take it lightly....my boyfriend&#39;s acknowledgement of the sound brought the whole experience more into reality and I guess it made me feel scared.  I would not let my boyfriend go outside to investigate I was that scared....though he did look out the windows to the skies and saw nothing. No plane, no jet, no helicopter, no street sweepers or garbage trucks, though the sound was nothing like any of those.  The closest to it I guess would be a rocket or a jet but it would mean it would have to be hovering over our apartment building for 10 mins and not passing over.  The sound was very present, like it was right above us, and very constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten minutes of pacing and peeping out windows it went away slowly....then came back three minutes later and stayed another three minutes then passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported the incident to my municipality&#39;s Facebook page, and then another local news Facebook page. Surprisingly, my post received 80 comments before the admins deleted it (without explanation), and at least a dozen other people had replied that they heard it too, some were outside looking for its source and saw nothing in the skies.  One was as far away from me as Quebec, but she heard it and described it the same as me.  Others were within the tri-city area and another about 60 km away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For what its worth, I grew up 15 mins drive from loring airforce base in Maine, and I am well aware of normal sounds of jet engines flying low over or engines revving up or idling.  I have had people suggest to me maybe it was a street sweeper and in desperation for an answer I checked the block around me that morning and nothing had been swept.  And that still wouldn&#39;t explain the woman in Quebec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In case this matters, I have studied UFOs and aliens a bit, the topic has always interested me and I have in the past seen things I can&#39;t explain.  I&#39;m also aware that UFOs are almost always silent and rarely reported to have a noise.  This could have been military somehow, I don&#39;t doubt thats possible, but my initial intuition and feeling was it was an extraterrestrial spacecraft hovering over my apartment building.<n>

I stopped looking for 1-2 minutes, then came back and took another look and saw that it was no longer at its original location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked farther west and picked it back up again, only smaller and harder to see.

It was only a small orange dot in the sky but it was flying faster than any plane I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few nights later I downloaded the sky map app from the android app store to see which way they were going, if the planets don&#39;t change position a lot over a few days then that means they were headed to neptune.<n>

It was up as high as their 3rd story/pitched attic near the corner of Greenwood and St. Elmo.  It fell or moved downward. Approximately 1 foot or smaller diameter.  I was sitting in our yard with my husband around 10:30 p.m. facing towards their yard.  Unfortunately he was facing the other direction.  I walked over to the edge of our yard afterwards and checked out their yard for a bit.  No one was out there, no bon fire, nothing.  Was excited I got to see it.  Unsure where it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Previously at around the age of 10 or so (1992) witnessed a white glowing orb 1 foot in diameter.  It &#34;pulled up&#34; to my passenger side window as we were driving down the highway and it followed along side us for a few moments.  This was on highway 44 near where the old gas reservoirs used to be near Maplewood and Shrewsberry.  My mother was driving and also witnessed it.<n>

It was in the shape on a boomerang. and for it to go across the sky to a disappearing point, took about 10 seconds.  I personally thought it was a person hand ((sic.  Hang.)) gliding.  But nah!!!

It was approximately 8-9 PM. While traveling my brother whom was driving asked, &#34;do you guys see that, what&#39;s that light&#34;?  On the left side of the hills about a mile away was this massive orange, reddish almost circular light.  We couldn&#39;t take our eyes off of it.  The light was immensely bright and looked to be hovering very low.  A helicopter or plane was a suggestion but the lack of noise, light color, and also lack of movement were all wrong.  My nephew suggested a tower of some sort.  Seconds later the light looked as though it shifted into almost a sliver and quickly vanished to a tiny dim light and suddenly gone.  Nowhere in sight. Moments later it reappeared. This time it looked like it was descending but very slowly.  The light was so bright that there was an almost transparent beam going thru some of the few clouds that were above it, and again, seconds later it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we started to travel around the hills. I was trying to look and turn to scope out the hills, but saw nothing. I looked in my review mirror and there it was.  At that very moment my brother was also looking in his mirrors and spotted it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we moved around a curve we lost sight of the light and saw nothing more.<n>

I heard about your website from Coast to Coast AM, in fact I’m a Coast Insider and a podcast of Coast was playing on my radio during this event! I had just finished my shift at 8:00 pm and was on my way home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 8:08 pm I saw a bright red light to my left.  I was heading north on a two-lane road so the object was in the west in the fading light after sunset.  It appeared to be slightly larger than a full moon would appear.  It was low in the sky just above the outline of the horizon still visible in the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object’s overall color was bright red.  (When I say red I mean fire engine red!)   However, there were three “hot spots” that were sort of pink, sort of purple in color.  These spots were not symmetrical on the object but were concentrated in the lower right quadrant of the object.  There appear to have been some lines or some structure radiating from the upper left down to the hot spots.  On a clock face, the lines appeared to come from about the 11:00 position down to the hot spots at the 3:30, 4:30, and 5:30 positions.  The object as well as the hot spots did not have clean edges; the edge! s were jagged as a spot of bright light appears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was travelling north about 50 mph, and as I was passing through a large pasture area I noticed it out my left hand window.  It takes about 30-40 seconds to traverse this pasture and I was surprised to suddenly notice the object about mid-way through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to drive while trying to observe the object.  It was in view for about 15-20 seconds before trees on the roadside blocked my view.  It did not seem to be moving relative to me, so this gave me the illusion that it was far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I expected to see it again at the next break in the trees, however I did not.  It was either very close to the road (i.e. about to land in the pasture!) or it disappeared.  There was other traffic on the road so I did not turn around and go back.  (I should have..)<n>

Almost like a scribble in the sky.  It clearly had a ball point on the front in which was a hint brighter than its trail it was leaving behind..  In the trail it looked like there were lighter ball points in the sharp turn areas of the trail.  It only lasted for like a second, but after I searched on the internet today to see if anyone else had seen something like this, I found that a few Hawaii places reported seeing a zig zig light in the sky appear for a few minutes… I watched the video and that is exactly what the thing in the sky I seen looked like that day except I seen this in Virginia a late night and it only lasted for a second or 2..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date of 5/6/14 is a rough estimate of the day it occurred because I cant remember the exact date.  But I will say that It at lease 5 days before my birthday ( may 14) because I had to get a rental to go see family at the top of the week and when I ran into my friend a couple days after I arrived at my relatives, I mentioned it to him and he said &#34; o yeah, that just n exploding star&#34; in which I didn&#39;t pay any mind to it nor did I check the internet to see if anyone else had seen it the day after I saw it..<n> <n><n> <n><n> What a wonderful experience, I wonder what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Fog like but solid, almost transparent.  First two objects were as ovals, rapid moving like a flash light beam in the air, moving extremely fast.  Tonight&#39;s object was moving from N to S same flight path (but opposite direction), but larger chevron image..no sounds at either sightings, clear night with stars....it wasn&#39;t moving as fast as the oval flash light beams, but appeared to float so smoothly at great speed.  No air craft in the air, no beacon lights fairly dark star lite night...resembled ghost as see in TV programs almost transparent, but yet you could tell they were solid objects...moving very fast..a blink of an eye, you would miss them....<n>

My neighbors were also outside at the same time as me and approached me asking if I saw the thing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They told me there were two at first, but when I got outside there was only one. It was a very bright light that was changing colors.  It would change from red to blue to green and would move up, down, left, right, in circles, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movements were unlike any aircraft&#39;s movements I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they went inside, I stayed outside watching the sky, and after a few minutes after it disappeared, I saw a bright flash on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed a lot of planes flying in the direction towards the flashing light.<n>

Initially I thought it was a helicopter or low flying plane but it was one single light.  I work with aviation as a aircraft technician also so I knew this wasn&#39;t normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got  concerned when I noticed it was not moving at all nor was there a trail of sound  for the distance it was away, if it were a plane etc. there would be sound of engine or propellers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 seconds later a second light appeared parallel to the first.  They remained in the sky for well over 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another employee with me also witnessed it and neither of us could make sense of it.  I thoughtt maybe a tower had gotten put up recently that I has not seen but the first orb began to slowly rise upward until it was adjacent to the second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They then burned out at  the exact same time  like someone let gas out of a lantern slowly.  I saw no sign of them afterwards.<n>

Faint clouds covered up the travel path and the object was nowhere to be seen.  Was not blinking like an airplane and would not have vanished after cloud cover.  If it was a star then it would have still been visible after cloud passed.  Moved slower than a shooting star but faster than an airplane. Had to have lasted no longer than 10-30 seconds.<n>

We live in a rural area.  I was looking for satellites when I observed a Ligjt flashing on and of aprromately a second and a half apart of each flash, altitude equivalent satellite altitude traveling through th shy at a very high rate of speed, faster than jet liners. In our area, we have north and south flight plans for commercial airliners on a regularly basis.  These airliners are easy visible to see strobes, port and starboard side lights and other running light.  The Ligjt that I observes was as bright as some of the visible planets, ie Jupiter, urianis, etc. like a very bright start.  The odd thing was the slow off and on duration off the object flashing, approximately a second, to two seconds in variation.  The flashing was slower that any other air raft I have seen, commercial, or military.  I watched the flashing Light move through the sky at the approxi! mate speed, or faster than satilites do.  It was traveling from the northland moving south.  I watched it for approxately five minutes before I lost it through the trees down range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went in the house to tell my wife about it.  About five minutes later, we both came back outside talking about it, I was looking up for satilites when she was looking south and said,&#34;  Is That It ?&#34;.  I looked south and yes, there it was moving from the south, to the west.  I looked at my wife and said , see that&#39;s what I saw earlier. She then said look, it moving  north now.  Without a arch, type turn, the Light just went from moving south, to immediately, moving north, still satilites altitude, high rate of speed, coming north back in our direction.  There was no noise, when the airliners fly over us at 30, 40 feet, one can hear them.  This flashing lite, no noise like satilites.  We tracked from the south, to the north, for almost 10 minutes before we posted in the trees to the north.  I have seem many satilites before, this appeared brighter a! nd flash ing, vs. the satilites being somewhat bright, about the same speed, but this seemed a little faster in speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed this same light a few Nights later, but lost it sooner due to light high cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen a lot of aircraft in my 55 years, but this did not show any carachteristics of an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope your organization can give am an explanation of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You for your time<n>

While looking at the sky I saw what fist appeared to be a single cloud in an otherwise clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that the object was moving too fast to be a cloud and had a distinctive triangle shape with rounded corners. It appeared to be about 300 feet off the ground and flew directly over me.  When it was directly overhead I could see three semi-spheres on the bottom that were emitting a very dull orange light.  As it flew farther away I lost sight of it when it flew over a street light.<n>

My perception was skewed.  Also, I tried to take a picture with my phone and it just said &#34;photo cannot open.&#34;  I popped my head back in the car window to put my phone back in my purse and get another look at the object but when I looked again it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not decipher what the actual shape of the craft was as it was completely dark out but it had 4 lights in a diamond formation.

Charlotte N.C., May 5th, 2014.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am submitting this report because I feel that people should know what my adult daughter (28 years old) and I went through.  After over three weeks later we are still upset and still not our usual selves.  I guess we are both still in shock and we are not sure what to do about it. It’s hard because we only really have each other to talk to about it and my daughter is still having stomach problems and just wants to forget what we saw.  I can’t get it out of my mind.  I am still scared. I still can’t believe that it happened at all.  But, I know it did! We know it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On May 5th, 2014, around 8:30-8:45 PM, we were driving through Charlotte, NC, on the Southbound side of I- 77.  I noticed a really bright light off to the right of us up in the sky.<n> <n><n> This huge thing was just floating there in the sky.  It was no plane.  It was silent.  My daughter was driving and I was in the passenger seat.  I just kept asking, “What is that?”  Her reply was that it was a plane because it had blinking lights.  It did have blinking lights but they were pretty insignificant compared to the huge bright white string of lights that seemed to be at the front of this thing.  The smaller lights looked like they were on top of it. One to each side of the center.  The white lights were very large.  I couldn’t see past the lights to see what shape the object was.  We were kind of arguing about what it could or could not be. I grabbed my cell and took some photos.  I actually caught two pictures of the lights and I also turned on my cell’s video to try and catch it that way.  I caught it on video too but it is very small and all you can see is a white light off in the distance.  It’s pretty shaky.  I’m not sure if I can pull it in to see it better or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove through Charlotte on 77 we came to an area where there are street lights right next to the highway.  Tall orange/yellow street lights.  I could no longer see the object because the street lights were so bright.  All of a sudden a huge round ball of solid bright white light came right at the windshield.  Out of nowhere! It took up most of the windshield and she drives a four door Toyota Corolla.  When it came for the windshield I braced myself for impact. But it didn’t hit the car.  It just kind of seemed as though it evaporated into it.   At that moment my daughter was driving over 70 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I sat there dazed, I was thinking that one of the street lights must’ve fallen on the car but there was no sound at all and I was having a hard time trying to grasp what had just happened.  I hadn’t said a word to my daughter about the light when she asked me, “What was that light?”  I was like, “You saw that too?”  Then I told her “I don’t know what that was!”   That scared us pretty badly.  Her stomach started to hurt really bad and she was nauseous and my stomach was hurting too.  It seemed to just take all of my daughter’s energy away. She started feeling really bad.  Not only did this light scare the crap out of us but it “STUNNED” us.  We were actually dazed by it.  We don’t know where the ball of light came from, but we didn’t see it again.  We both remember actually feeling it on the skin of our faces and upper arms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember that I looked in the side mirror a few moments later and nothing was there.   A little while later a huge helicopter flew right over and in front of our car. It was so close that we could see the two greenish/blue light domes stuck underneath it and a tiny little blue light on top of it, under the blades.  It was a huge helicopter and it was very loud. Because of the blue light I thought it must be police or military. All in all we saw the chopper three times or three different choppers. They were circling the area where we were. So, we couldn’t have been the only ones who witnessed the object. Not sure if anyone saw the round light that came after us. I did notice that the helicopters didn’t actually seem to approach the white lights that were still in the sky. They just circled around the interstate. The last time I saw one of these helicopters was when we were leaving the Charlotte area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we cleared the street lights we could still see the lights in the sky were still there. Then the road turned so that the object ended up behind us. I was determined to get some pictures of it so we took the next exit so that we could see it from on top of the over pass. Well, the next exit didn’t go up to an overpass. It angled down. We ended up surrounded by trees and buildings. So, we couldn’t see it anymore. We were going to go to the next exit to see if it had an actual overpass where we would be able to see it again and that’s when my husband called. It was 9:08 PM. I frantically told him all about the lights in the sky and the ball of light that came at us and about the helicopter. I wasn’t paying any attention to my daughter who was still driving until she said, “Mom, I don’t feel good!”  That’s when I noticed she was driving about 85 mph and she told me that she couldn’t stay awake. I told her to slow down. I got off of the phone.  She told me that she had been nodding off and that she couldn’t drive anymore.  We had eaten in Huntersville and we left at dusk.  I’d say a little after 8:00 PM, she was full of energy.  Our trip to where she lives was only 3 ½ hours away from Huntersville and she was fine.  She was fine until the white ball of light came at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told her to pull off of the interstate so that she could rest and that I would drive the rest of the way.  The exit we took had a Denny’s so we went in there. This Denny’s is located in Rock Hill, S.C.  As soon as we walked in, we realized it was freezing.  So, we reluctantly walked back outside to the car and opened the trunk to get our jackets.  Everything in the trunk was hot. Even the metal of my camera’s tripod was hot to the touch.  Our jackets were toasty as though we had just pulled them out of the drier.  That was when we started to worry about radiation.  Worried about where that ball of light might’ve come from. Everything being so hot really shook us up all over again. (We don’t know where to go to have something like that checked out. Who do you call to see if your car or you have been exposed to radiation? If anyone out there knows; please get the information to me.) When we went back inside we sat down and ordered coffee. We sat there trying to rationalize what had happened. She was still nauseous so she decided to get something to eat hoping she would feel better. I didn’t eat. My stomach felt bad and I had no appetite at all. Strange thing is that the clock on her cell and the register receipt didn’t match. The receipt said we left there at 10:05 and my daughter had gotten a call from her husband while we were at the table and the time read 10:46. That would mean that by her cell we left there after 11:00 PM. I know we weren’t sitting there for that long. I called the Denny’s last week and spoke to a manager to see of the register’s time was off. But, it was accurate. I can’t explain the difference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I could say that our experience ended there. But, it didn’t. We got into the car and I drove back to I-77.  After I had been driving a little while, I spotted the lights again. We couldn’t believe it!  They were over to the right of the interstate, just like before.  (When we had left the restaurant I made sure that we got my video camera and Cannon camera out of the trunk.)  So, I told my daughter to grab it to film the object, so she did. I couldn’t help her with it because I was driving.  As she opened the view finder she tried to focus on the object when it seemed to come straight towards our car! She just said “ It can see us, it’s looking at us!” She said the white lights went out and now there was a line of red lights under it. Then it flew over the car. It went from the front passenger side to the rear driver side and then across the street. By this time it was moving very slowly and low. The whole thing turned slowly like it was facing our car while staying in the! same spot. She is so scared and at this time I can’t see it. She can, because she is looking over the seat through the window behind me. I pull the car off to the right side of the slow lane. Strangely there is no traffic except for us. Now, I can see it! As we watch this thing together; it started changing shape. I ask you, how does something just change shape? The fact that it was in the air is what scared me! We could see what looked like metal beams drop down from I guess inside of this thing and it looked like they were interlocking. The beams looked like 2 x4s but seemed to be made of metal. It was changing shape right in front of us. We could clearly see it because it was right there and the red lights illuminated it. It’s outer shape was starting to look like some sort of a triangle. That’s when I put the car back into drive, hit the gas and took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I need to say this now; my daughter doesn’t own and has never used a video camera. (Except for one time when I was recording something and handed it over to her to use.)She thought that just because the view finder lights up and the screen is showing what you are pointing at that what you see is being recorded. She never hit the little red button. Later when we realized this we were crushed. I do not blame my daughter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, here is where I made the worst decision of my life. At this time we are in South Carolina and are between Rock Hills and Columbia. As before, I wanted to see more of the object so since it was behind us I started to look for an overpass again so that we could sit up high and maybe my daughter could get some more footage of this thing. When I took the overpass to the right, stopped at the stop sign then headed left onto the bridge/over pass as we looked at the trees in front of us there was a large glowing hovering bright creamy white object that was about 50 feet wide if not more. I don’t know if it was the same object we had just seen but if it was it had changed color and shape again and was chasing us and waiting for us. As soon as I saw it I slammed on the brakes. I remember hearing the sand and gravel crunch under the tires as I skidded to a stop. I had driven all the way across the bridge and was sitting in the middle of the road on painted lines that showed that ! the lanes were separate. We were in shock. It was at tree level and we could see the outline of the tops of the trees on both sides of the road. I could see that the road we were on went in between those trees and looked like it headed off to the right. There were no lights anywhere on or around this overpass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were just sitting there, stunned.  Staring at that bright light. When my daughter said, “You aren’t going near that thing? Are you?” I told her no. But, as I realized later; I still wasn’t leaving either. I can’t explain that. I was terrified but I wasn’t leaving. I don’t know how long we sat there. I think it was just a few minutes. Then we were hit with headlights from the right side of us. Someone had taken the exit from North bound side and had pulled up to the stop sign facing right at our car. That snapped me out of it. I took my foot off of the brake and swerved to the right and around to the left to make a u turn in the street and headed for the ramp back to I-77 South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am ashamed to say that we did nothing to alert the other car. We have no idea if these people saw it or not. All I know is that the object was still there when I took my u turn. I never looked back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once back on the interstate I drove for quite some time when finally I just had to pull off. By this time it was after midnight. I took a well lit exit and saw a Wendy’s but it was only open for drive through. All of the gas stations were closed. All the while I’m checking the skies. So, I got back on I-77 and looked for another exit. That’s when I saw a Shell station sign and took that exit. It was on the left side so we had to go over the overpass. We could tell it was closed as soon as we came over the overpass. All of the parking lot lights were on but it was closed. I was in pain because my bladder was hurting now. I pulled partially into the entrance of the Shell station and then made a u turn. As I completed the u turn we saw a guard rail right in front of us. At the very end of the guard rail as we were swinging around we saw something  standing there. I couldn’t take my eyes off of it. It was right next to the road. Right next to the door of the car. It seemed to be! bristling. Like it was luminescent in some way, but it was really darkly colored like it was camouflaged. I actually thought it was someone dressed up in that camouflage netting stuff when it moved towards the glass right next to my daughter. She put her hands and arms up over her face and head and tucked her head downwards. That is how close that thing was to her door. I honestly thought it may have been a poacher until I could make out the shape of it. I could see a larger than normal rounded top of a head then it came down to a short little neck area then straight out to both sides to shoulders. (Human shoulders aren’t shaped that way.) Then it’s arms dropped straight down.  The thing that made me realize that it wasn’t human was mostly that it’s waist was only like 8 inches wide and that it was about maybe 4 feet tall.  I could see from the top of it’s head to its hip area through her window.  I remember thinking “It’s so skinny!” Next thing I know we are past it and my  daughter is asking me, “Was that a person?”  I remember looking  back over my right shoulder through the window behind her and still seeing the thing.  It was moving and I had never been so terrified in my entire life.  My daughter said that she didn’t look at it but then moments later she said that it was really thin.  I remember asking her how do you know that if you didn’t look at it?  She still can’t answer that question, but is adamant about not looking at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and she assures us that the report is sincere.  She will have her daughter submit a supplementary report.  The mother has offered to send two photos she asserts she took of the object(s).  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I somehow find the ramp back to the interstate and just drive. Finally, I spot what looks like a truck stop. I know they are open 24/7. As we take the exit there are semi’s parked to the right side of the exit. As I passed them I could see that it was open and now I had a place to use the rest room.  Even after seeing that thing I had to use the bathroom so I just had to stop.  Once I was finished inside I came back outside to the car.  We sat there for a couple of moments trying to absorb what we had just seen. I didn’t know what time it was then and just got back on the road.  My daughter had to get back home that night because there was no one home to take her three dogs outside to the bathroom.  That is the reason we hadn’t stopped and gotten a hotel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving I ran into construction three separate times where signs with arrows pointed us over to the slow lane and the speed limit was only 45.  After the third road maintenance/construction site I had had it.  I told my daughter that I just couldn’t take it anymore.  I had to pull off and get a hotel.  Two exits later we found hotels and stopped for the night.  It was 2:00 AM.  The hotel was in Orangeburg, SC.  We were so shook up that we didn’t get to sleep until 5:00 AM.  We turned all of the lights on in the room and bathroom. We jumped at every little sound.  Even sounds the little refrigerator made.  I woke up at 6:00 AM and realized that we had fallen asleep.  We were both sitting up leaning on pillows stacked up against the headboards.  I finally turned off the room lights when the sun came up enough to light the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just can’t get the image of the creepy little thing out of my mind.  Even right now, I can still clearly see it in my mind.  Every time I get the same feeling of outright fear.  We think we were still being followed.  Then again, maybe this creature was separate.  We don’t know. I do guess that the larger lights that we saw were not what we saw change shape.  That object was much, much smaller.  So was the glowing light we saw at that over pass. We are still afraid. Writing this down has taken me all day long.  It’s still very upsetting. We don’t understand why it chose us.  Was it that we were taking too much interest?  Again, that would be totally my fault.  At points during all of this she was begging me to get far away from what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All in all it took us four hours to get 1 hour and 43 minutes away.  The time it usually takes to drive from Rock Hill to Orangeburg.  We got off of the road a couple of times but still feel that we are missing time somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can you tell me where people who have witnessed a UFO go when they want to speak out loud to someone about what they saw? Do people ever get answers to what happened? It took me about 7 hours to physically write down all of what happened that night. It was very hard to have to keep reliving it so that I could write it down. My daughter and I went over it a hundred times while I was still at her house but now it&#39;s like pulling teeth to get her to talk about any of it. She feels that we never should have been there. Never should have seen what we saw and that we shouldn&#39;t tell anyone. She doesn&#39;t understand why I feel the need to let people know what happened to us. What we witnessed I think it&#39;s important! All of it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to know what that ball of light was!  Did it leave radiation in/on her car? What happened to my left ear?  Why is there a &#34;New&#34; bump behind my right ear and why does my daughter have one in the same area? Why were my triglycerides through the roof when my blood was tested 7 days after May 5th? They were so high that my doctor called me at home to give me the results. I remember that I was asked by the tech&#39; when my blood was drawn if I was on any blood thinners when he drew my blood. I am not!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still very scared at night.  If I have to go outside for something alone at night now, It takes everything I have not to fly into a panic and run when I see any lights moving in the sky.  What if it knows where I am or worse, where my daughter is?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please, accept my apology for being so rude in my reply to your email before.  I have not been myself lately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

It flashes from red to blue, sometimes a greenish and yellow color.  The first time I witnessed it, it was a very intense blue and red.  I noticed that it would randomly seem as though it just &#39;went out&#39;.  Also I noticed that it was not stationary.  It would move up , above the pine trees in my neighbors yard.  My brother, and my boyfriend were on the porch with me as well.  They really did not pay it any attention.  They just glanced up and chalked to up to be a dying star or something.  About three days ago I was sitting on my porch smoking a cigarette, when I saw it again this time it was moving to the right.  I was watching it for about 2-3 minutes when it literally shot straight up and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today is my 22nd birthday so my boyfriend and I stayed up basically all night.  This time he actually noticed it and saw how it was not only flashing but it was moving.  He seemed utte! rly shocked at what he was witnessing.  We watched the object for at least 45 minutes.  Also I dark markings on my toes that are not coming off.  It looks like brake dust or something it is really odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight I am going to start documenting this events.<n>

I got my phone out and recorded about a minute of it.  We pulled away passing them and a fourth one appeared behind by itself.  They were weird looking and other people in cars next to us were also looking and taking pictures.  I thought that they were Chinese lanterns maybe, but these things were flying pretty low and they were not Chinese lanterns.  I only say that because of the pulsating and they way they were flying the same direction sometimes even lining up.<n>

Both were distinctly different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up at the sky as I walked and chatted with my girlfriend, on the phone.  That&#39;s when I noticed the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright, red light moving north to south, in the western sky, as it flew erratically.  It zig-zagged from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m unsure of its distance or altitude.  Even this objects speed was unimpressive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was its course correction that made me stand in amazement.  It moved from east to west without slowing down.  It didn&#39;t circle like a normal aircraft.  It just changed course without even coming to a stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point it seemed to come to a dead stop.  Then it continued south as its light faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t lose sight of it.  I continued to maintain a clear look of the object and the sky.  It just faded away, like it simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2nd incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch the sky, as I chatted on the phone, about 2 minutes later a second light/object appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t expecting it and only saw it for a second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved from east to west and it was VERY FAST AND VERY BRIGHT!  The light was white. It was low in the sky, probably a mile or just over and it didn&#39;t make any noise.  Neither did it leave a trail of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t quite as fast as a shooting star but MUCH faster than ANY aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen.  Nothing we have could have caught up to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before It disappeared behind the buildings the light simply went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never witnessed anything like it.  They were just incredible. Absolutely amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me close by saying I&#39;ve never gone out at night hoping to witness a sighting.

Traveling slow then gradually gained speed until we lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend was walking me out to my car and saw a weird looking animal on the ground that looked to be a bunny.  While I was looking for this animal I noticed these bright lights in the sky that kind of looked like headlights but it was flying very low and very slow.  I decided to follow it and it gradually became faster and we lost it.  We were on our way back to his house and we saw it again but this time it was lower and looked to be landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started following it until it became so low we lost it behind the trees in between Waterloo and Marshall wi.  The object was triangle shaped with three lights on the back and two headlights on the front.  My boyfriend says he saw two poles sticking up on the back of it.  While I was chasing it my car kept stalling while I was pressing the gas, and my car never does that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we got back to his house we saw about 7 to 10 bunnies just chasing one another around the street.<n>

At this point we drive a little further and damn near end up right under it.  It is literally hovering right behind the store.  That&#39;s when I noticed it was a triangle sitting still pulsating a bright red light and emitting no sound.  It then suddenly changed shape or cut off its red light.  Then looked like sparkling bright diamonds in patterns of three.  Then it just took off slow at first then all of a sudden it was fading into the horizon.  I also tried to take a picture of it on a phone with full battery, it suddenly had no charge.  Not my first ufo experience but definitely a strange one.<n>

A few seconds later the object came back into sight and begins hovering low over a subdivision.  At that time I was about 100 yards away from this triangular object.  I came to a complete stop to get a good look.  It was the size of a truck hood, white in color and had three rectangular lights on the bottom of it.  The lights were Ultra Violet blue.  Just as I was about to take a photo with my IPhone, it flew out of sight at a very high rate of speed.  The car in front of me fled before I had a chance to discuss the sighting.<n>

I was actually afraid I walk in the mornings to work like really early mornings like 4 or 5 in the morning I have been working at a new store in the area.  But anyways this one was quite strange I been seeing these sightings on and off during the past 3 months but Sundays sighting was the worst.  I seen it when I was leaving for work behind my apartment building in Raintree apartments.  Then as I was walking out of my complex I  seen it go towards the old Winn Dixie plaza flying silently in the sky.  I always cross the street right between Cagan Crossings, Wal-Mart and the Chilis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went down hovering between the Fairwinds Credit Union and Starbucks I crossed the street right before the bank…I was freaked out  it was like 50 ft from me and  it was like 20 feet across and very orangy bright. I couldn’t really tell if it was a disc or sphere shaped I saw a lot of lights it takes me usually 20 - 30 minutes to get to work so as I was getting closer, It then went towards the Wal-Mart n then  as I was walking to my work it went up by the Verizon store but it was higher in the air and  then went back towards the Kentucky Fried Chicken and the heavily wooded area and hovered there until sunrise and went back in the atmosphere...I don’t know if all these sightings are connected to the one 8 months ago in October but this one takes the cake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope I wasn’t the only one seeing it because of how low it was to the ground in the area where there are always cars going by.<n>

It didn&#39;t appear to move for 20-30 seconds after we noted it.  The object then began to descend and alternated a couple of times between green and red light.  The object appeared to float in an unusual hover pattern and then randomly moved (very quickly horizontally before returning to its ascending and descending pattern.  The light would periodically switch from red-green and then to white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object climbed and descended a range of  20-30 degrees on our horizon at an indeterminate distance, but at least several miles away.  It appeared to be the ‘type’ of maneuvering a helicopter might make, however we have never seen a helicopter appear to move in that manner.  It was almost floating and then would go straight up/straight down very slow, then very fast.  Sideways also.  It finally disappeared below the horizon.<n>

However, the pattern which it follow was very odd as it was basically curving back and forth, essentially an S or Wave shaped flight path that would, to my knowledge, be impossible for any current manned flight or air traffic common to my area as the back and forth pattern was too tight to be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled across the sky for roughly a minute before fading out, starting near the northern most star in the big dipper (as per the sky in my area) following a roughly south, to south south west pattern.<n>

I have been watching the sky&#39;s for some time hoping to see something unexplained like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching aircraft come and go from this busy region, this object stood out because it was a solid red light that never blinked.  No other lights were on the craft.  This object flew a straight path from southwest to northwest, leaving sight after 10 to 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was prepared with a new pair of 7x35 binoculars and was able to view the craft well.  The object was bright red and had a halo effect around it, however this may have been an anomaly because it seemed to be ascending slightly as it traveled northeast out of the valley through a low thin cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The altitude of this craft appeared to be  2000 to 3000 feet.  It made no sound and appeared that the red glow was at the rear of the object and it would shift and from side to side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every craft I see here has solid lights and blinking lights.  I can see in great detail with binoculars even at night.  It left no exhaust trail and was certainly something very different than aircraft.  No wing outlines and it resembled a spherical shape of glowing bright red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though the craft flew straight, suggesting a fast moving plane, it&#39;s behavior was not of any plane I have watched.  A rocket, weather balloon, meteor or helicopter would not act like this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was happy to finally see something unexplained in our sky&#39;s after months of trying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live near Area 51 and a large airforce base.  I suspect they had something to do with the object, which was very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD))<n>

I&#39;ve seen it every couple days so far.  Sometimes days back to back.  It slowly rises in the night sky, wiggling it&#39;s way up, very fast jerky movements. I zoomed in with the camera last night and it took on multiple colours, primarily a silvery/blue colour, seemed to change colours often up close, very flashy looking.  The shape looked like a shell at times, it seemed to move around so quickly that the shape changed frequently, from a teardrop to a shell shape with bright blue beaming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, I saw a fire like thing shoot out from the side, just the one time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, last night, I stayed up later around an hour and noticed 2 more appear in the sky but in a different location, and they slowly moved together, spaced apart, up into the sky...again very quick twitching movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, while video taping it last night outside my cats growled at me...they never do that…<n>

I am unsure if any of the other staff left on-site saw the object.  While walking to my truck, I noticed what appeared to be a large &#34;fire colored&#34; object coming over the hill next to me through the tree tops.  At first I was quite concerned that it was a large piece of burning paper floating up from a campfire from the nearby campground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I soon realized that it was traveling too straight of a line, and too steady of a speed to be campfire debris.  As it cleared the tree tops and came into plain sight, I could see that it appeared to be oval or disc shaped, only turned on its side, with what would be the top of your &#34;typical flying saucer&#34; being the leading portion of the craft.  I could plainly see the back of the craft, as it! appeared to be only 800-900 ft in altitude.  With my arm fully extended outward in front of me, and my hand in the shape of an &#34;L&#34;, the object easily took up 2/3 of the space between the end of my thumb and the curve up to my pointer finger. It was very large, very low and made no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The back fire orange glowing part of the craft looked similar to the bottom of a mushroom, with a round ball like center with lines going outward to the outer edge.  Similar to looking at a stopped turbine of a jet engine.  This feature was as large as the craft itself.  It was low enough and bright enough, that the refraction of the light behind it from the heat coming off of it could be seen, almost like it was emitting a very hot exhaust.  The craft continued to travel SSE at a very steady pace until it was out of view.  The craft passed directly overhead and was in plain, clear sight for well over 40 seconds.  Having turned my phone off due to no cell signal and not w! anting to waste battery life, I was unable to take any picture! s with m y phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time it powered back up, the craft was gone.  I am still very unsure about what I saw and after spending 2 weeks researching what it possibly could have been, I am unable come up with any reasonable explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personal background:  I am a 36yo college educated, electronics and sound engineer. Despite being at a music festival, I was not under the influence of any alcohol or narcotics of any kind.<n>

Once they began moving in contrast to the other stars is when they became an interest, as they seemed to become larger and smaller and moved in a triangular area in the sky.   It was assumed they were possibly paper lanterns or something similar, but when a high lumen flashlight was aimed on one, it got continually smaller until it disappeared.   The flash light was then aimed at the second light which also quickly shrank and disappeared.<n>

Moore Rd. off of the Borough Rd. in rural Pender County.  It was a dazzling sight to behold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately stopped the car and got out and watched it come closer as the wife stayed put in the car unsettled and quite vocal that I left the car parked in the road near a curve.  I then returned back to the car to turn off the ignition in order to listen for any sounds but it made no noise at all as it passed over with it&#39;s brilliantly displayed bright lights.  The wife however was still quite vocal about me being parked in the highway as she got out of the car and continued observing the startling craft..<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very odd sighting.  I&#39;ve never encountered this color of lights on any flying craft.  The wife and I watched it just fizzle out in about a minute and a half of seeing it in flight not far to our right.  I was not able to run down the road to look beyond the line of pines where it seemed to just evaporate just above them as I had to remove our parked car from off of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened right when daylight was fleeting fast as it got dark within a few minutes after it left.<n>

I am an Air Traffic Control Specialist with the Federal Aviation Administration at the Roanoke Regional Airport and also a veteran who served in the US Navy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw three bright fiery orange lights from the northwest direction of my home; the objects appeared to be equal in size and traveling together in a triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The surface wind was mostly calm possibly variable less than three knots, and sky conditions were clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were approximately 3 to 4 times the size of the brightest star in view.  Each light appeared to belong to a specific object and they seemed to move independently from one another, but in the same fashion remaining in a close proximity to one another in which reminded me of military aircraft in a formation flight.  The light from each object was a constant; it didn’t pulse or st! robe of any sort.  It didn’t change in color or appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects didn’t seem to make any sound.  The town was mostly quiet and I did not hear any aircraft engines, or rotary noises.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects appeared to be moving southeast direction when I first saw them and were approaching the town of Iron Gate.  The objects appeared to have lateral and vertical control like an aircraft.  The spacing between each object varied and they appeared to not travel in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the objects approached the west side of Iron Gate they turned toward the southwest one at a time and seemed to climb in altitude above the mountainous terrain west of the town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As to the speed of the objects, the only relation I can use is that of aircraft in the vicinity of an airport being tracked by air traffic radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I speculate the objects at the time I witnessed appeared to be traveling less than +/- 150 knots.  As the objects turned southwest, I lost visual contact due to terrain.<n>

The object flew directly over a large group of people and disappeared over a store into the night sky, but was silent and lasted about 3 seconds.  The only people who saw it happened to be looking up at the sky at that moment.  It was very low, much lower than planes/aircraft usually fly and was completely silent.<n>

The object was about the same size and brightness as a small star, only it was orange/red in color and was not blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first picked it up inthe area of  the star Alphekka and watch as it moved to the star Procyon.  The speed was about the same as most satellites that I observe and the intensty about equal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a satellite or reflection from a craft this color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several aircraft below this object with normal blinking running lights to compair to, so I would have to say that it was not a regular aircraft, although I have never seen a drone at night and I don&#39;t know what type of lighting they would display, plus the speed makes me thing it was a &#34;Red&#34; satellite.<n>

At first I thought they were the tops of radio or cell phone towers, which surprised me as I had never seen lights there before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still travelling, I turned and went across a long bridge on Old US 421 across the Yadkin River.  I then could see three total lights heading approximately North to Pfafftown/King.  I pulled over to take a photo with my iPhone 4 and made a phone call while I watched till they vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were all three identical in size, color, and shape from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Orange in color and flickering slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved together in what appeared to be a triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The apparent magnitude would be similar to a meteor entering the atmosphere, bright and OBVIOUS in the sky compared to the stars. You couldn&#39;t help but look at them. The angular diameter was that of maybe a low flying aircraft light at night. Again, much larger than a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three moved in sequence, at what appeared a slow velocity, in the same direction.  I got out of my truck and heard no noise (I was listening for engine or propeller sounds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was almost impossible to gauge the altitude, but if I could guess, maybe 14,000 feet.  There were sporadic high altostratus clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a former US Marine, full time city firefighter, and hold a Bachelor&#39;s degree in physics.<n>

Dog started barking and running towards fence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looked toward eastern sky and initially saw an extremly very bright orange, steady, spherical shaped light moving steadily from the south headed north-northeast and then immediately noticed a second, third and fourth identical bright orange light all moving above the back lot tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sky was clear with good visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were spaced apart fairly evenly in a horizontal trail configuration.  Objects were moving fairly slowly.  Estimate possibly ¼ mile between each light.  Hard to determine distance from myself, but possibly within one mile.  Altitude was medium, possibly 5,000&#39;, but difficult to determine due to lack of perspective or sky contrast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four objects were identical and displayed no navigation lights, position lights, anti-collision lights, wing lights, or landing lights that are standard aircraft lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no sound associated with these objects prior, during or after their passage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around the nearby houses to see if anyone was outside seeing what I was witnessing, but saw no one else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing for maybe 15-20 seconds, I ran inside to grab binoculars.  Returning to the back yard, I was able to observe the fourth object for about 10 seconds before it moved out of sight beyond the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the binoculars I observed a very bright, clear orange glowing light and I could faintly make out a dark angular object associated with the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not military fighter aircraft afterburners either.  I live in the vicinity of an F-22 US Air Force Base and these were not F-22s or any other fighter aircraft.  There is also a nearby US Army base with helicopters.  These were definitely not helicopters of any type either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a retired US Air Force pilot and I know what aircraft look like at night and am very familiar with the sights and! sounds of local aircraft at night.  In fact, as I viewed the fourth object, an MD-80 type commercial airliner flew over my house from front to back (from west to east) at low altitude in the direction of the four orange lights.  I believe the airliner was entering the traffic pattern at the local airport preparing to land.  The lights and sound of this aircraft provided an excellent contrast with the four objects that I&#39;d just observed.<n>

Observed a number of what I would say are standard satellite crossings in the sky.  Some small, very faint, some bright, and seen by the naked eye.  These are very common sightings in the sky on a nightly basis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looked away from the goggles to speak to my wife, who was inside the house, to not let the cat out.  Upon looking throughout the goggles again, spotted a group of three dim lights, ( triangle in form) moving very quickly across my field of view, heading from the east, to the southwest.  I was looking south at the time.  It was very clearly three lights moving in a triangle formation.  At first , steady, as if it were a flat object flying level, and then the lights moved in relation to each other as if it banked to the side, and then, just before disappearing behind the small pepper tree in my yard, the lights started moving apart! from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very disappointed that  the tree cut off any more viewing of what these objects did. I estimate the time that I saw all of this is about 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a sky watcher for many years and have attended a number of UFO conferences to boot.  My house is directly over the flight path to Lindberg Airport and enjoy watching all the various types of aircraft that come here.  From helicopters to blimps to all the various planes and jets that move, including satellites that criss cross the night sky  and  the occasional pass of the space Station.  After all these years, I have finally seen with my own eyes, what I have only read about from other people experiences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a profound ….Wow.

Then it just disappeared from view.  It did not fly away, it just disappeared.  There was no sound.  Neither of us have ever seen anything like this.<n>

I came to a red light on Miltary Highway and Shary Road.  I saw something flash in the sky and at first I thought it could be a rain storm with some lightening.  But there were few clouds in the sky.  I continued to look up and saw two triangular objects that had a haze around them.  They were both flying in the sky back and forth within a small area.  No rhyme or reason to the movement.  One seemed to be following the other.  I watched for about five minutes.  Sometimes it looked like the haze was a soft green.  Other times just a white foggy color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the gas station to pick up donuts.  I got back in my truck and as I was pulling out again I thought this is just TOO strange.  I looked up again and they were still there. I decided to pull out my phone and take a picture.  They were moving so fast and I didn’t think I was getting any pictures, so I kept deleting them.  I realized I needed to be at my location so I snapped a few more photos and left.  The house I was going to is not even a mile away.  When I got out of my truck, I tried to take a few more pictures and then went inside.  I explained to my friend and her 15 year old son what I had seen and asked them to come outside with me to see if it was my imagination or if they could also see it.  They came outside and could clearly see what I was seeing.  We watched for a few minutes and then went inside.  We went back out a few minutes later and they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we went back inside I mentioned that I tried to take photos and the boy, suggested I look at my phone again.  So I did.  The screen is dark and you can barely see little dots of light.  When you enlarged it you could see much more.  So we scrolled through the few pictures I took and each one looks so different from the other.  Even the little spots of light you can see without enlarging does not resemble what I was looking at with the naked eye nor does the enlarged pictures.  When I try to text it or email it doesn’t come through that well at all.  Also if I go in a dark room and enlarge the pictures it’s even more vivid.  The pictures I will email to you are ones I have enlarged on my screen and photo saved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is so strange to me, I have never seen anything similar to this and I am very perplexed.<n>

I was facing south about 1km from the Rockhampton QLD CBD.  Directly in front of me about 2-3 km away I noticed a dark (black) shape moving through the sky.  It was triangular and insubstantial, more like a shadow than an object.  It was approximately 100m above the buildings and was approximately the size of a city block 120m wide and 100 long at the point of the triangle.   I could see the stars through the object which seemed to shimmer like a heat haze behind it.  It was totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object travelled in a shallow arc from directly ahead towards my location.  It passed by about 50m away (the other side of a four lane road) to my left.  I lost sight of the object due to the roof of the verandah above my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It travelled low in the sky no more than 200m high and travelled the distance in less than 1 minute although it appeared to be travelling very slowly.  Intermittently it separated into three separate smaller triangles with dull whitish, yellowish lights which switched places but still within the outline of the larger triangle shape.  It had reformed into one large triangle (still shadowy) when it passed over head to my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have time to get my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my third UFO sighting and is the only one that caused me to feel fear due to its proximity, its trajectory, size, and shadowy nature.<n>

The sound had a pulsing nature that is different from normal aircraft engine sounds.  The loud sound had a steady rumble sound pulsed with a wooooOOO  wooooOOO wooooOOO sound.  I went out in the backyard but couldn’t see anything due to the trees, so I quickly went to the front yard, and then to the end of the driveway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking straight up, I saw 5 white strobe lights almost at zenith.  The lights were in a line formation pointing toward the southwest from directly overhead.  The strobes were synchronized so that they flashed in the direction of travel for the group.  The last strobe in the line would flash, followed by the one in front of it, then the one I front of it, etc.  The light were in almost a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called to my bride to bring me a cell phone so I could take a video, but when she came out, she had called 911 and was talking to the operator.  So unfortunately, no photo or videos were taken. I am not sure how well the cell phone would work on this type of situation, with small flashes in a dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the group travel to the south west, for about 6 minutes, until we lost sight of them low in the southwest near the horizon.  The pulsing sound continued but faded as the group traveled further away.  The linear formation broke down as the group got near the horizon.  The group traveled at a constant rate of speed.  I estimated they were about 3000 feet off the ground.  The sky had high clouds and was hazy.  There was a sky glow due to the surrounding urban setting, but no moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the sound, these craft could not be helicopters.  I have heard various helicopters from the large military two rotor machines to the very small traffic helicopters, and they all have the characteristic chopping sound.  The pulsing sound is not characteristic of either prop or jet aircraft.  There was no connecting structure between the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Because of the several suspect reports that were submitted at about the same time this report was submitted to our Center, we initially labelled it as a possible hoax.

We were in bed watching TV when my wife asked me to check, looking out the window in a nw direction I noticed a series of lights which appeared to be in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought the first few lights might be part of a few planes following each other in formation.  But after seeing the 5 and 6 light I asked my wife to follow me she needed to see this.  I ran downstairs and went into the back yard (I couldn’t go out front I was in my underwear).  When I was out back I noticed the lights headed towards Lewisville.  It was several miles long and all of the lights were on when the lights began to turn on and off randomly.  There were about 60 perhaps 100 lights that seemed to be in a straight line in a tight formation.  I couldn’t make out a shape, depth or height as the lights were partly obscured by clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights began to alternate off and on they suddenly turned off.  Then they appeared again to our left several miles away and in a straight line but in a vertical pattern instead of horizontal.  The lights moved down towards the horizon when it looked like it might touch down the lights began to flash white and red this time.  Then all of the lights turned off and about 5 seconds later we saw red lights in the form a triangle pattern just to the right of where the horizontal line had been.  The lights flashed off and on in red and possibly yellow for 1 or 2 minutes then stopped.  We waited about 10 – 15 minutes then went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards my wife noticed aircraft going in the same direction of the lights.<n>

I then observed while driving a shadow that was covering the bottom half of the sliver (crescent shape) of the moon hence separating the bottom half from the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived at my destination, the moon was back to a normal sliver and I assumed it was just an obstruction in my line of sight while I had been driving, however I decided to stay and observe the moon to see if maybe my eyes were not playing tricks on me.  Low and behold, they were not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking at the moon, I saw the same type of obstruction. I can try to describe it logically as much as I can, but the best way I can describe it was this: It looked very similar to the shadow of a hand covering the moon.  Not conducive with any other eclipse pattern I have ever heard of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As of 10:38pm central time, it is still covered.  Cloud coverage is not an explanation.  I observed the dark side of the moon until it was completely covered, and even now I can still see 100 percent visibility all around the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was not a cloud; it was most definitely a shadow covering the moon.   I had 2 of my friends tell me that they observed the change as well; one actually called me to see if I had seen it because he said it freaked him out; unlike anything he had seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an extremely skeptical man when it comes to the supernatural.

They were flashing in sequence from top to bottom vertically and the lights were bright enough that I could not see the craft.  I realized from the lights that this craft was in my back yard.

I then thought it might be a police helicopter, because of the presence of red and blue lights and the fact that it wasn&#39;t moving, but again, it was so high and so far away,  I&#39;ve never seen a helicopter that high up before.  If it was a police helicopter, it was extremely high and definitely over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch from my apartment balcony for approximately 45 minutes. The only movement from the light was that it very, very slowly traveled down toward the horizon.  I only noticed this movement because I could tell that it was in a different position relative to the top of an electric pole than when I first started watching it.  This is also how I could tell that it wasn&#39;t a star, because none of the other stars in the sky had moved that much since I had begun watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I filmed it on my small digital camera that I have. It&#39;s very poor quality, but you can plainly see that the object is flashing red and blue (and maybe other colors too).  I notice that you don&#39;t have an option to send video, so I&#39;ve uploaded my poor quality video here:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://youtu.be/haWsy8exV24  (I removed audio because I was on the phone while filming).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, it was glimmering or glinting as well as flashing red and blue, sort of from one side of the object to the other, while maintaining a consistent bright white light as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to say that I saw it slightly wiggle around or move slightly in its immediate area, but that could have been my eyes playing tricks on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it until it went behind the hill that was blocking my view, and I&#39;m not sure how much longer it was there for after that.  I&#39;ve done some research online and can&#39;t find anyone else who had seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

It vibrated so much, I could feel it in my body.  I looked up and there were seven or eight blinking lights overhead, moving very slowly from east to west.  It appeared as if they were all attached to some supermassive object flying overhead, though I could not see what they were attached to.  There were no signs of a craft emitting the lights at all.  No contrails or jet-stream.  There was another aircraft moving in the opposite direction that appeared to be at the same altitude based on the size of the lights, but it was clearly visible with a very visible jet-stream. I tried to get a video, but that failed, so I ran to get the other occupants of my house.  They came outside and watched it with me.  It disappeared approximately eight minutes after I first saw it.  Did not sound at all like helicopters or any plane I have ever heard.  I lived next to an Army Airfield for 12 years and never heard anything remotely resembling that sound.  The lights were bright white and tiny.  It almost looked like sparkling fireworks, but the light was more intense than that.  The lights never got closer or farther away from each other.  I thought maybe it was the Idefix and Ariane 42B satellite but I looked that up on a tracker and it was not due to pass over until 10pm EST.

We got home around 8:30 and my husband had taken our dogs out.  He called for me to come outside and look at something and when I looked up toward the mountains behind our house (which is a deserted land trust and state park), I saw a straight line of 5-7 slowly blinking lights with vague colors of red and blue.  The line seemed at least 2 to 3 football fields long and moved at a constant steady speed.  We could not see any other shape but the perfect straight flashing line of lights.  It moved in a direct southern direction until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I have never seen anything like this before and are both fairly common sense people but we are very sure of what we saw.

I have always have had a interest in UFOs and Area 51 and other stuff.  Never thought anything serious of it until May 1st.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came home from a day at school and I thought I’d look at some sightings and go into chat rooms about UFOs like I usually would do on a normal day.  I looked at sightings for about an hour, got bored, and moved on to talk to others who are interested in UFOs.  Usually I get a lot of pranks and people who are just trying to joke, but every now and then I receive a legit person who shares info with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On May 1st, I encountered a man who was very interested in UFOs and had a lot of information that most people never shared or even had opinions about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said things like there are these “people” who try to quiet him and he refuses and is spreading the word that he has “come in contact with a UFO”, and never had a chance to grab his camera, but he could describe it like he was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He started to explain the object to me, he said it had blinding, bright lights and moved in incredible different ways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before he could go further, my computer glitched, but I was still in the chat, however, he had stopped typing. I thought it was just bad connection but then a stranger came in the room and these exact words appeared on my screen, “Do not speak of what this man said. This conversation didn’t happen.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed like a threat, I thought it was some dumb prank, but then, all my tabs and links I had pulled up were immediately shut down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what became of this man but ever since that day, I have no doubt in my mind someone or something didn&#39;t want me to know about the object this man had seen.  Since then, I&#39;ve been looking for a place to share my story.  All I know is whatever he saw, it must of been something that we were not supposed to know about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have know idea why he chose a live chat to tell me this, and I have know idea if anyone else knows, but this is my experience.<n>

We observed these lights from I-64 shoulder with multiple other individuals.  As many as a dozen cars and semi trucks were pulled over observing the lights moving S to N in pattern.  They were observed to move uniformly south to north and one by one disappeared.  The manner in which they disappeared was not uniform nor did they disappear over the horizon or over any natural feature.  This event in our observation lasted appx 5 min.  The objects appeared to be a couple thousand feet in elevation before disappearing.  There was no visible smoke or exhaust or sound associated with the observation.<n>

We walked up and down the beach strolling the baby and when we got back, I sat on the towel under an umbrella and thought it would be cute to have a photo of their daughter in the foreground, with the grandparents walking with her older son.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first frame I took with my phone in portrait mode. I decided to flip to landscape mode for the next two shots. I didn&#39;t see anything in the frame when I took the shot, and there weren&#39;t any kites or balls flying through the air. The beach was not very crowded on a Thursday (May 1st).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I left Santa Cruz, drove to my next stop (Napa) and while I was getting fuel, I thought I’d review the photos I took in Santa Cruz. That’s when I noticed the sphere in the sky. I saw nothing like it that day at the beach, so I assume it is some anomaly with my digital software. Even so, I feel compelled to share the photo, because it is just too strange! I’m hoping you can debunk it or have an explanation that makes sense.<n>

Similar in sound and intensity to a flock of sparrows but in a much higher pitch and no birds were able to be seen.  The chittering noise originated easterly and moved westerly without any visual of origin.  Sky was clear with exception of a single wispy cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds after the noise stopped, a cluster of lights appeared in the direction that the chittering appeared to travel.  There were approximately eight of them.  They were moving only slightly west, with a speed similar to a low flying jet, but in erratic patterns.  Crossing over one another in what looked to be a random squiggly pattern.  In about 2 seconds, they blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were about as bright as a large shooting star, but no trails following their movement.  White balls, steady light, no flickering or auras.  Two passed through a wispy cloud and seemed to cut through the cloud.  No noise was heard at the time of their sighting.  They didn’t fade, but just stopped existing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than 2 minutes later, something was seen shooting across the sky above the tree-line.  If the ground was zero and zenith is 90 degrees, craft was approximately 45 degrees above zero.  It moved east to west and was on the ocean side of Frisco.  Either a very dim light, light colored craft, or light reflecting off craft was the only reason it was noticeable.  Moved with the speed of a falling star, yet moved horizontally above the tree-line.  No sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Military training is known to be done on this end of the island, but friends in the military claim no maneuvers were scheduled and none that would replicate what was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One observer claimed to have seen them with their family on several occasions in their 3 years residing on the island.  This was the first experience for the other observer in the 6 years of their residing on the island.  No intoxication of any level for either party member.  Both are logical individuals with college education and skeptical of unexplained events.<n>
