The light was bright and round but wider in the center traveling in an S like pattern and then suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared faster than a typical airplane and the sudden change of direction is inconsistent with a small meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day was a cold, clear with no rain, early morning still semi dark with a clear view of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object would have been over the water on the south shore of Long Island.<n>
