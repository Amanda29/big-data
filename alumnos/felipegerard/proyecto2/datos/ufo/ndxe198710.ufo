My niece had just been transported there a day after she was born.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on Highway 65 North almost to Omaha, AR.  It was a nice night and I had my sun roof open.  I was watching the traffic when I noticed that the traffic was slowing down.  I was asking my mom if she could see the reason for the traffic slowing down?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I can&#39;t really remember who said, &#34;Look at that flying over the mountain!&#34;  We were just in &#34;awe&#34; of what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, the traffic coming and going from the state line had come to a complete stop!  An airship, dark gray in color, shape like a triangle, was flying over the mountain with a white light from the center as if it was scanning the country side, searching for something.  It was like 3 football fields wide as well as long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was flying above us very slowly, there was NO noise coming from it.  We were amazed as we were looking at it thru th! e sunroof.  My mom was commenting on how low it was flying.  It was solid!  It looked too amazing to be true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light that was searching the mountain &amp; field turned off right before the light got to the highway.  We sat there just watching it.  There was NO noise at all when it flew over us!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everybody just sat there &amp; watched it until it flew out of sight!<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night will forever be ingrained in us!  We believe!:)<n>
10/30/87 22:00|Pleasant Hill|CA|Sphere|3 minutes|Close Encounter With Low-Flying Glowing Orange Orb|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101441.html|2|ndxe198710| Close Encounter With Low-Flying Glowing Orange Orb<n> <n><n> <n><n> In late October of 1987 at approximately 10 pm I was walking alone to a market in a shopping center very near to my apartment in Pleasant Hill CA.  This was a very quiet, tree-lined, residential neighborhood consisting of mainly condominiums and apartments. That evening I did not hear nor see anyone on the street. I was walking along the sidewalk when quite unexpectedly, I noticed a glowing orange rounded object floating in mid air at an altitude of approximately 8 feet over the sidewalk, approximately 25 feet in front of me. I don&#39;t remember seeing from what direction the object came, I just remember it appearing there.  I continued to walk toward it as it slowly sailed horizontally in the air. It was floating very slowly, and I was able to walk up to it and observe it at a distance of 2-3 feet. The object at one point lost altitude and hovered at about at eye level. Now, it may have been floating in my direction from the moment I saw it, I don&#39;t recall ex! actly, I only remember that it floated just past the right side edge of the sidewalk over a patch of ice plant.  The size of the object was about 12 inches in diameter;  however, it was not perfectly spherical as the contour of the object appeared to fluctuate (slightly undulating)  I find it strange that my memory remains a bit weak concerning what happened next, and I have no recollection of events for the rest of the evening, but I believe that the glowing ball eventually drifted to the ground across from my feet and shrank in size (a bit like a dying flame) until it disappeared upon a patch of ice plant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought that the glowing orb was a balloon with some kind of orange fire inside of it. I though that perhaps there were some kids nearby playing a trick on me. As the object came very close I realized that it wasn&#39;t a balloon. There seemed to be some kind of changing/moving luminescent source coming from within it.  I could not explain what I was seeing AT ALL. There were no kids around, and no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I strongly remember thinking to myself that I had just witnessed something  supernatural and that I should not tell anybody about it. In fact, I did not tell anybody about it for many, many years. I was eighteen years old at the time. Characterizing the experience as a supernatural event was the only way I could explain it, yet my gut sense told me it was some kind of natural/geological phenomenon, perhaps simply because it was so real. I was a part-time freshman in college at the time, and had not yet taken any physics or chemistry classes that would have improved my observation skills or at least increased my frame of reference. Looking back, I think that what I witnessed was a ball of plasma (ionized gas).  I recently related the story of my experience to a professor of physics at my local community college. He was of the opinion that what I witnessed was a rare (and controversial) phenomenon known as ball lightening. A professor of chemistry at the same institution, a! fter hearing about my experience, theoretically rejected and argued against the very existence of ball lightening and offered no scientific explanation for the phenomenon I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I fell asleep about 8:30 and was awakened by a bright light in my room.  At first I thought I had overslept and it was full day but when I woke I realized the light was gone, I looked out the window thinking someone was in the yard putting a flashlight to windows (I lived in a 4plex that was empty except for my unit).  No sign of anyone, then I thought maybe a car had gone down the dirt road behind the complex, but there was nothing.  I was ready to go back to sleep when I saw that it was almost a full moon.  While I was admiring the moon I saw a &#39;star&#39; move from one side of the moon to another, then it was joined by two more.  The three moved together to another part of the sky, then were joined by 6 more.  They did geometric formations, pyramids, triangles, then light shot between them for a few seconds.  Then all but one zipped off.  The one came close and got big, it looked like a sphere with lights stobing around the middle, but I could have imagined that.  It might have been a disk or just a circle of stobing lights.  No way to tell.  It hovered a while and suddenly the lights went dark for a second, then they came back on and a beam of light shot down to the ground.  It was bright white and seemed to have a spiral of brighter light in it (some kind of movement).  It stayed on for a few seconds, went off then on again.  then it went off and the lights left.  There was no sound the whole time.  I looked at the clock and it was 9:00pm.  I remember it fairly well because I wrote it down.  What was weird is that I was usually exhausted because of work and kids and too much to do to ever get enough sleep and I felt like I had a full nights restful sleep.  The next day I called the police and sheriff to see if a helicopter had been in the area or if anyone else had seen anything.  Neither department owned a helicopter and said the military did not have one in the area.  No one had reported seeing any lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The Wednesday before Halloween was October 28.  We have corrected the date above.  PD))<n>

My husband spotted three reddish orange objects in the sky.  I took a quick glance and said &#34;That&#39;s just a light tower.&#34; When I looked closer I realized this was like nothing I&#39;d ever seen.  The objects were rising slowly in a triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One quickly disappeared into the sky.  The other two were still visible, and I kept watching them until I could no longer see them.  The objects were not blinking like an airplane would.  They appeared almost like orange reddish balls with a translucent outer glow.  What a cool thing to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, neither of us drink!  A one hundred percent sober sighting.  I am still in shock regarding the sighting.<n>
10/26/87 00:00|Fort Wayne|IN|Unknown|8 minutes|UFOs seen in Ft. Wayne Indiana and in Dayton Ohio on the same night in 1987|7/8/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37987.html|6|ndxe198710| UFOs seen in Ft. Wayne Indiana and in Dayton Ohio on the same night in 1987<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working on a master&#39;s degree in music ((deleted)) at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  I was going home to Dayton, Ohio for the week-end so it was probably a Friday. I am not sure of the date-it was cold outside and I think in late fall when this occurred.  I wish I had written down the date. I had traveled the same route at least 50 times since I was married and tried to get back to Dayton every other week-end.  I was coming out of Ft. Wayne around midnight on Rt. 30 (33?).  There is a long stretch there where there is a McDonalds.  Up ahead of me I saw a huge bright white light that was about the height of lights at a football stadium.  I wondered what it could be since I had never seen it before traveling this route.  It came closer and closer moving slowly.  I pulled off of the road into the McDonald&#39;s parking lot and got out of my van and stood watching it.  It appeared to be very large with the white light on the front and it had a green, a red and a purple light on the body of it.  It was large and flew slow and silently.  I know this sounds weird but I could not make out the shape of the craft even as close as I was to it.  I could only see the lights and from the spacing of the lights I knew it was very large.  It flew slowly towards Ft. Wayne and then disappeared out of sight.  I looked all the way back to Dayton that night hoping to see another but did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I owned a Book Store in Dayton called Aragon Bookshop.  I went with my husband the next day to work in the store.  Around noon a woman came into the bookstore and asked excitedly if we had a UFO section of books.  I said yes and got up to show her where the books were.  I asked her if she was interested in UFOs and she said &#34;not until last night.&#34;  I asked her what had sparked her interested the night before.  She said that her and a friend had seen a lot of UFO&#39;s late at night.  She said that they were driving near Wright State University when they saw them.  When I asked where she said they were near where all the construction was going on near Colonel Glenn Highway.  She said her and her friend observed them for several hours.  She said that they were afraid to leave to go tell someone as they thoug ht they might not be there when they came back.  She said they had a bright white light on the front and that they had a green, a red and a purple light on them.  She said they would hover and move slowly and then they would zoom off and disappear out of sight traveling at a high rate of speed.  She said there were a lot of them.  She said that the next day she called her relative who was a Colonel at Wright Patterson Air Force Base which is close by where she saw the UFOs&#39;  She described the crafts and he said that there was nothing that the military had that could do what these UFOs did as she described it to him. I relayed my sighting to her of the night before in Ft. Wayne, Indiana.  We marveled at the coincidence of seeing the same type of craft in 2 distant locations on the same night. She bought some UFO books and left.  I often wished I had gotten her name and address so that I could contact her again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other little tidbit of information: When I was 19 years old in 1967 and attending Wright State University I lived off of Linden Ave. with a nice lady who let me stay there in exchange for taking care of her children from time to time.  There was a little store on Linden Ave. that I frequented to buy food, stamps and etc.  There was a young man who worked there who I became friendly with.  One time he asked me if I would like to go see the aliens that were at Wright Patterson Air Force Base.  He said that his father was a higher up in the military there(I think he said a Colonel) and that his father had taken him to see them before since he had a security clearance to where they were being kept.  he said he could get me in if I wanted to see them.  I was scared to go and declined his offer.  I have regretted that many times since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/22/87 20:00|Portsmouth|NH|Cigar|20 minutes|Large silent black cigar shaped craft sighted over Pease AFB|5/2/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108928.html|7|ndxe198710| Large silent black cigar shaped craft sighted over Pease AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back one evening in 1987 (Fall, I believe), some friends of mine and I were in Portsmouth, NH, where we stopped off at Gooseberry Market.  As we left, one of us pointed out an odd formation in the sky, over above nearby Pease AFB.  We noticed at least one other group of people ahead of us looking at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a large (two football fields length?) dark black cigar shape.  No color, no visible lights save for the ambient reflection of the AFB ground lighting on its underbelly.  It just stood there silently in the dark partly cloudy sky - it was in the early evening, so the sky was already dark by then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes, the object began to move very slowly into a cloud - yet, on the other side of the cloud there was nothing -- it was if it were disappearing somewhere.  During that time, I recall seeing two tiny sparkly white lights drop out of the middle, swirl around each other and dart off in opposite directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is possible it just went into the dark sky and wasn&#39;t visible, but it really did appear as if it were gradually disappearing into thin air.<n>
10/21/87 21:30|Swansea (UK/England)||Triangle|30 minutes|Triangular lights seen over Swansea and Port Talbot|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50466.html|8|ndxe198710| Triangular lights seen over Swansea and Port Talbot<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was amazed (and elated) to see that somebody else had reported the same incident on this site. I remember it being in the local newspapers the next day and that numerous people had reported it. If I remember rightly it had also been reported to the coastguard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way to football practice at the time. We practised on a small field under some street lighting close to Aberavon beach. On our way there I noticed some lights in the sky behaving oddly. At first I thought it  might be aircraft dogfight training as the lights seemed to be dancing around each other. I then noticed what seemed to be a cylinder shape at the centre which could only be defined by the lights on it. I could not see any physical solid shape. These lights continued revolving and cartwheeling and slowly moving away towards a slightly misty horizon until they dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting alone amazed me as it lasted what seemed a good 10 minutes which gave me enough time to discern that these lights were not aircraft of any sort that I had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 minutes later as we were playing football I noticed more lights in the distance heading towards us. I stopped playing football to clearly observe them. They were moving slowly and at first I saw four lights that as they got closer changed into three lights and a triangular shape was clearly discernable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my amazement the lights passed directly overhead. I couldn&#39;t make out any sound or see any shape in between the lights. I can only guess at the size. It seemed to be about the size of a British Vulcan bomber or bigger. It passed over slowly and as I mentioned earlier there was absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, not long after it passed overhead it  pointed upwards and ascended vertically at exactly the same slow speed until it disappeared. This amazed me as I know of no aircraft that can do this for that duration and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after two aircraft appeared which led me to the conclusion that they were looking for these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He was employed as an auditor at the time and did not wish his credibility challenged, so he never reported it.  It was however reported on the front page of our local newspaper the following day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am amazed that I can find no reference to this sighting anywhere on the net.   He described the triagular shaped object as blacking out a vast section of the night sky, and travelling very slowly without any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are on a flightpath and are used to seeing passenger aircraft at around 25,000ft doing approx 475mph, he told me it moved across the sky at a similar pace, but if it was at a similar height to the passenger aircraft we are used to seeing, then the craft size would be possibly better measured in miles than feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

The ball got loose so we all stopped to look for it. I heard a  faint low pitched humming sound from above so I looked up and saw a slow moving large triangular shaped craft with dim lights(red,blue green or yellow) at the corners. We all saw it. It moved too slowly  and quietly to be a airplane . It was a clear starlit night and as it moved across the sky it obscured the stars as it passed by. I think that it was flying at a  fairly low altitude which made it appear to be larger than a jumbojet. This all took place in the fall of 87(approx), around which time there were a number of similar sightings all over the Hudson Valley . I feel that this sighting was  of a man-made  craft , possibly military in nature, the nationality or origin of which is unknown. In other words I do not believe it was extraterrestrial. Also an Eastchester police patrol car drove slowly by on Leewood drive and pulled into the parking lot and stopped to possibly watch it float by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four of us agreed that we had witnessed a UFO sighting. We were not overly excited  about it . It just confirms what I have always believed<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I couldn&#39;t help but notice viewing this same object to the south as it was getting closer and seemed to be travelling approximately in the same direction as I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked at first like a horizontal line of lights; as a large well lit jumbo jet; I said to myself, &#34;gee,  wouldn&#39;t it be great if that were a UFO&#34;. As I continued on the Cross County Parkway west, I could see it was gaining on me, and our path&#39;s were intersecting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When decending down the hill to where the Cross County joins the Saw Mill Parkway, I was startled as I looked up to see, getting closer and closer from my car window, an object about 1000 feet up that was a flat, black rectangle with six groups of lights configured  in a triangular pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The six groups of multi-colored lights were symmetrically placed in rows that were evenly spaced along this football field sized rectanglar object. 2 groups in the front, 2 in the middle, and 2 in the rear; spread out and disernable as groups. Each group of lights was of a slightly different tint or color, mostly whiteish with some being pinkish or reddish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was generally an overcast night with some low level visibility which explains why I could have seen it so far away at first. I distinctly remember that it was also a moonless night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The large rectangular shape was clearly defined against the muddy low cloud cover as illuminated by the omnipresent static greenish-pink urban glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was not a group of planes or a blimp. It was a solid rectanular platform, and I descibed it to others as being easily as big as a football field. It also struck me odd that it was completely silent. I estimated that it was travelling at about 60 MPH as I slowed my car to almost a stop  with my head sticking out the window looking up in amazment. There were other cars slowing down and pulling to the shoulder to watch it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my route north up the Saw Mill Parkway was heading directly in it&#39;s trail, I watched as it travelled northwest diagonally over Yonkers with it&#39;s distinct 6 red rear lights stretching it&#39;s stern width. I don&#39;t think it was moving much faster than a car, as I visually followed it&#39;s path over the low land valley of Yonkers over the ridge while towards the Hudson River. This is a very hilly ares with multple views, even the far horizon of the palisades with it&#39;s famous FM tower to the west. I quickly manuvered through the back street and up the hill to my destination as I was on my way to my grandparent&#39;s  house which sits high on a hill, and commands a great view of the Hudson River, Palisades and the Hudson valley to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The six 6 red lights across it&#39;s stern were clearly visible for at least 20 minutes as it cruised north up over the Hudson.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day the local paper had some story about a &#34;UFO&#34; or &#34;Strange Lights&#34; observed by numerous people. I was confused by the story, because it seemed un-related to me as the people interviewed  described it as being &#34;greenish in color&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I found it strange that the news story mentioned that the sighting location was over the vicinity of the town of Ardsley; which is further northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve told this story to a lot of people over the years, and I&#39;m telling it to you the same way.  I can remember this incident as vividly as if it had happened yesterday and I swear it to be true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always assumed that it was some &#34;U.S. government&#34; flying platform possibly on it&#39;s way the the Air force field at Newburg  N.Y.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in October 1987 is approximate.

We decided to park so that we could talk and listen to music when we noticed this ball of light which looked somewhat gold in tone drop down from out of the dark star lit sky. At first we thought it was a huge falling star but it came to an instant stop like nothing we had ever seen before. Then all of a sudden it moved horozontally to the south so fast and came to an instant stop. We both looked at eachother with our mouths opened and asked eachother, &#34;did you see that?&#34; We both said yes and were afraid that the other one would say saw what. But as we looked the object went straight up like a shot and disappeared. But as fast as it disappeared it reappeared and moved from north to south like no other craft we had ever seen. The color of the object seemed to grow in intensity instantly changing from a dim hew to a bright hew of gold. At that moment we felt fear and decided to leave and say nothing thinking noone would believe us.  I am positive that UFO&#39;s exist. And I know that the guy I was with that night will back me up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

They looked  like roman candle balls and the same intnse glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We scooped up my daughter and hopped into the truck me in my fuzzy footed jammies even. We tore out of the field and went to next farm over.

He too had sen the same and reports were coming in from community.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Baffled and no ! answers after about an hour we pulled through the gate protecting the 100 acres where we lived.  Of into the distance to the north like heading to Olathe we could only see a trail about mile or so wide of orange sparks trailing behind the light balls path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few months went and one night in Olathe at friends house we were dinking and talking when the same sighting was seen by the other 2 females were were hanging out with.  They had witnessed the sighting too but they were in Lenexa at the arrowhead Apt. Pool/clubhouse.  They thought they were tripping and just seeing the same trip.  They had heard leter after their sighting it was a satellite and the pixals that were the balls of light we had all seen and reports of it seen all the way to canada. .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what it was.  Never heard anything about it til they told their story and nothing ever after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wondering did anyone else ever see anything like it as well around the same time frame?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date probably is approximate.

We were traveling in our car on Charman road Cheltenham Victoria, Australia, there was a petrol station in the corner but was closed at that time, those days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after Nepean Hwy, first lights heading to the Cheltenham shopping strip, as we were to stop at the red lights.  Ex husband my daughter and myself noticed a huge object almost as if it was parked above us.  It was a huge space ship, above about 4 to 5 story&#39;s high in distance, maybe closer directly above us, could not believe our eyes, we were not scared but very shocked and nerves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were few other cars going in different directions as well.  Everyone just started to toot their horns and just froze for a little while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was covering almost all of the above sky view, it was like what they call the &#39;&#34;Mother ship&#34;.  It looked round underneath the object, it had heaps of bright lights underneath the craft.  The lights were turning around in different directions according to the rows, and was like turning more then one direction, it was like, looking into  a night view of another city with all the lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Colour of the object was dark grey and metal or steel like, but a rough surface, object looked high in height and did not look completely round on the top level, rather kind of some corners around the top edges it was unbelievably silent, no sound or wind coming from the huge object, and did not see any aliens in sight.  It was almost like the spaceship that you see in some movies these days, but sound turn off.  It was like observing the area for at least 5-7 mins or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly started to move in high speed directly up and up for a few minutes, then slightly angled towards the sea with a higher speed until it was about the size of the  moon and paused for awhile,  During this period the lights turned off and only looked like a grey saucer, and within seconds shot up into the sky slightly direction of the sea  but disappeared up into the sky&#39;s atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after arriving at a friends house I phone the TV news channel to report it, from what I remember it was channel 7.  I reported all the information above, and was told that they would investigate, and call me back, which few hours later they did.  But only to tell me that, so many other people have also reported it and after their investigation there was no sighting in the radars.  I was told it was in possible for it to be a spaceship, other wise they would have detected it, and it could be a air-balloon add.  No matter how much I tried to describe it to her, she was not interested or did not believe it to investigate it further. for a huge sighting that I reported at the time there was hardly any UFO sightings these day is nothing like the one I have witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I have not heard or seen it in any reports anywhere, and always wondered why, for all the small types of sightings are reported documented and announced, and I am always trying to research of the other witnesses whom were there, or seen it that day, or anyone else that would have had the similar experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Those days there was no mobile phones to take photos for proof etc.  For this is very true and described the best of my memory today, and it was nothing like from our planet that&#39;s for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

10/15/87 20:00|Bolingbrook|IL|Triangle|5 minutes|Thin black triangle, moving slowly over field in suburban Chicago.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59089.html|16|ndxe198710| Thin black triangle, moving slowly over field in suburban Chicago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the passenger seat of a car headed west on Boughton Road. My mother was driving. I was gazing north, looking at the constellations but not paying special attention. Then I noticed something odd about one of the “airplanes.”  At first glance, it looked like any small aircraft at night: a pair of red &amp; white lights flying low, headed west, roughly parallel with the road. What struck me as odd was its slow speed. In fact, we seemed to be outpacing it. (I believe the speed limit on that road was somewhere around 40-45mph).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would have been out of view soon, if not for the fact that my mother made a wrong turn, north onto Weber Road. We were headed straight across its path as it continued west. I didn’t say anything, but after a few seconds my mother noticed it too. I remember her asking, “what is that?” over and over, in an increasingly anxious tone. It was only about 20 feet above the ground, and moving so slowly that it just looked completely wrong, as if it shouldn’t be in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We rolled down the windows and killed the radio. I’m not sure why we thought to do this, but we were duly shocked to find that it made no sound. By now we could see the shape of the object, and in a few more seconds it passed directly in front of / above us. We had a clear view through the front windshield of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the side, it had looked like a very thin wafer with lights front and back. From the bottom it was an equilateral triangle and each of the three sides curved inward. Each of the triangle’s three apexes terminated in a small rectangular “nub” with a light. (It was actually a very elegant-looking shape). The lights were red and white, but I don’t recall if they flashed or alternated in any way. The object itself was pure, unreflective black. My mother and I later disagreed somewhat on the size of the object. She felt that it was about the size of our car (a large sedan), but my impression was that it was slightly smaller – maybe about the size of a dining room table.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I won’t vouch for my memory of what happened next. (Not at a distance of 20 years, to be sure.) But what I remember is this: After it crossed Weber Road in front of us, it stopped in midair, hovered a second, then rapidly dropped several feet. Then it took off at a shallow upward angle, traveling east at a surprisingly fast rate. It was out of sight in a few more seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few final comments. If you look at a map of the area, you’ll see that the intersection of W. Boughton and N. Weber streets is just northeast of a small airstrip (Clow Airport). I’ve thought about the possibility that we saw a light plane – especially considering the red/white lights. I just can’t completely accept that conclusion based on the evidence of my senses that night.  I should also mention that the terrain in the area was mainly uncultivated fields. I didn&#39;t know it at the time, but a stream runs parallel to Boughton Road right along where I estimate the object&#39;s flight path was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I saw the UFO about 20-30 feet off the ground. It was a silver disc-shaped flying saucer. It was not rotating but it was hovering. I heard no sound and no wind movement from any propulsion system. I saw no windows, no alien creatures and it was perfectly level with the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is electrical equipment on the hill where I saw it. There are also about 3 or 4 homes near there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I went to the window and opened it to look out. Almost my entire veiw of the sky was blotted out by a huge triangular shape with lights running down the sides and marking the corners. It seemed incredibly low and was moving very slowly toward the West. I watched until the entire length passed overhead and the rumbling began to grow more distant. I was astounded and wondered what to do--then I remembered that I was in the middle of a city and realized that this would be big news in the morning--it couldn&#39;t have gone unnoticed--so I decided to go back to bed! No one else that I know of saw a thing, so I&#39;ve kept it largely to myself until now. The report from Louisburg NC seems to be very similar and may have been the same night. But mine made noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I had just returned to the residence with another conference attendee. It was probably between 2230 and 2300, and the skies were clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my arms on top of the car and was thinking about what I needed to bring inside for the night when I noticed a bright white light reflecting off of my arms, the car, my friend’s back and the bushes in a 10-20 foot circle around the car.  The light was flashing, like a very rapid strobe light, and seemed to be directly above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up, the flashing had stopped.  I saw a very bright light moving from our position to the east at a very high rate of speed. In just a second or two it seemed to be over the city of Minneapolis.  It stopped very suddenly, stayed in place for a second or two, then sped off at what appeared to be a right angle, now heading south at a high rate of speed toward the Minnesota-Iowa border.  The light disappeared as I tracked it southward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had yelled to my friend to look up.  By the time she looked up, the light had disappeared, though later she said she did see a very bright flash of light in her peripheral vision as she was getting some things out of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five to ten seconds after the first light disappeared, we both saw two other lights that moved more like meteors.  One was bright orange and appeared to arc from east to west.  After this one faded out, I looked slightly to the north and spotted a second whiter light arcing from west to east. Both of these lights left trails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Comparing our observations, it was clear that these second lights impressed both of us as being consistent with meteors.  The first light – with its brilliance, its burst of strobe-like flashing, lack of a trail, and its extreme speed, deceleration and sharp change of direction – was definitely something of a different nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am presently a psychoanalytic-psychotherapist in private practice.  Before I changed careers, I was chief of a large fire protection district in the western U.S., and had training in fire investigation.  Before that I was a naturalist with the National Park Service, and have long been a student and observer of nature.  I consider myself to be a curious, careful, and scientifically oriented observer.<n>

Lighted triangular shaped objects hovering at a low pattern and cornering like a  kid on a big-wheel. Yeah, yeah, saw that several times, that I could write off as man made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night however on a walk to my grandmother&#39;s house I saw what I am still to this day sure of. A semi-large brigt white object setting dead still somewhere lower than an airplane path would be.  No it wasn&#39;t Venus . I was sure of it&#39;s place in the atmosphere. What really sat me down was what was going on around it. 5 to 6 seperate red sigular lights where darting around away and some even merged with the white object. They did so in an unorganized manner . It was too high for a light show, and besides it is a small town, and there wouldn&#39;t be one anyway. I did get my grandmother to see for herself, and she did , but only I remember now.<n>

It made no discernible sound and I would have definitely have heard something if it were a plane since I lived out in the country and it was extremely quiet there. It simply just flew overhead and disappeared on the horizon at the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

( vermont local ) A bright flash of light lit up the  sky, like   a  flash from a  old  fashioned  camera  bulb. The   light  was intense and  gave me and  my friend  quite  a start. I thought  we  were being blown up.. it   was  weird, a  good  minute  had passed  and  and=other came along, then another  and  maybe  2 or  3 more. Nervous  we  exited  the  vehicle   we  were  sitting in  at the  time and gazed  at the  sight ahead of us, now  were  seeing things  fly out of this pulsating flash of light little  streeks  like something taking off  from it. a  few  minutes  had  passed  and  we  began to motice 2  flying  objects heading west and behind us. I had  laughingly  said  to my friend at  the time  woudlnt it  be great  if  they could  land here. That was a t   approximately  10:30 I  remember   checking my  watch for  the  duration of  the  events. Its  the  last  thing I remember  doing before  checking my  watch again   and  seeing  it  was 11:00 pm ,  with   a  strange notion that  time had  lapsed  awfully  fast. My  friend  had  the same  feeling. Scared  and weirded out  we  left  the  area and my life  wasnt  the  same  for  the  next  two  years. I became  pregnant  and  noticed allot of  new  things, strange  scooped marking on my belly  faint  but  when  stretched i  could  make  them out, and  I had  noticed one more  on my head and my leg   area. In  side  each of  these scooped  marks were three particularly placed indentations making  a perfect triangular shape. I  dont know if  this  was in connection  with what I saw but things  were too weird  for me for  a few  years. Reoccuring sounds and  bright lights And  this  all occured the year before aurora borealis was so intense in my area it  was phenominal  (that  was 1988  )   There  are other  things  that began to happen and I would love to have an  explanation for them.…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of alleged event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

10/1/87 20:00|Roseburg (7 miles northwest of)|OR|Oval|30 mins.|Two small glowing oval orange objects and one larger triangle craft in rural Oregon.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66062.html|27|ndxe198710| Two small glowing oval orange objects and one larger triangle craft in rural Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Friday before hunting season- so it was either September 25 or October 2, 1987- since Oregon’s hunting season is always the last weekend of September or first weekend of October (I checked online to see if I could figure out what date is correct using Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife with no success.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were seven miles northwest of Roseburg, Oregon, in a sparsely populated area (no houses for at least a mile away) checking out a hunting location that I was very familiar with and it was just before twilight.  We sat down to rest next to a creek-we were in a fairly deep, narrow valley between two hills-  when my friend noticed two yellowish lights at a distance about two thousand yards up the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I did not think much about it since I knew of a gravel road at the end of the valley and thought it was probably just headlights of a car, and told him of such.  We were about to get up since it was now almost dark-and had about a quarter mile to hike back to the truck-when I again notice the two yellow lights were now closer and heading directly down the canyon towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still did not yet think they were UFO’s or anything out of the ordinary when all of sudden we could hear animal(s) moving  in our direction away from the direction of the yellow lights- I couldn’t see the animals since it was almost dark now and the area had enough brush and trees to hide them as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time we were listening to the animals, I also started to see small (about 1 inch) red glowing “sparkling” spheres appearing at the base of a tree twenty feet away from us, towards the direction of the yellow “lights.”   These red spheres, suddenly appeared at the base, then started to swirled around the tree, all the time rotating upward, and then just as suddenly disappear once they reach the top of the tree.  More and more red spheres appeared around the trees in front of us when I started to asked my friend if he was seeing what I was seeing (I was worried that I was losing my mind) when he shakily replied, “Yes.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> I once again looked at the yellow “lights,” which were now close enough to see that they were not yellow lights at all, but two glowing, yellowish/orange, oblong spheres or “crafts,”- about six feet long and 3 feet high.  The crafts were about ten or fifteen feet above the oak trees and twenty feet apart- still fixed on the same course, now about eighty yards away, and still heading down the valley towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These oblong crafts did not make any sound and did not rotate that I could see whatsoever but maintained a slow, methodical speed and spatial distance between themselves and the trees, all the while moving in our direction.  There was no propeller, wing, rudder or prop whatsoever on these “crafts” that I could see or detect.  They did not appear to be flimsy like a balloon nor rigid metallic either, but almost smooth, round-cornered plastic looking objects.  In addition, they did not glow from within nor from without, but within the skin of the craft itself.  Also, underneath the two spheres the ground was brightly lit up. The light that they emitted was strange in that you could not see the source of the light emitting from the spheres itself, like you would from a headlamp, instead the it was “magically” lit up underneath the spheres and the edges of the light did not slowly diffuse but stopped very abrupt… almost like it the light was contained!?!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was becoming too much for my senses… (I will admit I was starting to get freaked out, feeling quite alone even with my friend there in the woods and even though I hunted in this area alone all my life) we both stood up and I said let’s get the heck out of here.   As soon as we moved, the spheres moved in an instance directly overhead and both of us were now bathed in the light.  I stood, in awe, frozen, looking at these THINGS, when one of the spheres shot out a red glowing disk (the same color of the smaller red spheres) straight upwards and then the red disk exploded in a brilliant flash of red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt frozen as if I was knocked unconscious and the next thing I know I am running.  My friend is also running beside me and we are both running towards my truck not saying a word when I reach the top of a hill I see another object or craft that is triangular in shape that appears high and quite far in the distance further past where my truck is located.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This triangular craft is hard to describe how big it is because I cannot reference how far away it is, but it is definitely triangular and of decent size, as well as, far away.  The craft appears to be more metallic looking, in that it is straight lines and appears to be rotating or spinning and has three sides like a pyramid.  It either has three lights or sides or corners of red, silver, and blue, that either interchange or spins giving it an appearance of blinking or spinning motion.  It also appears that the bottom side arches or wobbles back and forth, giving it the “blinking” or jittering effect?!?.    I cannot describe this craft any further as to the fact that I was moving rather fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We lived next to the school grounds and could cut across the field to get to the corner store on the other side of the school.  That is what we did that night.  We decided to go to the store my babysitter her boyfriend and I and were cutting through the grounds I was being a child and rambling on about something when my babysitter said &#34;Stop for a moment ----- look up.&#34;  And there perched on the large rock in the grounds was a sight I will never forget, a large now it seemed HUGE to me as big as a house but I was 7 and things just seemed big back then it was at least twice the size of the rock this large sphere it was red and orange seemed to swirl with these colors, almost like the sun and was balanced perfectly on this rock.  we stood and stared at it for a few moments and then I asked if I could climb the rock and touch this glowing sphere.  I don&#39;t know what possesed my babysitter to say yes but she did and I climbed up this rock as they stood and watched me.  I remember climbing slowly up to this object and when I was within a foot of it reaching out my hand to touch it&#39;s side, I got within an inch of it&#39;s surface ( I didn&#39;t notice any change in temp) I stopped something in my head told me to leave, to go away, so I did I climbed down that rock and told my sitter we had to leave.  So we left and as we walked away I looked over my shoulder and wished it away back to where it came from.  We went to the store and when we came back it was gone. And there was no evidence of it having ever been there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have remembered that night in vivid detail since it happened and I write this in hopes that someone else may have seen something similar to what I did that night.  Thank you for taking time to read my story it may seem tall but is every bit true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/1/87 01:00|West Palm Beach|FL||one hour|An "out of the body" experience|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15778.html|29|ndxe198710| An &#34;out of the body&#34; experience<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1987 I was living in a small home on a lake in West Palm Beach Florida. One night I had an &#34;out of the Body&#34; Experience.  I remember  what seemed like my &#34;Spirit&#34; lifting upward from my bed toward the ceiling.  I remember being frightened, (terror) and looking down and seeing my body in bed.  In my mind, I kept screaming &#34;Jesus, Jesus.&#34; I had expected when I yelled that name I would have returned back down, but I didn&#39;t return immediately as I had expected, finally I slowed and then returned to my bed. I had thought it was &#34;Spiritual&#34; until a few days later.  My neighbor was a retired AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER&#34;.  I had gone into their house to visit and the wife seemed &#34;frightened&#34; of me, at least it seemed that way.  He brought the subject up and asked her to tell me.  Turns out, that same night she had seen a UFO over the lake, directly behind my home. This was brought to a head in October of 1987. (Prior to the out of the body experience).  I was on a flight  to Florida and had been upgraded to First Class.  I sat next to a man in uniform, but had not paid much attention to him at first. I was looking out the window and saw something.   I jumped and quickly turned my head to see if I could see it out the other window on the other side of the plane.He asked me what I saw and I noticed his uniform again.  I had wanted to prove my thought wrong about all this, so I told him what I thought I had just seen.  He asked me if I had ever seen anything like that before and I told him yes.  Thinking he would straighten me out.  I told him the whole story.  He suggested that I write it down or report it.  I asked him if he had ever seen one.  He said that he had and had chased one over the skies of New England for about an hour until he was running low on fuel. That really made me think. It has taken me till now to Report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of three reports submitted by this witness.  PD))<n>
