1/31/12 23:15|Milford|CT|Unknown||I saw many bright objects which appeared to be the same size and traveling fast at the same altitude high in the sky going westward.|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87950.html|1|ndxe201201| I saw many bright objects which appeared to be the same size and traveling fast at the same altitude high in the sky going westward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event happened I believe on Jan 31, 2012. I’m pretty confident of the date because I had taken a photo from my phone that same morning of (what I thought to be) very strange cloud formations – I have since found out this particular formation is called Altocumulus undalatus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That evening I had taken my dog out for the last time before bed.  It might have been 11pm or later – I don&#39;t recall the exact time.  I was standing on my deck outside and looked up towards the sky.  I remember it being a bright night. I remember seeing the outline of the clouds very clearly.  That strange cloud formation was still apparent that evening.  The event I witnessed was what I thought to be many, many planes flying in the same air space. The sky was covered with the clouds however, I could see these bright objects (non-flickering)between the cloud openings.  These bright objects were moving fast in a westward direction.   I thought to myself what on earth is this all about.  I’ve never seen anything like it.  I disclose it now because it’s been on my mind. I’m thinking what I saw was just too weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To recap, I saw many objects which appeared to be the same size and traveling at the same altitude high in the sky going westward.  These objects were bright and moving fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I then realized it wasn’t something made my eye see a sky illusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we continue travelling a third a light appear and when we looked up to gaze the full sky to our surprise a parallel of lights were on the sky.  It was made up of 7 to 8 lights parallel in two lines. It was then my colleague who was sitting from behind joined us and looks up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My driver stop in the middle of the road, I jumped out of the vehicle, my colleague and driver as well and to our amazement we stared at the sky lights for about a minute before it disappeared.  It was like stationary at a height of a small plane can fly.  Really amazing and fantastic experienced! I now I believed in UFO’s.  I wa! nt to know if there are sightings similar to what we saw.  The sighting was January 31, 2012 at Ruwais, Abu Dhabi, UAE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

(Unidentified flying object not some round thing with martians in it) it was just after dark between 5:20- 5:30.  We both happened to glance at the sky at the rite moment.  It was traveling in the same direction I was so it passed over me(not directly over a few feet over my head but up in the air over me) and flew in a straight path until it wasn’t visible, which was about less than 5 seconds It was going very fast there wasn’t anything to get in my field of view so it flew until I couldn’t see it which again was less than 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a round in shape I’m not sure how maneuverable it was it flew in a straight path.  The whole circle was white but not colored it was a white like it was radiating light around the bottom until the middle of it which was just a dark spot.<n>

1/31/12 15:30|Phoenix|AZ|Formation|15 minutes|UFO sighting over  Rose Mofford Park in West Phoenix, AZ on 01-31-2012 at 3:30pm ... formation of 6 muted color Orbs, cloaked.|2/3/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86989.html|6|ndxe201201| UFO sighting over  Rose Mofford Park in West Phoenix, AZ on 01-31-2012 at 3:30pm ... formation of 6 muted color Orbs, cloaked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 31st, 2012, at 3:30 pm I decided to go from my home to clear my mind at a large park about two miles away from my home (very peaceful place).  I was at Rose Mofford Park located at 9833 N. 25th Ave. Phoenix, AZ (on 25th avenue just north of dunlap).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This park generally has many people playing sports in the afternoon and some people having lunch or relaxing during the day.  At that time of the day I had walked buy two full soccer games involving preteens and kids.  I decided since I wanted peace and sunlight that I would avoid the soccer fields and go on the way to the running track area, which I did.  I proceeded to lay down on the grass on the outside of the track on it&#39;s west side.  It was completely cloudless that day which is very typical of Phoenix.  I was affixed at looking into the sky as I did when I was a child... like looking at the clouds and guessing what they might resemble.  That was my state of mind at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I soon noticed a small dot in the sky that could have not bee a plane by any stretch of the imagination. I looked a little deeper and thought it couldn&#39;t be a bird... no bird would ever fly so high alone that it was nothing more than a tiny black dot (size of a pin head or smaller).  I chose to ignore that dot and decided to gaze at the whole sky rather just out of relaxation.  I widened my gaze and the whole viewable sky  and immediately came across something out of place... a formation of 6 semi transparent or muted color orbs forming a slightly unorganized cross system.  One orb was a darker gray color and was bigger than the others, this orb was off center (top left of the cross intersection).  This system of orbs moved slowly across the sky (as if quietly cruising) as one unchanging group.  None of the orbs moved independently of the others.  They moved as one system. In between the orbs it appeared just as the rest of the sky or completely transparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was baffled, but not surprised or skeptical to see this.  This is the second time I&#39;ve seen a truly unmistakable alien craft or UFO in the sky and don&#39;t regularly go looking for them at all.  Even my choice to go to the park to clear my mind in the middle of the day like that was absolutely out of character (been at leased a whole year since I did that type of thing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> To debunk any skeptics, yes I was here when Phoenix lights occurred but was not an eye witness in any way. For the record, that event doesn&#39;t &amp; didn&#39;t cross my mind during this sighting.  That event was never fresh in my mind since I had no personal attachment to / experience with it.  With that said, the Phoenix Lights event has no bearing on my current experience.  I was not looking for this sort of thing,... it just happened!   My belief system as for Phoenix Lights is this: I believed it was true and happened physically as well as that it was a real space craft driven by either our govt or other intelligent species from within our galaxy.  As said before, I actually was not an eye witness of the Phoenix lights, but from all videos and said descriptions of the sighting from eye witnesses, this UFO that I saw had / was using what appeared to be the same type of cloaking technology where I could see the normal sky in between  the orbs.  Also, this UFO appeared much higher in the sky and didn&#39;t form a chevron like the Phoenix Lights one did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a nutshell, I 100% without a doubt know I saw an alien or possibly top secret government craft that was cloaked and peacefully traveling over West Phoenix that day on Junuary 31st, 2012 at 3:30pm in the afternoon.  Hopefully others might have seen it as well and can confirm it with me.<n>

Sighting occurred during daylight hours, at 11:42 a.m. on January 31st, 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Telephoned Report:  A man and wife called to report have witnessed a disc-shaped craft cross the road in front of their automobile, as they drove from Minneapolis to Duluth.  It was so close, they reported, that they could see various details on the exterior surface of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object crossed the road in front of them, and then disappeared behind trees to their right.  Then, a short time later, it appeared again, traveling in a different direction.  It disappeared from their sight a second time, and then reappeared, providing them with a third sighting of the strange object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The couple were traveling north, and were approximately 2 hours&#39; drive south of Duluth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses will submit their own report, sometime in the near future.  Their ability to write a report has been delayed by a death in their family.  They will submit a report, once they return to their home.<n>

It looks like it have some kind of darkest area in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are awake in that street until 4 A.M., just to see if it come again, and since there we come to the same place every day, unfortunately nothing...<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are any report that looks like this one?

Living near DC, we have a lot of light pollution, so I was pleasantly surprised to see so many stars tonight.  Orion is the most visible constellation and, as I stood looking at him, I saw what I thought was a plane moving east, away from Bellatrix, Orion&#39;s left shoulder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My stomach dropped as the object made a sharp ninety degree turn and began moving north.  It moved slowly and stopped a couple of times, appearing to waver slightly, as if it were moving back and forth.  Occasionally it blinked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before and I am still in a state of stunned disbelief.  It might still be visible, but as I thought of coming inside to get a camera, I started getting scared.  Partly because I felt frozen in place.  I had the absurd thought, &#34;What if they can see me.&#34;<n>

It looked as if it were going to hit the first object, then stopped suddenly right underneath the first. The both paused for about 5 seconds, sitting still in the nights&#39; sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then one become very bright, then very dim. The other followed the same pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they flickered their lights, and vanished completely!! We waited for minutes, but saw no return?<n>

Construction crews lined both sides of the highway (north and south).  I saw a rectangular craft flashing red and white lights at about the height of a street lamp stretched across 3 left lanes of the high-way.  I was able to see the craft for about 30 seconds - the craft did not move and only looked dark in between the flashing lights with a couple of dome-shaped windows.  The craft did not move, sway, or hover and made absolutely no noise - it had a beam of narrow light directed at a frenzy of state troopers.  Half an hour later on my way up the opposite side of the high way going back the way I came, construction crews were gone, but state troopers were still there looking confused.<n>

1/30/12 05:00|Calabash|NC|Circle|1 hour|It first appeared to be a glittering star drifting left to right and then upward.|2/3/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86904.html|22|ndxe201201| It first appeared to be a glittering star drifting left to right and then upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> January 30th, 2012 I was waiting for the coffee to brew on my couch at 5am this morning.  I noticed what appeared to be a large yellowish flickering star.  It appeared to be moving left to right. The movement was so slow I doubted myself.  I only became very interested in what I was seeing when I noticed the object move upward.  I called my wife and we both watch the object.  The object had a very noticeable red light and an occasional aqua light glimmering off one side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I retrieved my 8x30 Leupold optics which worked amazing.  As the object got closer it became almost transparent.  I would compare it to the look of a jelly fish, Translucent with a notable shape and appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed another object approach from under the first object.  It was the exact same in appearance.  The initial object casted a light which seemed to draw the second object toward it . There was an obvious line separating the two close objects.  This is when a black circle appeared (had a very perfect shape with a light outline) and went back and forth between the two objects.  I would say the black circle was 1/3 the size of the two object together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for only a minute, then the two original objects where one.  I watched this entire event transpiring in amazement.  The now one large circle began to glow.  When it came close enough I was able to see into the shape.  It was almost like veins running throughout the inside.  There were light red and aqua flashes he whole time, some times more intense than others.  I would describe this like a lighting storm contained inside this sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when the object seemed to pick a path and started moving away and moving upward at a constant but slow pace.  I watched the object until 6am.  When my binoculars were not powerful enough to see detail in simply looked like a flickering yellow star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was truly an unexplained sighting. I would love any information you may have in concluding what my wife and I saw.  I once witnessed an Aurora Borealis, I know science has explanations,  I’ve never read about anything like this.<n>

Just a green, solid light, that looked like it could have been a spark from a fireworks.  It could not be that since there was only one, it travelled horizontally over hundreds of meters and only disappeared in the horizon, with a slight decrease in altitude, and light intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed in front of my window for about 20 minutes wondering what I had just witnessed.I am absolutely sure it was not a plane, due to it,s flight type and altitude. no one would dare do that with a plane.  It was way fater than a helicopter and I would have heard it, whatever engine type it would use.  It was late on a sunday night, not fireworks, it&#39;s winter in Quebec anyway.  A green, solid light that only seemed to flicker when the object reached a far distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never witnesses anything like this before, and now I just have the hardest time trying to figure out the possibilities.  I am not a naive person, and technologically, I am relatively well informed.  I was not drunk, drug free and never experienced hallucinations in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am stumped and also very confused as to whatever this was.<n>

At around 11:30 pm I saw a light that was nearly in the direct center of the moon from where I was looking at it.  The light was oval shaped and every so often a smaller flash of light would blink around it.  After only a second or two a beam extended down from the oval shape and shined on the water below.  It rested for maybe another second and then streaked off too fast for the eye to follow.  I remember feeling nauseated by the fact that I was there alone.  I got in my car and left immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was an eerie night and I could hear all the birds and night animals.  I looked at the sky and saw all the amazing stars, when out of the ordinary there seemed to be lights moving. I thought this was an airplane, but as an expert in airplanes I could tell this was not one.  It had three dots, that seemed to be a blue haze in a distinct form of a triangle.  Since I was out on my back porch I had no utensils to take a picture.  I wish I could provide more factual information, but I know what I saw. I saw a UFO.<n>

I thought it was just a plane or some stars, but then I realized they were to big and hazy to be stars and they seemed to close to the ground to be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I showed my brother and we were puzzled as to what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten minutes they just sort of disappeared and we didn&#39;t seem them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since we couldn&#39;t figure out what thy were, we decided to report to here.<n>

I was shoveling and i looked up and saw 3 strange blue lights hovering over Lake Michigan.  There were 3 of them in a triangular formation.  Each light was an oval ship that were blue with an aura around them.  They hovered there for about 9 to ten minutes.  It was unlike anything I have ever seen before.<n>

There were three of these lights, and they were pretty far spaced apart.  They definately could be seen rather clearly, and they formed a triangle.  This was definately not an aircraft, as th lights were pretty far apart and they seemed to zoom away after about 15 minutes of sitting in the sky.<n>

As I was walking,I|2/3/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86960.html|33|ndxe201201| I had just got back from the store. I got out of my car walked up the sidewalk with a bag and a box of frozen pizza.  As I was walking, I thought I saw something dark moving accross the sky.  I stoped to confirm if I really saw it.  There was a small plane,I could tell by its lights, higher up and a good distance east of this object.  This object was in a lower flight path and was moving from the north east to the south west, then more south.  It blended with the night sky, and if it was not moving I would not have seen it. I could track it with my eyes, then lose it for a secound, then I would see it again.  I could not make out its shape, I could only see a dark object moving accross the sky.  I live one town over from a small plane type airport,and see many small plans flying at night.  They all have blinking lights and you can tell what they are by the way they fly. I never saw anything like this,all blacked out, no lights, flying not real low, but lower than norma! l.  At the time I was wondering if it was a government drone.  I watched it for about five mins untill it was out of my sight flying south.  I&#39;m posting this wondering if any others in the area saw it?<n>

As we came into town we noticed a shape of lights in the sky.  It was an almost &#34;Y&#34; shaped formation of several individual lights, they were a golden color and stationary.  Then the one on the very bottom of they &#34;Y&#34; began floating downward extremely slowly, as if in slow motion.  From there, the entire formation began to fall apart and go different directions, I cannot say how long the formation was there before we saw it, but the time from us seeing it to its disappearance was only a matter of a couple minutes, it was there and gone quickly.<n>

To the west/southwest of me I observed three (3) red/orange lights in the sky.  The lights were moving in a controlled manner and appeared to be following each other.  There were no other flashing or blinking lights on the red/orange lights.  The lights made a sweeping turn and one by one faded out and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Today is Monday Jan 30th 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: I live in Washington DC. Moving almost exactly from east to west (I have checked the direction on google earth) at about 7:20 pm today (01/29/12) I saw a large group of round white lights, maybe 10 or 12 of them, seemingly apart from each other, in a group, moving far too quickly to be plane/jet/etc.  Although the lights moved around each other at a very fast rate, the group traveled in a straight line  It looked like each white light was moving around each other in a pattern.  Somewhat like bees do around a hive.  I have no idea what this was but what I do know is it was not like anything that I have ever seen before.  I should add that this could NOT be any aircraft known.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This close group of revolving/moving lights moved across the entire sky in approximately 10 seconds.  Fantastic, whatever it was.  I might also add that I have never made any such report before.*other than note above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear at this time.  No way to determine altitude.  I watched this ‘group of lights’ until they reached the horizon and faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason for me making this report is that,  1/ Being the nation’s capitol, I think that this should be looked into.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2/ I would like to find out if there was any other report of what I saw, seeing that we have so many aircraft in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 60 years old.  Have good eye sight with glasses.  UK citizen.  Registered Alien (not a joke).<n>

It occurred four times at uneven intervals over a one hour period, approximately 0130 - 0230 early morning 1/29/2012.  The first three flashes were approximately 5-10 minutes apart; the last occurred about 30 minutes later.  Broken cloud cover and relatively low ceiling sky condition.  Flash effect (shadowing) and intensity (brightness) were similar to what would be expected of a camera flash discharging within about 50 feet of my bedroom window except appeared to originate from the sky, entering my window downward.  No aircraft could be heard - I listened carefully and looked for one.  No vehicle or pedestrian activity on my street at that time - again, I got up, listened, and looked.  No known thunder storm activity in the local vicinity.  No immediate explanation for this.  My oldest son witnessed it once before about a month ago during the holidays.  He was standing outside when it happened.  He claims it was brighte! r than I described.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/28/12 23:00|St. Augustine|FL|Triangle|3 seconds|2 triangle shaped crafts with 5 lights seen with night vision goggles zooming north over the coast of Florida.|2/3/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86928.html|39|ndxe201201| 2 triangle shaped crafts with 5 lights seen with night vision goggles zooming north over the coast of Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four friends and I were using ambient light night vision goggles on the beach of Anastasia park in St. Augustine, FL on Saturday January 28th at 11:00 pm.  I was gazing into the stars when something moving extremely fast, crossed my vision. I wouldn’t have thought much of it however, the objects were only visible though my night vision goggles and appeared closer than any of the other stars I was observing. The next thing I noticed was the shape that these lights where arranged. The 1st object had 5 lights arranged in the shape of an elongated triangle.  This object flew at approximately 80 deg angle over our heads so I was able to get a direct view of the bottom.  The other object was in the same shape but flying at a further angle. It had to be flying at about 45 deg over our heads, which skewed the shape into a staggered linear arrangement of the same lights.  They were in my line of vision for approximately 3 seconds before they disappear from view. They were flying in the north bound direction and came from the south .I had just enough time to pass the goggles to a friend who caught the tail end of their flight and agreed it was not like any of the other stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both objects were in front of the other stars because the shape around the lights blocked out the other stars it was flying in front of. Meaning the outline the 5 lights made on the 1st object was a dense shape and the lights were not flying separately, they were apart of a whole shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five minutes after spotting these objects and getting the other four friends to point their goggles to the sky another single light (the same size/type of the lights on the other two objects) followed in the same direction and speed as the previous sighting.  It couldn’t have been a satellite because they revolve around our equator with a flight path more like east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites, almost invariably, either are in a polar orbit, or they have an easterly component to their ground track.

My friends were looking at the fire and I was looking across the fire at the trees when through a gap in the trees (which in daylight the gap was at around 30 feet) I saw an orange light which was sitting still as soon as I saw the light it accelerated (did not fall!) toward the ground at an unknown speed.  I asked if anyone else had seen the light which no one else was looking in the direction at the moment.  Never saw the light again after staying up all night watching for it.<n>

I saw to my right bright shinning lights.  The object had 2 red lights parellel to one another in the center and white light forming either a diamond shape or a triangle shape of white lights with the 2 red lights in the middle.  I was driving at around 55 mph and the object seemed to not run ahead of me as I stayed with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came to tree lines and valleys as I drove I would lose site of it.  Each time I again saw it the lights had moved more ahead of me.  The last good look at it was when it was just past the lighted tower on Gamble Mill rd.  I went down in a valley and lost site of it and when I got to where I had last saw it,it was gone.I sped to 80 mph and finally saw it again miles ahead and over the tree line.  It then just vanished into the clouds.  Called my friend who lives near the tower and she said her dogs had just started barking and went crazy on them.  They had never done that before so they checked outside but seen nothing.  I know other people saw it as there where other cars on the road.<n>
1/28/12 20:30|Ashkelon (Israel)||Circle|About 20-25 minutes|1 object falling to the sea, 3 other objects hovering and flickering with red lights, untli finally disappearing in super high spped.|2/3/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86914.html|50|ndxe201201| 1 object falling to the sea, 3 other objects hovering and flickering with red lights, untli finally disappearing in super high spped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my fiance were walking on the promenade near the beach, and as we started to go back, my fiance stopped me and told me to look up to the sky.  He pointed somewhere, but I couldn&#39;t understand what he was looking at.  Then I saw it - there were two &#34;stars&#34; that were flickering in white light above the Mediterranean.  At first I thought they were just stars that were closer to earth then the others - that&#39;s why it looked like they were flickering, or maybe even a couple of air crafts - but then they started to move slowly to the west.  It looked like they were floating in the air, just moving next to each other in one straight line.  They&#39;re white lights suddenly changed to red, and there was about a 3 seconds gap between each flicker of each object.  The 2 objects kept moving to the west, when suddenly, one them started to approach us.  I looked around us, and it looked like no one else seemed to notice what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object kept approaching us and then suddenly, and we realized it was actually falling.  It fell very slowly (a couple of minutes) and there was no noise at all when it hit the water, so my fiance and I figured that it must&#39;ve fell somewhere in the Mediterranean between us and Cyprus - too far for us to hear, but close enough for us to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other object seemed to have stopped for several seconds, still flickering, and then continued to the west.  Passing only what looked like a couple of kilometers, 2 more hovering object appeared.   The 3 objects just kept hovering up in the sky without any movement at all, and kept flickering.  It couldn&#39;t have been planes, because planes can&#39;t hover with any movement, and certainly without any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes , the 3 objects flew back east.  They flew slowly the first couple of seconds, and then - I didn&#39;t turn my sight away for even a second, nor did my fiance - they flew away in a super high speed with leaving nothing but a trail of of a dull white light.<n>

I observed what ever it was and it seemed to not move for anything during the first 10-15 minutes.  It was a lot brighter than the stars or any close by planets.  There were also a lot of small planes flying near this strange light, but it still did not move.  This light had an effect like it was from some sort of technology. It would flicker at times and then it would sometimes have a reddish hue to it.  After about 15 minutes or so it started to move away at a very slow speed along the horizon until I lost sight of it behind some trees.  Usually I see a lot of small civilian planes with a bright headlight or cabin light in this area, then the light fades off and you then can see the blinking light formation small planes usually have.  But the light I seen tonight did not look the same as usual. It was much brighter and it did not follow the flight path of the normal aircraft seen in the Lod! i area.  Not much happens in the sky&#39;s here so when something doesn&#39;t look right you can tell.<n>

A lone object of the same color appeared at the end of sighting event.  All objects lost intensity as the fell to the ground.  They moved in a general direction and them simply dived to the ground.  An amazing event.   A am sure many others also so this event including my wife<n>

The front of the house faces a road with a cornfield on the opposite side, the rear of the house is also surrounded by corn fields.  The area we were in has a clear view of the north, east, south, and south western horizons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We began to shoot rifle for about 45-50 minutes outside.  My friends father was focused on attempting a long shot on his rifle, so he was looking through the scope of the rifle and not paying much attention to the surroundings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting there with my friend and his girlfriend when all of the sudden my friend stands up and yells &#34;Oh, my God!&#34; in a very surprised and shocked tone.  I looked over to where he was looking and instantly saw to what he was referring to.  His girlfriend did as well.  My friends father was focused on his shooting and didn&#39;t notice what we were fussing about to look in time at what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw was a large looking teardrop shaped craft.  It has an eerie light neon green color to it.  At the time we saw it the sun was just about to set with plenty of clear daylight still present.  The craft moved at astounding speeds.  It started on the south-western horizon and moved along that horizon at roughly 1.5 miles away from us.  We saw it for about 10 seconds and it was the fastest moving flying object I have seen.  The UFO made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a good perspective of its speed because after we saw it fly then dissapear from view, we saw an aircraft passanger plane flying and it was move substantially slower than the UFO, I would say 1/100th of the speed that the UFO was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weirdest thing out of the whole situation was that after the spacecraft disappeared, we saw a huge line of various types of birds flying in the same flight path.  I identified the birds, being an avid waterfowl hunter and outdoorsmen, as seagulls, Canadian geese, snow geese, and black birds.<n>

Our GPS led us astray, and somehow we got off track, and started traveling down gravel roads instead of the turnpike which we should have taken in the first place.  We were traveling down this little highway when I looked up and noticed this black smoke ring up in the clouds.  Nothing else in the sky even resembled it, and I didn’t see any air craft in the area at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In fact I took pictures of it and I had it in my view for miles.  I commented on it to my husband.  We live in Missouri, so I am not familiar with this area at all.  The closet town that we came to was Gunter, Texas. In one of the pictures I saw different crafts that I didn’t see with my eyes.  I thought it may have been dirt and grime on the wind shield, but if that we true the dirt would show up in the other frames.   This reminded me of something a smoker would puff up in the air but the smoke was very dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Not visible to eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sharing available information and two pictures that were presented to my by a very dear friend that passed away a little more than a year ago.  I had encouraged him to share his sighting at that time, but he was reluctant to do so.  I will attempt to relay his comments as accurately as I can recall them:<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;At noon on 1/28/12, myself and two of my friends were sitting outside of the patio of the Raffaldini Vineyards enjoying a glass of their wine.  It was sunny and beautiful so I decided to take some pictures facing northwest toward the mountains.  The sun was to my back so I don&#39;t think what I caught on my camera was related to lens flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any rate I took two pictures with my iphone about 30 seconds or so apart and noticed lighted objects were captured in the two pictures when I viewed them upon my return home.  Neither myself or my friends saw these objects with the naked eye at the time the pictures were taken.  The attached photos provide all l of the specifics of the pictures.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend had a nice combination of skepticism and open-mindedness and he felt as though he had caught something very unusual in his pictures that were visible to the camera for some reason, but not to the eye.<n>

It was clear, stars in abundance and the temperature in the -20&#39;s.   On the back patio facing North approximately 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon a bright object, star like but in an area where there shouldn&#39;t be a star.  It was the brightest object in a 180 degree arc from side to side.  The Constellation Cassiopeia was just to the right. Size wise it was about twice the size of the star Capella which was to my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur astronomer and it caught my eye immediately.  I observed it for 10 to 15 seconds and then it went out.  I say it this way as it was similar to a large spot light when turned off fading quickly to nothing.  The peculiar thing was that my eyes seemed to take a few seconds to adapt to the background where it had been before I could see the faint stars that are suppose to be there.  There was no missing time, the dog finished her job and I returned to the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light did not move. There was no sound.  I smelled nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived around an air base mostly all my life ( 53 years ) and it definitely was not an air craft.<n>

My oldest son was helping to unload the groceries out of the back of the car when I got a phone call and sat down on our screened in porch talking on the phone with my husband on his way to work.  All of a sudden my son said, &#34;What is that in the sky?&#34; Then he really got scared when it finally moved.  When I first viewed it, it was a HUGE ball of white and appeared totally round in the sky and it was really low.  It didn&#39;t appear to be moving but hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it slowly moved upward and then stopped. It proceeded to move to the right in the sky (our left) above the trees.  As it moved to the left of us we could see there was a small steady red light that was on the end of this object.  As large as this object was there was absolutely no sound.  It proceeded behind the trees at a very quick speed behind the neighbors yard across the road until it was no longer visible.  What could th! is have been?  The scariest thing is that I saw this EXACT same object do the same exact thing at what appeared to be the same area of the sky maybe two weeks ago when I was outside on the phone, but I never had a witness to that sighting.  This is the second time I&#39;ve seen it and I&#39;ve never seen anything strange in the sky before now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What&#39;s so astounding is how large this white light is in the sky!!! It&#39;s way larger than any star in the sky that&#39;s visible! It&#39;s a HUGE white light?!?!!<n>

It was a very bright orange fireball that moved slowly and disappeared.  A few minutes later we heard the sound of helicopter blades above our house.  The helicopter was heading East, following 2 distant orange fireballs that at that moment sped off out of sight.<n>

I looked up into the clear night sky and saw a bright blue object with flashing red lights floating up off in the distance.  I stared in disbelief and motioned for my friend to look.  Immediately in my mind I cycled through possible things it could be.  It was not a plane or anything else I could think of.  I could not explain it and stood dumbfounded and questioning if what I was seeing was really happening. I had never seen a UFO before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stared drifting towards us heading east and it became more visible.  I could see the craft was circular though I could not tell if it was orb or disk shaped. It had bright neon blue lights around the edges and going through the middle.  I couldn’t discern the craft, only the lights surrounding it.  The craft itself was either a dark color or transparent because it blended in with the night sky.  There were flashing red lights positioned around the craft, each light flashing at the same speed but not in unison.  There were probably about five lights, each positioned around the edges of the craft evenly with one in the middle.  The object made no noise and seemed to be a few hundred feet in the air, although it was hard to judge both the size and distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I glanced down from the craft which was moving slowly through the sky I saw in the parking lot that there were others looking up and pointing at the sky.  My friend and I ran across the parking lot over to two others who were standing out of there car with there phones pointed at the sky.  We did not know them but talked briefly with them, asking if they were seeing what we were seeing and remarking how weird and incredible it was.  I noticed others on the opposite end of the lot, probably three or four people, who upon seeing us in the middle of the lot with our cell phones, fingers, and eyes cast to the sky turned to look themselves and also saw and stopped to look at the craft.  I did not bother to pull out my phone because I knew the object was to far away to show up on my cheap cell phone camera.  My friend took out his phone but did not get a picture, remarking that the UFO only showed up as a small blue speck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point a plane few by in the sky, visually appearing to pass by the object but obviously being much higher and much farther off in the distance. The craft came close to being directly over us before it shifted direction and drifted away heading south.  It was then that we decided to get in our car and head home as it was cold outside, being a January night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the last we saw of the object as my friend and I drove away.  My friend watched it out the window as I drove.  We quickly lost sight of it as it was too low in the sky to see from farther away. After losing sight of the object we called the UFO report hotline and reported the case before arriving home.<n>
1/27/12 20:30|Medina|TN|Sphere|60 seconds|Bright, fast moving white light with red/orange pulsating edges moving over Medina Tennessee.|2/3/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86871.html|66|ndxe201201| Bright, fast moving white light with red/orange pulsating edges moving over Medina Tennessee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:16 PM on Friday, January 27, 2012, a friend called me from Jackson, Tennessee and described some strange lights that he and his son were watching in the sky. I live about 8 miles from him in Medina, Tennessee.  After about 6 or 8 minutes I was able to find the lights he was describing.  They were oval shaped lights (about 6) that were moving in a general counter-clockwise circular pattern and were in the southwest sky close to the moon&#39;s position.  There were some clouds in the area of the moon that obscured it.  The lights were reflecting off of these clouds.  I soon identified these as lights from a spotlight since I had seen similar lights rotating in this pattern several years ago (I even drove and found the spotlight in the parking lot of a local club in Jackson).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had called my son, daughter, and wife out to the back porch to check out the lights.  Since I could identify them, I didn&#39;t grab a camera.  As we were watching these lights a bright light appeared out of nowhere at approximately 8:30 PM. The light was due south of our location at about 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon.  It was very bright, mostly steady, solid white but with a reddish/orange pulsating glow around it.  It was traveling directly towards our position. At first I thought it might be a helicopter with its search light on coming straight at us.  However, as it got closer, the light never changed even after it got directly above us. Also, it became apparent that it was actually very high (several miles) and was moving at an extremely high rate of speed.  There was also no sound. It moved in a steady straight path eventually getting to 90 degrees directly above us.  At first I thought that this object was the International Space Station since I have seen it pass over m! any times over the years.  The white part of the light was solid and steady, not blinking, but the outer edges were glowing red and orange with a pulsating action.  The size of the object was also very similar to the size of the station and had a very similar brightness.  However, I have never seen edges like this on the station.  After I came in, I checked the position of the station and it was over Australia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued over our heads and as it got to about 100 or 115 degrees it became reddish/orange only, began to get smaller and smaller until it just blinked out.  My son got my wife&#39;s iPhone and did manage to take video of the object after it passed 90 degrees and until it blinked out.  We viewed the object for about 60 seconds from the time we first saw it until it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am confused about this because of the color and characteristics of the object.  My instinct was that it was a satellite, however, I know of nothing that bright other than the space station and as I said, it was not in our area.  Also, the color was very strange with the pulsating red and orange edges compared to what I have seen of satellites in the past.  I will send the video.<n>

Bright white light hovering over one of the buildings. Stayed there for 20 mins before vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live by this defunct facility.  This is not the first light I have seen over it. (unreported as it was new years eve[midnight] and people were shooting off rockets although not where I saw the light hovering over the smoke stack and has not been there since)  The ONLY lights the facility has are 2 red blinking lights atop the central smoke stack that is about 150&#39;-175&#39; tall.  They are visible during day and night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I wasn&#39;t sure of what my uncle was telling me about, he claimed it was a star. (my uncle has mental retardation and klinefelter&#39;s syndrome, to him it was just a star as he doesn&#39;t know the difference in stars, satellites, planets, or aircraft)  So I decided since I had already seen an unidentified lighted object before that has since not returned I would investigate.  I tried to tell him it was too large to be a star or planet as well too low to the ground.  He went back inside and I walked out of my yard and stood by the factory&#39;s fence to observe, continued to watch the object for 20 minutes before it simply vanished.<n>

My wife and I were in our car, 40 km from Paris, going to Normandy (on highway). I was driving quite slowly when my wife saw and pointed a static cylinder near clouds on the left side of the highway.  It was very bright (sliver), apparently reflecting the sun like an airplane could do but with no wings, no sound, just like a metallic cylinder shape...  The sky was perfectly clear with just some clouds in one spot (the cylinder was very near from that spot).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were watching &#34;that,&#34; and suddenly a very very very bright light like under a spotlight much more brighter than the sun appeared during perhaps 5 or 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, he disapeared like a gun bullet.. a condensation trail appeared slowly and after 2 minuts a beautifull clouds appeared where was the cylinder and got stuck with the others clouds just near. It was a very beautiful scene. Very peaceful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 45 years old, my wife is 37 and early pregnant at that time.<n>

It was about 10:00 PM, Central time.  On the way out to the car, in the parking lot, I looked up and saw what I thought was an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching it, and I realized that it didn&#39;t have the same type of lights as an airplane does.  The lights were white, unlike airplane lights that are green, red, and white, and they were flashing in sequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise such as you hear when a jet flies overhead.  The object was silent or nearly silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be triangular, but it was very hard to tell, since it was dark outside at the time.  I didn’t see any real outline of the object, again probably because it was so dark.  It took a straight path over my head and over the restaurant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a video (I take my camera everywhere), but it was extremely difficult to keep the camera stable without a tripod.  I’m always aggravated with UFO videos that are taken by a camera operator with a shaky hand, but now I realize just how hard it is to keep a moving object in the shot while also trying to watch it yourself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very excited, because I&#39;d never seen anything like this before.  Eventually the object just flew too far to keep track of.  I still don&#39;t know what it was, but I&#39;d certainly like to.  It would be fantastic if someone has the proper equipment to stabilize this clip and/or do some sort of analysis.  As it is, you can&#39;t tell much at all.  Also, I&#39;m sorry for the language at the end.<n>

Suddenly I saw a huge orange ball of fire flying down straight towards my window! I thought it was going to crash agaist it. Luckily it was flying very high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outdoors to see it better.It was much lower, about the distance of a plane flying high. I saw orange flames on the top of the ball, but they weren&#39;t like the flames you see in the fireple.  These flames were somehow joined together and some would go higher than others, but compact.  I thought to myself.:!  Please turn or you will hit and crash against my island!&amp;quot; suddenly I saw the orange ball make a 90 degree turn to the west and disappear in the horizon.  I didn&#39;t even think of taking a photograph, because I was so much taken by the event. It was ony one ball and it did not make any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards  ((name deleted))<n>

It appeared to be of an oval shape, well above the tree lines and had rotating blue lights around it, resembling a carnival ride.  It was heading in the same direction I was, north, and as it got above the buildings at the top of the hill, it seemed to make an immediate sharp right turn.  I was almost at the top of the street when this occurred, and as it made the right turn it seemed at accelerate, then suddenly it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have served in many countries while in the military, and ridden in many types of military helicopters and airplanes, but nothing  I have ever seen resembled this.  The way it disappeared as it accelerated was what caught my eye, as the night was clear and I had an un-obstructed view of the dark where I had seen the whatever it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been inside burning aircraft to remove dead bodies, have seen many things in my life which were amazing and extremely curious, but I have to say that this was without a doubt one of the scariest things I have every witnessed.  I felt more fear on the rest of my drive home than I can ever recall feeling, and even tonight while driving home the same route at the same time I felt a chill as I drove up Miracle Mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot for sure state how big the object was, but if I had to make a guess, I would say it was maybe 20-30 feet, basing this on roughly how high it was in the sky and in relation to the traffic lights at the top of Miracle Mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for taking the time to read this<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, ((name deleted)) Redding, Ca<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally well-spoken and objective in his description of the event.

Parked in Victor and watched for several minutes while they flew back and forth in the southern sky.  Came close enough to see there were two craft but could not identify as a plane or helicopter.  No distinguishable sound, but did hear other planes in the area.  Only one white light on each craft, no other lights and each blinked erratically, sometimes in unison.  We see planes and helicopters, even military all the time in this area and these were not even comparable.<n>

To my right was the Salt Lake. The highway travels parallel to the dry lakebed.  I estimated the highway was about 20 yards above the bottom of the lake.   I had my cruise control set to 74mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No radio, no other vehicles around.   A craft triangular in shape flew up alongside my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 75 feet from my vehicle.  Slow close I could see the texture of the paint.  It was triangular in shape, not unlike what a jet might look like, but triangular because there were no ‘wings’ on the craft but instead it was triangular in shape.  The paint was matt-black.  And the dome on the craft was yellowish and opaque.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed out my peripheral eye line that something was there.  I turned to look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was perfectly visible out the passenger side window.  I estimated the length to be about 1.5 car lengths.  Maybe 15 long.  And the flying height to be at the same altitude off the lakebed as the highway was for it to be visible out my passenger window, maybe 60 -75 feet above the lakebed. As soon as I looked at it, it banked at a 45-60 degree angle and disappeared into a pinpoint as it reached the opposite side of the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimated and later confirmed the width of the lake to be 8-10 miles.  It took approximately 1.5 seconds for the craft to become a tiny dot on the other side of the lake.  Based on my math.  It appears that the craft flew at speeds in excess of 10,000 mph.  It made no sound whatsoever.  And seemed to fly around a corner in the lake as it disappeared.   It appeared to have a sort of anti-gravity component, as it came up to the car and then turned the way it did and was able to travel at such high speeds and so close to the bottom of the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it must be military.  But as I have relayed the info. to some people I know including commercial pilots, the fact that it was completely silent makes one wonder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was headed to Mammoth mountain to ski for a few days with my brother.  I am 47 years old, a mother of three and I live in Malibu California.<n>

Sometimes it would be a red/white flash.  Also when it flashed you could see 6 or 7 perfect circle lights, that made the oval shape when they flashed.  The object never moved out of its spot for the half an hour.  It was no where near any city limits, and even if it was it was way to high in the sky to be anything from a city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fact that the object stayed in the exact same spot proves that it was not a plane.  The flash would happen so fast you would have to concentrate in order to see it.  There was sometimes when the light would flash extremely bright, and other times not as bright.  I found a video from someone recording a ufo sighting during the day, and the ufo would flash the exact same as what i saw.  Same time duration and same exact circle lights forming the oval shape.  Sinse it was dark for me, all i could see was the flashing lights.<n>

I thought I was seeing things when one of the stars, or so I thought, moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that it was just the tree branches moving so I braced myself up against a post and, it moved again.  I just stared at it for awhile, and I have never seen anything move so fast in all my life!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light, of sorts, moved left and then shot back to the right.  It done this a couple of times then, I saw it shoot straight up, then it flashed a red light, then it shot like a dart straight down and it flashed a blue light.  It started just moving to the left and right several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went and got my husband,a nd he said...sure you saw a spaceship, and he laughed.  When I showed it to him, boy did his eyes get huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both didn&#39;t know what we had seen, but I&#39;m sure glad there was a second person that saw what I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for giving me somewhere to go with this information, cause others just wouldn&#39;t believe.<n>

Its shape is similar to that of round saucer thing although its exact form cannot be verified due to distant observation during night time.  Initially spotted when the thing was hovering awkwardly in the sky.  Shortly after that it moves in a &#39;bouncing&#39; style - just like a ball being dropped onto the floor.  Visibility decreases as it flies away.  I am sorry I cant provide any photograhic evidence as I havent got the right device to capture the event.  Cameraphone will do no good in this case. Its maneuverability in the sky just amazes me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> bright flash in bellingham area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A flash of light lit my whole house.  My dog freaked out.  At the same time a friend who lives 15 miles away witnessed this same light and his dog freaked out aswell.  I was wondering if anyone else noticed this.

Sure enough I saw one reddish dot off in the distance if I was looking West towards Pittsburgh.  And closer to us there where three more red and orange dots traveling together in a Triangle formation.  They were changing between the two colors probably due to reflections.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They would not break formation and seemed to slowly disappear.  First one then the second.  You could almost see right through them as if they were turning inadvisable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last one kept going and I ran inside scared because my son was getting scarred because I had the computer in my hands still doing my video chat with my son.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not too much of a believer but I know those were not falling stars or air planes.  I&#39;m not stupid so i know something is up with that!<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s not cool at all we&#39;re all pretty freaked out!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sighting occurred in 2012.

At precisely at 9:25 at night my Mom came running in the house stating that there were Aliens in the sky. Curious but doubtful I walked to the front porch.  Once outside, I got the first glimpse of what I believed to be a UFO. There were four Red/Orange illuminated orb shaped objects.  A single orb disappeared as three began to form a triangle.  I  ran back inside shocked, amazed, and a little spooked.  That&#39;s when I briefly described it to my cousin Chad and my roommate Elly and my Mom.  Quickly convinced we all sprinted back to the porch in time to see the red/orange orbs drifting in  our direction heading West to East.  The three remaining orbs formed an Isosceles   Triangle with the high point of the triangle leading.  The lit up orbs were flickering the entire time.  It drifted to the point that it was almost right above us.  At the first glance there seemes to be a transparent craft causing blurred vision between the triangle points.  Almost as if the three triangle points were holding something together.  It continued East for a moment and one of the back orbs disappeared.  And the left back orb headed South and disappeared momentarily.  The tip orb of the triangle continued on East and disappeared within 40 seconds.  Ffreaky stuff. any questions reply back to<n>

The speed was faster than anything moving in the sky and then the lights suddenly changed direction to move due east. I followed with binoculars for several minutes until it was out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later I witnessed 2 more craft moving from the southwest to the northeast and they maintained the same path without changing direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last sighting was about 5 minutes later and this one was the most incredible.  Again a set of red lights that changed to white and back to red.  Approximately 2-4 lights.  This one moved from the southwest heading north east and after about a minute, completely turned around and went back the way it came from.  Then it turned again to the north and then turned due east going directly over my house.  I don&#39;t know what it was, but the speed and constant lights, not blinking was like nothing else in the sky.  This is the 3rd day this month that I have seen something that is not an airplane moving in the sky over Henderson and almost always moving from the south or southwest to the east or northeast.<n>

We walked past some houses, and then they disappeared.

It was really bright and got brighter then bright then brighter (pulsing from bright to brighter).  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before.  I stood there in awe and I wanted to get a closer look so I ran inside to get binoculars, however after only being inside 10 seconds grabbing the binoculars, when I came back out, the bright fireball ufo was nowhere to be seen.

I recently moved to this part of San Francisco.  My house is on a hill and there is a window facing the ocean.  The ocean is about 3 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was a rising object that looked like a shiny black disc.  When I spotted it, it was a little west of San Francisco State University.  Then the UFO drifted upwards and east.  It revolved horizontally and I was able to see that it was egg or cigar shaped because it would be a small dot and then it would be long and skinny.  When it was long, it was about 3 times the length of when it was a dot.  There was a glare on top of it from the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the UFO more closely with binoculars and it had a black underside and maroon/redish topside. It also appeared to have fins like a fish.  The fins were translucent green and in the same locations as a fish.  A fin on top, a fin on bottom, and a larger &#34;tail&#34; fin.  It was as large as a blimp but I didn’t see any entry points on the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unable to see it after it climbed in altitude and was in front of the sun.<n>

I am an avid “sky-watcher”, and enjoy watching the sunrise/cloud formations.  This particular morning, I’d stopped to wait for the dog to finish sniffing about, and stared up and toward the S-SE sky. Very light, cirrus clouds, mostly clear sky, sun just rising, illuminating clouds.  I noticed an object, appeared to be round, or very slightly ovoid, high in sky.  I waited for it to move, thinking it was either a plane, or a satellite. It did not move, at all, in any direction. This area is about 10-12 miles from Ft. Laud. Int’l Airport, and I see jets, helicopters, cargo planes, etc., all the time….we’re also close to the Executive Airport, private planes.  The sunlight reflected off of it, and it appeared to be metallic, silvery, shiny. I stared at it for a good five minutes, and then had to leave for my home, across street.   About a minute later, arriving at the! house, I peeked up again, and it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly, I forgot about the entire incident, and went on MUFON the following day, as a friend up in VA had had a sighting, and I wanted to see if there’d been another reports made, in her area.  I was surprised to see that another local resident, in Coral Springs, about 5 miles north of me, had reported basically what I’d seen.  I reported to MUFON, that morning, the 26th, as well.<n>

I know commercial flights do not fly that close and there was no noise from either craft and they were low enough to where I should have heard sound.<n>

It was very far away, hovering just above the tree line.  It appeared as a very bright star that continuously blinked with all colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for at least 15 minutes as it hovered and occasionally moved erratically left, right, up down, back and forth.  After observing for some time we ruled out the possibility of it being a star, a satellite, a plane, a helicopter or a balloon because none of those objects have the ability to make the kinds of movements that this object was making. It was very far away and all we had to magnify with was a pair of binoculars. In the binoculars it appeared as a pinpoint (orb) and was very far but closer than a star appears in binoculars.  When it went below the tree line we drove to a local field to continue to observe it.  It was still there but appeared to have move further south.  It was still too far away for us to be able to clearly identify it.  The area this object would have been observed is the Gulf of Mexico, west coast of Florida, around the Cedar Key area.<n>

First I saw what I thought was a shooting star fly behind a tree as I just caught a glimpse.  From the same direction a few seconds latter another one came across the sky which I first expected to be a shooting star.  It shot across the sky and then made a hair-pin 90 degree turn followed by an L turn heading away from me with a little bit of a spiral and faded out. It made very fast and sporadic movements with an incredible speed and sudden changes of direction. It moved kind of like and insect but it was very brite and kind of made me think of a firefly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Really unlike anything I have seen and did not seam at all like an aircraft of any kind. I also could not tell how close it was or its relative size and distance. It was no closer than 350 feet but may have been much further.  It was also strange that when I first saw what I thought was a shooting star I was looking for what I thought was a second shooting star as if I expected it before it appeared again in its spectacular yet surrealism.  It also was not defined like a shooting star but more glowing like but unmistakable and bright it is appearance but very soft on the eyes.  It also looked like a mix between an electrical spark, a shooting star and an orb or what I would best describe as glowing white light.  I always thought a UFO would be more clearly defined as a light that looked like a large star with more linear movements.  This was more difficult to define or to relatively grasp.  Its movements were also graceful yet complex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea how to explain.<n>

If it were a plane or helocopter, the engines/rotors should have been easily heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I initially thought it could have been a balloon tied to the ground bobbing in the wind with a light attached, but as it started moving far from the original spot, towards the horizon and back, far out of the range of a balloon string, I ruled that out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I captured about 5 minutes of footage with my phone.  It conveys the silence and the movement, but falls short on conveying the intense color of the light.  I started filming about a minute or 2 after i spotted it and the video ends about 8 minutes before I lost visual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJpyArOlPiw&amp;list=UU-ViVnRJYEqpn9TCGjTNIA&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plcp<n>

The lights were in an equilateral triangle formation and not moving at all. After only a few moments, perhaps 45 seconds, one of the lights went away; it appeared to have been turned off.  It reminded me of how a bulb still glows slightly for a split second once it has been shut off.  After about 5 seconds, the remaining two lights went out at the exact same time (and in the same &#34;slow&#34; manner).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were not seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> bright flash in bellingham area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A flash of light lit my whole house. My dog freaked out.  At the same time a friend who lives 15 miles away witnessed this same light and his dog freaked out aswell.  I was wondering if anyone else noticed this.  I have never seen a UFO and don&#39;t nessasarly beleive in them, but I can not think of another explaination.  My girlfriend has witnessed a similar occurance.

1/24/12 18:20|Chesapeake|VA|Unknown|10 min|Two intense, multi-colored, pulsating lights/objects aloft in vicinity of Chesapeake, VA|2/3/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86820.html|115|ndxe201201| Two intense, multi-colored, pulsating lights/objects aloft in vicinity of Chesapeake, VA<n> <n><n> <n><n> Chesapeake, VA, (approx 36-44N 76-13W) on 24 Jan 2012 from approx 1820-1830 EST while grilling on the BBQ, I noticed an intensely bright, pulsating, multi-color light (altenating red, blue, violet) in the air to the west of my location at about a 45 degree inclination above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it may be a helicopter, as it appeared to be “hovering”.  I then saw a second, similar light to the left (SW) of it at a lower altitude.  Having no point of reference, I could not estimate the distance, but guess at least several hundred yards up to a mile.  They each then began to display an “on-off” flashing yellow-white light in addition to the pulsating, changing color lights and they began very quick, erratic, “hummingbird-like”, “dancing” movements, up, down, left, right over great distance.  I was once a high speed  morse code operator and could not distinguish any intelligible “code” from the flashing lights, although they did appear to be in deliberate! pattern/sequence, not random. The flashing light of the second object appeared to respond to the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes after first observing the lights/objects, a small, single engine propeller aircraft approached from west to east  (common route to/from Chesapeake Municipal &amp; Norfolk International airports).  The plane was at about 1500 feet altitude. As the plane approached, the two lights/objects quickly dropped from view below the treeline several hundred yards to my west. After the plane had passed overhead and to the east, the two lights/objects quickly reappeared and continued their “dance” for a few more minutes before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear evening, shortly after sunset with only several high altitude jet aircraft vapor trails visible in the night sky. A partial moon was in view to the northwest. Other than the bright lights, where the yellow-white flashing lights were to the immediate left of the multi-colored, pulsating “halogen-like” ones, I could not discern any form or shape of the objects from which they emanated. There was absolutely no sound coming from them that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were like nothing I’d ever seen.  Surely they were not from conventional aircraft, fixed wing or rotary, and they were definitely not weather balloons or “natural phenomena”.  I thought possibly kids with REALLY sophisticated radio-controlled devices? Maybe, but I really don’t think so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any case, I’ve never reported anything like this before, and seeing them is what caused me to search the internet for similar sightings, which brought me to this web site.  I’m neither a “believer” nor “non-believer” in UFO’s.  My jury is still out.  But I did nearly burn my chicken.  A small price to pay for a really interesting light show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 30 year military career retiree still serving as a civilian in security management.<n>

It was very difficult to see, even with the scope but actually appeared larger to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything like that in all my 33 years, and my girlfriend saw it as well.

Fort Lauderdale, Fla. but it was not normal in the way it was flashing so I grabbed my binoculars for a closer look, and what I observed was unlike any light source that I have ever seen before, what made this unusual was the way it was all over the place when it flashed, the pattern or timing of the flashes were very erratic, the pulses were in small groups of @ 2-5 pulses, and as it was doing this, is was slowly dropping lower to the horizon, it was already low in the sky from the start at @ 25 degrees, going down to @ 15 degrees, it descended at a slow speed, as if it was on a parachute, it could have been moving away from me and getting lower on the horizon for that reason as well, it was a very small cluster of flashing lights with all colors present, to the naked eye it looked like one very small light, with binoculars you could see it was many different lights, I will create an animation as best I can for an example. This animation has only 9 frames, so it does create a pattern, I watched this for exactly 5 minutes and there was no pattern, it was always different and erratic until it vanished.<n>

We watched the object move from our left to right from our westward viewpoint at a very rapid speed, it then made a 90 degree clockwise turn around a star and then headed downwards before turning back  On itself and seemingly slowing down before fading away. the object seemed to be very high up and made no sound whatsoever in the time of witnessing the object i didn&#39;t flash and stayed a very solid bright light and looked nothing like id have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be seemingly quite sincere and credible.

I noticed an orange colored fireball shape making its way across the sky.  Because DFW airport is near, I initially figured it was a landing plane; however, there is no glowing orange landing lights of that I am aware.  I was unable to make out any directional lighting i.e. green and red wing tip lights.  It seemed to be moving faster than that of a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I watched it for several seconds, it made no change in direction.  The object from my perspective and location moved from a South Eastern direction to a North Westerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When a commercial plane on approach to DFW came into my view with its landing lights on, I was able to compare the two objects.  I was able to compare the light temperatures which were clearly different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the orange glow was much larger than that of the planes landing light. Although the orange object appeared closer to my location ! than that of the plane.  I was able to make out the directional green and red lights, in addition, the flashing strobe on top of the commercial plane in the distance.  The orange object did not have any additional lighting.  I also noticed that the orange fireball shape was moving away from my direction and away from the direction of DFW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition, the orange fireball object appeared to be at a higher altitude than the plane. Once it was in the NW quadrant from my location the orange glow went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was waiting to hear the whine of engines or growl of a rocket thrust and heard neither.  My only regret is that I stood watching in awe instead of running for a video camera.<n>

It blinked pretty steady and each blink would show a different amount. It would blink and we would see three lights usually close together and usually in a line. The next blink would show one or two, every blink was different and bright. At one point I saw them blink in a square formation, with four lights as the corners. my husband and I saw two of them &#39;race&#39; for a moment.  That was when we knew they were not a typical aircraft or just lights in the sky.  This blinking went on for several moments and at times we could see what looked like high beams stretching out in front of them but the light would just stop like there was a wall but this all clearly happened in the clouds over the hills.  The clouds were low and unusually thick looking. We had to pull over and watch them.  My mother and a niece pulled over and got out of their vehicle to watch them too.  This went on for fiftee! n to twenty minutes but we needed to get home so we lost sight of them.<n>

Truck driver saw massive craft as big as a mountain with lights over West Virginia.|2/3/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86925.html|126|ndxe201201| Truck driver saw massive craft as big as a mountain with lights over West Virginia<n> <n><n> <n><n> A truck driver in West Virginia saw what he claims was an other-worldly craft hovering over a mountain while going on his usual lane in the early morning of Monday (01/23/12).  Around 3 am, GreyBeatle (known here only by his username) saw what he first thought was a town of some sorts on top of a mountain.  He usually travels through there with his truck so immediately he knew that it couldn&#39;t be that, since there was never anything there before.  Then, as he pondered what those lights could be, they began to move in unison as if belonging to a single body, a craft, the size of which he guesses was at least half of the mountain.  It was hovering as it moved, but very slowly.  He could tell it was hovering since it was at the very top of the mountain and he could see the terrain below it. The sighting lasted 5 to 7 minutes and the witness claims he heard no sound coming from the craft as he drove off.  No shape was given to the massive craft since it was a dark and! rainy and the sky was not very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the transcript of the entire conversion:  GreyBeatle: saw a flying saucer in WV GreyBeatle: last sunday GreyBeatle: I&#39;m sure it was.. for about 5 minutes.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> GreyBeatle: But then i realized there were like 5 military bases there.. so it was likely some kinda secret air craft GreyBeatle: The thing i don&#39;t understand.. is why if you want to keep it secret do you put 10 million lights on it? Interviewer: Was it disc-shaped, diamond, spherical?  What kind of shape was it? GreyBeatle: naw.. it was more like a big floating upside down mountain GreyBeatle:  I drove past it flying in the mountains at about 3AM..<n> <n><n> <n><n> GreyBeatle: in the middle of a rain storm GreyBeatle: nobody on the roads or out.. but a stupid truck driver to see it GreyBeatle: it was actually Monday Morning GreyBeatle: Sunday night.. whatever Interviewer: Did it have any lights? If so, what color were they? Plain white or multi-color lights? GreyBeatle: white.. all white GreyBeatle: maybe yellowish GreyBeatle: hard to tell GreyBeatle: Had millions of them GreyBeatle: like all close together.. was wild Interviewer: you said it was big? like an upside down mountain? GreyBeatle: yah.. huge GreyBeatle: I thought it was a town on a mountain at first.. until i realized there was nothing under it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> GreyBeatle: didn&#39;t hear a sound except my truck.. was listening for engine&#39;s or anything to make it fly.. heard nothing GreyBeatle: funny thing tonight tho.. my radio antenna is glowing red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> GreyBeatle: when i&#39;m driving GreyBeatle: real odd GreyBeatle: like some sort of radiation or something Interviewer: You couldn&#39;t see it clearly? Was it the weather? GreyBeatle: Yes.. dark, raining bad GreyBeatle: will look at it in the morning with my pre trip.. i only told two of my buddies who absolutely know i&#39;m not insane GreyBeatle: Weirded out about saying anything to anyone about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> End of transcript.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness, for some reason,  indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

1/23/12 00:00|Shanghai (China)||Circle|3-4 minutes|Orange Orb sighting in Shanghai, China, Chinese New Year, January 23, 2012.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96831.html|127|ndxe201201| Orange Orb sighting in Shanghai, China, Chinese New Year, January 23, 2012<n> <n><n> <n><n> I accompanied my mother and stepfather on a trip to Shanghai, China in on January 7, 2012.  We went there so that my mom could get a specific set of treatments that lasted almost six weeks for a very rare cancer that she had.  The treatments were successful; but that is not what this is about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 23, the very first night of the Chinese New Year 2012, my mom&#39;s doctor, ((name deleted)), his girlfriend ((name deleted)), my stepfather&#39;s granddaughter ((name deleted)) and I all went to the Bund aka the Zhongshan Dongyi Road waterfront area in central Shanghai to celebrate the incoming Year of the Dragon with thousands of Chinese and other visitors for the from all over the world.  The Bund is the picturesque area overlooking the Yangtze River where the river takes a dramatic bend and where the most incredible and unique architecturally designed buildings reside along both sides of  its bank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of the buildings, hotels, banks, etc. in that area are very, very modern and very, very tall skyscrapers that are elaborately lit up as soon as night falls.  They are truly something to behold.  Not all of the buildings are new, but are older, well preserved buildings that are also elaborately lit up when evening comes to show off their glory from an earlier time in Shanghai history when the Germans had an influence on the architecture in Shanghai.  Whenever you see a picture/photo of Shanghai you will most often see the area that I am describing here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I forget the name of the hotel we ended up celebrating the beginning of the Year of the Dragon in, but it was gorgeous and it had close to 120 floors.  We ended up spending the evening in a very scenic cocktail/party lounge area that occupied the entire 97th floor.  We arrived at about 10:30 pm that night.  We went there to celebrate, enjoy the crowd, the beautiful panoramic view overlooking the all of Shanghai, the Yangtze River and the all of the amazing skyscrapers on both sides of the river that were beautifully lit up and shimmering over the Yangtze.  We could look down through any window on that floor and be able to see the fireworks that were being fired up into the sky from hundreds of different areas of the city and beyond.  We had to look down upon the fireworks because they weren&#39;t able to reach up and explode in the sky as high up as we were on the 97th  floor.  You also could literally walk from one window to the next and then end up where you started from to get an even broader view of the city.  In other words, we had a panoramic view from every angle of the lounge since all the walls on the 97th floor were made of window glass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They really go for the gold in China on the very first night of the Chinese New Year—a celebration that goes on for almost two weeks.  This night was particularly special because it was the Year of the Dragon and super special because it was the the night I saw an orange orb in the sky fly between my building and the building across the Yangtze River from me.  It was an orange orb that flew much higher in the sky than any of the fireworks were able to reach that were exploding below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is where my sighting begins:  At exactly ten seconds before midnight everyone started the New Year&#39;s Eve countdown.  When the clock ticked to midnight we all began cheering, toasting each other and giving each other hugs.  It was at that very same moment when most of the people around us were still embracing and wishing each other a “Happy New Year” that ((woman&#39;s name deleted)), my stepfather&#39;s granddaughter, asked me to look out the window to help her identify what this strange round orange orb was that was coming toward us from just above and maybe about a quarter of  a mile behind one of the buildings facing us on the opposing bank of the Yangtze.  It was a bright orange glowing ball/orb.  It was not overly bright, nor emitting a glare. I would say that 99.8%  of it was orange with only a slightly bit yellow at the back end of it.  However, I couldn&#39;t see the tiny bit of yellow on the back of it until it made a smooth and steady turn in front of me--going from my right to my left as I faced it--between our building and the building it had to pass in front of and over the river in order to make that turn.  Before making that turn though, ((woman&#39;s name deleted)) and I initially thought the orange orb could possibly have been a type of flare that the military uses a parachute to suspend it from to light up an area; but we decided, no, it couldn&#39;t have been a flare because it wasn&#39;t floating down--it  maintained its height and was coming toward us too fast and too steadily to be that type of flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my very first sighting of it it took approximately eight to ten seconds for it to reach the area where it made the turn between the buildings.  I really got a good look at it.  It was gliding, but going fast.  It flew in the air space a helicopter would fly in and, yet, it was flying so low in the sky in an area where any jet, large or small, would never be allowed to fly within.  I have to add that I have never seen, nor do I believe I ever will see a helicopter or airplane/jet make such a fast-gliding sharp/tight turn—I don&#39;t believe its possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We weren&#39;t the only ones who saw it because several people around us were shouting out, “UFO!”  Right at the moment when the orange orb began making its turn over the river I excitedly asked Dr. ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted)) to come over and take a look at it with me.  He was a little bit farther away from the window than I was within the interior of the lounge.  They were in an embrace, but I felt that I had to break them up in order to call both their attention to the orange orb in the sky.  I didn&#39;t feel guilty!  As I began calling out to Dr. ((name deleted)), that is when ((woman&#39;s name deleted)) took off running from one window to the next in an attempt to keep sight of the orange orb until it disappeared.  A few others ran after it with her, as I recall  I didn&#39;t run after it; I&#39;m not the running type.  It was too crowded in the lounge and as  I say, I started having a conversation with Dr. ((name deleted)) about what we all had just witnessed.  He said that he, himself, had seen many UFO&#39;s in China—that many people often do.  In fact, so did Yoko.  They acted like it really was no big thing and weren&#39;t nearly as excited as I was about it.  I was in a tizzy because it was my first experience with a UFO!   It wasn&#39;t a jet, it wasn&#39;t a helicopter, nor a parachutist.  It was a UFO--none of us could explain what it was, so it had to be a UFO.<n>
1/22/12 23:10|Cincinnati|OH|Fireball|5 mins|9 red fireball-like objects hovering in line formation up and down and at angles accelerating quickly and descending slowly.|1/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86790.html|128|ndxe201201| 9 red fireball-like objects hovering in line formation up and down and at angles accelerating quickly and descending slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was lying in bed next to my girlfriend and next to an east facing window at roughly 11:10pm EST 01/22/12, Downtown Cincinnati when I saw a flash of light from the left corner of my eyes.  I turned my head, looking southeast out the window and noticed a round orange/red globe/orb-like object floating along without sound traveling northwest toward my condo.  My girlfriend and I were astonished by its ability to drift, sometimes moving up or down unlike that of a helicopter or private jet! The object was coasting at a pretty good clip.  At this point I climbed higher into the window to get a better less inhibited view through the glass as opposed to through glass and outer screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment we noticed another object just like the first following a short distance behind approx ½ mi. Then came another and another.  Those that followed totaling 5 or 6 more were performing maneuvers unlike the first three and more peculiar.  My girlfriend again pointed out two more circling each other to our southeast while those behind them were hovering very close to the tops of the city skyscrapers around the corner of Seventh and Vine and then finally nearing the ground hovering straight down at roughly Race and 9th St. Downtown Cincinnati.  The one that initially appeared to land on a building top came slowly down at that junction and out of sight once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded to film those closest to the downtown buildings rather than following those who were in a straight path out of sight north and west of my home.  The angle from my vantage point to the objects’ was somewhere between 20 and 45 degrees from the ground.  They were straight up halfway across the 8 or 9 Cincinnati City Blocks from east to west on a map.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The remaining 2 objects exploring the downtown building tops eventually in just under a minute began to make their way due north up the I71 corridor and out of site.  The objects’ diameter appeared to be a car’s length maybe slightly longer.  I estimated by the size of the object that appeared to land on the building in relation to the size of the rooftop.  We were not sure what to do exactly however with a little research we found the NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have 2:44secs of footage taken from my Droid Camcorder to accompany this report.<n>

I continued to watch while my sister went for the brand new sony dcr-sx45 handycam.  Then I started to film and use the 70x zoom, It was then that we realized what we were witnessing a ufo, our first sighting. It was a circle almost plate like and continued to more almost like spinning in place.  To the naked eye you could not see the movement but it continued to spin and dark back and forth, getting closer and further from us with-in the blink of an eye.  Then it started to change color producing a dark but bright purple light, almost like a small flash.  Then it changed into what at first seemed like a cross and then a triangle, at the end of the recording u can see it almost like wings flapping and within a blink it disappeared.  About 15 to 25 minutes around 7:15 pm January 22, 2012<n>

It moved from east to west gradually gaining altitude until it disappeared.  A lear jet climbing out of orlando executive airport had a front row seat on this object and there is no way they they did not see it.  The object made no sound and was medium to dark grey.  I have ten years naval aviation experiance.<n>
1/22/12 18:04|Poinciana/Kissimmee|FL|Formation|4-6 min|6:04pm Kissimmee/Poinciana 1/22/12  Three objects in triangle form one suspends, other two move opposite directions different speeds|2/3/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86986.html|135|ndxe201201| 6:04pm Kissimmee/Poinciana 1/22/12  Three objects in triangle form one suspends, other two move opposite directions different speeds<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Jan 22, 2012 @ around 6pm I was outside with my kids watching them play when I noticed strange things in the horizon. I live in Poinciana, FL and I believe that the direction would be to my SW, but I&#39;m not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I do know is that there were 3 orb things with a glowing look to them.  They almost formed a triangular pattern, with the top one standing still in the air, the bottom left one was moving at a fast pace to the left, and the bottom right one was moving super slow to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I thought it was a shooting start, but it freaked me out because my neighbors dogs were going crazy barking and going nuts.  We have woods across the street from me, so the one on the left zoomed out of view rather quickly, but I kept following the one moving to the right. It was going in a straight line slowly but it had a smoketail kind of like a jet would have.  That wasn&#39;t my concern, it was the one that wasn&#39;t moving at all. It was just hanging in the sky.  Then I went and got my phone and started to record it and @ 6:04 pm I shot a 35 second video of the hovering orbish thing taking off and going straight up into the sky and then it shot up over my house and head at a phenomenal rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I&#39;m not sure of the direction but it was headed towards Orlando way, which I think is NE of me.  I literally had to record with my body in an almost backbend stance because of how fast it went and I was trying to keep up with it by following the jetstream clouds it was leaving. It ended up looking like a rainbow shaped curve before it just went horizontal off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I showed the video to my husband who thought I was crazy, but he is convinced now too.  He says there is no way a pilot could withstand the G-force or even fly that fast.  These objects were small in comparison to the occasional plane or jet we have flying around here, which makes me believe they were at a very high elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My video is not very clear but you can see the quickness and hear the dogs barking.  I can send it to anyone who is interested in looking at it or dissecting it.  It wasn&#39;t shot on a fantastic phone and it was zoomed in as much as I could but it&#39;s available for review.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found this website looking for similar activities just to validate that I&#39;m not losing my mind because I&#39;ve been noticing a lot of strange things going on in the sky and I&#39;ve kind of been paranoid about the whole 2012 thing.  When I saw the Orlando pilot reporting similar activity within minutes of my video, I had to post this because it is no coincidence for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, there are no Army, Navy, AF bases that I know of around here; only the Orlando airport on one side of me and a very very small airport in Winter Haven on the other side of me and there was no sound.  Also, it was still daylight during this time, the sun was setting but sky was visible.  My sister was also on the couch looking out the front door and saw the shooting star looking one too.<n>

I wasn&#39;t scared, but more like in shock that anything was going to happen like it did, I wanted to take a Picture, but I figured by the Time I click this &amp; that on my Cell Phone it would most likely be gone and sure enough, less than 10 Seconds it went.  I tried another Nite to do it again, to see if anything would happen again, but nothing, that was the first Time in my Life something like that ever happened to me.<n>

I said, &#34;what the heck is that?&#34; and proceeded to get up and have a better look....at that point, I noticed that there were more--many more--coming behind the first that I&#39;d seen.  I called the rest of the family and we all stood on our deck and watched.  It was very surreal as it appeared we were being invaded!   I&#39;m guessing they were flares, but I&#39;m not sure now that I&#39;ve seen so many similar reports.  I&#39;d say they were each about the size of Venus or Jupiter on a good night, reddish/orange, solid (no blinks) and just seemed to dissipate like a flare might.  But there were at least 15-18 total that we saw in about a 2 minute period, really.  They just kept coming, one set behind the other.<n>

It had no lights or anything that would normally draw your attention to it, it was more like a silhouette against the night sky. It made no noise and simply glided through overhead. I would never have noticed had I not been looking up right at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was only partly cloudy this evening and the stars were out where you could observe them, the moon was nowhere to be seen.<n>

1/21/12 21:00|Manchester|NH|Circle|4 minutes|4 colored figures hover in the sky|1/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86757.html|141|ndxe201201| 4 colored figures hover in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 9:00 pm my dog was agitated.  He had a confused look and was staring right at me making funny noises.  Then he went in the kitchen area and laid down but his body was erect, this is not normal for him unless he hears something outside.  He was whimpering but it was different than let me out normal sounds.  I tried to let him outside but he wouldn&#39;t go so I went out to have a cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up at the sky and there were 4 figures other than stars.  What got my attention was they were all together just sitting there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The colors were very distinctive.  The colors were red, yellowish and green I think.  I don&#39;t recall anything other than all four were hovering and the lights were sparkling.  These things move so fast I can&#39;t tell if the lights were going around the saucer or just flashing quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for about 2 minutes and one went quickly off to the right in a white streak a bolt of lightening then it was gone.  The second one not long after as I watched it just faded and was gone, no movement involved.  I watched the other two for a few minutes and they just faded right in front of my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after they left I saw what was about 20 objects in the sky in some kind of formation.  These were shaped like a skinny oval.  I don&#39;t know how else to explain it.  They were like the color of stars but different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came in the house for about 5 minutes and they were gone, the formations.  I looked to the west and above my house and could see clearly there were stars there and the formations to the north were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear , there were a lot of stars in the sky after they vanished.  I saw the figures clear enough and all the colors.  This is my 3rd sighting in my life and I reported the last one in Manchester NH about 30 years ago or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This truly amazes me and I am not afraid but I can&#39;t tell many people because they think your nuts. I need to report this because you wouldn&#39;t have UFO sighting reports if there weren&#39;t UFO&#39;s out there.<n>

All night Dec 21 - 22 Yellowish white, and blueish white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving down a back road in the country when I saw multiple aircraft in the sky, half could be recognized as human make by the colors of the lights.  The remainder I myself could not explain. At first they seemed like stars, blending in until we went around curves in the road and they had... moved. Almost like they were following us, they were shaped almost like a V and the light coming off them was flashing.  Really fast and almost un-noticeable. We stopped to get out and look to see what it was and they started moving.  Left to right, at first, then in other patterns. I could easily tell that the human aircrafts&#39; were in some kind of formation because they were all kind of close together but the others I could barely distinguish from bigger stars.  The next night (Dec. 22) I saw these same stars, but in totally different places in the sky.  Almost like they followed me home.  (My home is on the far side of town from the first sighting) It&#39;s hard to explain!  all of this typing but this is the best I can really do at this moment.<n>

We was walking on a path|1/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86806.html|144|ndxe201201| A circular light (pale blue in color) was sighted by myself and one friend on the evening of 21 January 2012.  We was walking on a path surrounded by fields just a little west of Lamprechtshausen.  The first thing we saw was a light in the distant sky that was slowly getting bigger.  Of course, at first we didn&#39;t think anything of this as for all we knew it could have been a helicopter.  Then, after 10-20 seconds my friend said &#34;that helicopter is very quiet.  Perhaps it is a specialised military helicopter that is to be used by the military&#34;.  Then a few seconds later we both noticed that the colors of the lights were also quite odd to belong to a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 20-30 seconds after we noticed the colours of the lights on the &#39;helicopter&#39; was strange, it flew almost directly over us. Instead of being a helicopter, it was just a ball of light.  It made no sounds and the size of the light was getting bigger and smaller (pulsing?).  It was as fast as a helicopter or small plane, and about as big as an auto.  It was about 200 meters in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Well sure enough her and her daughter both saw a huge bright around 8 pm.  And it looked like a ball that is flying or burning with flames in blue orange and white, I thought it might be a planet being obstructed by clouds but after I see no clouds it has me wondering what it really was!  This went on for just over an hour and the flashing was irregular. I do have it recorded on camcorder but it&#39;s not very clear :(  although u can see the light go from bright to dim.  I looked tonight if I can see it again but nothing yet lol.<n>
1/21/12 19:15|Spring Hill|FL|Circle|2  to 5 min|FIRE IN THE SKY|1/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86776.html|146|ndxe201201| We live in Spring Hill Florida, The sighting occurred about 7:15 on Jan 21st 2012.  ((woman&#39;s name deleted)) my wife was sitting in the front enjoying the warm weather and talking on the phone with a friend.  It was a very clear night with no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came outside sat down and looked up and saw a fire ball in the sky over the tree line, traveling in a slightly northeast direction coming from the Gulf.  The craft at first site looked like a meteor or an asteroid, or something of the sort.  This thing was huge, and headed towards our direction, then I saw the other one appear, not as close that came into view rising above the tree line.  The images and video provided give no justice to what we originally saw because it was the tail end after the account and fly by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stunned, shocked and frozen in awe. While frozen I started to think this is no meteor or asteroid, I also thought could this be a plane on fire going to crash. I decided to rush in and get Sam my daughter out of the shower, because I was very uncertain what I saw and worried.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I scrambled to find my video camera, could not find it and grabbed my digital camera instead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I got back outside they were already over the house and at a much higher altitude. I started snapping pictures of it with my digital camera.  ((daughter&#39;s name deleted)), my daughter started videotaping with her camera on video mode.  The images look like dots, sorry best I could do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted again)) my wife, has a very good account as they flew over when I was inside scrambling for my camera, she was outside the whole time.  My best guess, the size of the object was at least 5000 square feet round, there were two of them and they were silent, and made no noise whatsoever.  The objects were round, burning fire in the middle and glowing orange red around the parameter circling the burning center.  These objects were very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will personally never doubt anyone who claims they saw something. Unfortunately, by the time I got my camera they were already over the house at a much higher altitude. Also, I was smoking, so you can see this in some of the pictures. Had I not been in such shock I would have not hesitated so long to grab something to record the incident sooner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((wife&#39;s)) Account  Jan 21st 2012 around 7:11 pm at night I saw something in the sky that was not any aircraft, like a helicopter, airplane, jet etc.  It had glowing fire in the middle and reddish orange colored lights surrounding the object.  The lights were circular and the whole thing glowed like an asteroid you see in the movies.  The objects were big and there were two objects in the sky.  Through the whole incident I was completely stunned and seemed to be emotionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first one came above the tree line across the street above my neighbor’s house then a second one followed.  They were flying low when they appeared then flew over our house.

I was in the middle of the city, walking east, when I glanced north and saw the objects moving from the northwest (seemingly coming from over the Pacific Ocean), and moving to the east (or slightly southeast).  I could not see their full passage through the sky, as part of it was blocked by neighborhood buildings (they were not extremely far above the horizon, and my view of them could be obstructed by three-story building across the street from where I was).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were not making any sound that was audible from where I was walking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Relative to a star or planet in the night sky, the objects were about the same size or slightly bigger than the planet Jupiter.  They twinkled slightly, as stars do, and did not emit a pattern of blinks.  The air was steady (no wind) and the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the objects moved inland, they gradually faded into the distance until no longer visible.  They moved at about the speed of a commercial jet through the sky, if not slightly faster.  They did not leave trails, and were distinct objects, moving from left to right, rather than vertically or at an angle, as shooting stars or space debris passing through the Earth’s atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not notice a distinct formation in which they were moving, except that they were all moving in the same direction and disappeared in approximately the same area.  They were not traveling in a line, but were rather staggered in elevation, and moving at the same pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed the last one I saw out to someone else who was outdoors at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out twice later in the evening, and did not see similar objects again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally eloquent, objective, and credible.  We suspect that she is a very capable, and reliable, witness.  Witness corrected the date of sighting, and we have amended the date above.  PD))<n>

As I picked it up, I noticed a large triangle shape in in the sky. (It was still dark).  The Triangle had the point pointing downward and had about four bright lights on each side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling from the Northwest to Southwest and was much higher than a Jet would be. There was no sound coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was trailing about four streams of burning trails from each of the bright orange lights.  I could not tell if the object was on a frame or around a solid object.  It seemed to me to be four or five stories in height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole episode took only 6 to 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was wondering if the object was a falling piece of space junk or a real UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any enlightenment would be welcome.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired Police Chief and considered a reliable person in this town.<n>

It was not a helicopter. I continued to watch it as we turned North on Long Beach Blvd. and it was still visible as we stopped at a Chevron Gas Station on the Corner of Long Beach Blvd. and PCH. As we got out of the car I continued to watch it as my boyfriend pumped gas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of a sudden, about 3 smaller orange lights “fell” from the large orange globe. (Unsure if the falling lights were other craft or not.) I exclaimed in surprise to my boyfriend and he came over to watch. Then another several lights fell from it again, bringing to mind an image of embers falling or liquid metal dripping as the smaller lights fell and faded as they fell below our line of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the main orange orb disappeared. It did not fade into the distance as a plane would. It was just GONE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

My daughter is 14 my son is 11.  It was 10:30 pm and we were traveling east on Elliot rd between Dobson and Alma School.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just north of Elliot at roughly 400 feet were three circular orange globes.  Two were at 400 feet one was another 100 feet or so above the two.  I knew immediately it was a technology that officials claim doesn’t exist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove back and forth doing several u-turns while I told the kids, &#34;I told you UFO’s were real.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> If we went more than a block or so from the spot next to the road where they were hovering they looked like stars.  At one point while heading back west on Elliot my daughter said, &#34;Oh dad they are real close to the ground.  OHHH DAD they’re right there, I’m scared.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the other cars were oblivious and obviously were not seeing the objects.  I would have missed them as well except at the exact moment that we were in the spot where they were visible my son asked me, &#34;Is it a new moon tonight?&#34;  So at that moment I looked up and made the initial sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On our last pass I had an image of seeing myself from their perspective in my mind and I blurted out, &#34;It’s a father with his two kids.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moment I said that, the globe that was hovering higher floated up at a 90 degree angle, then instantly shot west at a 45 degree angle, then stopped in a position that made it look like a star.  We then left for their mothers as my daughter had become frightened.<n>
1/20/12 22:20|Silver City|NM|Changing|20 minutes|Red/orange orb interacts with jets, chased by more jets, re-appears 4 days later.|2/3/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86818.html|154|ndxe201201| Red/orange orb interacts with jets, chased by more jets, re-appears 4 days later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a descriptive account of two incidents of personal eyewitness accounts of a reddish orange orb.  The first indecent occurred on January 20th at approximately 10:20 pm in SW New Mexico, just outside of Silver City.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first there were three of us outside, me, m and c.  We were about to leave m&#39;s house when I saw what appeared to be a plane and some distance behind it and approaching it quickly was a reddish/orange orb.  There was a distinct difference in the speed of the orb and the speed of the plane.  The orb was obviously traveling faster than the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a second plane was visible behind the orb, and all were traveling together (plane, orb, plane) with the orb somewhat lower than the two planes.  It was peculiar that there was no sound from these planes or orb.  We were out in the outskirts of town where it was very quite and we could hear very well, that there were no jet engines.  Then, as all three objects are flying due west, the orb shakes up and down violently a  very small distance, shaking the planes up and down as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next was beyond belief.  The orb very obviously sped up to the first plane and went into or behind it, disappearing from view.  It almost immediately came out as 2 orbs of identical color.  It is vital to note that the orb was not only much smaller than the outline of the lights on the planes, but that it did not flash like the planes did.  These planes also did not flash like the regular commercial flashing plane light.  The planes seemed to be communicating with each other using their lights, it did look like Morse code, now that I replay it in my mind.  (My current hypothesis is that the orb had already taken control of the planes by the time I had seen them, and all the pilots had to communicate with one another was their lights!) Immediately after the 2 orbs came out of the plane in front, all of the objects lights&#39; turned out, the orb was dim like a star, as were the planes, most strange, at the same time this happened, they all turned towards the south and merged to form an equilateral triangle with the point directed upwards, facing us.  This triangle appeared to have a mass connecting the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds in the sky, the stars were very bright, and the light of the city was blocked by a ridge.  The triangle slowed down its movement to a crawl yet still covered a massive distance very quickly, circling from West, to South, to East, and finally North East while it disappeared into what appeared to be space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not five or ten minutes later c and I were preparing to depart from m&#39;s, we were amazed to see the reddish/orange orb floating straight up from the north.  I thought to myself what would I do to communicate with this orb, and I thought maybe I would whistle.  Before I could even whistle and directly after the thought, the orb light went out.  The star sized light that remained floated upward and southwest until it realized two more jets were coming in from the north east.  I heard the roar of the jets  as they flew the trail of the orb all the way over us towards the North and West, south into Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, January 24th , 2012, I was witness again to this phenomenon, yet it was slightly different.  I was sitting on my front porch facing South West when I saw the red light again, this time smaller and what appeared to be 2 orbs very close to one another and fainter.  It was also earlier in the evening, approximately 8:20 pm, and the city lights reduce visibility.  Still the stars are highly visible in Silver City, NM.  I watched as the pair of orbs moved in a similar flight path as the Friday night before.  The lights pulsated or flashed irregularly, almost more of a pulsation.  It went from West, to South, to East, and disappeared behind the trees.  I watched it circle around 3 times before it disappeared the final time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But before it dipped behind the trees for the last time, it glowed a brilliant orange/red much brighter and larger than the orbs we had seen the previous Friday.  It quickly faded and went away behind the trees.  It was interesting to see how the flight path of these pair of orbs was directly compared to that of observable commercial flights at the time and to note the irregular flight path of the paired orbs, and the straight path of the commercial flights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The paired orbs traveled at a much higher speed than that of the observable commercial flights.  They also had no noise.  This where it is puzzling.  Very soon after the orb glowed that burst of orange/red light, it went away, and minutes later 2 fighter jets zoomed by, completely audible and loud, just like the 2 jets that went after the one orb on Friday.  But unlike those two that pursued the orb into Mexico, these two jets did not appear to know where they were going, just going really fast in the same flight path as where the paired orbs were 5 minutes prior, and pretty much where the first occurrence turned into an equilateral triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yet when we first witnessed this on Friday, there was no noise when the planes were incorporated into this triangle, and there was no noise tonight with the paired orbs, we could hear the commercial flights when they passed by, we could hear the Air Force jets zooming by, but no, we could not hear the orbs at all.  The whole time the orbs flew with remarkable speed and smoothness, and made irregular and seemingly impossible movements, like moving a large distance while appearing to move slowly.  This was particularly present in the triangle form.<n>

The first time my wife and I noticed it, it appeared to be landed on a deserted mountain range. We saw it move slightly to the left, right, up, and down. Ever since 1/20/12, I have seen it in the same region of the sky, or if cloudy or raining, it appears upon this same mountain range, sometimes motionless until after dawn. I have ruled out the typical planet theory. This object moves in such a way to blend in with the stars. But if you watch it for any length of time, you can tell it is indeed moving in an unnatural way. Because it varies slightly in location, I have determined that it has to be within the atmosphere and fairly close. The unique aspect of this object is its appearance for this many consecetive nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I would say that the small plane that approached the orbs came from the north west and was no higher than 300-400ft.  One passer by said he saw almost the exact same thing the night before.  People were pulling over to view this.  I can say they were deffinatly not planes helicopters or flares.  Planes and other aircraft simply can not move the way they did. There were also no emissions such as sparks and smoke as a flare would do.<n>

It had blue lights under/on it and was shaped like a triangle (My best guess), I have never in my life seen anything take off or move this fast.  It was at about a 5000 ft ceiling. No sound, however it had to be going faster than the sound barrier, much faster.  I slowed down as much as I could without wrecking my car and followed it with my eyes as far as I could.  It went from left to right in the sky (North to South) in a matter of seconds, It was gone just as It became visible.  Nothing man-made could ever travel that fast without the right technology.

As I crested the top of the bridge, I noticed a bright light in the sky off to my right coming from the direction of the city of Buffalo area.  This caught me off gaurd because though there is an airport close by, I&#39;ve never seen any aircraft come from that direction, at least being this low to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> continuing down Military road in Tonawanda,NY,  I could see it was coming in my direction and by the time I got to about 400 yards away from the underpass for the I-90 it was passing almost directly over top of my car at I would guess a couple hundred feet and at a speed of around 20-30mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this object had 3 lights on the belly of the craft  equally spaced out and blinking lights on what at first I thought were wings of a plane but as it passed over I realized it wasn&#39;t.  I could see the far side due to lights in a parking lot for the highway department.and what I thought was a wing actually sort of looked like the arms that come off the side of a shrimp boat but I cannot be 100% sure on that due to it being more dark than light out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So,  I arrive at work to punch in at exactly 6am, go back outside to park my car and I can still see it heading towards the lockport area, not the other direction which is where the airport is. and that is when I could see a very bright light turn on, on the right side of it if ur looking at it from the rear. the light turned off then back on and stayed on. it&#39;s wasn&#39;t a beam of light though. at that point I then watched it until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen random things in our skies that I myself and others with me at the time have questioned, but this is the first time ever I have felt compelled to write out a report and  submit it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -thankyou-<n>

I was walking out of my apartment building and happen to look up at the sky.  The moon was in a crescent shape to my right.  As I looked at the moon, I noticed out the corner of my left eye, what looked to be an airplane moving very fast. The only difference was there were no flashing lights and it was low, bright, white light flying low enough that if it was an airplane, I could’ve made out the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I followed the light across the sky, I noticed another one coming from the other direction (my right).  It looked like they were going to hit each other.  Once they got close enough to each other, they began to shift in the same direction side by side across the sky.  Then they just shot straight up in the air (VERY FAST!) still side by side and they disappeared!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in shock and still am!  I don’t know what to believe???  I only see these types of things on TV or movies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My question is, did anyone else happen to witness this?<n>

It was round, with an orange/yellow tint, and had a short faint tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I expected it to be an extremely big shooting star, but there was no way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO came down in the sky in a downward angle, stopped and hovered, then shot off and faded away extremely fast.  What my friend and I saw was definitely in this atmosphere, but was very far away.  Although it was farther away, I could tell it was a massive and circular object.  I had never seen anything like it in my entire life and full-heartedly believe that we saw an actual UFO last night.<n>

It was about four times as big as the North Star, which was conveniently next to it.  It remained this shape and then began to periodically drop or shed a glitter-like substance from it.  After glowing profusely, it began to flicker and then disappear.  After it disappeared, it was not seen again.  The overall condition of the night was clear skies and low 60&#39;s.<n>

I drove the mile from my home to the main highway Rt. 114.  I stopped at the T intersection facing South.  As I looked to the West checking for traffic before pulling out (toward Radford, Va and the Radford Army Arsenal Plant) , I saw two orange flickering lights heading East.  I first took these for fighters on afterburner as my area is frequently overflown by F-15s from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro, N.C.   I then saw that no navigation lights were visible, and that the lights were traveling much to slowly for the normal F-15s I usually see.  The lights passed in front of me at about 2000 ft. elevation relative and what I estimate to be ¾ mile distance.  No structure was visible and the lights were separated by about ten diameters, with the front light above the rear light about 2-3 diameters . The impression was of a slowly flickering orange fire with a tinge of yellow ! around the edges. I turned on to Rt. 114 and travelled East toward my work and following the lights.  The lights seemed to speed up and they faded into the distance toward Poor Mt. above Roanoke, VA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the intersection of Rt. 114 and Rt. 460  I turned to the North toward my workplace in Blacksburg, VA.  I traveled about 1 mile and to the Northwest I again saw two orange flickering lights traveling Southeast approach me and begin a slow turn heading East.  I pulled my truck over at a car rental lot and got out and stood beside my vehicle as the lights passed in front of me at a distance this time of ¼ mile and about 1000 feet elevation relative.  The objects made no detectable sound.  My impression of the appearance of the lights was the same.  They continued their turn and proceeded to the Northeast fading into the distance over the Ellett valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It also moved against the wind slowly then turned at about 90 degrees... but seemed to follow route twelve out of the village and eventually out of vision...  I&#39;ve never seen the like...  it appeared to be a fire orange in colour uniform in shape not wavering in the wind like a candles flame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed the same size relative to distance from me. meaning it neither grew bigger or smaller or changed shape..  was silent too...<n>

She pointed out two white large lights in the sky. one was directly above the other.  They would move closer to each other until almost touching and then move apart again. They did this about five times and then the lower one flew away.  Then, up the road where the trees thin out and much more of the sky is visible there were about 10 orange orbs floating in different places just hovering. I pulled over to watch them and then we noticed places flying all around the lights.  They weren&#39;t normal passenger planes they were triangular in shape and loud.  There were probably at least 20 planes flying all around the hovering lights.  I wanted to stay and watch because it was so pretty but we were going to an appointment. When we came out of the appointment everything was gone.  I have never seen anything like that before and while I was watching it I was in awe.<n>

This occurred on the evening of Thursday, January 19, 2012 at around 7:00PM EST, and lasting for about an hour.  This took place about 10 miles north of Macon, GA.  I would estimate the angle at which I viewed this object relative to the Earths’ surface was about 35 degrees.  As seen at arms’ length, I would say that it appeared to be about 1 ½ to 2 inches across and about ¼ inches high.  It was a straight, horizontal rectangle.  I saw nothing above or below this shape.  Its size as compared to the full moon would be about 1/16.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was seen in the SW sky, and was hovering completely still in mid-air.  What made it so outstanding were the colorful lights moving along constantly from left to right.  The colors were vivid blue, less green, less red and white.  They were intermittently blinking on and off as they moved along.  Then suddenly, all of the lights would momentarily go off.  Then all at once they became a solid line of bright white light with some brilliant flashes of that bright white light.  Then the colored lights started moving along again.  There appeared to be no repeat pattern.  I reasoned that, even though I couldn’t see it, the lights were probably circling around something and I could see only one section.  As the stars moved in a clockwise direction, this “object” very slowly sank to the right (westerly) until it was out of sight.  At any rate, it was the most fascinating thing I have ever witnessed in my life<n>

It was too far from us to tell if there was sound or what shape it may have been.

I watched this red object for 10 minutes (by my watch), it made a large circle in the nigh sky....after 1o minutes it was heading south, it just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I turned looking east toward the city.  We live out of Tucson up in the Tucson Mountain foothills and therefore we enjoy a wonderful view of the twinkling city lights.  I observe aircraft regularly but one light over the middle of Tucson caught my attention.  It was a ball of orange/red light moving at a typical plane speed traveling south to north.  I studied the movement and light trying to figure out it&#39;s color, orange or red?  It seemed to be organically shifting from more orange to more red.  I thought atmosphere may be tricking my eyes. It was a solid unblinking color.  For reference, there were two other typical planes in the sky over town at the same time and their white lights with blinking green and red lights were easily visible.  I was waiting to see the familiar plane blinking lights but none were seen.  A funny coincidence happened then when I was! startled to realize that this was no ordinary aircraft.  The amber light stopped moving as I felt an adrenaline wave.  I then noticed that it changed directions promptly and appeared to be headed west in my direction.  I sort of panicked and ran in to get my husband and our two boys out to see the &#34;UFO&#34;.  Eventually they all came outside.  The light grew or glowed bigger as it approached, though still many miles away.  Although it seemed to be coming straight toward us it started to lose intensity and brightness growing smaller and smaller. Then we all saw the light as it blinked out, nowhere to be seen.  We looked and waited a few minutes for it to reappear but it did not show up anywhere.   My husband was a skeptic about ufo&#39;s until he saw this thing he could not understand.<n>

Didn&#39;t seem large, maybe size of a car dripping approximately basketball sized &#34;drops&#34;.  The drops seemed to leave a long straight line behind them, like a trail or tether.  Shrank after dropping two in a row and dissapeared without moving.  Would like to add that it was close to highway and I pulled over so hopefully someone else spotted it, because I left my vehicle and may have drawn attention.<n>

There were 4 flashing lights in the northerly direction heading east-north-east.  As we all watched, a large orb lit in the northeast for about two seconds.  It was easily 10 times brighter than anything in the sky.  It disappeared and the blinking lights continued heading that direction.  There is no moon tonight at this time and,extremely clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an aside, when I originally left my home, ..from the east I could hear jets heading up the coast of South Carolina from Charleston towards Myrtle Beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I looked at the lights that I described for around 15 minutes.  My daughter headed to her home 15 miles away in fear to be near to her husband.  My wife remained with us intermittently.  We tried to get something on video after the fact, when a light showed up to the east, and remained there, but could catch nothing on camcorder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jets were present after the lights appeared and observed them during this period.  I have no doubt about this fact.  My son was amazed completely by what he was seeing.<n>

He witnessed exactly what I saw around this time last year.  We previously lived on the Intracoastal water way and in February of 2011 I saw what looked light blinking white lights in a triangular formation.  He didn’t see it and thought I was a off my rocker.  They began in a triangle and then began to move closer together and then farther apart.  It lasted for about 2-3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight (January 2012) what we saw was about 15-20 blinking lights moving randomly across the sky east to west and then north to south.  This lasted for about 30 minutes.  At one point I noticed other lights in the opposite part of the sky one of which was moving very slowly as a single, stable light and then took off and started to blink.   We also noticed another blinking light that turned orange and then blue in color then appeared to fall.  We heard police sirens about 2 minutes later. We noticed a really low flying plane about 10 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure if this is a coincidence or not but while we were looking at the sky we both noticed a shooting star at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been a skeptic but I’ve seen this twice now while living in Little River (North Myrtle Beach) in one year.  It was absolutely incredible to see.   I’m just curious to see if anyone else saw what I did.  It was mesmerizing, beautiful, and a little scary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The light was very bright and did not flash or have any kind of movement to it (like an airplane or helicopter or even a star I guess).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was very clear and you could see all the stars out and airplanes passing by.  This light caught our attention because it was so bright and it did not have any of the light characteristics of the other stars that were out.   It did not have any flashing lights like an airplane and it wasn&#39;t moving across the sky so it wasn&#39;t a commercial or private airplane (imo).  The light wasn&#39;t even that high up in the atmosphere like the other airplanes were when I saw a couple that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened next is what really caused our jaws to drop.  The light came speeding down toward earth like it was going to crash (I really expected a loud crash sound) but then it swooped up and it disappeared!!  It didn&#39;t come down at an angle or slowly descend....it moved with force straight down....STRAIGHT DOWN then immediately (without hesitation) it did a U turn toward the sky and it disappeared.  It had no trail or it didn&#39;t have any other colors to it but just a white solid color.<n>
1/18/12 19:00|Preston|CT|Light|3 hours|A bright moving star in the sky?|1/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86683.html|205|ndxe201201| A bright moving star in the sky?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not exactly sure what I have been seeing but I have caught it on multiple occations now. The latest occurence happened last night around 10pm.  I went outside to relieve myself and was looking up at the night sky through the branches of the trees.  One of the brighter &#34;stars&#34; caught my eye, as it was not only bright but also twinkling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching this light, I noticed that I was actually moving in the sky, but not in straight lines.  It would smoothly glide across the sky and come to a halt.  I also noticed movements similar to &#34;figure 8s&#34; It would sometimes just sit up in the sky and not move for a while. In addition to &#34;twinkling&#34; it would also get brighter and sometimes fade out completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an experiment, I would line up the &#34;star&#34; with my fixed line of sight, so that I could see the light through the tree branchs, then I would watch as the light would move from &#34;behind&#34; the branches and move around the sky some more.  I was able to watch this on several occations throughout the night.  The &#34;star&#34; was spotted in the southwest skies. Just to make sure I wasn&#39;t going crazy, I made my roommate watch the light and she was able to watch the same thing as me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night there was only one of these, but 3 nights ago, I was able to see 3 of these things in the sky, relatively close together.  What are these? If anyone has the answers, Im certainly open to hearing them.  Thanks!<n>

As I backed into my parking space, I observed two sets of lights toward a mostly East direction. Initial observation indicated to me that they were a pair of military helicopters in the distance. I assumed this due to the fact that the &#39;choppers&#39; were in a somewhat typical flight pattern. That being one offset and a bit higher/lower than the second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked to my mailbox, I watched and assumed that they would be coming nearly directly toward/over me as this is the typical flight path for aircraft traveling East toward McGuire AFB / Lakehurst NAS. I have many low-level flyovers of military aircraft to these military locations.  I am approximately 40 miles from these facilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, I realized that the craft were flying in, from my perspective, a more Southerly direction. This is a bit of an unusual flight path for low altitude aircraft. My view was obscured periodically by leafless trees and a couple of homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft traveled it became obvious that the direction had changed as indicated in #2 below. This direction change put the path coming nearer to me. I am NW of Philadelphia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the two craft came into full-view in my South direction, and at the apparent nearest, I had an unobscured view for about 30 seconds. What I observed was different than those below. It was not until this point that I became really interested in the craft. This was my nearest observation of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As indicated below, there was absolutely NO sound coming the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed what appeared to be two individual aircraft. The leading craft was lower than the following one. What I saw were four lights. Three white and one red, on each of the objects. There was NO symmetry in the lighting pattern. I saw no variation in intensity of the lights. Additionally, I am / was unable to put a shape to the objects in question. The position of the lights on the craft made no sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lighting configuration on both craft were identical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first saw the craft at a 7 degree elevation (this elevation number is quite accurate) and 81 degrees toward the East. Utilizing the location information from #1 below and a distance of 19 miles from my location, would yield an altitude of 2.3 miles above witness #1.  I believe that I first saw the objects very close to the time as seen by #1 below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the craft were nearest to me, the elevation was approximately 11 degrees. Utilizing the information from #2 below, that being turning West, distance from me to the objects would be approximately 2 miles. This yields an altitude of about 1/2 mile. Obviously, there is a problem here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the objects in view for some period of time. It was not beyond 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Utilizing a 10 minute time-line and the distance traveled by the objects as seen by me, approximately 25 miles, yields a speed of 150MPH. Again, different than the speed indicated in #2 below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although there variations in the observations, there is no doubt that all three observations were of the same objects during the same time period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What they were is certainly unknown to us. The flight looked &#39;military&#39; in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possibly some &#39;stealth&#39; type plane / chopper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But who knows ?   #1 January 18th at 6:40PM Levittown, PA MUFON # 35024 . .(17th sighting information) . . .  On January 18th at 6:40PM I was driving in Levittown, PA southbound on Woodbourne Rd shortly past the roads intersection with Business Route 1, heading towards Trenton Rd. Above the residential section to my left, I saw two sets of three horizontal lights that appeared to be stationary to my left. One set of lights was slightly above and to the right of the other from my vantage point. The lights were the same as I witnessed the night before, but now there were two sets of them. I drove into the section to get as close to the lights as I could. At 6:41PM, I called a relative who resides in the section to look at the objects. As I got closer and towards the end of the residential section as it met Bristol Oxford Valley Rd, the lights started to move and again as had happened the night prior, the large sets of three horizontal white lights were no longer visible. The lights flew over the edge of the residential section and Woodbourne Rd ! in the Southwest direction. At one point I was only a few hundred feet from being directly under the objects. I could hear no sound being emitted from them. I followed the direction of the two aircraft as I headed towards my relatives house. I was now behind the aircraft. The structure of the lights resembled a cross or plus symbol with two white lights on the sides with two vertical red lights on top of each other in the middle. The lights were blinking. I arrived at my relatives house and we watched the objects fly Southwest towards Northeast Philly in formation from a window in the upstairs of the house. Approximately 5 minutes had gone by between first sighting them and their lights fading as they flew too far to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> #2 January 18th at 6:45PM Northeast Philadelphia, PA MUFON # 34937  Four family members, including myself, were walking returning home after grocery shopping in Northeast Philadelphia, PA at around 6:45PM on Wednesday, January 18, 2012. We first noticed the lights flying very low and close to each other back to back, almost as in a flight formation, with absolutely no sound. We could not make out a solid object around the lights that we witnessed. At first, both sets of lights appeared to be in a single horizontal line, with white lights on the sides and a large red light in the center. My son ran inside and grabbed his HD camera, and after zooming in, we realized that the large red light in the center was actually two red lights stacked one above the other. Because of this, the lights looked like the following • : •  Again, in the video footage (to be uploaded at a later date), the lights on the sides were white and the two in the center were red; there were two of these sets of lights, making for 8 lights in total. In formation, they appeared to be diagonally flying next to each other, with one on the bottom left and one on the top right. The pair appeared to fly almost directly over us and then drifted off towards the west, over neighboring Montgomery County, PA. The lights speed was slow, possibly traveling at 10 to 20 MPH. My son claims to have seen one of the sets of lights shoot up into the sky, while we saw the other one disappear beyond the tree line. I personally did not witness the first set of lights shoot up. What we witnessed was definitely not anything ordinary, especially since I am usually skeptical of UFO sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> #3 January 18th (reported at 7:17 PM,  19:17) Lincoln, DE NUFORC # S86669  i saw blinking lights in the sky, &amp; think it was hovercrafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to take my dogs outside when I noticed 3 blinkings lights in the sky.

I ran inside and got my littler brother who came and had a look for himself. The lights appeared to be moving just a tiny bit but not too much. One went dark then came back on.. then After a few minutes both of them stopped blinking and it looked like they disappeared. - By the way they were changing from red to white in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> #4 Occurred : 1/17/2012 23:00 (Entered as : 1/17/2012 23:00) Reported: 1/18/2012 8:50:34 AM 08:50 Posted: 1/24/2012 Location: West Chester, PA Shape: Triangle Duration:8 - 10 minutes Slow low flying unidentified craft  Front of craft had multiple very bright white lights, something between 3 and 5. Craft was flying very low level and moved very slowly, appeared to be heading from north to south with no deviation of course. Back of craft revealed blinking red lights, two or three. This craft travelled within a very close distance of Brandywine Airport, but passed it by. When the craft travelled overhead a sound of a jet engine was present but very faint. Was very odd for the slow speed of the plane and very low sound output. I was surprised the craft did not fall out of the sky. It appeared to be moving no faster than 40 mph. Any assistance that could be provided with finding out if this was &amp;quot;one of ours&amp;quot; would be greatly appreciated.<n>

Not necessarily &#34;aliens&#34; or even a space craft, but I definitely saw allot of objects in the sky at the multiple times sometimes alone, and other times with more than one.  First my friend sitting nest to me outside in a car had seen a strange &#34;shooting star&#34; in remained in the sky visible for about 10 seconds.  I tried to look, but my vision was blocked by trees.  about 10 minutes later A set of flashing blue and red lights appeared. They were strange but I assumed it was a normal airplane and paid it no attention. This passed by and then about 3 minutes later another &#34;plane&#34; appears in the same general area. This time I paid more attention to the detail of the &#34;plane.&#34; I could not tell exactly what the flashing lights were. There was no plane shape near, I could also see a strange Ora or force around the flashing lights as it gradually and steadily moved forward from the lower left middle ! of the horizon at about a 45 degree angle up and across horizontally  towards the  upper right. at first I thought this was a trick of the eye, but as I continued to look, I could clearly see a surrounding area of the sky that was moving with the light, and had a very very slight difference in appearance than the rest of the sky. It was almost like a perfect camouflage with the night sky, it only could be detected with keen attention being paid to a seemingly average airplane in the sky. I observed about 20-30, maybe even 40 objects in the sky within the next 2 hours. I saw multiple shapes. Some were very small and had a similar shape to a blimp, except more rounded and less ovular. I saw large roundish saucer shapes. I saw one that has abrupt square edges. All of there are the shapes of the outer &#34;force&#34; or Ora around the flashing light. These obects were following each other in the sky. One would be far away and appear as a single light in the lower left distance. A mediu! m sized flashing light would we moving horizontally across fro! m left t o right at about the middle of my line of vision. This medium one was clearly made up of more than one blue and red flashing light. The third flying thing would be towards the upper right on the horizon. you could see the outlining force around it once it reached this point. Also I heard a low humming noise, similar to the sound of a car in neutral except more quiet and muffled. This appearance of one after the other lasted for about 30 minutes. I probably had seen about 20 objects during that time. After 2 hours of watching, I went inside. I peeked out the window several times and have spotted flashing lights at least once every time. Also, A friend from the far end of the neighborhood confirmed the sighting of three bright white lights in triangular form. Another friend in a further neighborhood confirmed the sighting of multiple objects in the sky at once. Several of the objects seen were clearly visible aircrafts but many others with not. I attempted to mkae video footag! e, but my cell phone camera&#39;s quality was too poor to capture the lights in the dark.<n>

Craft was flying very low level and moved very slowly, appeared to be heading from north to south with no deviation of course.  Back of craft revealed blinking red lights, two or three.  This craft travelled within a very close distance of Brandywine Airport, but passed it by.  When the craft travelled overhead a sound of a jet engine was present but very faint.  Was very odd for the slow speed of the plane and very low sound output.  I was surprised the craft did not fall out of the sky.  It appeared to be moving no faster than 40 mph.  Any assistance that could be provided with finding out if this was &#34;one of ours&#34; would be greatly appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While walking back to my house, I looked up and noticed a strange fireball going from Southeast to Northwest.  It was strange in that it was bluish-white, unlike normal meteors one sees in a meteor shower, or a regular fireball.  The object was about the size of a asprin tablet held at arm&#39;s length, and the fireball itself was egg-shaped.  The trail was much, much longer than a normal fireball, and had the same color as the object itself.  It crossed the sky in about one minute, and did not fade or otherwise lose shape or color as it crossed the sky, only doing so when it was over the NW horizon.  As if it was going from point A to point B.<n>

I went out to my porch and looked into the sky and coming into view I now saw 2 lights coasting west and then a 3rd light came up to the other three and they all continued west until fading from view.  I heard now sound just the 3 strange lights moving east to west.<n>

She confirmed the sighting.  A plane usually has accompanying intermittent lights and sound, which were not present.

It was roughly 6:00pm.  About a half mile up the road, I saw a bright white light in the sky.  My first thought was it was a police helicopter conducting a search, however the light emanating from it was really bright.  There was no light trail leading to the ground so I do not believe it was a spotlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was parallel to the road so it was in my direct vision.  I cannot accurately estimate how high up it was but it was maybe a few dozen feet above the tree line and it was moving very slowly. As I drove closer, I noticed what I thought was one bright light several hundred yards back was actually 3 bright lights, in triangular-like form, all facing downward. It was difficult to make the shape of the object because the lights were so bright (and it was dark) but by the orientation of the lights I would say it had more of a boomerang like shape.  There was no discernible sound coming from the object - a helicopter at that height would be very loud.  I am a smoker so my window was down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are no shoulders on this road so I could not pull over, but I wanted to turn around and try to capture a photo of it with my phone.  However when I turned around on the next street and headed back the other direction, it was gone.<n>

I was with my wife, 14 year old son, and 2 year old daughter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw 5 very distinct and very bright lights that formed the shape of a roof with a very gradual pitch.  The object was about 5000 feet in the air.  It is hard to judge the height, but it had to be near that.  I was looking at it at about a 60 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights from point to point were approximately 300 feet.  The lights flashed off and back on. The craft moved one width of itself to the west.  They flashed off and on one more time and the object had moved one more time at the same interval.  Then the lights went out and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t see it leave, and the sky was still light enough that we would have seen a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all saw the exact same thing and none of us have any rational explanation for what we witnessed tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone on two occasions with this witness, and we found him to be quite objective and credible.

I was waiting for my bus i was listening to my ipod when i saw a big oval shaped object in the sky.  It was moving slow with flashing bright lights.  I pulled my phone out to take a picture and as soon as i pulled it out to take the picture my phone was acting weird.  My screen then went blank for some reason so i was not able to take a picture. The oval shaped object was flying really low to be a normal aircraft it was silent and all of the sudden it went flying into the skys really fast.<n>

I looked to the ocean and above the waterline in the midst of the overcast was a bright light fading in and out but getting bigger as the the minute went by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my kids outside to see the light and they witnessed it too.  They ran and got the binoculars and we could clearly see it was an orangish colored light.  It then moved North and disappeared. I called the coastguard to see if they were crazy enough to have any rescue helicopters out and they confirmed the winds were too strong and did not have any flying in the area.  The hole incident lasted about 5 minutes.<n>

I have the original video in my camcorder and we can arrange to view it directly from my video camera as well if we meet.  I never believed on UFO&#39;s until this encounter and initially I thought it is some sort of Government aircraft but when I review the video with 1/4th speed and also frame by frame, it blew my brains to see what I describe as a FACE and full figure being with clear view to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on a 14th floor facing East, from where I can see Mountain Baker*(Washington State). On Jan 17, 2012 at around 2 am I noticed very bright light in the sky traveling from southeast to southwest and thought a plane is heading West to land *(Pearson Intl&#39; Airport) Vancouver, BC. But the light was hovering for at least a minute before I got my Video Camera out to capture this video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please log on to you tube*<n> <n><n> <n><n> (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUAeIV7TmOk)  to view the  video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I strongly request to view it in a slow motion *(1/4 th ) speed and if possible view it frame by frame.  You will be able to see a FACE with visible eyes,mouth and nose and what appear is a HORN on the left side of the face stretching from head to chin around jaw line, when the object change color to red and it is a closeup shot.  You will also notice the object change into two at the end and also the ability to expand??  I am just unable to explain in words.<n>

Bright yellow orange lights started slowly decending and then made a quick half arch in sky downwards.  It almost appears to be an asteroid coming into earth&#39;s atmosphere because it was so bright.  It then started to move across the sky lateraly continuing to slowly decend. It did not act like a plane or helicopter, but I did think that there would be a plane crash because of the way it was decending.  I heard no roar of engines.  I followed it in the sky by driving in the direction of it.  It did seem to hover at one point and then I lost it behind the trees.  It was definitely a bright light, I could not make out any shapes because it was dark.  But I have never seen anything behave like that in the sky.<n>

Lasted 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 22:18 on 01/15/2012 my family and I were travelling home from having dinner at my parents.  As we approached our home we noticed a bright orange orb moving from the southeast to the northwest.  We first thought it was a fireball.  I pulled the car over and we continued to observe its movement.  We agreed that it wasn’t a fireball as it did not have a tail and it seemed to be turning towards the north.  My wife then suggested it might be a commercial airplane on fire.  I opened the door and exited the car and could not hear any sounds from the object as it was now getting farther away and accelerating as a commercial airplane now approached from the south.  In a matter of a few seconds it accelerated up and away very quickly and out of sight.  The glow of the object made it appear to be very large and even though it came somewhat close, I could not determine a definite body to the object.  The color was orange and there were no flashing lights or other lig! hts of any color.  The weather was mostly clear with a few clouds out.   Temp was 32 degrees.  I have never witnessed anything as strange as this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I looked in the South East sky I saw what appeared to be a star moving in my direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 seconds it immediately stopped for about 3 seconds and made a sharp right turn very quickly.  It appeared to go several miles in just a couple of seconds and stopped again for a few seconds, made a left turn then zipped off to the east at a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a pinkish light and seemed to be in space and not our atmosphere and about the size of a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local authorities however they were not interested.<n>

It appeared as what I have known to be a falling star.  This object appeared as I have seen what may be meteors, &#34;falling stars&#34; or other objects appear to fall and strike the earth&#39;s atmosphere and &#34;glance&#34; into an arc thru the atmosphere and disappear.  The difference here is the size of the object appeared to be large, or perhaps closer. Something that had stood out to me was the ultra bright green fiery color of the object. It looked to me as it were a bright green roman candle firecracker shot in reverse(ie from the top of the sky down). It was like a bright green fire ball except for the tail of the moving fire ball was crooked and bent toward the earth as it fell at an angle/arc from almost due south toward the southwest. It traveled in this direction for maybe 3 to 4 seconds and disappeared as if the &#34;fire&#34; had! burnt out. It showed such a spectacular view I had thought to call other family members to come outside to see the spectacle. But it was gone too soon to be able to do this. After the sighting I had wanted to report this to some agency or an official department of some sort who would&#39;ve been interested in looking for a falling satellite or space junk.  The only places I could think of at the time would&#39;ve been the Benton County Sheriff&#39;s Office or State Police. Both of which I had thought at the time wouldn&#39;t really be able to relay the information to any agency or official office that mattered.So therefore I didn&#39;t report this at the time. I had forgotten about the sighting and have only thought to report it to you after seeing the article on Yahoo News about the Russian Mars Spacecraft that had malfunctioned and fell to earth around 1/15/2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

He called me and we both watched them for about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first they were in a line but separated from each other, but they did not keep an even speed, sometimes moving closer to each other or even crossing paths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 8:45pm one of them disappeared, then one more, then about a minute later, the third one disappeared.<n>

Next as I stared at it, it got faster and faster for about 5 seconds and suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was definitely much faster than an airplane or helicopter.  I then looked up for about a minute and saw nothing but a few stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally I ran inside my neighbor&#39;s house to tell them and we called the hotline.<n>

I then showed the other 4 people I was with and they stated the same thing, its too far up to be a plane.  I think the star (unknown object) was moving south to north.  I was just wondering if anyone else saw the same object or something similiar??<n>

In the Sky were 8 lights, all of them a Yellow color. They were in a formation that resembled the little dipper upside down.  The Dipper of the formation was up.  As soon as I pointed the lights out to the wife they Dipper portion of the formation turned in a clockwise rotation.  The ships in the Handle then started to get smaller. It looked as if they went higher into the air and then were gone. Then the ships left in the Square formation started to do the same thing. At this time I was able to get my phone out and activate the camera. I was only able to snap two pictures. All but one light had left. At this time another light came up from the east. It stopped and hovered with the one remaining light. This light then disappeared the same way as the others. Leaving one remaining light, this one also disappeared as the others; however upon disappearing i! t did seems to cork screw or barrel roll before getting too small to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other than the last light come up, please note that all other lights were hovering.

It looked to me like an electrical discharge of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked around the sky to see if there where any other stars or lights from aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking directly up, I saw what appeared to me as the twin of the object to my west. The object had radiating spikes of light like a corona, but the “spikes of light” did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my friend and ask her if see could see anything in the night sky that seemed strange. She saw the same thing I was witnessing, so I went to get an old SLR with a telephoto lens and a doubler to see if we could make out any more detail. With magnification, the object seemed to have a rectangle in the center of a circle with smaller rectangles on each side of the larger rectangle in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t get any pictures as the old camera with the long lenses had no film in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching these objects for about 15 minutes, I went next door to see if my neighbor had seen them,or take him outside to see if he saw what we saw. He said he saw the same objects the night sky the night before in the same spots in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my best guess these objects must have been very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time right now is 1915 hours, 12-15-2012,and the object that was in the west is gone, and the object directly overhead has moved a few degrees closer toward to west and very visible even through an overcast sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you. I hope there may be other reports of this same sighting, whatever it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were six lights in the shape of a triangle and it was moving with my car like how the moon moves with your car; not how a plane moves with your car.  I&#39;m not sure if any other people saw it, but people in front of me were braking and one person turned into a gas station and parked their car, so I&#39;m not sure if they saw it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object ended up going in the back of me so I wasn&#39;t able to see it again, but I know for a fact it was not a plane or an outline of stars, as it was only 5 pm.<n>

This is a park I drive by on a regular basis.  I immediately knew something was out of place. There was a light, not very bright but it caught my attention.  It was to my left at about fifty feet or so high. It was turning from right to left.  When it was almost even with me it bobbed slightly up and down. That was when I noticed the size of the disc.  It was black yet silver at the same time.  I couldnt see the top but the bottom was slightly rounded.  It pretty much covered the park from my right to left.  I had stopped by this point and gotten out of my truck.  It bobbed again then bobbed again.  It was enormous.  It then shot straight up so fast it dissapeared.  There was no noise at all.  No sound of wind rushing past it as it shot up nothing.<n>

I stopped to stretch my back and stared up into the dark and stary night sky. The visibility was excellent during this time as I noticed a spherical light zipping through dark sky at a very high altitude. The object moved at such a fast velocity my eyes had trouble tracking it. The sphere moved so fast it left a brief trail of light behind as it covered a vast expanse of the night sky before it disappeared out of the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I woke about 8:30 it was gone.  Several years ago I saw 3 triangle shaped crafts in a triangle formation toward the back of my house in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night the radio tower they were near collapsed.  A new one has been built still a distance away from by house. I live on a dead-end street out in the country. The field where the flashing light was is just farm and ranch land.  No one should have been out there and the light was too bright for farm equipment and it was not moving, only standing still and flashing and the hour later when I awoke it was in the same spot.<n>

The time was around 11.30 -11.45 pm on Saturday the 14th of January 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eye sight was drawn toward the ridge on Mingus Mountains.  I saw an extremely large light being admitted from above the ridge of Mingus mountain, the light has a soft orange glow to it becoming more white as it disbursed (the size of the light appeared to cover a few miles) the light allowed the ridge to be visible and also lite up the sky and clouds, similar to the sun setting, although not as intense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believed at first it to be a large wildfire, but looking closer the light was well above the ridge, the area of light was large and the view was incredibly beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch for around 5 mins before continuing my journey; I lost sight of the light when traveling up Hondo as the ridge was no longer visible, but was still able to see the reflection of the light in the clouds of the dark dead o! f night sky.  I was expecting to hear of a fire and after nothing has appeared in the new I called the forest dept to ask if anything of that nature had been reported, I was informed that no fires, or prescribed burns have taken place in that area. Did anyone else see the light?  Does anyone know what it was?<n>

At first I thought it was another planet shining in the sky because it was so large, but no, it was moving horizontally across the sky toward me from the right hand side of my wind shield gliding toward the left.  It was so strange, an orange ball of fire that did seem to flicker, but was so steady.  I&#39;d never seen anything like it. It looked like a floating fire ball, but it was moving at a steady, intentional pace. It kept heading what I think was northward.  I tried to rationalize it but can&#39;t really figure how to do so because it was so high up.  But it was large enough to look the size (diameter) of a pen top from where I sat in my car.  NO I hadn&#39;t been drinking or taking anything at all.  Not even Advil. I was happy to see the reports from Southbury and Bridgeport not to long before.  They are towns relatively close to me.<n>

The circular lights reflected against clouds but disappeared in cloud breaks, suggesting they were beamed upward, possibly from some form of powerful laser light. My wife and I both witnessed the event and would wish to know whether the lights were from earth or elsewhere. This will highly influence our decision to barbeque outdoors in future. We can live with the bears but not with ETs, and if its a human with some Chinese made laser gadget, we would like to give the bears his address. We are former diplomats who spent thirty seven years abroad. I saw these lights once before in Kandahar, Afghanistan in 2004.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Anyway, my mother-in-law was telling about how her and my father-in-law have seen things outside their house before around 8pm or 9pm so at about 8pm she went to lock the door and let the dogs out for the night and she was like &#34;Hey, come here!!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the front of the house with some binoculars to check it out and sure enough there really were lights outside that were really bright orange and red and they were too low to be stars. When I first looked at it, it looked like a &#34;T&#34; and it had 4 lights coming down off of it and 2 on each side on the top. The two on the top on each side were white and the ones coming down off of it were red and orange! The top ones on each side went away as I watched and they never did come back. From then on, I was just looking at a vertical strip of lights. I handed the binoculars to my mother-in-law and she seen it too then handed it to my father-in-law and he seen it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of commotion woke up my son who is 8 years old and he seen it happen too.  It started changing colors from red and orange to blue and even green and white.  It looked like the red one in the middle was rotation around it somehow. It would get closer for a minute and then it would get farther away.   Most of the time it just hovered and when it did move it moved really quickly, must faster then a jet.   The only way we could tell it was moving away is because the lights on it would get smaller.  The only other lights out were the street lights which are huge and right in front of the house but across the street is just the lake and there are n! o other houses in that area or lights that you could confuse this for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also never made any noise so it couldn&#39;t have been a helicopter.  You could be looking right at it for a minute and then it would just disappear but then come back and finally about 25mins. later it was gone completely.  I was in total shock but my in-laws were not quite as surprised because they had seen things in that area before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it was and I can&#39;t information about UFOs for that area but I know there had to have been other people see this. Please email me if you seen it too or have seen other UFO sightings in that area before. My email is trying2raise3@yahoo.com.<n>

The light drifted in slow sweeping circles then would remain stationary for a minute then would drift off again.   Sometimes it would follow a straight line then pause to circle or curve again.  If I raised up both arms with hands two feet apart that would indicate how wide the path of this object meandered.  It seemed as high as small aircraft that would be passing overhead at the same time.  It also seemed to flash or pulsate about every three seconds.  This flashing wasn&#39;t always noticed, but more so when the object seemed to accelerate in a straight line.  I mentioned above that the time we obsereved this was  about 30 to 40 minutes but we actually went indoors after that long as it is a chilly nights a here in upstate South Carolina.<n>

I was driving right by Mt. Scott, when i noticed a bright light hovering at a distance away in the sky above Medicine Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my video camera and zoomed in on it.  And you can see a roundish object giving off different colors. I recorded the object for over 2 Minutes.  I have recorded some other videos on other days and month before.  One of the other videos, you can see the object shape shifting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one was seen by me and my daughter.  And one before that also on a different time, was seen by me and a friend.

I am in the Fort Mill, SC AREA. The formed up a triangle, hanging motionless. Then Two of the orange lights appeared to merge into one, then slowly vanished. My neighbor and my wife both saw this. My neighbor stood outside watching as two more orange orbs move upward and hung motionless in the same area as the other 3 had been. These were brighter, more orb-like. The hung there motionless, sometimes they looked like they were dancing around each other until they vanished. Two more, much brighter and more spherical rose up from the same direction. They were much brighter than the previous 5 that I had seen.  My Neighbor and I continued to watch. These too slowly faded out, to a low magnitude star-like appearance, then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my neighbor if he had ever seen anything like this.  He said he was a trained pilot, had been in the military and seen a lot of aircraft, but none behaved like this. There was a lot of air traffic coming  out of Charlotte Airport (we are in the flight path and one airplane flew almost directly over head.  In the distance, beyond the tree line I could see other aircraft making their approach to the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What ever these orange orbs were, they did not behave like aircraft.  Nor were they meteors and fireballs (I have observed and reported these also in the past to the American Meteor Society). They were not planets, or stars (I’ve been a sky watcher/amateur astronomer for years). They did not behave like fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not notice any more orbs after 6:28PM, as I was taking garbage to recycle.  I keep looking but failed to observer any further orange orbs as I drove off and came back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what these were.  But there were at least 3 witnesses who observed the same thing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be happy to discuss this with someone and show them where I saw the orbs.  I reported this to MUFON. They also had similar sighting on that evening.<n>

Around 6:00 PM I went outside to my deck to get firewood and noticed 3 dull orange-red lights, solid not blinking, fairly high in the northeast sky.  Triangular pattern 2 on top 1 below, all moving differently, up and down, side to side, fairly slowly.  I assumed they were helicopters or planes but as I watched them their movements were not consistent with a plane, maybe a helicopter.  They seemed to be a fair distance away, not overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a large government artillery range about 10 miles south of me so it’s not uncommon to see helicopters flying at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched them, suddenly, a cluster of the same type of lights appears west of the lights I just described, in the north sky, very low on the horizon.  The cluster had probably 8-12 lights and was in an ellipse type random formation and they all appeared at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first set of lights didn’t surprise me that much but when I saw this second group I was very puzzled, it was like nothing I had ever seen before.  I called my neighbor who lives +/- 600’ south of me and told her to go outside.  She said she could see the 3 up high but I think my house was in the way of the large cluster.  As I was talking to her the larger cluster was fading in and out, always visible and very bright at times, they were visible for a couple minutes and they didn’t move up or down, they seemed to stay in one place.  Then they all just faded away and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of these lights were nothing like I’ve ever witnessed before orange-red, almost rust color.  Not blinking but they kind of twinkled.  As I watched them, stars were visible but I believe there was also some thin cloud cover because the stars were not bright like they would be here on a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a fairly remote area with minimal light pollution and I didn’t hear any noise associated with what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend checked the notice to airman and temporary flight restrictions for our area and there were none.<n>

It was roughly similar in brightness and size as the planet Venus appeared at that time.  Visibility was good as I could see San Clemente island and the sun had recently set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving at significant speed from left to right and with a motion like a gentle sine wave for what I&#39;d estimate was several hundred miles.  It abruptly corkscrewed downward toward the point at which the water met the horizon and appeared to skate across the top of the water still out near the horizon.  It then began to move toward my location/the coast &#34;skating&#34; across the top of the water with the same gentle sine wave motion only back and forth laterally now rather than vertically as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb appeared to get very close to the beach and then turned around and headed back out toward the horizon and began to gain altitude.  It returned to something near its original altitude and near where I first observed it out over the horizon.  It again executed a helical / corkscrew turn down to the water and approached the coast again where it appeared to vanish into the ocean approximately one mile or less offshore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The duration of the entire event was approximately one minute and was viewed by myself and one witness standing next to me.  I have been a resident of Southern California my entire life and am quite familiar with the view over the ocean during the day and at night, local military bases, airports, etc.  I have never seen anything remotely resembling this in my life except for what I&#39;ve seen on &#34;UFO&#34; specials on the television.  The object / craft appeared to move as though it was under intelligent control and exhibited flight characteristics unlike any craft I&#39;ve ever seen or heard of.<n>

It looked like it was barely moving and lower than where a plane would be.  I jumped in my car and drove home fast, ran in grabbed my camera and yelled to my husband hurry come look at this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound what so ever, it looked very white and cigar shaped, when I first spotted the object it was flying much lower and extremely slow if at all, then it went straight up, and continued to move slow (enough time for me to capture this video) and then took off in about 2 sec across the sky out of my vision.  Later on we heard what sounded like a jet or 2 heading in that direction.  Sorry, it&#39;s a bit shaky.  I was excited and also, I couldn&#39;t see the object on the camera screen so I used the tree branches as a reference.   Just lucky I caught it at all!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very excited about this!   I did get overly excited and tried to switch the camera to picture mode because I wasn&#39;t sure it was able to capture it in video mode (I could not see the object on my screen) and I just wanted some sort of proof.  The pictures didn&#39;t come out that great it looks like a long dot even though I was zoomed in all the way, plus this thing was gaining speed and poof it was gone!

Black Triangle was spotted flying East to West at extreme speed.  No contrail.  No Exhaust.  Altitude and size impossible to estimate because of lack of reference points.  However the object was clear enough to clearly discern triangular shape.  Triangle was not equilateral but more of a Isosceles triangle, longer front to back than wide.  One or two vertical tails might have been present, but due to shortness of sighting this can not be confirmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional details:  Walked outside to have smoke.   Heard strange loud sound filling the air that is very hard to describe.  Sounded like a very low pitched droning sound.  Similar to a tornado warning siren winding down, but much lower pitched.  Sound had no directionality at all.  Looked up trying to discern source of sound and spotted triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Triangle was moving at extreme speed and was over horizon in less than 5 seconds.  Called for son who was inside house, but triangle was long gone before he made it out the door.   However the droning sound was still very noticeable.  He heard the sound before it dissipated, but never saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparent course of object from my perspective appeared to be about 275-290 degrees true.<n>

They separated into pairs, two switched places, and they seemed to &#34;disappear&#34; (we believe they flew into thick clouds as it was an overly cloudy night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft resembled planes, in the sense that it appeared they had wings.  The underbelly of each aircraft was glowing, completely lit up with a bluish light; and they made no audible sound.  There were no navigation lights, no blinking light like planes usually have when flying at night, and they were flying substantially lower than the couple other planes we saw in other places in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what they were but my friend and I dismissed them as stealth jets flying night training missions or something because we are within 50 miles of Dover AFB and have heard they sometimes perform training up and down the coast.  The only thing I can say for sure is that I have never seen anything like it and it certainly was a sight to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Trajectory was from South to North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time and Date: 7:40 pm approximately on 1/13/2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration:  Approximately 5 to 8 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions:  Night, clear sky, no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Setting:  My companion and I were sitting in our vehicle ready to back-up on to street.  Companion checking traffic to his right and noticed orange/red dot lights in the sky to the distance (coming North from South).   He looked again and said, &#34;What is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked and was also surprised to see orange / red dot lights that were moving towards North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We exited the vehicle and walked South on sidewalk to better see coming lights (past our front neighbor’s trees).  What we saw:   As the lights moved North, in what appeared to be two rows of lights, we were able to distinguish that there was a large &#34;mass&#34; craft at the front of the &#34;fleet.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft appeared to be very large and looked diamond-like.  It had red/orange circular lights at the perimeter;  about three or four appeared to be turned on and these looked like dots of light at the perimeter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fleet, including the larger craft, moved smoothly without sound (appeared to be moving fairly slowly and smoothly, but unsure of how fast.  It took about 5 to 8 minutes from when we noticed the lights, to when we saw the final light disappear).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While it seemed as if the fleet was traveling below the height that a plane would fly, we are unsure of the actual size of the larger craft so we are unable to assess height of travel.  With an extended arm, and measuring with your thumb and index finger, the larger craft would be about 5 inches wide and about 1 inch high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the fleet proceeded on its trajectory, the larger mass object was now “in-front” of us.  We were facing west and the fleet’s trajectory was South to North.  The larger craft appeared to be metal, dark and had textured surface (as if the surface was comprised of different levels).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The larger craft lights began to dim until they completely turned off.  When the lights turned off, we were still able to see the dark mass and that is when it was clearer that the surface was not smooth, but &#34;textured.&#34;  The larger craft was still very much silent and still moving toward North, when lights were all off and it continued behind my front neighbor’s trees and then disappeared (or was less visible as if it either went higher, or simply further, I don’t know).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Behind the larger craft followed, what appeared to be, smaller crafts following in the same trajectory.   We do not know how many smaller objects were following, but we believe there were more than 5 (from 5 to 10 possibly).  The following crafts had a number of lights that dimed and then reappeared, so it was difficult to assess quantity.  The lights continued to pass in front of our vantage point until one by one, they began to slowly dim until they disappeared completely (similarly as with the larger craft).  The smaller crafts appeared to be smaller in size and so the surface was not clear as with the larger craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I first thought is was a chinese lantern because of the color (kind of reminded me of the color of fire). It did not flicker or blink (it seemed to glow or flow) but seemed to kind of slightly change shape but was mostly spherical.  It appeared to be about the size of a small car (the distance makes it hard to tell how big it actually was).  I got out of my car and listened, thinking it may be something from the military.  There was absolutely no sound coming from the object that I could discern.  It was directly in front of us over our heads about 1 or 2 football fields.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It kept moving forward in a straight line at the same speed along side Chubb Rd so I go! t back into my car and turned the engine back on and turned the car around to follow it.  Being that it was moving slowly at first, I was going to stop at a friend&#39;s house on that road and have them come out and look at it but it started to speed up about 2 football fields down the road and before I realized it it was speeding away, it arched up into the sky and as quick as I can snap my fingers it looked like a distant star and just disappeared into space.  It seemed effortless.  I worked for the state in a law enforcement capacity.  I have lived in the area for over 10 years and there are many military helicopters and osprey that fly over our area.  I have never seen lights like that or seen any military helicopters or osprey fly silently like that.  Neither have I seen any flying machine that can take off that fast and go that distance into the sky without any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your interest and time.  I would love to know what that could have possibly been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be exceptionally credible.  PD))<n>

I would say this was about 20 times brighter than the light you see from planes, as well as about 30 times bigger, and its speed accelerated in a weird way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a meteorite coming down and I was waiting for some sort of explosion in the distance but nothing happened.  This was not super close to where we were in terms of distance, it was miles away.  The object was only visible for a few seconds and travelled vertically towards the ground.  It started high and was moving quickly, and after a second or so its speed doubled or more and it quickly got much brighter.  It all happened so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like it travelled through our whole atmosphere in less than 2-3 seconds and I don&#39;t know if the glow came from that or whatever happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancee and I were stunned and even though we both saw it because of its super bright shine we didn&#39;t say anything to each other until it was over because we didn&#39;t want to take our eyes away from what was happening.  It was so spectacular she even forgot for a second that she was driving and had to slam the brakes to avoid hitting another car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what this was but I don&#39;t think it was a crashing plane or a meteorite because I haven&#39;t heard anything about it on the news. I&#39;m left with this weird curiosity.  I never thought I&#39;d see something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you!<n>

When I notice on a overpass about a half mile ahead, a round almost oval yellowish orange light the size of a beach ball.  With two smaller blinking red lights on both sides of the yellowish orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance I thought it was a 18 wheeler because how high the red lights were from the road.  But after staring at the lights for 20 or 30 seconds I notice a black shadow above the orange light. The sky was a dark gray-purple which made it possible for me to see the black shadow.  Under the black shadow and yellowish orange light I could the glow of street lights on the other side of the overpass.  That&#39;s when I realized it was not on the road, it was above the road and could not have been an 18 wheeler.  Then the lights shifted to the left behind a tree line and out of my sight.  When I got to the overpass there was no lights or shadow to be found.<n>

Followed by a power flicker of at least 25 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clear skies for Thursday night January 12, 2012 in Saratoga, CA.  I was outside on the phone talking to a friend who lived approximately 25 miles north in San Mateo and was inside their house.  Suddenly, I saw a flash of light across the sky almost instantaneous coming from a Western direction across the sky towards the East.  The light was so fast that while I saw it I thought it was lightning but while the light flashed I reminded myself that we had unseasonably hot and clear weather with no rain for a month.  Then once the light flash ended, all the lights flickered, street lights, neighbors house lights and inside lights and even our own house. I was talking on the phone while I witnessed this and said I saw a light flash across the sky and the lights just flickered off. My friend on the phone said that while I said this, their house lights flickered off and then on again.  I would have thought this was nothing but a power spike, except that I saw the light a! cross the sky flashed in a flick of an eye.  There was no object, just a flash of light across the entire sky as thought it was coming from the West (Pacific Ocean or San Francisco) area.  The entire moment from the light across the sky to then the electrical energy bleep lasted 3-4 seconds. If you blinked, you would have missed the light across the sky.  The electrical outage came after the light, and was a longer bleep.  This happened again approximately 30-45 seconds later.  However, this time the flash of light was barely noticeable and the power flicker only hit the street lights.  I do not live near any electrical power center or any large electrical wires. What was odd is that 25 miles north my friend experienced the same thing, but did not see the light flash because they were indoors.  There were no forms of evidence such as pictures, except that my friend witnessed the electrical outage.<n>

The lights were about the height of a radio tower, with one appearing several feet higher than the other.  There are several radio and cell phone towers in the general vicinity but none in that area and all the others have red lights.  There is an interstate in that direction as well--but it lights were visible (and are orange sodium arc lamps anyway.) I have never seen this type of bright, pure white light before. The two spheres appeared to be stationary.  They did not resemble spotlights (like from a helicopter) or any other common light source we could think of.  We watched them intently for 30 seconds or so from an unobstructed view, though they were visible through the trees for approx 2 minutes as we drove. We did not note any mechanical sounds or aircraft in the area.<n>

I looked up and saw a purple-colored light in the sky, heading away from us.  I commented that it was strange, as usually airplane lights are red or white, but didn&#39;t think very much of it.  A couple moments later, as we arrived back at my car, I looked up again at the object and saw that in the 30 seconds since it was last observed it had completely reversed direction and was heading vaguely towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Realizing that this light may actually be queer, we stopped to observe it.  As it got closer, I noticed that the light was not purple, but was made up of both blue and red lights.  The center of the object was a series of red lights, arranged horizontally.  Above and below the red lights were blue lights that almost looked halo-like. It was the sandwiching of these lights that initially made the object appear purple.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, the object stopped moving towards us and began moving in circular motions.  The lights continually faded in and out while this was happening.  Its movement was not confined to simple circles, and was fairly erratic.  It would circle around in one direction, then stop, then rise up again and then seem to appear in another spot when its lights faded back in.  At one point, the entire object tilted on its side and seemed to dive towards the ground, only to reappear higher up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed the object for around 6 minutes before it began moving away from us, towards the beach.  We decided to try to follow it, but we couldn&#39;t find it again after we left the parking lot.  We went to the beach to see if maybe it had made its way out to sea, but it did not show itself again.<n>

Prevailing winds were out of south, entire object ravel was north-northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning, a girl and I went down the bike path to where they were... the place felt HOT (ambient temp was sub 40* F) and there were two goats on the trail, mutilated... only sharing 1 pic, the other looks like it got ht by a car at hundreds of miles per hour - we found the head and its the only discernible piece of the animal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Local law enforcement  were called, and we were laughed at.  I know they&#39;ve seen the spheres, they witnessed them on 7/3/2012 ((sic.  2011)) at the fireworks display in Eldorado, which has been posted before.  State police were contacted and apparently dispatched some units to the location.  Never saw them; Left within the hour of ISP contact<n>

The sky was clear and the moon was almost full, so when i grabbed my night vision gen3 monocle it was hard to see the craft clearly, but i could see no wings only the fuselage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The body of the craft or fuselage was abnormally long and appeared to be at least twice the length of any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen and I&#39;ve dealt with many different aircraft as I was once in the USAF&#39;s Crash Rescue Team.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not have standard aircraft light markings, its lights seemed backwards... The red blinking/pulsating light was on the front and it had 2 white dimmer lights on the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a minute it was across my yard and into a very large open field area and as I left my house en route to the emergency call i looked ! to my left across the field and it was gone.  It should have been very visible at the slow speed it traveled which was almost a hover or landing speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many military aircraft over the years and Emergency Medical Life flights come over my house very low, but nothing like this and you can hear them for miles, this thing was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, no other aircraft in the area.<n>

A large cylindrical object flew right over my car about 50 to 60 feet in altitude, 30 to 50 feet in length, dark if not black in color. I noticed the color cause as it passed me it turned slightly and silently to the right, and the moon reflected off the surface of it.  It was not shiny more dull in color. It had a large white light in the back.  About the circumference of the body of it;  But the light was not blinding. It would be like if you took a 60 watt bulb and through a diffuser in front of it.  And it had a blinking red light on top.  It had not a smooth surface.  The surface looked like entangled piping.  There was no sound that I could hear.  It passed me going about 80 or 90 MPH then slowed and moved to the passenger side while gaining a little altitude.  At this time it is increasing speed. It then moved to the driver’s side of the road and flew just above the treetops and hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then crossed the road again (passenger side) and it looked like it deceased altitude and was coming back towards me.  The object was less than a quarter of a mile away at this time.  Then at a high rate of speed, flew above the tree tops to my left and a few miles away and hovered again crossed the road and looked like it was going in for a landing, cause it decreased speed greatly and looked like it was descending.  I watched it for 5 mins.  I swear to you this is fact and true!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be quite credible.  PD))<n>

PD))|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87749.html|298|ndxe201201| Strange Noises In The Sky Heard All Over The Earth!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter, I have discovered many videos on YouTube.com purportedly from people all over the world that have filmed loud strange noises coming from the sky or earth in Aug. -Sept. 2011, and also again during the second week of Jan. 2012. These mysterious noises and vibrations sound like construction machines or horns (tubas or trumpets) or some say whales. Some noises sound like knocks or rumblings, also. Most of the noises in the videos sound eerily the same in each widespread location. Personally, I know of three different people in my area that have told me that they heard them back in January, although I did not hear them myself. It&#39;s interesting viewing and speculating about the cause of them, if nothing else, and I thought our fellow readers here would like to know about it and be on the listen for them. Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object looked like a distant star but was directly infront of the helicopter, size was about the size of a large beachball in comparison to the military helicopter with a white light emitting from it like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was heading across the road from east to west.  There were two red lights and two white lights across from each other forming a diamond shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, we thought it was a plane and were alarmed because it was right above tree level, about 100-150 ft up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it crossed the road, he stopped the car and rolled the window down, but we didn&#39;t hear an engine.  It was a very still night.  The craft came to a stop, then proceeded to move in the south-western direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned around to see if we could follow it, turning down Haw Pond Road.  We lost sight of it, so we turned back around to head home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got back to the origin of the sighting, the craft was crossing the road again, heading in the same direction as it was before.  We&#39;re not sure if it was the same craft or a second, but it looked exactly the same as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We proceeded to slow down again, and as we passed it, it appeared to be shining us with one of its white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend accelerated after we saw this, and the craft headed in the northern direction.  We lost sight of it through the trees.<n>

My husband and I had been hearing these really loud jets in the sky for about a half an hour or so, so I went upstairs to see how close they were. I noticed the trails of the jets were all around the sky above our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside to get a look at these trails. The trails did loops directly above our house on all sides. There were a few jets with blinking lights, around 7 doing maneuvers all around the sky in view.. The trails were heavy and hanging for a long time so I stayed outside and looked for awhile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband had gone outside to the shed. I went back upstairs to check on the kids and looked out the window again, this time on the other side of the house (to the southwest). I saw 2 large orange-red orbs above the tree line. They were larger than the moon’s diameter . They were lined up at a 35% angle off the tree line. The craft made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They looked as if they were going to fly right at our house, so I gathered the kids and took them downstairs. I actually thought at first it must be a really large plane that was going to crash into the house, I was assuming it was traveling at great speed. When nothing happened I went back upstairs to look and they were still the same distance away but parallel with the tree line, they hovered there for a minute before turning off for less than a second then reappearing. When they reappeared one was in between the spots they had been and the other was to the left of it, the same distance apart. After a minute or so the lights just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was in the shed the whole time and saw the orange glow shining on the back wall, but was too low below the tree line to see the actual lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then nothing until last night. We had been hearing the jets again and as I was putting our son to bed at around 9:00 I checked the sky (to the west) and saw an orange-red glow above the tree line. It was further away this time. I called my husband up to look and we watched it glow bright, change color, fade to a speck and glow again. This happened for a few minutes and then it lowered into the trees out of our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Moon was in east, objects were 45 degrees to south of moon. Orange balls appeared maybe 35 degrees above the horizon. They appeared to fly next to each other then one would pass the other at high speed and grace, their motion was like that of several spotlights such as would be seen in hollywood for example, but they were orange balls, like little suns. I ran to  get my husband to have him see and they dissapeared.  I am a local woman, I am in the accounting field, have workedfor non-profit orgs my entire career.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have children, a husband, a house and a very busy life. I only saw these items in the sky because i was out back of my house having a ciggarette (a nightly ritual).  I am not a drug user.  I never in my life expected to see something like this.<n>

While smoking a cigarette outside, I noticed a bright light to my left appear in the sky.  It quickly went out, then about a minute later directly in front of me, 1 appeared, then another to the left of it, then 1 under the first one and then another appeared directly above the first one, revealing a total of 4 at one time.  They went out.  Then about 5 minutes later, 3 appeared spaced out horizontally then went out.  A few minutes later to my left again, 2 appeared in a vertical pattern, then faded away 1 by 1.<n>

Naturally I gaze at the stars on my smoke breaks.  I turned my vision in the direction of S/SE for just a moment, and through the trees I noticed what appeared to be a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event lasted at least 3 seconds.  Orion was almost directly above me to the south. I saw a small flash of light which appeared to be rounded in shape.  The size of it was at least ten times the size of a star visible from earth, or 1/10 the size of the moon as seen from earth.  It was going in a downward motion almost as if it were falling out of the sky. It was visible for ~3 seconds, white in color with some faint bluish tint on its edge with a brief faint tail of bright reddish color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed the full event in my peripheral vision and my first thought was &#39;shooting star&#39;(which i have seen many of)  On my second thought, what I had seen had a flight path unlike a shooting star and a duration at least 3x that of a shooting star.  I spent the next ten minutes waiting to see it again and contemplating what it could have been.  It failed to appear again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background or level of interest in anomalies such as this is purely a star gazing hobby with limited knowledge of constellations and cosmic activity.  My age range is 18-25, I am male.  Also I was not under the influence of any controlled substances or alcohol at the time.  My final assumption of the event was that it was a satellite falling from space (something I&#39;ve not witnessed), but some part of me believes this to have been a UFO of some type. These statements are to the best of my memory and descriptive abilities.<n>

It was a cloudy night and there were white clouds.  I observed something dark quickly passing from the top of the full moon to the bottom of the moon (like a curtain), completely blocking out the moon, then the darkening would go back up, and the moon would suddenly be visible again.  The full moon would be completely visible for only a few seconds, and the process of the darkening would repeat.  This happened several times for the 20 minutes I observed.  Also, there was a ball of white light (smaller than the moon, but larger than a star or planet) slightly above the moon.  Then all this stopped, the ball of light was gone, and the full moon was in full view.  I watched for another few minutes after that, and no more unusual events took place.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked around to spot the helicopter, first looking at the sky towards Palm Springs and then to the east and west.  As the sound increased substantially, I then walked around to the front of my home. I looked up to the left first and saw a red light but at a quick glance I thought it was an airplane. At the same time two helicopters were approaching from over the mountains near Joshua Tree but coming from different directions. The helicopters, both, flew towards the red light. The red light then formed into mulitiple red lights and then became a solid object. As the helicopters got closer to this object, it ascended straight up vertically within a second. The helicopters stopped immediately. The object began to float and descend across the skies in a slow motion. I was yelling at the top of my lungs to get someone else to witness what I ! was seeing as I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. I had to go back to the backyard to keep an eye on it as it went over my house. I opened the door to my house and yelled for everyone to come outside. I could still see it from my door, then I walked deeper into my backyard as I was still yelling. All of a sudden the red lights turned into a bright fluorescent, neon baby blue color. A couple seconds later it sped off south towards Palm Springs over the mountains by the windmills. It was so fast that the best way I can explain it is that it traveled at the speed of light. It literally disappeared in front of my eyes over the mountains. The helicopters proceeded to chase it in that direction. At it&#39;s largest, the object appeared the size of a football field and the helicopters looked like ants in comparison. I do not do drugs and was not drinking. I&#39;m still in shock and trying to comprehend what I seen. I tried to record it on my phone but mysteriously my phone froze during the whole ! encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

When I looked up, there were a series of fireball-looking objects in the sky.  The shape is hard to describe as they were like spheres, but with no distinct shape, sort of like a fireball.  There was no sound from them at all, and they moved slowly like clouds floating horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The airspace they occupied looked like the same height in the sky as a small plane or helicopter, perhaps higher, but not as high as a jet.  There were at least 8 to 10 of them, and they were parallel to one another in series of two and three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into my house and watched them from my second story window and then they just disappeared.  I could not tell if they went up, as one did look like it did, but I am not positive.<n>

It appeared to stop moving at times, then it would get closer, and it did not move about like a helicopter or airplane.  It also had no blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this object in the sky for about 5 minutes.  About a minute before it disappeared we had seen what looked like a smaller bright red light fall off or out of the UFO.  Then, as we were discussing that that light may have been a tail light or a wing light, another red light fell off or out of the larger orange object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only this time, there was no mistaking the red light for a fixed light on the larger object.  This red light was again smaller than the orange light in the sky and it fell downwards quite some distance before it faded out or disappeared.  Within 10 seconds of that 2nd red light, the entire orange light/object flickered and faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were also too far away to discern any shape the object may have had.  To us, it appeared almost like a planet you would see in the night sky.  Only this was about double the size and obviously had characteristics not of a planet!<n>

I noticed approximately 4-6 objects in the sky which seemed to be flying in formation.  The object&#39;s color was that of a matte dark gray/black.  The shape was ovalish, but it was truthfully hard to make out an exact shape.  The objects in formation were traveling east at a slow speed, but would at times travel in the opposite direction at slow speeds as well.  There appeared to be to large streaks of smoke in the sky following the objects; however, there was a large gap in between the streak.  The streak was temporary. I would also note that there was a lack of noise coming from the objects.  I was then waiting at a red light waiting to turn left while I continued to observe these objects.  The objects maintained a close formation traveling at a slow speed towards the SouthEast direction.  The objects then increased their speed and began traveling upwards.  When I made the left turn at the light,! the objects&#39; visibility began to decrease.  I was attempting to view the objects while simultaneously driving.  When I looked in the directions I last seen the objects in formation, I could no longer find it.  The weather conditions did not exactly make for a bright and sunny sky due to some light clouds and fog burning off, but there was enough visibility to view anything that should of been in the sky.  I would also note that it may be due to excitement, but I believe that the number of objects in the sky, upon recollection, appeared to be more numerous at the the initial sighting of the formation as compared to when I last saw the objects.<n>

There were no visible clouds in the sky and no visual obstructions.  I saw a bright blue/white flash fly through the sky, north/northwest of me, seemingly moving towards the Earth from my perspective.  It was very brief, and way brighter than a shooting star or satellite.  The car in front of me clearly saw it aswell, because they veered into the other lane briefly as though they were distracted.<n>

I looked out of my window (south) and seen a very low flying object, about tree top high.  We are about 15 minuets from the airport in Springfield, IL, so my first instinct was that it was a plane, until it got closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I notified the passengers in the car to look out their windows on the opposite side of the vehicle as we came to a stop in the road and we all three watched out the windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved over the top of us, we realized that this object was triangular shaped and had lights on each point of the triangle and was not moving at a very fast speed for a normal plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to watch, the object moved onward then turned into two seperate objects and took off extremely fast across the sky in two opposite directions.  One went northeast and one went west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not the first UFO sighting I have seen, the first happened around 1999 just north of Petersburg, IL, at approximately 9pm (3 witnesses), but this UFO started out as an abnormally bright light high in the sky, it disappeared then re-appeared within a few minuets but closer.  We shined a 2 mile flashlight towards the object and it disappeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stared off into the sky in curiosity and suddenly, a large oval light, yellowish orange in color, appeared above our neighbors tree (approximately 1/2 football field away) it just hovered there without noise and another oval light appeared on the right side and one more on the left side of the first initial oval light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects stayed there for only a mere 1-2 minuets and then disappeared.  This object moved fast, hovered, had no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way this happened, I feel that this object wanted our specific attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At one point early in the sighting I heard sounds that sounds similar to the sound that dolphines make under water.I watched the one in the west sky for an hour.  It at times had multiple small beams of light, hair thin , darting out from it, at one point it looked like a light show of color, then the colored lights would stop.

They were at the end of the road and hovering over a library. I drove to get a closer look, even though I could see them through the trees because its winter and with no leaves on the trees. The color was what stood out, and the brightness and color being amber. It is an overcast night tonight in out area but these lights in amber were very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon getting to see them better I knew I only had my iPhone 4 to try and get a photo of at least the formation. They were apart from each other in formation, but upon looking directly at the objects I noticed they were not blinking, and there color amber was a stand out.  They also hovered, no forward or backward movement but I tried to take a photo even though it probably wouldn&#39;t show, and the phone was in auto and the flash went off. I switched to video quickly and filmed but they were  not going to show up on a cell phone.  As soon as I took the photo by flash one of the colored objects moved covering the other object, then one broke apart and it disappeared, and the other followed.  The thing about this is they just vanished as if a hole was in the night&#39;s sky for they to go through.  It also looked a little like an ember burning on last blow out at a fireplace, but the rapid disappearance was very intriguing.  The night&#39;s sky sucked them up.<n>

After listening for a few minutes to what sounded like jets, I walked outside and saw two balls or reddish/orange light to the south.  They stayed in on spot for a few seconds, then they went in to a rapid decent, only to disappear.  Then when I looked up there was about 10 or 15 jets that all seemed to all be heading for the area where I had just saw the lights.  It was like a giant light show in the sky from all the jets.<n>

I look easterly behind the houses. 3 very bright lights. 2 dimmer lights on the side, and one central one. My first thoughts were that is must have been a C-5 from Westover AFB. When I got closer to the part of the road that allowed me maximum viewing, I realized it wasn&#39;t moving. It didn&#39;t look like it was moving going towards it either, whereas with C-5s or other planes they are going faster.  The object had to be about 100 feet in the air.  Once I got toward it, I saw a dark tail on it that was clearly more massive than the craft.  When I stopped and pulled over, that&#39;s when it started to slowly creep away and finally out of my view. It was massive.<n>

I work in an industrial park and the area I was in was cleared of trees and obstructions.  I looked toward the south and there was a circular object moving VERY slowly right above the treeline.  The oval object had orange circular lights going around the whole of the ship and I stood there crossing out everything that it could be in my mind. It was most definetly NOT a balloon or a cloud or a plane or a helicopter. It was moving so slow that a plane has to be crossed out and if it was some stealth kind of military plane the shape was all wrong. It was NOT sleek or strong looking. Actually it looked sort of huge and clunky. It looked like something out of like a 50’s sci fi movie and not some newfound classic CGI spaceship that adorn our movie screens today. I knew that the ship was soon going to descend out of my sight beyond the treeline so I yelled at one of my coworkers who was approximat! ely 50 feet away. As I ran over to her the object just reached a point where it could not be seen anymore. I asked her, “Did you see that UFO?” and she said, “Is that what it was? I saw it and I don’t know WHAT that was…” The object if I had to estimate was very large I would say half a football field in length (150 feet) and I was appox. 150 feet away when I saw it. I witnessed the craft for about 15 seconds. It was dusk and I think that actually helped in assuring me it was a UFO and not something else. If it had been completely dark I would have probably chalked it up to something natural because then I could have ONLY seen the lights. Although it was too dark to accurately identify the color of the ship I could at least see the outline and it was in my opinion not of this world. As a side note, my job is one exit off the highway away from Fort Meade. We are literally yards away from this military base and approx. 20 minutes north of Washingon, DC.<n>

When I got outside he pointed to the sky and I saw two huge bright lights horizontally next to eachother.  I was in shock and couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing! The lights were big, round, very bright, and seemed to be move around eachother at one point. The light on the right went out, almost like someone turned of a light switch, and then the second light  went out. Immediately after the lights  disappeared i noticed a bunch of smaller blinking   lights surrounding the area where i had seen the lights. We live in a secluded area and are surrounded by federal land. There is a military training base about 35 minutes away. We have a lot of air traffic, military and non military, so I&#39;m assuming we live in some kind of fly zone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not an airplane.  I have never seen anything like this in my life. It almost like whatever or whomever it was,  knew we were watching it and turned the lights off.

It was a craft that mocked a helicopter, but I noticed something was off with it.  It maneuvered much like a helicopter.  It had the directional lights on it, as well as a strobe light.  It was circling above the City of Pittsburgh, though higher than the buildings.  I couldn&#39;t see any body of the helicopter.  At one point, all of the lights turned off but one.  It looked much like a star in the sky.  Then all of a sudden, it turned into a VERY bright light that was painful to stare at.  It then proceeded to turn back on it&#39;s directional lights and strobe light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a few short miles up river on the Allegheny, I saw a similar craft.  It could have been the same, but would have had to move at a lightning speed.  It did the exact same thing with the lights as the first craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live fairly close to an airport.  I have seen planes and helicopters at night before.  I have seen them from all different angles and making many turns.  This was unlike anything I have ever seen before.  And again I stress, all I saw was the lights.  There was no body to either crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have taken pictures, but it was very dark, and I a passenger in a vehicle driving to work.<n>

At first I thought it was a star or planet such a Venus or something, however, I noticed it slowly moving in the South East direction. The first light to catch my attention was brighter than Venus on a clear evening. It was following another dimmer light. There were no sounds from them and they appeared to be far off in the distance. I watched them make their way across the night sky. Both objects moving in the same direction keeping the same amount of distance between them. The faded as the reached the horizon line. I live near an airport and I&#39;m used to seeing objects in the sky, however, these two objects acted differently. I wouldn&#39;t have thought anything of it if there hadn&#39;t been two of them. The first one I saw dimmed quicker than the one leading the two lights. I&#39;ve never seen aircraft do this, they have flight patterns and generally there are no flights out of our a! irport this late. I don&#39;t believe it was a helicopter because they usually fly solo. This was different.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There are tall hills in that direction. It looked like a single row of stadium lights and, initially, I thought it could be lights of top of the hills in the distance.  However, my wife pointed out that they were too high in the sky to be on a light pole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was black and clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we noticed that the lights were moving towards our location at a slow rate of speed which told me it was not an aircraft making an approach into Travis AFB, nor do military aircraft have anything more than running lights.  As it came closer, we could make out a shape (I called it a flying wing or boomerang) and the entire forward edge had white lights from end to end which did not appear to project a beam.  We noticed that other drivers were beginning to pull to the side of the road to observe the object.  We did not stop. As it passed nea! r us to our left, we got a good look at the underside as another array of red lights went on behind the white lights.  The red lights appeared to go off and on randomly.  It was a large dull colored craft which seemed to blend with the sky, it was moving very slowly, and it made no sound.  From what I know about aviation in this country, we have nothing like it in our national inventory.<n>

Then a second bright light appeared diagonal to the upper left of the first light, then a third bright light appeared diagonal to the upper left of the second one.  The first one then went away and I saw another light appear diagonal and to the left of the third light. It was difficult to discern if the lights were moving closer, but for the most part it seemed they weren’t moving much, if at all.  A couple of seconds later, in order from right to left they went away...I pulled over on Mahan Street and rolled my window down to try and hear an engine or anything but I didn&#39;t hear or see anything then. I got home and when my husband pulled up ~5 minutes later, I was pointing out to him where and what I saw and my neighbor pulled in ! his driveway and asked if I had seen the UFO too...he described it EXACTLY the way I did. Then I found out my husband, right before he got home and after my sighting, had seen one bright light about 30 degrees above the horizon around 6:08 pm (he was going downhill into a dip on the same road) and the neighbor said he had seen that one too.  I posted my sighting on facebook and my friend who lives here in Ridgecrest said her Dad told her he had seen the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw three red disks in the sky that seemed to be “chasing” each other in a circle.   I told my husband to come see, he got his camera and took a video as well as a picture.  We were both in awe as we have no idea what we saw.   The disks we saw were not blinking and were very bright and easy to see.  They were also moving from left to right, two of them went behind a tree where we could not see them and never came back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then got in the car and started driving.  As we were driving, we could still see one of the red disks.  My husband saw it fly very fast across the sky towards the north.  I kept watching as my husband drove and it went so far out of sight I could not see it anymore.  Neither of us have ever seen anything like it before, my daughter couldn’t see it because she is too young.  When we got home we searched about things like this on the internet and found quite a bit of reports about them, but no answers as to what they are.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like it was in the woods.  The best way I can explain it is, it looked like a small fighter plane.  It was white or a silver in color.  From what I could tell, it was maybe 25-50 feet long.  It was pretty small (although it was hard to tell exactly where it came from because it happened so fast).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowly hovered at an angle, almost as if it was taking off.  I kept my eye on it until it suddenly zoomed off as such a speed that my eyes couldn’t even keep track of it. I searched the cloudless sky for the craft, but it was no where to be seen.  The only reason I knew I wasn’t going completely crazy is because I heard it.  After it had zipped away, it left me with the sound of it taking off.  It was quite loud. I know it wasn’t a plane.  There are no airports anywhere where I live.  Plus, the area I live in is too woodsy to fly a plane.  It was way too small to be a plane.  It was too big to be any sort of model toy plane too.  I have no idea WHAT it was, but it definitely was something.  (My brother and mom also saw a blueish light zip off the night before).<n>

I looked up in the sky and noticed what I first assumed to be a plane.  I am skeptical by nature, so I tried to figure out what I was looking at before I jumped to conclusions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something struck me as odd as I studied it, and it was then that I noticed that there were lights covering the entire length of the object and that I had never seen a plane with so many on it.  Most of the lights were of the white variety, save for one blue one.  They were steady at first, but then the blue one and one of the white ones flashed on and off twice.  Then they went back to being steady for the remainder of the time. In all of my life, I have never seen any type of aircraft with that many lights on at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was flat-oval in shape and looked to be about an inch long in the sky.  I continued driving while trying to keep it in my scope of vision.  When the road turned, it was now in the north-west sky.  Then it vanished.  There were no buildings or trees to block the view, only open sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any event, whether or not it was really a UFO, I&#39;m not an expert. All I can say is that it was unlike anything that I&#39;ve ever seen, and prompted this email to you. If you would like to speak with me about it, I am more than happy to relay this information to one of your investigators.<n>

The object quickly became out of sight as it just disappeared into the dark, but there was nothing to hide it as the sky was clear and there were no trees to block it.

The object was visible for about 4 minuets as it climbed at a steady rate to approx 50deg above the horizon directly east of my home. At that point,  the ball began to grow fainter and appeared to change direction and go vertical or turn 90 deg away from my position until the light faded to nil 5 seconds later. Halfway through the observation I went outside to see if there way any sound, and heard nothing.  I can see and hear airplanes nightly through the same window and am familiar with the flight paths that are used in the skies above Sacramento. This was unlike anything I seen in the 10 years I’ve lived in the home.  I only possibility I’ve been able to come up with is that 40 NE of Sacramento is Beale AFB, home to the 9th Recon Wing of t! he Air Force. Anybody know what a U2 Dragonlady spyplane looks like in full afterburner max climb at night?<n>

I was getting closer to the object and I could make it out better as I kept driving.

All the other stars that were scattered around looked normal white.  These lights were orange reddish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day at the funeral reception we asked my godson if he saw anything.  He said his friend saw what he thought were UFOs and they were reddish.<n>

They were in a triangular formation and appeared to be individual orbs.  My husband expressed that there had been 6 in the sky one minute ago, and ran back into the house to get his phone to try to take a picture.  I felt dizzy and grabbed the wall to steady myself.   When I looked back up to the orbs, one had gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the two that were left were still in the same position as when I first saw them, then the one that was lower in the sky began to pulse, and I was afraid that it would go away before my husband could get a picture.  He waited for his phone to load and the lower orb flashed and in my opinion, shot out of site toward the South East.  The final orb that was a little higher and to the right of the one that just “left” was now beginning to pulse.  It moved down 2 inches in my view, and then shot off as well, toward the South East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there in awe for a min, repeating, ”What was that?”, “What were those?”  I mentioned that maybe they were comets burning through the atmosphere, or perhaps something new that TAFB is testing in weaponry, but have NOT seen any news of this.  We searched the local newspaper and NASA’s web site to see if there were any comets that night, but found nothing.  We viewed some you tube videos labeled “Orange orbs” and some other people have captured this same phenomena in many other areas of our country and even in other countries.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I read one opinion that they may be a plasma weapon of defense that is used to “melt” something from the sky.  This may be a laser that creates a photon ball of lightening in the sky and then can be maneuvered using micro-waves, a lot like the drones that are manipulated and used in the middle-east right now.  This makes sense to me, but have not been able to find anything official.  The persons opinion of this was linked to a web site…sciencenews.com  I&#39;m an educated at home mother of three (and a student) with a career history in Human Resources, Accounting and Education.  My husband is a Navy Veteran, who is a hard working man and student.  We are rational, open minded, California natives.  I believe there is an explaination for this event, and have felt compelled to find out these orange orbs source of being.  Any help would be appreciated.<n>

One orange ball was hovering still and the other orange ball was circling around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it first and told my wife to look so we decided to pull off the highway and she then proceeded to get out and take a picture and within that time frame of 2 minutes the orange balls just disappeared with the blink of an eye.

At first, they were both moving about the same speed, then one slowed down, and the other kept going.  I called my wife out to see, and by the time she came out, the faster one was almost out of view.  She got the binoculars, but couldn&#39;t make out any distinguishing features.  We watched for a few minutes, as the fast one moved behind a tree, and the slower one seemed to just hover and then slowly move away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They all flew in one direction, cut across left above my work building into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> within 10-15 minutes, the sky was SWARMING with helicopters and airplanes and TONS of our own flying machines.  Every dog on the block was barking, HOWLING, for at least 20 minutes while these things flew by. And around 745 is when I saw the last one, diagonal from my office, right above a church, well, not RIGHT above like the one that flew literally 50 feet over my head, but a little ways above the roof of the church, and has sat still to this moment (806p) and is SLOWLY rising higher into the sky. I would say in the time it has SAT there, it has only moved upwards about 300 feet. AND it&#39;s blinking purple and pink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother, aunt, and cousin drove to my work and were also witness to the last one floating in the sky.<n>

The sky was clear, with a big full moon illuminating the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, I saw a flash of light in the sky to my left.  I looked up and saw 3 lights in a triangular shape.  It was maybe 150 to 200 feet in the air.  In between the lights I could see a solid metal shape.  It was moving slowly, and floated across the road just in front of me.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it had passed across the road I looked to my right and could see it for a short period of time. There was a vehicle behind me on the road that must have seen it too.  Wish I had pulled over and watched it further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess I was kind of afraid, so I just kept driving.<n>

I was thinking it is to big to be a planet  it must  be an aircraft when I saw it seemingly zig-zag.   So I stopped and put my finger up to see if I was imagining things and it seemed to be completely stationary  but looking at the sky every night I am sure this is not be a big orange planet but since it isn&#39;t moving it can&#39;t be an airplane.  Then,  it just vanished.  There was no noise  like to be a helicopter or flare or something closer.  Now, I was generally concerned but more so because about 3 months ago a teen was leaving our house and said he saw an orange light over our pasture zig-zag across the sky then disappear!! I din&#39;t give it much thought until last night.   I would like someone to tell me what exactly this was.<n>

They were traveling  the same course  in a loose formation with the first, in my perspective, to be the lowest.  Above and to the right was  the second and a little farther behind, above and to the right of the second was a third.  They appeared as helicopters would, entering my view low on the horizon and about the same speed.  Objects were silent. In my experience, helicopters at that range would have been clearly audible.  At this time a wittness began observing objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the lights as they proceeded in an easterly direction when, one by one they turned, seemingly at the same point, to a southerly direction, traveled a  short distance, grew dim, and &#34;twinkled out&#34;,  like a candle running out of fuel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked back to the west, where I had first seen the fireballs, and a fourth appeared, seemingly out of a dark sky.  Description of the fourth exaclyl follows the first three in appearance, speed, altitude, and course. It also  &#34;twinkled out&#34; after changing course to the southern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took pictures, every one shows something, a few are very faint even with magnification.  Two are Interesting, one showing swirl from camera movenemt oppisite of swirl from object.  They all show the reddish-orange color.<n>

Excellent view all over.  This Sunday morning I saw three bright lights hanging in the sky.  Normally I would take them for airplanes as we live near an approach of Rotterdam airport.  However they did not move. J ust hung there.  At different heights.   Hard to determine what heights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 15 minutes one by one the lights started moving west (I think) and they became smaller, less bright.  Then I saw flashing lights going around in circular motion.  Then they disappeared altogether.  There can be explanations: blimps. But we don’t have those here.  Or helicopters.  But what would three helicopters with huge lights be doing here hanging on different heights?   Not likely.  That is all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards from Holland.<n>

In the distance about 2 miles head on, a pair of bright white lights positioned side-by-side in the sky catch my eye. The spacing between led me to believe they are mounted on each wing of an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was, knowing there aren’t any airports near, that someone hijacked a commercial airplane. The lights looked like something you would expect from such aircraft, and it’s altitude was low enough as to land within moments on the stretch of highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I head its direction, it doesn’t seem to get closer, or farther from me. However the lights shift west, left of me from now not over the road. Myself, trying to make sense of this, I am thinking these lights were merely lighted beacons to signal airplanes; for what seemed to be twenty seconds they remained stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having realized, I did not notice the pair of lights during the last four days I traveled this bit of road, they shifted back over the highway; then seem to be consumed by cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time myself and three other vehicles reduced speed to about fifteen miles per hour to more closely investigate what it is we are seeing. The strange pair of lights emerge but now on the right side off the road. What seemed to take 5 seconds, they maneuver into a top and bottom position then side-by-side once again before disappearing for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you can imagine a plane performing a slow barrel roll and remain upside down, puzzling as it may, I am certain this was not normal aircraft; but that of out of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Name deleted))  -Original story-  &#34;I was driving on Hwy 3, in League city when I noticed 2 white lights side by side.  My first reaction was that it was a commercial plane flying low about 2 miles directly infront of me. It slowly shifted to.  My left hand side, so I then thought that it was the angle I was driving and it was really a light pole for airplanes because it was stationary for about 20 seconds. It then started shifting back cross the road way and disappeared behind some clouds. By then me and other cars we slowing down to see what it was. When it reappeared it was on the right hand side. Then lights then started to move slowly, one above the other then side by side light the craft flipped upside down then the lights disappeared and it was gone. (Took about 5 seconds to do the flip) 3 other cars driving with me, slowed down to 15mph&#34;  ((name deleted))<n>

It appeared as if they were heading north for a short amount of time then looked as to travel to the east and climb.  The entire time the lights would start to fade and brighten sporadically.  After about three minutes they all started to fade to the east and climb.  The last and most center of the lights was the last to fade.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Changes from Orange to Grey and floats in one spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving West on Golf Course Road, close to Fort Hammer Road in Parrish FL when I saw an Orange/ Red light right in front of me.  At first, it looked like a Planet like Mars, but then I noticed that it was way too big to be a planet. I would say it was about a 5th the size of the moon. As I drove closer, I could see the stars behind it moving at a different speed. This is when I realized that this object was probably only a couple hundred feet above ground. It seemed to stay in one place, then it&#39;s glow went away, and it was just a dark grey color. I stopped my car and kept my eye on it. I opened my sunroof to watch it more closely. It slowly flew right over me, but I could barely see it. I couldn&#39;t hear any engines or propellers, but my car was running still.  I was watching the constellations for a reference to it&#39;s speed and hight, and it went right in front of a star, so I knew it was there. I lost track of it and drove off. My wife was driving in he! r own car 2 minutes behind me. I called her and told her to look, as we were both driving home. She saw it too, and it turned Redish Orange again.<n>

Too bad we didn&#39;t get the mother ship it looked like it was straight out of the movie &#34;Close Encounters of the third kind&#34;...  The first of the 4 sightings within 1hr started off with a HUGE Mother Ship I guess you could call it.  But by the time we got up into the hills it was gone, we were trying to get up into the area they were headed...  I thought I would call my Son and tell him what we were seeing and see If he wanted to drive up, he lives very close to where we parked in the hills...   And guess what happens.  We get a forth time that these red orbs come flying by but this time we are up in the Remote Area back in the mountains...  My wife and I were very surprised on this 4th sighting not even expecting to see more...  One of the orbs stopped and paused a min before it turned left and flew over the mountains, it looked like it was going to come back and check us out...  I must say we did get a little excited when that! happened... In all I guess there was over 50 as in each group of Orbs there must have been 10 or more red light orbs... There was no way of telling if they all were hooked together but they seemed to be separate orbs...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was lucky enough to catch this even on the third sighting.  I had my cell phone and used it on the third time we seen them.  I never expected to see this a second time much less 4 times in less then a hour...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the URL on Youtube where I posted what I caught on tape...<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nEk4io9o8o&amp;context=C3a3240aADOEgsToPDskK0XoG5LVYNFWvWbcTqlnJo<n>

I was on I84 in CT between exit 14 &amp; 15. Iwas travelling east with my 4 year old, who also saw it. I saw it against a partly cloudy sky but very bright moonlight.  It looked like an orange light, round, the whole time. But it was not partcularly large, as I had a clear view against the clouds.  It had no &#34;body&#34; other than the light (one would see the fuselage that close). I pulled over to get a better view, and watched it disappear over a hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 34, an engineer, and always had a logical explanation for everything I&#39;ve in the sky until this.

We were in our living room with the balcony open, taking advantage of the cool south Florida weather.  Our balcony faces south east, we are only a couple of miles from the beach.  There were scattered clouds and it wasn&#39;t completely dark yet but, close to it (approx. 6:30 PM).  The object was a round light and when it streaked across the sky it had a long white tail, it sort of pulsated an orange glow.  I would say the front part was about the size of an aspirin held at arm&#39;s length, plus the long cylindrical tail.  It was so bright it lit up the clouds as it moved through them.  It was a &#34;wow!!!&#34; moment, that&#39;s what we both said as we saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly on the following night, my boyfriend, my sister &amp; I were sitting out on the balcony around the same time and we were pointing to the sky around the same area to show my sister where we saw the object and we saw another moving light, this time it was a lot higher up in the sky, not as close as the previous night.  All of us spotted it at the same time.  What are the chances of that happening 2 nights in a row?<n>

I was looking up at the sky and  all of a sudden, I saw a shiny metallic balloon-like object floating in the air.  I looked at it for several seconds.  As I was almost finished hunting, I thought maybe I would shoot at it, for target practice.  Then all of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, it darted off to the right, and in a blur it was gone.  I continued to stare at the sky wondering what had just happened, and thinking it may re-appear.  After several minutes I came to the conclusion that I might have just seen a UFO…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was an exceptionally clear day.  The temperature was 8 degrees Celsius, and the wind was from the North at 5 m / s (according to the Yahoo Japan weather service website).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were looking toward the East, at an 8 X 17 meter advertising structure on top of a 6-floor building across the street from the station (approximately 65 meters from where we were at on the platform, according to Google Earth).  The structure was empty except for a banner calling for would-be advertisers, detailing its dimensions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were discussing the size of the structure when from behind it there appeared several small, spherical objects traveling in a southeasterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is difficult to say from how far behind the structure the objects appeared, but if I were to hazard a guess, I would say between 50 and 100 meters.  The objects “appeared” to be about the size of basketballs.  If this would be the case, then we were seeing the objects from about 100 meters to 165 meters away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were silver, were of a uniform size, and were easy to see against the bright blue sky.  They were not in any discernible formation.  We watched at least ten to fifteen appear randomly from behind the advertising structure traveling in the same direction and at the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound associated with the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects did not “gyrate” or move about as one sees when watching balloons carried on the wind.  They did not rise or fall, but stayed in the same position relative to each other and all traveled at the same, continuous altitude (some above the others, but at the same relative altitude), and in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the objects for approximately one minute, until they got too far away to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were few people on the platform at the time, and no one other than my brother and I seemed to notice them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I are teachers and have lived in Japan for 15 years.<n>

I have seen this on many numerous occasions.  It is probably nightly.  It seems to stay in one spot but moves so slowly you can not detect movement.  It is not from a tower due to the movement.  It appears to be too bright to be a star, so low to the horizon and also there are no stars in the vicinity minutes before it appears.  It is always around the same time but a few months ago it was a couple of hours later.  It cant be car lights because it is actually above the rim of the mountain.  I have never seen it come in.  One minute its not there and the next it is there.  It seems to move very very slowly and then the mountain is in the way of my view.<n>

As I got right up to the fence I peered over and looked into the woods and saw the top of a head fairly large, pale white head on top of a 3 foot tall figure.  I called out &#34;Hello?&#34; and as soon as I did the being ran away into the woods at a very fast rate and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/6/12 21:15|Charlotte|NC|Light|1-2 Minutes|3 Glowing Orbs glide across the night sky in triangle shape.|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86454.html|416|ndxe201201| 3 Glowing Orbs glide across the night sky in triangle shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday, January 6th, 2012 Charlotte, NC 28209<n> <n><n> <n><n> A group of friends and I were playing a game of night Frisbee at the local middle school.  At approximately 9:15 pm someone shouted, &#34;Look up at the sky!&#34;  We all shifted out attention to the clear dark sky, where 3 balls of white light were swiftly gliding in perfect unison.  Even more bizarre, was how these foreign balls of light moved.  Not only did they glide with a solid white glow, (didn&#39;t flash like an airplane), they moved in a perfectly symmetrical equilateral triangle shape.  One light guided the other two across the sky, all of which appeared to be the exact same distance from one another, forming three perfect 45 degree angles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all dumbstruck by the phenomenon and attempted to make sense of it while continuing to admire its beauty.  Each of us announced our individual ideas in hopes of deriving a logical explanation for the triangles existence, whilst smothering the immediate idea that lingered in all of our hearts - could it be a UFO? 	Perhaps it just seemed too unlikely for us to be blessed enough to actually witness, first-hand, a true UFO sighting.  I remember watching the lights glide across the sky and debating whether or not to take a picture from my phone, not wanting to appear juvenile, I decided against it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the lights glide for approximately one minute, the rear two lights began to reduce their distance apart from each other making the guiding light&#39;s angle (Far Right) more acute and the other two light&#39;s angles more obtuse (Left &amp; Center).  The possibility that their paths were not predetermined by the front light (Far Right) began to cross our minds.  However, surely enough the rear lights settled into their new position and the three glowing lights maintained there new triangular shape and continued to travel across the night sky, once again, in perfect unison.  This proceeded for approximately 30 seconds.  Then, the far left light suddenly vanished from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The group burst into uproar, attempting to decipher the cause of the disappearance.  The consensus from the other witnesses was that it must have disappeared behind some clouds.  However, I was not convinced for two reasons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, the sky appeared completely absent of clouds, no reflection from the moons glow indicated any cloudy haze whatsoever.  Secondly, even if it did disappear behind the clouds, eventually it would have reappeared - it never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 15-20 seconds after the far left glow disappeared from sight, the front guiding light also disappeared (Far Right).  Leaving the last light to dwindle for approximately 20 seconds until it, too, disappeared.   The lights never revealed themselves to us again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day later, a friend of ours who was at a neighboring mall the night of the occurrence, approximately 3-4 miles a way from our sighting, also saw the glowing orbs in the sky that night.

He was driving south on Highway 87 having just passed Old Highway 87 when he noticed reds lights in the middle of the road just ahead not quite to Clarks Fork.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking he was coming up to an accident he slowed down.  The witness pulled to the side of the road and stopped his car.  He grabbed a flashlight, turned it on and shone it toward the pick up truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then that he realized the red lights were actually hovering over the truck stopped in the middle of Hwy 87.  The UFO then moved up and headed east toward Columbia.  The pick up truck sped off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO turned around and came back to the witness.  He reached for a camera but everything happened too fast; the Unknown was coming directly at him.  It stopped over his car and he could see orange and reddish lights reflected on the hood.  It seemed to! be coming down. The window was open and he leaned out thinking it might be a helicopter.  There was no prop noise only a deep bass sound with the rhythm of a heart beat.  Luckily it moved off and left him.  He arrived at his home at about 8PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day his face was red and he felt slightly sick to his stomach and very thirsty.  He continues to be upset by theincident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I examined the car about a week later and there seemed to be no damage or anything unusual from the incident.  I also searched the area for the other witness in the truck but could not find him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Included is a link to a Google Map of the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://g.co/maps/b3gn9  Barbara Becker / MIG<n>

Ok the first and second one went from left to right at different times and they didn&#39;t go straight but same direction. Then two came up from the monument from what i and my friend could tell and went up and disappeared into thin air like the ones befor it. And then a couple mins latter another popped up and did the same as the last two and vanished. None of them went straight just kind of went in that direction. It was amazing. Never saw anything like it<n>

Everything I tell you is for real. From 1/6/12 to 11/6/12, I have taken over 700 still photos using mostly 200 type 35 mm film and (more recently) 800 type 35 mm film.  I have about 25 hours of VHS video which includes some day light footage, but, mostly night footage.  I have photos and film of fantastic light shows and wild displays of flying. I have from beginning to end abduction photos.  Beams of light taking people up. I have photos of the Aliens that are called Grays and the big hairy ones that look like a Sasquatch.  I have discovered a location where I have seen the UFO&#39;s on the ground and taking off.  I have seen the Aliens and captives on the ground there and filmed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MUFON has published a number of my photos.  What I see in some of my photos is disturbing so I want more people to be aware of this.  I have not reported any of this to the authorities.  It&#39;s pointless to do so, as you probably know.  I will mail you photos via the post office and try to e-mail you photos.  My system is old so they may not get through. Let me know if they do.<n>

My neighbors boyfriend was standing there on the phone.  He got off and we started talking about life other than here on earth, when we noticed very dim lights that looked like stars in motion leave the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after, the object I first seen while coming up the hill began slowly coming into viewfrom behind the home at the end of the alley.  I asked him what did he think this was and he said he don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for about a half an hour til it moved in line with the middle of the alleyway.  Then I told him to get his girlfriend so she can see this as she didn&#39;t believe in UFOs.  She came out and freaked when she saw this object.  It seemed to be looking at us and was turning every color in the spectrum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sat in this spot for another 90 minutes or so and began to slowly move farther away.  As it was moving, my neighbor noticed jets flying toward the object (6 of them).  They one by one flew over to this object and did it in large circles like it was seen on their radars as an anomaly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were also low flying black helicopters with no lights on them doing fly overs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember everything like it happened today!!!<n>

I could see in the moonlight and city lights a &#34;smoke&#34; trail left where object came down.  To give you and idea of brightness, in the photo it is about half as bright as street lights also in photo.  I suppose it may have been a miltary flare dropped from aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I continued to watch it formed a triangle with a light at each point.  Later these lights would blink also forming a line at time (around 4 or 5 dots/lights) blinking in intervals of red and white lights.  Pulled over at a gas station off of Weyers Cave exit and watched also mentioning it to other people who saw and did not recognize the aircraft.  It circled around the area (From Weyers cave to Bridgewater, Va area)and did this for around 45 minutes.  Got to my house and eventually saw it in the distance heading over the mountain range towards Charlottesville VA. I am thinking this was some sort of military aircraft, just not one I am familiar with or have seen before. I also tried to take a video with my phone and pictures with my camera on my droid X but my phone displayed an error message reading &#34;Files ca! nnot be displayed at this time&#34;  By the time I got home (About 8 minutes away from gas station and away from aircraft)  I was able to get into my videos and pictures. Of course I was unable to record anything...sigh.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was driving home in between the time of 5:30 and 5:50 p.m.  I had passed 93 South to merge back to Route 1 in Massachusetts.  When I started to get close to exit 11B, I saw a string of lights in the sky in the top left corner of my windshield. The lights where in a straight line and flashed.  I would say it looked like an old camera flash going off in the far distance.  The row of lights where about 10 individual lights that went went off at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a plane and I continued driving getting closer to exit 11B.  Because of the time, traffic became congested and my car was going maybe 5 mph if at all.  As I looked up all of a sudden there was a huge craft of some some sort floating right across the highway from my left and crossed into the woods to my right.  What was strange about this object was that it wasn&#39;t hovering like a helicopter or pushing air to keep itself up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was steady when floating across and it never wavered.  The object floated right across the street with no disturbance to any cars.  The object was moving so low and so slow that I was able to see what it looked like from its underside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 3 white lights in the form of an Isosceles triangle, one blue orb in the middle which color looked like a car high beam blue, and a small red dot near the white light near the top.  Besides the lights, I could not see what the object was made out of.  It looked darker than black.  It looked like a moving shadow.  Light did not reflect on its surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was rather large in comparison to my sedan.  The object was as big as two sedans parked next to each other.  The object was no higher than the exit sign above me, which I estimate to be somewhere between 100 to 200 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in too much shock to take any video with my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the object moved into the woods the object came to a halt then just started  to flash in the wooded area to my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As traffic started to move again, I continued to move forward while the object above ground continued to flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere and credible.

My 14 year old son looked up and noticed a bright light moving west to east over Utah Hill - just  to the west of Saint George.  It appeared to be an orange-colored landing light but its altitude was quite high.  At first I laughed because they often think airplane and jet lights are something out of the ordinary.  But then it stopped and stayed in one place for 30 seconds or so, then changed its direction of travel to east to west. It then stopped for maybe two seconds and changed directions again.  This time raising in altitude then vanishing completely.  Just a few seconds after that, another very dim object appeared and flew in an intersecting path from south to north, then vanished.  At this point in the evening the sun had just set below the mountains leaving the sky overhead dark, while the horizon was still bright with a nice sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started to return to our task when my brother then saw a dark, almost translucent &#34;ball&#34; drop behind the mountain (Utah Hill to the direct west).  Three other people who were walking to their car stopped and watched.  I had missed that one, but only a few moments later, I saw the same thing dropping from the darker part of the sky into the horizon that was still orange with the last bit of sunlight.  It was a massive, round object that looked like a silhouette floating steadily but slowly downward.  We all watched it for approximately 45 seconds until it vanished behind the mountain-line.<n>

I arrived at a stop sign &amp; looked up to see a jet and the usual smoke following it, but towards the end and just under the smoke trail there was a motionless, silver ball-shaped object. I was trying to make out what this could be, but had to focus on the road. I turned in a westerly direction and when I looked back up, the object was gone. It was still light outside, so I told myself it must&#39;ve just been a reflection of some kind, but up ahead, I saw the object again, blinking like a star, moving at a high rate of speed in a westerly direction, leaving no trail. It either went too fast to see anymore or vanished, because it was nowhere. At this same time, I counted SIX jets (all with smoke trails) in the vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first we thought it was an airplane on fire because he lives close to an airport.  Then we thought it was debris from space but we didnt see any debris.  It was silent as it flew over.  The object came out of the clouds, flew directly over our heads and went back into the clouds.  My brother tried to take a picture with his phone but it didn&#39;t come out.  It flew at exactly 79 degrees east because we looked at the compass on his phone headed towards Canada.  We haven&#39;t called the airport yet to see if they saw something on radar.  It is something we can&#39;t explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/6/12 09:10|Tucson|AZ|Oval|10 secs|Pure white oval object seen at the Catalina Mountain Range, Tucson, Az. 01/06/12|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86398.html|436|ndxe201201| Pure white oval object seen at the Catalina Mountain Range, Tucson, Az. 01/06/12<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of 01/06/12 at 8:30 my friend and I were hiking east of Tucson at the end of Broadway Blvd. in the Saguaro Nat&#39;l Park.  I am 61 and work in retail sales and he is in his 50&#39;s and is a professional therapist.  Due north of us is the Catalina Mtn. Range.  I estimated the range to be approx. 5 miles away and upon looking at a map that distance is confirmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx. 9:10 AM I looked to the north towards the Catalinas and saw a pure white object below the skyline thus framed against the mountain itself.  It appeared to be the size of a small plane or good sized helicopter at first notice and was traveling due east skirting the mountain range at a speed that would not be inconsistent with such vehicles.  Since I wasn&#39;t paying attention to sound in the environment due to my friend and I having a conversation I then stopped hiking, called the attention of my friend to the object and then listened for engine or rotor sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I initially heard motor sounds but we soon both agreed that it was coming from northwest of us and was clearly machinery being used in roadwork or something similar.  I then watched the pure white semi-round object begin to have a ripple effect similar to a bed sheet fluttering in a breeze.  This effect was contained in the confines of the object itself and was not a phenomenon that the object was projecting in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then proceeded to travel on its unwavering horizontal course and became pure white again.  it should be noted that my optometrist told me that with my glasses on (which I was wearing) I have better than 20/20 vision.  My friend told me he has 20/15.  He said he didn&#39;t see the initial couple of seconds of the incident due to a cactus being in the way but we both saw the next phase where the object either appeared to be glinting light or creating light.  At this point the object itself could not be seen other than a complete ball of light similar to when a silver plane catches the sunlight and reflects with a strong glow or glare except in this case it was evenly distributed and all encompassing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my friend got a call on his cell phone and he looked down to press the keys to answer the call and that was the end of him seeing the object.  What I saw at that moment was this ball of light that then subsided back into being a pure white object that then made a arced turn towards the north at the same altitude and disappeared heading north and within a second or two was obscured by some mountain peaks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was close to being round but seemed more to be slightly elongated from the front to back rather than top to bottom.  There were no noticeable wings or other structures or markings visible on the object and definitely no helicopter propellers.  If I were to guess the size in relation to stars even though it was daytime I would say it was 4 times the size of Venus.  The entire event for me was approx. 10 seconds.  For my friend it was about 5 seconds.  From the beginning to the end of the event it travelled approx.  20 degrees of a 360 degree radius of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially due to the height of the peak it was framed against it was below the skyline and framed against the mountainside that was behind it.  Due to the contours of the mountain even though it was traveling on the horizontal, in a couple of seconds it was then seen with the sky as its backdrop.  What really struck me at first was the fact that this object was below the skyline which made it impossible for it to be no more than a few miles away and thus I automatically assumed it had to be a helicopter since many of them pass through that area.  Again, no sound and sound travels far in the desert and definitely no propellers or wings seen on the object.  When I saw it turn north it&#39;s speed and movement was not at all consistent with a helicopter since the turn and speed were too fast for a helicopter or even small plane.<n>

It appeared to be rotating or tumbling. It was about 9:05 Am,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on a hike with a friend, He said look, look at that I looked up and did not see anything.  I moved and out from behind a saguaro cactus I saw a point of light moving from the west to the east over the Catalina Mountains.  As I watched the light it appeared to tumble or rotate, either description could describe what I saw.  This spot of light  moved perfectly level as it passed over the mountains. I noticed it did not change in it’s brilliance like an aircraft reflecting the sun would.  My best estimate of the area over the mountains that it covered would be about five or six miles maybe more.  As I watch this light my cell phone rang and I answered it, when I finished the conversation the light was gone.<n>

It was almost right above the Walmart parking lot in brick.  It was so clear and it left me speechless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not crazy and I am looking for others who may have seen it.  It was amazing!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireball was orange that progressed to yellow at the end it almost looked oval but more rounded in the front that was facing earth more.<n>

I recently had two very good sightings of UFOs.  The first one was near exit 128 on I-40 me and my girlfriend witnessed a large cigar shaped hovering over or near I-40 it turned slowly went at about a 45 degree angle and slowly ascended.  it was very large 2-3 times the size of a plane.  The sky was clear and we also saw planes with contrails but the cigar had no contrail and moved very slowly it was much lower also i would say about 5000 feet.  The next week on 01/13/2012 about 10 miles south of Taylorsville on Hwy 16 heading south saw a bright reflection in the sky like a mirror that caught my attention it was about 1000 feet above the treeline the object was hovering and then began to turn slowly or rotate.  It was metallic and round but not a disc more like a sub shape.  Then it took off south faster than anything i have ever seen south towards Charlotte it was gone in the blink of an eye.  I have seen multiple reports from my area and i wanted to add what i have seen.<n>

I brought it to my wife&#39;s attention and she began to notice the object appeared to be changing colors. The object was so far away that we couldn&#39;t be sure if it was mobile or stationary in the sky. It did appear to slowly ascend. Yet we were sure it was flashing colors of white,blue and red repeatedly. I got out an old cheap telescope and we still could not clearly perceive the exact shape of the object but we could certainly tell the lights were moving in circular motion. Through the telescope we noticed several colors including: red, white, yellow, green and blue. They were all flashing and moving in a blur. This object could actually be between Dexter and Sikeston. It&#39;s difficult to tell it&#39;s exact location. It is much too high to be a tower. It can not be a helicopter or a plane. It can&#39;t be a planet because there is multi-colors and there is movement of the colors. I do not! take any drugs nor have I been consuming any alcohol. I have been up late each night because I&#39;m on vacation. I do not suffer from insomnia nor have I ever been diagnosed with any mental illness of any kind. We are just normal people that noticed a strange flashing light in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These lights were blinking from orange to white to green and yellow. One of the lights dropped quite a ways down and then just stopped.  All 6 lights then proceeded to make two large perfectly shaped triangles next to each other and the distance between the lights forming each triangle was approximately 1 mile.  The way these lights moved was very fluid, not moving in the air like any normal aircraft.  The tri angle formed for approx. 30 to 45 seconds and then broke up. The top two lights just disappearing and two others moved to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove to our home about 2 minutes away and brough our son and mother in law out to see what we had seen.  We then all got inot our car and drove west about a mile and parked on the side of the road and got out.  Two of the craft were still there and hovering low in the horizon.  Both were blinking the ! same colors as mentioned above.  One of the lights then turned a brilliant white color and appeared to grow slightly in size.  The light the dimmed and started blinking again and both lights headed north.  My wife and I had our cell phones out and tried to photograph and record these lights.  On my video, only two of the lights would show up, although they were all equal in brightness.  My wife took numerous photos with her phone and all turned out black with the exception of one photo.  This one shows 3 of the crafts forming one of the triangle formations they formed.  These lights appeared to be above an area where there are large windmills located.  There was no noise that we could hear from any of these crafts.<n>

We had set about an hour and i noticed a strange light above the tallest hill in the river bottoms.  i watched it for a minute and then noticed it was making very erratic movements. i pointed it out to my girl friend, she said wow it is really making weird movements, she asked if there was any house lights or anything in the area, i told her i lived here for 38 years and i had never seen anything like that in my life, it was up and down in altitude and would move forward and backwards, we watched it for about 3 minutes then it stabilized and lowered right down on top of the hill and disappeared, it was pitch black out and there was nothing behind the hill for us to be seeing, also the wind was really strong that night and for it to be erratic and then stabilize like it did was the most unnerving part, i am educated, i am an artist and an avid outdoorsman, what i saw wasnt normal or natural for that matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: We saw the light at about 6:30pm, we stayed about 5 minutes after it disappeared, we were parked west about 1/4 mile of the sighting, it was above the tallest landmark in the area, my other sighting was a couple weeks before, 2 miles straight west at my residence inRich Hill. i went out to smoke at about 4:30am i saw a small green light moving at an amazing rate of speed, it was moving north to south and as i watched it crossed paths with another one that was headed south west to north east i thought they were shooting stars then i noticed that they were angling away out of our atmosphere they didnt lose brightness or flicker i see both civilian and military aircraft all the time and this was neither, the speed they were moving was tremendous, it was a crystal clear sky i am an artist so i pay attention to detail this sightings will be in my memories forever, now i cant stop watching the sky.<n>

The thing that drew my attention to it was a long shaft of light beaming downwards towards the earth from it. It was a long shaft, not uniform in brightness but an increased intensity of brightness along it’s middle, extending downwards towards the earth at about a 25 to 30 degree angle from vertical.  The shaft thinned and feathered as it approached earth, not reaching the ground.  The object at the top of the shaft was no more than a light with no recognizable shape, about the size an aircraft would be at that distance.  I pulled over to look at it, and called my husband to see if he was able to see anything.  As we were talking I must have looked away for a second and when I looked up the light was gone.  I was shocked, and looked all around in the sky to see if there was any trace of it.  The only thing I saw was something like an aircraft with 2 flashing lights moving very fast in a southerly  direction well past me on my left, i.e. the western side.  It had a very long, straight stream of hazy white behind it. I don’t know if that was the same object.  If it was it had changed position exceedingly fast.<n>

They are lower than the starts, more on the horizon, and you have to be in an open area to see them. One night one of the lights went away, and it looked like a plane was coming over to the other light that was still there. When it approached the light it did 4 90 degree turns(in a square) and then started to hover with the other light.

The glowing object came from the top right portion of my wind-shield and swooped to the left high in the sky. As I followed the object it made a noticeable arching movement until it was nearly beside the north star, the it simply swooped downward like a slower moving falling star. The speed of the object was not as fast as what I can compare to a falling star, nor was it as slow as a plane or helicopter. The object was not blinking, just a constant and vibrant green glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

EST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be stationary, very bright, and at first very star-like. As we were watching the light we noticed it was moving slowly towards the horizon. I went inside and got my mother and grandmother to both come outside to see it as well. The object got brighter and seemed to pulsate with a brightness and shine to it. We watched the light descend out of view appearing to drop down below the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time I first walked outside and saw the bright light to the time it went below the horizon I viewed the light for at least ten to fifteen minutes.  There was other traffic in the air and I noticed at least one commercial air-liner heading toward Daytona International Airport. From my perspective the light we were looking at seemed to be much higher than the commercial traffic heading toward Daytona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between my wife and I we took a total of 10 pictures with a Nikon Coolpix P100 with a 26x zoom. All of the pictures show a bright star-like object.<n>

Nope a rotating dodecahedron shaped object vibrating intense color in the sky over DeLand FL.|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86344.html|460|ndxe201201| Star? Airplane head lights? Helicopter?  Nope a rotating dodecahedron shaped object vibrating intense color in the sky over DeLand FL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed this star like object in the sky on my way back from going to the Bp Station at the corner of Kepler Road and 92 in DeLand, Florida. It actually caught my eye out of the corner while driving west on Kepler Rd on my way back to the house. It was bright enough to get my attention.  So I glanced over to my left and see this very bright star in the sky.  At this time I really didn&#39;t think about what it was other than &#34;star&#34;.  It wasn&#39;t until I turned left onto Old Daytona Road and had the object now in front of me in full view did I realize it was way too bright to be just a star.  So I started running senarios through my head:  Maybe a plane coming in to the air port that was literally a quarter of a mile in front of me, or a helicopter possibly with a search light.  But as I got closer my intuition told me to have my husband meet me outside when I got to the house.  So I dialed the house phone and told him to come out front as I was pulling left o! nto Pierce Street making the object now on my right and directly in fron of my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I pull in the drive my Husband is stepping out the door of our home and starts to walk towards me. I turn around and point in the direction of the air port and point at the bright object. I asked &#34;What do you think that is?&#34; He looked at it for a minute and replied with a &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; As we are looking on at this object for a few more seconds or so it dawns on me that my camera (a Nikcon Cool Pics P100) is in my purse in the car still.  So I go and get it.  This particular camera came with a 26x zoom one of the main reasons I picked it. I love to take pictures of the moon and this camera always comes out with the most beautiful marco and long distance moon shots I&#39;ve seen from this style camera.  At the moment I had an eyelash or trash in my eye which made it hard for me to see so I handed my Husband the camera and told him to take some shots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He began taking some pictures with my camera and wasn&#39;t really able to get a good focus on it.  So once I was free of the annoying fuzz in my eye I took over and managed to ge a few more shots in that were more focus.  When zoomed in to the max with my camera I noticed several things about the object one was it was solid and had an unusal shape to it one that most closely resembles a dodecahedron.  The other when I used my camera as a sort of binacular set I could watch the obejects movement which went in a fast clockwise, teeter totting motion. In this mode with my camera I could make out much detail of this object. It vibrated color, as it floated above the tree tops.  And moved too fast for my camera to capture the solid mass of the object and instead took almost see thur disc shaped photos of this otherwise bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was pretty cold outside I went on into the house and gave my Husband the camera to do with as he pleased. It was a great experience. One that lasted probably a grand total of  fifteen minutes.<n>

In 20+ years I have become familiar with an assortment of craft sharing our LI skies. I can recognize the difference between the Yaphank and South Hampton US military equipment performing maneuvers(usually during late evenings) and know where their insallations are located vs passenger liners en route to and from Islip Int&#39;l Airport, JFK and LaGuardia airports by  regulated identification marker lights.  I know the distinctive nightime sounds of chopper blade rotation and winged craft props, jet exhaust rumbling, etc. operated by NY Suffolk County Police and various NEWS choppers, instantly, when vectoring over my &#34;area&#34;.  So, I have become unimpressed by their appearance due to familiarity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Jan. 4, 2012 at approximately 7:30 pm EST I became aware of the unusual amount of aircraft traffic flying in unfamiliar patterns over Western LI .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alarmed by the number of visible craft flying in a seemingly congested space at various altitudes and unusual patterns ranging from N-S, W-E, W-N, NE-S.  During the next few hours, I watched multiple craft flying varying directions in distances of 1 mile to 5 miles(ed. guess)from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The patterns, criss-crossing pilot maneuvers, low altitude banking and deliberate circling about kept my attention and was unsettling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of moving craft &#34;lights&#34; varied from single solid amber to solitary white strobe, some( I think they may have been choppers) strobed white AND red flashers. There were low flying, fast-moving craft outfitted with huge double tiered solid red lights positioned aft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hard to distinguish which craft made which sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Jan. 5,2012 (night #2) I again witnessed multiple white and amber lights in the W-S/W sky at approximately 7:30 pm.  I am aware that Venus was low in the evening sky at similar location.  This was not Venus......unless Venus can somehow switch from her familiar bright, head spotlight look into an upturned, spinning triangular shape with the ability to hover over the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many craft were &#34;scrambling&#34; in all directions, again.  Why?  I have no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I blogged News12 on Jan. 6, 2012 asking if I was alone in my sighting - if someone could tell me what was that??  I continue to watch multiple craft (I think military) in the sky from dusk &#39;till 2:00 am EST.  After that, its quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any information would help<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The shape was hard to see since it was too far away.  It had red, blue and white lights going off and on underneath the object with a bright light on top.  I looked through my small binoculars and asked my husband to come out to look as I handed him the pair I ran back inside to get my larger binoculars and when we both looked it turned sideways and went black.  I continued to look at the location of where it was last seen with nothing showing up.  It just vanished.  Later at about 15 minutes I noticed to the far right of the where the original location of the object the lights further back again in the valley but slowly fading out of sight.  My husband did observe this sighting also.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My family and I were shopping in Gravois Bluffs (Feton,MO) and on our way home (about 6:30PM) we noticed in the sky many blinking lights in small groups in static formation (i.e. series of 3-5 lights in one area, not moving, but multiple groups).  As I watched these groups of blinking lights I then noticed lights deploying from those area one at a time.  Once deployed from those areas, they then took flight and then looked like normal airplanes at night (white/red lights).  The 5 or 6 deployed &#34;planes&#34; scattered and seemed to &#39;scout&#39; the Fenton and Arnold areas.  When I arrived home (Arnold, MO), we still saw the &#34;planes&#34; flying around.  Then one came flying over our house fairly low.  This is when I started to get a little scared.  The plane was low enough to see the formation of the red/white lights.  The craft had 3 white lights in a triangular formation  with a flashing red light in the center.  There was no tail light.  It sounded li! ke a prop plane but for as low as it was, it should have been much louder.  After it passed over I then noticed another craft (same with white/red lights) hovering further south and at a much higher altitude. . but it was not moving.  It remained stationary.  After seeing all this, I started to feel very uncomfortable, and then went inside pretending I saw nothing.  Then, at about 1:00AM, I heard the loudest most annoying humming droning sound ever (as if &#39;something&#39; very large was hovering nearby.  The hum echoed through the town and I never saw anything. . . but the noise was very clear.  Needless to say, I did not get much sleep last night.  If I see something activity again tonight, I&#39;ll have my phone ready to take pics.  Have  there been any similar reports?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

Looked just like a star but was moving pretty slow to be a meteor. And had no tail. Too low to be a satellite. Saw it from Ontario, it was headed for San Diego. I had enough time to go inside my home to have my family come see it.  Then when we got outside, i went and got my binoculars.  It had no flashing light at all. Not even a flicker like a star. It moved in a straight line, didn&#39;t speed up or slow down. There was also no sound.<n>
1/4/12 17:44|McMinnville|TN|Unknown|In Progress|Color changing object observed over/near cattle who were going crazy.|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86341.html|465|ndxe201201| Color changing object observed over/near cattle who were going crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was observed hovering south westerly from the back of my location - the first noticeable characteristic of the object was the color changing.  It would stay green for approximately 2 minutes, then flash red, orange, yellow, red and back to green and repeat.  After approximately 10 minutes of observation, the object started moving.  It would oscillate side to side, then gain altitude slowly, then rapidly lose altitude.  It would then move side to side by performing a half moon drop and then ascending.  There were also very rapid movements in angles and radii that are both mathematically and physically impossible for any known man made air craft to perform.  Also curious, at this hour, as the object moves, I can hear cattle mooing and doing what I can best describe as screaming.  I have experience with military and commercial aircraft, both rotary wing and fixed... and  have seen and reported objects like this for a few years now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights had been headed towards us coming from the west headed north east, while we were headed south along the highway.  We watched and waited as we passed the group of trees along side the road looking for about where the lights should have been visable again but there was nothing.  I even slowed down to allow myself and my brother to see where it had gone but saw nothing.  When we first saw lights we could see they were moving but not very fast and not fast enough to have crossed the entire sky before having another chance to see it.  The light at the center was white and outwards farther f! rom the center it became more yellow and faded.  The shape was rough and not smooth.  Still not sure exactly what my brother and I saw but suspect it could have been a smaller plane with bright headlights?  I do remember having an eerie and uncomfortable feeling about being outside looking at the sky after getting home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

Grandmother and granddaughter leave their apartment.  Grandmother notices lights in the sky but thought nothing of them because there is a cell phone tower, street lights, private home lights, etc. in the area.  They exit apt. complex to the left, take another left on Normandie St.  (1st sighting)Grandmother see an object with red and white lights moving slowly behind them.  She stops her car at the intersection of Southland Park Drive and Normandie Drive and gets out of car.  Granddaughter, age 8, is beggin her to stay in car.  The object passed over them and veered to the left, heading west on So.Land Park Dr.  Near Sams, a fish eatery, the object suddenly disappears.  It is no where in site.  Grandmother gets back in car, turns right on So.Land Park Drive then turns left on Fireside Drive.  She pulls into driveway at 9343 Fireside Dr. to pick up newspaper in driveway.  She gets out of car, goes to back of car, picks up paper, takes! paper to carport and places it on table, goes back to car and gets in.  Backs out of driveway, car is facing south on Fireside Dr. (2nd sighting) They look up, there the object is again.  Grandmother and grandaughter can see the object from the windshield.  It is just above them, no noise.  She pulls into 9344 Fireside, gets out of car, picks up my newspaper, gets back in car.  Dials my number, call comes in at 6:18 a.m.  This is my signal to go outside and bring my granddaughter inside.  I go out, nothing unusual, go to car and granddaughter begins to excitedly tell me they have just seen a &#34;flying saucer&#34;.  Other grandmother is also telling me what they have just witnessed.  I am very skeptical at this time but as I am standing there, SUDDENLY, over the house at 9343 Fireside Drive, (3rd sighting)this hugh object appears.  It has red and white lights.  Beautiful lights.  Very, very slow moving, if moving at all, more like it was hovering.  No sound or noise at all.  I as! k them if this is what they saw and YES, that&#39;s it.  They jump! out of car and come around to where I am standing and we all gaze at the object not really knowing what to do.  We watch it and then it slowly goes up Fireside Drive in a north west direction.  Other grandmother gets in car to try and see where it went.  At 6:23 a.m. she calls me back to say the thing is nowhere in site.  I called airports in the vacinity but they knew nothing and you could tell they were disbelieving of what I was telling them. Also called several other agencies to report this but no one was interested.  This was such a vivid thing in my memory, I drew a diagram of the events and wrote a timeline.  This was the morning of the meator showers and also when the sun came up, the southern sky was full of chemtrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Over the ocean, headed south.  I watched it for 15 minutes.  It appeared to veer right suddenly and it seemed as though another light, either white or green, emitted from it and then came  back to the path, returning to red again.  It then stayed in one spot for a couple of minutes before continuing south.  The light was big and that was all that I could see as it was dark.  It appeared to be directly over the coastline where I live, less than 1/2 mile from me.<n>

I noticed the triangular craft appear seemed like out of nowhere, it had sudden sharp moves and was still at times briefly almost like it were noticing me.  The craft was no more than maybe a mile high, that&#39;s my guess. It did seem to appear very close.  I could see probably 3 to 4 lights located on it.  What made me know it wasn&#39;t one of our coast guard crafts was because this thing had a reverse at times.  It did take off so quickly that it was gone as fast as it appeared from the start.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> sorry for the misunderstanding it was on the previous night.  If I put the wrong date, I apologize for the confusion.  and this was not my only sighting.  I seemed to have encounters every since I was a teenager, of the same kind of craft. same in distance away from me. my brother has witnessed it with me. we are firm believers, others think we are crazy or make it up. my fathers car was actually lifted off the road years ago when he drove over a bright light. my dad is a christian and does not lie, he testified in church of this encounter. you might think this is crazy but I feel somewhat of a connection when I have these encounters. I apologize for babbling on.  But it was the previous day.  I stumbled upon your site, didnt know I could report such occurences. I will be ready with camera for future encounters.

This object showed up, in-between the moon and Jupiter, while I was trying to get a pretty shot of a very big cloud ring the moon and a star (or planet).  I really believe that someone in authority aught to take a look at these pictures.   There are 5 of them taken in a span of 1 to 2 minuets, the object is moving away quite rapidly and has a strange red, round, fog or thin haze (or a aurora) around it and gets further away in each pic. I still have the pictures on my phone, if needed, (wish it would have been a regular camera) never the less I down loaded them on my pc and magnified them in photoshop 7 and you should really look into this, in the first picture it looks like the moon is reflecting off of it on one side and has a shadow on the opposite side, I don’t believe it’s a weather balloon and it’s definitely not just a satellite or airplane. I caught this by accident and couldn’t see it ! with the naked eye, but saw it on the view screen of the first picture, so I aimed in the camera in the same vicinity and caught it 4 more times as it moved away from the area of the moon and planet. When magnified with software it has all kinds of colors, in shot 4 it has moved far to the right and is totally green in color. I managed to find it in picture # 5 if I added some brightness and contrast and again it’s totally green with colors around the edges. Nothing I try gets the same effect out of the moon or planet so it’s not the lens or software causing it. To try and explain any further would make it sound like a farce. God as my witness (and I take that pretty serious) this is not a hoax or doctored pictures. The pictures I’ll send are untouched, I made copies and that’s the ones I used to enhance. If I need to I would send the entire phone to an authority to validate. I’m 52 fairly educated and watch the skys quite often but have never seen any thing like this. I do! n&#39;t know if it’s a UFO but I would sure like to have some one ! tell me what it is. Contact me back and I’ll gladly give my phone number if you want a better explanation about it after you take a look at the pics.<n>

It was dark so I could not be sure but, I believe it was, it passed directly overhead coming out of west going east at likely 750ft to 1000ft.  This same heading going east to west, and often, west to east, at the exact same flight path it has used before or one like it, has used before, and used repeatedly after this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I had heard it a couple of times, it did not register with my mind being busy with other things, however, one night around 9pm I&#39;d guess, I believe, this same craft also, returned, in the first week if January 2013.  This time they got my attention: I had been watching tv when it froze on a single frame for about a minute, while I was messing with my digital antenna I heard the loud UFO craft&#39;s sound passing overhead, grabbing my boots coat etc, I went out but it was already far to the east, using the same flight path as it had previous years, some 750-1000 feet, unfortunately I did not note the exact date and time of this sighting.  It appeared to me, to be the same disk shape craft, same red lights on opposite sides with one flashing light below, I went back in and thought, well they&#39;re back again, my tv had resumed normal operation.  As I don&#39;t have the date/time, I have included it here, because it did, mark their return in 2013.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The event lasted all of about 2 minutes (from me first spotting the object).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had passengers on the bus at the time but pulled over at the next bus stop to see what the object could be.  I stepped off the bus and looked up into the night sky.  The object seemed to kind of fade out once it was directly over me.  I almost felt as if it knew I was watching. It looked as if it disappeared but suddenly re-appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when I noticed an airplane traveling westbound.  Moments later the glow went out again but this time I kept my eyes on the object and to my surprise, I observed a round grey object moving across the night sky.  I have 20/20 vision so with the moonlight I could see it VERY well.  I can only assume the it was the typical Flying Saucer, but it&#39;s clear to me that the fireballs that people see are actually saucers with some type of shield that surrounds the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have searched on-line for months to see if anyone could collaborate my sighting to no prevail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my second time reporting this online.<n>

At first he thought it was a star, but he called me outside to look at it and it at first looked like a star but it was so bright in the sky and in a location where we have never seen a star like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got the binoculars to look at it but it must have been far away because I could not make much out except at times it looked like many tiny lights (kind of like a fireworks configuration) through the binoculars, but it looked like one light without the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We don&#39;t know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside about 2 hours later and it was not there.<n>

It was around 7 pm on January 3rd, 2012 when I was heading out down my driveway heading north and I noticed a long string of lights in the distance that were never there before. I stopped my car and sat there looking out the window trying to take a picture but my phone camera would not capture it because it was too dark and the object was too far. I immediately call my sister, who was still in the house right behind me, and she looked out the window and saw the same. She headed outside with my other little sister and our mother and they brought along a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I headed into town to my boyfriend’s house and I also told him and his dad what I had just seen and they headed out to the back yard and we looked towards the north and it was still there. We kept a lookout for about another 30 minutes and nothing was happening. So we headed back inside the house and about an hour after we first spotted the object my sister called and explained to us that a white light had hovered over the train shaped object and everything suddenly disappeared into nothing. I looked back onto the north and it was all darkness excluding a few street lights in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was rectangular about a half a mile long divided into rectangular even length sections. It was all brightly lit in different dim looking colors not very bright some of which we can remember were white, red, green, blue and yellow.  Around this train shaped object were red dots hovering above and on the end of each side. There was no activity that we could see and there was no movement at all until after an hour around 8 that a white light came as if from behind the “train” and it all disappeared. As we looked back to where this had been it was dark as if nothing had been there at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One appeared much higher and further off than the other and was hardly moving. The closer plane appeared as a small alternating blinking green/red lights so I assume it was also far away, and it was moving at a slow pace and seemed to be moving in a North or Northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, a small circular dot of very bright white light appeared, seemingly out of nowhere - it did not move in from any direction. It appeared slightly above and in between the two flying objects/helicopters I had been observing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It remained stationary for a fraction of a second, then quickly shot off at an amazing speed in the opposite direction of the lower flying object/helicopter and into a cloud. It seemed to be traveling in a South East direction. The cloud appeared to light up with a white light as the UFO went behind it. It traveled so fast that when it shot off, it only appeared as a stream of bright white light with just a hint of blue color to it. I commented to the person I was speaking on the phone with that I couldn&#39;t believe what I had just seen, and described it to them. I watched for several minutes waiting for the UFO to fly out of the cloud but never saw it exit the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel it&#39;s worth noting that I saw this UFO in the same community where I live and there is also a Defense Mapping compound located there. (The compound does not have an airport or landing strip - it&#39;s not large enough, however I believe it does have a helicopter landing pad.) We frequently have low flying military planes and helicopters flying overhead in this area at all times of the day and night, which we&#39;ve chocked up to the Defense Mapping compound very near our home. The military air traffic has picked up significantly in the last year and we&#39;re not sure why (they don&#39;t publicize that the air traffic is related to the Defense Mapping compound or anything else about the compound, which is private and guarded, but most in the community are aware of it and aware of the unusual air traffic in an otherwise very small suburban town). There&#39;s also hospital approximately 8-10 miles away that receives airlift patients. We are very used to seeing and are familiar with planes a! nd helicopters flying overhead, day and night, at varying distances, but I&#39;ve never seen anything appear like this UFO did or move at a fraction of the incredible speed or behave the way this UFO did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was the same place and time of day as last November&#39;s sighting, 3:25pm in the western sky. The sun was getting lower in the sky and there were scattered clouds, though the sky was mostly sunny. The conditions were very similar to our sighting in November. One light appeared to the lower right (west) of the sun and the other was farther to the right (slightly northwest). We only saw them for a minute and then lost them and had to keep driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to our home, about a mile away, I got out our Sony Handycam and caught the lights on it. The stationary lights were in the clouds directly west, to the right of the setting sun, and the lights were lower and bigger than the airplanes that were present before and after. I focused in on one light 2 MINUTES INTO THE VIDEO and it appeared almost a triangular shape with fuzzy edges and it was a glowing reddish-pink on the top point, white in the center and green on the bottom two points. I was inside and there is dirt on the window. The video is shaky but if you pause on it you can really see the colors. I didn&#39;t know it at the time but I also caught three lights later in the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were stationary, not airplanes, as I was also watching and comparing them to airplanes with their contrails. There were no helicopters or small planes in the area when the lights appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking at the second video I caught what appears to be a dark disc skipping across the sky at minute 2:59. I don&#39;t think it was a bird because in the same area are geese with wings flapping and this was circular and much, much faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, in the third video a dark helicopter flew by about 20 minutes after the lights were filmed, about 10 minutes after the disc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after the events our Wii froze and wouldn&#39;t turn off, has never happened before, and our cell phone wasn&#39;t responding when we wanted to play songs, which also hasn&#39;t happened before. I am also having problems sending this, have tried twice and it isn&#39;t working. The video files in my email also aren&#39;t working.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange events here in Oswego today!<n>

We were on the side walk facing south when ((male name deleted)) said look up I looked up and this object that to us looked like a bright red fireball that flew from west to east in the sky,  it was large (the size of a full moon) but much closer, no sound.  We were able to see it for approximately 3 seconds before trees blocked the view.  It was a very clear quiet night.

The intensity of the light was slightly brighter than the brightest nearby star. The light seemed to move in a confined (approximately 2-3 degrees) but random pattern. The movement was noticeable because the event was very near the top of a large oak tree. This light blinked on every 10 seconds for 7 minutes.  Occasionally, the intensity was less but there was no discernable pattern to this lesser intensity.  The light appeared to be at very high altitude. At the end of the event, the light blinked faintly once then a final very dim blink in a position that seemed as if it were moving very far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event was very similar to an event I reported 12/13/2010.  The light was the same and in the same area of the sky.  It may have been in exactly the same spot but time and date were different so the star background was different.  Both events occurred on the night of a meteor shower.  The first event occurred during the 2010 Geminids.  I have observed this position in the sky on several occasions and times but have seen this light only on these 2 occasions.<n>

It appeared to be still, but it became apparent that it was approaching us at a very slight angle. As it approached, we noticed that it made no sound, and was moving very slowly, so we assumed it had to be proceeding at a high elevation. However, at its closest, we noticed that it was close enough for the silhouette to be visible, and not only was it not a recognizable plane, but it did not appear to have wings. It seemed to be only a short distance above the treetops, not much larger than a large van, and had blinking lights around its edges. Since we were driving, we turned when it passed, but it seemed to accelerate beyond the trees and over the horizon before we could follow it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The leading one soon faded out as well and I began walking home through kalama village a little shopping area next door to Foodland keeping my eyes in the sky the whole time, and I soon say another light again and watched it moving in the same fashion as the other one. And it lasted about 3sec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The back ground was just after sunset pretty dark with a few light clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please tell me it was some sort of military flare, but the lac of the Military presence in Maui makes me think it wasn&#39;t.<n>

My wife looked up and saw a strange light in the sky and said it looked to close to be a star and it was not a plane because it didn’t not have any flashing lights on the bottom.  About the same time I looked up it changed color from white to red and seemed to change direction because the shape went from Round to Oblong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it change color and shape for about five minutes we noticed a low flying plane coming quick from the opposite side of the craft.  As the plane got closer to the craft it was as if someone turned a light switch off because the light from the craft was gone except for a real strange glow emitting from the craft. My wife and I thought it just disappeared and thought the strange sighting was over.  As the plane descended and disappeared over Reno the light came back as if a switch was hit again and was closer and brighter than before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I continued to watch from the road for a total of about 40 mins and we could see the light pulsing and move from one spot to another with speed faster than any aircraft we have ever seen. This craft seemed to descend and ascend repeatedly and go from North to South. As we watched the craft it seemed to change color many times and continued into the sky north until it was completely out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a cigar shaped UFO gliding through the sky soundless and right in front of me.  I watched it glide towards Suffield Air Base (40 miles away) it glided right over Brooks at 7:20 am with pitch black and semi clear sky&#39;s and just a bit of cloud over Brooks.  I had my camera there, but I decided when I first realised what I was witnessing not to take my eyes off of it.  The whole experience lasted maybe less than 60 secs before it disappeared out of sight moving east slowly but so smoothly ...the image is burned in my brain I saw it with the city lights reflecting through the clouds below it and its own lights reflecting off the clouds above and around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it slide through the clouds and for brief moments caught it&#39;s full profile in  clear pockets in the clouds ---it was huge!  At that distance it looked like a straight, thick stick or floating barge in the sky the size of an aircraft carrier... with one orange-ish red non blinking light sitting on top of the front end and one yellowish non blinking light on top of the back end.....The craft looked darkish brown/grey; it was lit up by the reflection of it&#39;s own lights on the clouds as it slide in a straight line eastwards like an air hockey puck sliding across the sky slowly and steadily out of sight.<n>
1/1/12 23:00|Wenatchee|WA|Unknown|10 minutes|Lights that were front & rear of ufo.|11/21/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115405.html|509|ndxe201201| Lights that were front &amp; rear of ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The winter before last, maybe January sometime, at around 11pm, my wife and I were in our hot tub on our deck at the back of our home here in the pacific northwest.  There was snow on the ground but it was a very dark night with a little mist in the air.  Our house is adjacent to some small hills, maybe several hundred vertical feet higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our tub is located on the south side of the house.  I noticed two lights, if you want to call them that, approximately 800 feet away to the west of us, travelling along the hillside at a pace which would be a sprint for a decent runner.  The elevation of these lights was maybe 100 feet up from the ground.  They were probably 30 feet apart, one front and one back, perfectly parallel to the terrain, and moving at a constant speed, slow, with no deviation.   The hillside there is virtually straight up and straight down, no trails and a person couldn’t walk along it at this level these lights were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About the lights…both were solid and the front one never could figure out whether it was blue or white, as you looked at it, it seemed to be in constant change, constant motion within itself, and it was blue and white at the same time.  The rear light was more of a green color and didn’t change.  These so-called lights never reflected or illuminated the sage brush and hillside they were travelling next to the way any regular light would have and I guess this object was no more than 30 feet from the hillside. It wasn’t on a wire, no variation in trajectory with absolute constant pace.  There was something in between these lights that we could not see, namely a vessel, had to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It travelled up to the top of a little hill westbound and stopped and most likely rotated slightly counter-clockwise because the light were closer together.  I went upstairs and got out my binos and observed it for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It projected out to the northwest an intermittent light that looked like a pattern of corregated roofing metal, red in color and brilliant and I could see it at various distances away from this craft due to the intermittent mist in the area.  This went on for only a minute or so then the lights went out and that was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what we saw and it obviously wasn’t man made. I expect this was a little mapping expedition or something with a crazy reddish light report sent out.  There’s a few more minor details I’m sure I’ve left out but that’s the gist of it.  I am a retired Fire Captain, college grad in the sciences (chem) and my wife is also college grad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have my own opinion on what I think is going around here and maybe you do also, anyways every time go go an evening spa dip we’re looking.  This is the third sighting I’ve experienced in lots of years.  Thanks for listening.<n>

I would not be wasting my time filing a report on this if I weren’t sure of what I experienced earlier.  It was strange and weird, and  I just want to let someone know.  I’m in total shock, its too ridiculous and bizarre! This occurred at Houston , Texas,  around 11 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After driving my girlfriend home, and coming back home, I started to look up at the beautiful clear sky. The sky  here in Houston is never clear and you definitely never see so many stars as they were tonight. The beautiful  clear night sky and stars hypnotize my attention for a few seconds . That’s when I saw this/ these object (s). It seemed around 100 or so feet above the sky and it came the north heading south, it cruised over my head and in open space so I got a real great look at it! It seemed like two metallic or dark stealth looking orbs, its pretty crazy because the orbs did not give any light.  The way I saw them was from their shape and a sort of reflection that reflected of the surface of the objects. The objects seemed around 20 -30 feet in diameter and were 20  feet apart in a parallel horizontal way. I at first mistook the objects for a single plane who I thought did not have the lights on (I thought the orbs we! re giant light bulbs on the edge of the wing or something) but I notice the orbs were separated as starts could be seen trough the 20 foot gap between them. That’s when I was like woah, what could that be? I also did not hear any noise, complete silence , which kind of creeped me out. As the objects cruised away , I saw them rotate around each other in a circular pattern.  When I saw that I totally lost it and decided to look down. Thanks for hearing me out, had to tell someone.<n>

As this object approached closer to my position, I noticed it was giving off a brilliant orange color and had a spherical shape. It had no navigation or running lights (I am a former private pilot) It moved probably no faster than 60mph in my estimation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object radiated the most brilliant and pure color of orange I have ever seen.  It flickered as it moved, as a road flare flickers when burning. The object emitted no noise whatsoever. It was quite obviously spherical, with no projections anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made a slow arching turn from its initial flight path right toward where I was standing, slowed and then stopped almost nearly directly above me (staying at ~1500ft altitude).  The object hovered for no more than a few seconds.  Suddenly, this object flew straight up punching a hole directly through the cloud layer (est. 2000 ft) above it.  It flew to an altitude to where it was a pinpoint in less than 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Notes/Impressions:  - Aircraft flight patterns in my area are generally from the the South to North (To/from SeaTac airport)  - This &#34;object&#34; I witnessed came from the east (from over Tacoma proper) which is unusual in my area unless it is a military aircraft from McChord AFB  - There was a few aircraft flying in the area at the time of this incident.  I would say there is a good chance a pilot flying in the area saw this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - Other people in my area at the time must have seen it.  The glow was quite brilliant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - I got the impression it &#34;knew&#34; I was looking at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - The color of orange this thing emitted was extremely &#34;pure&#34; like coherent light from a laser - ie. the pure red or green you see from a laser. Not like an aircraft navigation light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - The faster it moved the more it seemed to &#34;flicker&#34;  - I am aircraft/military buff and can recognize most civilian and military aircraft.  I have never seen an object like this one. It flew outside the performance envelope of any aircraft I have known about.<n>

I jumped up and walked out to the street to follow its track, but it was soon obscured by trees.  Im not sure if my memory is correct, but I think it was red on the edges and orange toward the center. Hope someone else saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It is also possible one light was &#34;chasing&#34; the first. The size was about five times that of the stars we can see in the sky but they were much lower than airplanes..  It was cloudy out because of rain, but these lights were below the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights moved so fast with no sound (we even opened the window to get a better look and hear for sound).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights flew very fast from the south west in a smooth curve going east and then appeared to be moving downward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement was so fast and unfamiliar from that of an airplane.

At approximately 7:30 pm I was on my way home driving east making a right hand turn south and noticed a bright red light in the sky my girlfriend, 7 YO god daughter who were also in the front seat of the car saw the red light too (approx. 40 to 45 degrees from horizon looking south) my 49 YO friend and my girlfriends 9 YO niece who were in the back seat also saw the light. I told my girlfriend the light was a planet either Venus or Mars most likely mars because the light was red. She agreed it was a planet because the light was not blinking and the light was larger then all the stars. Anyways, I was excited because I had binoculars in my car and wanted to take a closure look at what I thought was a planet. So I pulled into the driveway got out of the car with my binoculars and the object was gone? We were all baffled, but my girlfriend said “no look its right there”, when I saw the light we realized it was at a different p! osition in the sky, approx. 30 degrees from horizon, I focused on the object through the binoculars and noticed it wasn’t a star or planet. The object was a red sphere split horizontally with a single very bright white light moving right to left (at the split) the object was stationary for maybe ten seconds then the object began to move almost vertical (5 degrees right to left) from 30 degrees to 45 degrees (this took about four  seconds), at the 45 degree position from horizon the object stopped and appeared to move away from us in the direction we were looking at it until the object completely vanished (approx. 8 sec. at the 45 degree position). Anyways we all went inside the house talking about what we had just saw, less than a minute later I decide to go back outside and take another look, and there in the same area just above the tree line, the same object appeared, my girlfriend, god daughter and I looked at the object through the binoculars and the object went throug! h the same maneuver as described above. I have gone back outsi! de to se arch for the object with no luck. I did call local police to report what I saw, and the said to call Pasco WA airport tower and make a report because the Walla Walla airport tower was not opened. Anyway, I am guessing that the object was approximately 15 to 20 miles away from the point where I saw it. The size of the object from where we saw it was about the size of a dime at 25 feet away. Well I just wanted to tell others what we all saw and attempt to describe the sighting to the best of my ability.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards,<n>

One alone at first then another one, then two side by side, then one. Fairly evenly spaced almost like military planes returning from a sortie. However what caught my eye is how slow they were flying. They also were a steady glow that that cycled between a reddish orange and yellow. They then at the same point in the sky appeared to go straight up and then disappear. The other noticeable charateristic is that there wasn&#39;t any engine noise at all. Completely silent  leading me to believe they weren&#39;t helicopters.  I am an electrician and have wired many runways so I am familiar with airplane lights and runway lights along with FAA standards.

We had just laid down for the night and I looked out and saw this plane coming towards the house and flying lower than normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when we got up a looked and saw two red lights up above the plane and behind it a bit.  As if something was following the plane.  It was not a military plane but a plane indeed, perhaps a Cessna.  The two red lights then darted off to their left and behind a cloud.  One came out the other side and continued east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night at 7:00 I looked outside and two more were in the sky and they seemed to join together then dart off in opposite directions at a very fast speed.  One just seemed to stop and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen a few strange things like this in my life and it makes me feel like there must be others that are embarrassed as I am to report this kind of thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see there was another report on your site made in the ealier part of Jan. similar to our sighting and in the Cocoa as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We noticed a black, airborne object that seemed to be hovering in one spot above the mountains. We figured it was a helicopter, or weather ballon, but realized it was neither of these things as we got closer. It appeared to be in motion, but did not move very fast. The sun was going down, and as it got darker, we saw that the craft did not have any lights. That is how we know it was not a helicopter or airplane, as both of these would be required to have lights on at night. My husband is in the military, and he works in the aviation department. He informed me that every aircraft, military or not is required by law to have proper lighting for nighttime flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I made a joke to my girlfriend that they were UFO&#39;s.  The aircraft seemed to be coming from the north and both were too high to land at the SFO airport.  The object on the left had a very steady flight path and ended up being a commercial passenger airplane.  The object on the right was had a flight pattern that that was very different. At a very high altitude the object on the right moved down towards the ground, then back up towards the sky and seemed to vanish into thin air.<n>

The time was approximately 12:10 and I seen a bright orange light come out from over the trees. My 1st instinct was fireworks being the New Year was just rung in, but it was a constant orange light. Then I thought it was a flare due to the color??? But the 1 bright orange light  was slowly mo ing in the direction of our house. I had enough time to call my mom and oldest son outside to see, which the light was still traveling, but had steered  in another direction towards the back of the house keeping the same constant bright orange glow, even while moving away from our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not see any flashing lights as on any aircraft nor was there any sound involved.

My brother ran to git his camera but his pictures did not look to good the lights looked like stars. The lights came in from the south and were headed in a northern direction until they stopped right in front of us and over the fireworks we were watching that were down the street from us, it was like the lights were watching the fireworks to.  The lights stayed there for about 10 to 15 minutes and then they faded out. and then 20 minutes later we all saw another single reddish  orange light north of us it stayed sill for about 4 minutes then it faded into! the clouds.

She said to me &#34;NO REALLY&#34;!  The boys come running out of the room.  I jumped off of the couch scaring our cat looked out the window and saw 4 orbs. As quick as I could I rushed outside to get a better look.  When I got outside,they were still there they were in an rhombus formation.  As I staired at them I knew from my experience that they were no kind of firework,so then I considered them to be some type of flare but they were not dropping as a flare would.<n>

I heard a very loud noise outside in the sky from inside my house.  It was louder than my TV. I got up, went outside and looked to the sky. It was raining with VERY low visibility.  The craft was powered by what sounded like a gasoline engine. The craft was triangle shaped with rear mounted engine / propeller.  It was much smaller than an ordinary airplane.  I&#39;m guessing it was some sort of unmanned drone but I have no idea why it would be flying in such low visibility / rain.  Just strange.  I&#39;m guessing we will be seeing a lot more of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

As I approached the rear of the main  building on my way back from the dumpster I happened to glance up over the top of the building and I saw at an altitude of approx.  two hundred feet two glowing red spheres, a bit darker shade of red where the main mass was in the center of these spheres, the sphere to my left appeared to be a little further back but at approx. the same alt. as the one on my right I stood and watched them for several mins. trying to determine what these objects were.  I thought they might be marine style flares but there was no visible residue falling nor any smoke.  There was no visible movement in alt. or in x-y axis.  There was no audible noise from these spheres and the nearby roadway was also quiet.  After observing for several minutes and getting a little nervous and fearful, plus it was time to clock off work, I returned to the inside of the main building hoping to find somebody nearby to tell but at that hour there was no one around.  When I left the building to go home several minutes later the spheres were gone and nowhere in sight and did not see these objects on my drive home.<n>

However I am trying to reject the thought of what I am seeing so I closely studying the object noticing its moving in strange patterns that a balloon a known spacecraft cannot move and it was not far away it was very close down i want to say 16 to 18 stories from the ground and it radiated a red glow until it went dim then dimmer and gone and re appeared and slowly dimmed out again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

The objects were moving from North to South at approximately 1-2 thousand feet.  They had a very bright orange glow that seemed to pulsate yet emitted no sound.  The lights were moving swiftly yet steadily possibly 150-200 mph.  The objects seemed to be in a large yet distinguishable line and did not deviate from that pattern.  At 1:15 AM I called the non emergency number to our county dispatch and reported the incident to the police.  I then walked to a neighboring house to get confirmation of what I was witnessing.  A pair of binoculars was used to view the lights.  While we were unsure of the exact shape of the objects, we agreed the general shape and size was around 50 feet long and seemed to be triangular but because of the glow we could not be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AT 1:20 I called a friend who lived across town and asked them to go outside to look for the objects and he also confirmed our s! ightings.  One by one the objects blinked out and disappeared in the same general area.  This display lasted 30-45 minutes and was observed by 4 people that I know of 1 of which was a police officer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were not fireworks, blimps, known aircraft, weather balloons or flares.<n>

Several other patrons saw the lights and I was able to snap a few photos (attached) and my friend was able to record some video. The lights were orange glowing balls and travelled generally south to north and appeared to be powered. Ambient noise from the bar was loud so I couldn&#39;t hear if the lights made any noise. They travelled one after another along the same path at erratic intervals, although usually around twenty or thirty seconds apart. They travelled in a straight flight path and that path generally drifted and changed to the northwest as the event took place. They were below the cloud cover, but one did go through the lowest clouds. I estimate I saw around twenty and that the whole event lasted 10 or 20 minutes. To recap, they travelled at approximately the same altitude and along the same path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They glowed a dark orange and didn’t seem to flash. When viewing them through my camera phone they seemed to flash at a constant rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend who also witnessed the event is a pilot and called Standiford Field air traffic control (Louisville International Airport) and they said they had nothing flying in the area. Both of us called the police and the dispatcher said we were the only people to call it in. And we called a local news station tip line who told us we were the only callers to report the event. I also emailed all four local news stations with the facts and photos on January 1st and received no response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, in one of the photos some non-glowing spots are visible. I’m didn’t see those during the event so I’m not sure if they are due to reflections or some other camera error, or if they are related to the event.<n>

At first I thought it was a plane, but there were no blinking lights.  It moved silently across the sky and it traveled rather quickly.  It reminded me of how, when some military jets are high up in the air, they move more rapidly across the sky.  It did not appear to be very high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I was able to get my camera out of my bag, the object disappeared.

This only lasted a very brief period of time (60 seconds) , as they were traveling extremely fast.  A  person accompanying me also witnessed this sighting.<n>

When we went to the window to look, we saw 3 orange and yellow in color oval shaped objects moving sideways when one went behind the other looking like there was only 2 objects, then seamingly that one either slowed down or the other sped up making the 3rd object visable again.  While we watched 3 more orange and yellow in color oval objects appeared.  They were not airplanes or helicopters, because there was no noise.<n>

It was my mother-in-law, my sister-in-law, and myself. We were at the window looking to see if it was snowing when we noticed the lights.  We were inside looking northward.  A little beyond us are 2 small trees and another house.  When we first noticed them we thought they were planets due to their stationary look, however it was too cloudy to see any stars behind the lights. The weather was around 32 degrees and a bit cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What makes this unusual, however, is their sudden movement northward.  The lights appeared to move independently of each other.  They would move far apart and then one circle back on the other.  The pattern was non-sequential and lacked any distinguishing pattern of movement. Then would speed up and slow down as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, the lights rose above the clouds in a circular pattern and vanished from sight.<n>

We noticed several red pulsing lights to the south above the tree line.  The lights were moving slowly to the right, some were higher from the tree line but both high and low each individual light would become stationary for a moment and then continue.  The lights disappeared from the right as if going behind a curtain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately to the west, over a 20- 30 minute span, lights began rising one, two, or three at a time. Two might start close together but usually separated with one ascending at a faster rate, and drift to the right or left as if following the gravitational pull of the earth, some meandering around on their own accord until the pulsing lights winked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn’t until the last three that we noticed that once the pulsing lights winked out, nearly transparent discs continued though the night sky, and just like the lights the discs would pause stationary one moment, then continue in a seemingly impossible trajectory.  I focused in bewilderment on one of these discs after ascending as a light continued as a disc traveling from west to south until it too disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed this along with 6 other people on new years morning just after midnight. None present were under the influence of alcohol or drugs and all agreed that, what was witnessed was beyond any explanations we could think up.<n>

Since there were no open public bathrooms around, we decided to go by a field off the side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While urinating, i was staring at the sky when i noticed 3 glowing orange orbs in the sky.  I kept staring for a few seconds and noticed that they were moving about while staying in a triangle formation. The lead orb moved slighty farther ahead and than would slow for the others to &#39;catch up&#39; as it seemed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After noticing what i was seeing, i pulled out my phone and took a 2 minute video which captured the orbs moving from one side of the horizon to the other (east - west) withing the 2 minutes.

I called a friend to ask him if he could see them too and another 15-20 lights started appearing and rising up, all throughout the range, and over the mountains dissipating on the other side.  He saw them and realized as I did that they were reappearing and sinking, then continuing to rise up again until they completely disappeared around 12:38 AM<n>

Watched them glide/fly/travel through the sky for about 5 minutes and disappear completely as they turned to the North East.  Thought it was a few airplanes at first, maybe coming out of Charlotte-Douglas International Airport (CLT); however, as the first three moved towards my direction and then turned to the Northeast, I noticed many more, following closely.  Many, about 30 to 35 closely flying together.  Red/Orange in color.  Then disappearing into the night sky into nowhere.<n>

I ran inside to wake up my husband, and he came out and saw them as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Numerous neighbors were outside watching the fireworks and also saw the lights. I heard someone say that it may be lanterns.

So we go outside to get a better view, and there are two more, an orangish reddish dot, following the same path, an estimated 300 meters up, moving at a variance of speeds, ranging from an estimated 100 to 250 miles an hour.  They were all moving south to northeast.  They were evenly spaced. In total, there were 8 or 9.  They did not make a sound. I thought they may have been lanterns, but there was no wind, and if there was, they couldn&#39;t have flown in that straight line.<n>

At about 12:15 amon Jan 1st, I glanced out mysouth-facing bedroom window to see 2 round orange balls about a foot apart in a straight perpendicular line. I could not figure out what I was looking at....perhaps some reflection of the streetlights? As I moved to look better, they appeared smaller but still in same formation.  I thought maybe they were large orange planets in the sky in a formation and came to ask my son-in-law if any planets/stars were sposed to be in alignment that night, New Years Eve.  He and my daughter then came to see and as we watched, these orange balls of light became smaller and smaller very quickly as they seemed to move away and eventually they seemed to come together and disappear.  It was a very short time beqween when they appeared tennis-ball-sized right out my window to disappearing  higher in the sky.  I am a 51 year old mother.

It was cloudy and raining so you couldn&#39;t see any stars, planes, satellites, etc.  We were watching fireworks display slightly northeast when we saw a bright orange round object (#1) flying mostly horizontally in the east-southeast sky flying to the right of the fireworks southbound. The speed was fast but not constant, it seemed to slow up or slightly at times. We watched it fly south until it was out of sight (took about 60-90 seconds)  Within 2 minutes a second one (#2)flew through same part of sky but that one dropped down out of sight in a minute or so.  A few minutes later four more at once (#3 #4 #5 and #6) flew the same pattern, direction and speed but #5 dropped out of sight while the rest flew and diminished to the south. A few minutes later #7 flew the same direction etc and diminished in the south sky, a few minutes later #8 did the same. Color of objects was mostly orange but looked yellow or even reddish at times. The total sighting lasted approximately 10 minutes. Both witnesses agree to have never seen a UFO before this sighting.<n>

First sighted heading west – began as a triangle formation of three white “star” sized lights moving very slowly.  Next we noticed some lights were following behind the triangle.  Formation began to change to a somewhat wide cluster, dispersing the triangle shape of three lights at the front of the movement of lights and appearing as if they were all just part of a tight constellation of stars, almost imobile but still some small movement westward.  Anyone looking up at this time may have thought it was just a concentrated area of stars and thought nothing of it for the several seconds or minute it was formed this way.  The lights (at least 20, probably more) then began moving, still very slowly but more noticeably, and forming a narrower line formation which then curved strongly to head north-northwest.  They seemed to be flickering now in different colors occasionally as green, blue, red, and white, but mostly white, as they passed almo! st directly above us.  Sometimes an occasional brighter flaring of color would come from one of the lights; and sometimes they were no more than an average star brightness in white.  The catepillar-like loose, linear formation of lights continued north-northwest until they became too far away and &#39;dim&#39; to continue to track.  There was no sound; no aircraft sounds.  The entire sighting lasted about 10 to 15 minutes.  We called our neighbors over to view – 3 adults and one minor child.  Upon first sight of the “constellation-like” scattering formation, our neighbor thought it was just that, a cluster of stars, until he realized they were moving, and continued to watch the procession of lights changing formation and moving in the sky above us.

It stayed at the same height going straight across the sky horizontally for about 3 minutes.   We knew it wasn&#39;t a firework because it didn&#39;t have a tail and it also wasn&#39;t going up it was moving to West.   After the 3 minutes it disappeared as it was too far away to see.

They also didn&#39;t dissipate or lose altitude, as is common with fireworks, flares, chaff, or skydivers with lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second witness with me thought that the lights were only about one hundred feet in the air, or slightly above the tree top level.  I, however, believe they were at least 1000 feet high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were three separate lights moving slowly from west to east, and then north and out of sight.

The second one from the front of the group of orbs dropped two smaller orbs (which descended behind the mountain) soon followed 3 bigger orbs from which they were dropped one of them flew away in a south east direction. Over a period of 15 minutes three more separate orbs flew in the manner only not together and 3-4 minutes apart(also diving behind the mountain). During the minutes that followed I saw a multitude of orbs one by one coming from a southern and eastern direction. A little while later from the southern direction a triangular shaped object flew in easterly direction whilst turning on its axis(on each corner! was a orange orb) I saw nothing else after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

WOW! at approx. 12:01am an amber ball traveled north directly above the Peugeot Sound. there were fire works in the vicinity and other (normal)air traffic as well. the light at first looked like a helicopter but it was moving away from the city center during the show (Strange?) it was an odd vibrating amber glow not like any other aircraft. it moved north slowly at about 7 or 8,000 feet and pulsed at alternating intervals . and after about 3 mins it disappeared.. just pulsed out, didn&#39;t go behind anything and had visible in a clear patch of sky. moments after it left a (obvious) helicopter flew from the north to the same spot and circled and then flew back north.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife and sister in law stepped out for a smoke and noticed a silent reddish orange orb hovering above the treeline moving away into the distance til it dissapeared. Then bout 10 minutes later my brother in law and stepson we&#39;re outside and saw the same orb above the treeline again and my kid caught the orb on his phone camera for a few seconds then said to have just dissapeare again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that we went on with the new years countdown inside not thinking much of what happened. And if it couldn&#39;t get any stranger it does. Just after the ball drop me and my wife go outside for a smoke. I look the other way and my wife yells i  turn around towards the woodsO and there it was again a reddish orb rising of the the woods clear as day. I turn back around and yell to my family that the orb they were talking about was back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all six o! f us were there to see it.It went straight up so smooth and effortlessly and then made a 90 degree curved turn and hovered off in the distance and never made a sound and I would have to guess it was with a few mIles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But after I picked my jaw off the ground I remembered that I had my iPod and caught the last few minutes on video and catching our reactions. it&#39;s a little dark but it&#39;s there with some cleaning of the video maybe someone can shed some light on this.  So by the end of the we got 6 wittnesses and two videos of this. When I first saw it we were on the porch and it appeared west of us at eye level in the woods rose I&#39;d say about a mile then headed north for a few more miles before it was out of sight. As far as the first two sightings this nite I was not there for the third I was.<n>

All who were present were sober.  We then witnesseed approx 9 ufo&#39;s flying in groups of 3 in v like formations.  The aircraft was unlike anything we observed.  The crafts were not easy to observe and emitted bright light with what appeared to be a fiery shaft in the middle of the craft.  The craft appeared to be flying at  a moderate speed from east to west and  coming in and out of formation.  The craft initially came very close to us, unlike typical planes or copter flights in the area.  At one point we thought that the craft may land in and around the area we were in and the kids began to get scared.  The crafts then flew as far as we could see west until they were out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a small airport airport near by but never have we observed such craft at night, and I am out smoking cigarettes at night all the time looking at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then preceded to call 911 to report the approx. 9 unusual craft in the towns airspace. When I informed the 911 operator that the craft wasn&#39;t a plane or helicopter she then became skeptical and questioned the veracity of my claims.The incident was recorded via cell phone video by 3-4 witnesses.<n>

Each took relatively the same path across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This took place for about an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A neighbor came over and asked if we saw those things in the sky.  We talked for a few minutes and saw a few more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looked to me to be balloons with some kind of bright candle/flame/light floating across the sky about 5-10 miles away and about (total guest-imate) 3000 feet in the air.  My wife was not convinced of the balloon theory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

My wife and I  were in the lower most level watching TV.  My wife promptly ran upstairs to administer his treatment. As she was doing so something caught her eye through the bedroom window. She called for me urgently to come upstairs.  Thinking something was wrong with my son.  I quickly ran upstairs only to find him standing in the living room where his mother had told him to stay.  The front door was left wide open with my wife calling for me to come outside. I ran outside to find three brilliantly glowing orange spheres peacefully gliding just above the street in front of our home.  I would say they were no more than fifty feet above the tops of the neighborhood homes traveling almost directly out of the south heading north very slowly, no more than five miles an hour, between five and ten feet appart from each other, and completely level with one another on the horizon. They were moving so slow.  My wife and I were able to get a good long look at them.  We both quickly tried to dismiss them as some kind of new year lanterns, but their color was so vibrantly warm and completely uniform.  There was absolutely no deviation in their luminosity, no flickering as if the light were to come from candles.  They did not rise in the air whatsoever as if to be a hot air balloon.  They didn&#39;t rise rapidly as to be filled with helium or any other lighter-than-air gas. Their were no signs of rockets attached to them.  They were not filled with LED lights, the light almost appeared solid, uniform.  We watched them drift, but with absolutely no wind behind them, in fact no wind at all.  They also made no noise, no mechanical sounds;engines, rotors etc.  Walking back through my home I went out the back door and continued to follow them glide over a neighbors home about two plots away.   As I watched, the last most southern orb began to what I could only describe as short out and slowly fade out of existence.  The other two remained to slowly venture north never changing in eleva! tion.  I watched them until they could no longer be seen above the horizon. Just after our encounter with these orbs my wife and I recalled the strange yet completely peaceful silence we both experienced while we were watching them.  Though we live just outside a commercial area in the suburbs we heard no cars, no celebration of the new year wich later seemed very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a profound moment but not our first either. We have also both seen brilliant blue lights darting about in the north this past summer.<n>

Its on going.  I reported just a half hour ago and while the firework show was going on at my two o&#39;clock the fireballs were at my ten o&#39;clock.  I was looking due north that would be my 12 o&#39;clock   Was no firework or plane or white light being obscured by the smoke in the air from the fireworks.  Our T.V was acting up like there was some sort of interference and we have cable.At arms length the object appeared to be the size of a half of a pencil eraser while the moon looked like the size of a bottle cap. There was a shooting star while I was making this report the size of a BB that illuminated the color of Teal and white and gold trail.  Fireworks have ceased. Lots of sightings ongoing and now its been a full hour.<n>

When I happened to notice a red light in the sky, headed towards us.  We thought it was just a airplane. We kept watching it.  As it got closer I observed that there was no noise.  At this time what we seen was a red light like on a pole.wasn&#39;t strobing, nor was it blinking.  Just a constant red light.  It was heading in a northeast direction. then it turned heading in a east direction.  We watched a total of approximenly 15 minutes.  Then it seemed to disappear.  It should be noted that when it was passing us it appeared to be surrounded by a cloud.which stayed with it as it moved.  It was approximately 200 feet high and approximately 500 feet away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
