There appeared to be a large fiery glow above or on the Olympic Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, we thought it was a forest fire as it was flickering.  After watching it for 3 - 4 minutes, my husband noticed it was moving.  At first, I didn&#39;t believe it because this didn&#39;t seem to make any sense.  As we continued to watch it, it became apparent that it was moving very slowly in a southward direction.  It also rose a bit in height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When compared to the half moon that night, it was just as bright and quite large for being so far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous;  provides only e-address.

After a few minutes we both spotted another &#34;moving star,&#34; it looked just like the previous and was observed for around the same amount of time. These sightings are two of five we observed that night, that occurred in a time-frame of around 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These moving stars may sound like shooting stars, though 4 of them did move from top to bottom as if falling, one of them moved up wards. Something I never encountered in a shooting star. And all 5 sightings were too long observed, and moved in a slow manner compared to a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, while moving these objects seemed to slightly change direction. They moved in a straight matter yet slightly changed angel as they moved. One of the objects at one point, seemed to slightly move in a zigzag manner, just long enough for us to confirm it with each other, as it then disappeared in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t think any of the authorized flying objects found in Malta, can explain our sightings. Nor can they be explained by a satellite to my knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently, searching for an explanation.<n>

I looked out the window and saw a large white object low in the sky.  I watched the object for over an hour with binoculars.  The object was very bright and I could not see defined lines of the shape but could tell it was sphere shaped with some sort of lights coming out of the top.  I used a tree across the street to gauge the position of it in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the object didn&#39;t do anything over this hour except float upwards until It was so far up that it looked like a star, by that time it was light out. I went back to bed at that point.  4 days later the front page of our local paper reported a crop circle in a nearby town which to me looked identicle to the light I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

7/31/06 02:00|San Antonio|TX|Other|5 minutes|((HOAX??))  Flying object that looks like a Hawk or Eagle|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61649.html|10|ndxe200607| Flying object that looks like a Hawk or Eagle<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a hovering object in the softball field at work. It was around 2 AM and as I slowly walked closer to it I noticed it looked like a huge hawk or eagle that was as big as a man. It was hovering w/ it&#39;s wings closed. I heard a low mechanicle sound coming from it. I also heard some tones like you would hear on a computer or telephone. I picked up a rock and threw it at the object. I saw the rock deflect off of it and when the rock hit it, it sounded like it was hitting metal. The object spreaded it&#39;s wings in mid air, I briefly saw tiny green and red lights flash on it, and then it made a sound like a hawk or eagle as it began to fly towards the south. I would guess this thing was 5 to 6 ft in height, and had a 15 to 20 ft wing spand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards I read this one story online that a college kid from Colorado went to Mexico with a couple of his classmates that were from that country. They were hiking near the US-Mexico border outside of Texas in the late 1990s. They were resting between two hills behind some large trees near an isolated road. A military type vehicle drove up and stopped. The college hikers were out of it&#39;s view about 30 yards away. Four men got out of the vehicle, three of them appeared to be Chinese and one a Mexican National. The three men that appeared to be Chinese seemed to be speaking in an oriental language.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two minutes later the college hikers saw this huge bird fly up and landed 20 yards from the four men. They went and got the huge bird and carried it and placed it in the back of their vehicle, then drove away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought this story might have some connection to what I witnessed in July 2006.  My guess is that this bird type object could be some sort of spying flying object that an Asian country such as China is conducting on the U.S.  I&#39;ve heard of several large bird sightings in the Southwestern USA for years.  I just find all this to be interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I got out of the water and sat with my husband, we both started looking at the sky, and were amazed to see a small dim light moving in front of a larger greenish white light. Still looking we noticed that the were zigzagging a moment or two and the going forward. And also there were several more similar lights in a row. When the first set passed there was more to follow. My husband is a retired professor (university), and I am a housewife, we do not do drugs, and are convinced that these in no way could be stars, nor planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were also a few others on the beach looking into the sky..but hey, its New York..who wants to ask anyone if they saw a ufo!<n>

One stands out far and above the other two, and I am fairly certain I can explain them in chronological order.  I am grouping the three together because I do not know specific dates, and I am writing this report about 8 years late.  July 30 is my best guess at a median date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That summer I routinely spent evenings at my friend&#39;s house, a girl that I had a crush on.  The first event was the only one to my knowledge that had another witness, and was at this girl&#39;s house.  The second event was witnessed while walking to her house.  The third was witnessed while walking from her house back home.  All three were at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First Event:  The girl and I were hanging out in her front yard near the basketball goal, and for just a second the entire sky illuminated with a flash of blue light.  I am not sure, but the light may have originated to the west near Austin or Pflugerville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second Event: On a dark night, I saw a massive black triangular object creeping silently across the sky.  This triangle may have been equilateral, but I can&#39;t say for sure.  One thing I can say for sure is that I could clearly see the three defined edges, even through the darkness.  It emitted no light and seemed to be flying low, though it is impossible for me to confidently give an estimate of it&#39;s altitude.  I watched it until it disappeared past the tree line.  This is the most amazing sight I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Third Event:  I saw a bright blue streak of light zigzag on the horizon in the direction of Austin.  In less than a second, it shot up and north at around a 45 degree angle, then went straight down, then up to the north at the same angle and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The dates of the three events may be approximate.  We have invited the source to submit individual reports, using one report form per sighting.  PD))<n>

I went outside to join them and my Dad told me he had just seen a strange object pass accross the sky. I asked him about it and he said he was looking up and saw an object that was pitch black about the size of an adult thumb at arms length move across the sky very fast and blocking out the background grey and all stars as it went. It moved without a sound. I didn&#39;t see anything but then about 5 minutes later at high altitude a triangle of red lights moved across slownly and silently. It had one flashing light and not the usual red/white combination and obvious plane shape you see every day. I&#39;m not sure if this second object was a military plane or something connected to the first sighting but it was weird. Back to the first sighting - my dad described it as &#34;In star trek speak... it was something under a cloaking device - it was a very dark pitch black against the background glow of the sky&#34;. I&#39;ve listed the object as triangle in the report because that is the shape of the other object we saw - my Dad was unable to give me a shape of the first object as it moved quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is a slightly extended report of the most important event.  Originally, I reported a 2-4 minute sighting, but it was certainly closer to 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a dark night, I saw a massive black triangular object creeping silently across the sky, from east to west.  This triangle may have been equilateral, but I can&#39;t say for sure.  One thing I can say for sure is that I could clearly see three defined edges through the darkness. It emitted no light and seemed to be flying low, perhaps the altitude of a helicopter searching for a spot to land.  I watched it until it disappeared past the tree line, maybe a football field in total.  This is the most amazing sight I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As anyone else would have done, I did some searching on the internet afterward. I was relieved to find out that - after sifting through the garbage - similar sightings are not rare.  It is often noted that there is a military base located nearby, and it just so happens that Camp Swift is about 12 miles southeast of my sighting.  There is one major difference in my experience, however.  Almost all black triangle sightings that I have read about include lights at the corners and sometimes a large red light in the center, but what I saw was completely devoid of light.<n>
7/30/06 22:00|Henderson|KY|Light|30-40 mins|Roaring and erratic-moving lights over Henderson, KY|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51809.html|17|ndxe200607| Roaring and erratic-moving lights over Henderson, KY<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the period of about 30-40 minutes, a jet-like roaring sound was witnessed by several people including the dispatch officer on duty at our 911 number.  The sound was similar to a jet engine, but pervasive, louder, and seemed to almost vibrate the house.  (It was loud enough to be heard/felt inside a well-insulated house with TV on, for example).  The roaring sound(s) persisted over most of the 30-40 minute period, but may have been multiple (up to six?) discrete events.  On about the fourth event, I personally witnessed a light moving from directly above me to the SE.  the roaring sound came directly from the direction of the light.  For the first few seconds the light appeared to be a fast-moving aircraft (I thought it was a fighter).  The problem is, it was so high that I should never have been able to hear the sound of its engines.  If a commercial or military jet had been low enough to hear, I should have been able to distinguish separate lights (wing lights, etc.)  I couldn&#39;t.  This object was just a white-to-maybe-orangish point of light accompanied by a loud roaring sound.  Before it passed out of view over my house, it veered dramatically left, then right, then left again.  I don&#39;t want to suggest it was spiraling, but that is what I thought at the time.  It maneuvered much faster than any commercial jet vehicle could have moved (in my field of view at the percieved altitude).  There may have been more than one UFO, as the roaring continued over about 30 minutes, either rising and falling, or multiple events in sequence.  I called the 911 dispatecher and reported the event at approximately 10:15 PM and she confirmed the sound, but at this time, neither of us could find a light in the direction the sound was coing from.  The night sky was absolutely clear.  I first became aware of the roaring when my girlfriend&#39;s son called me from across town to report both the sound and that he had drawn a picture of the moon because it had a funny shadow.  (That may not be related to what I witnessed.  I just note it, in case anyone else corroborates it.)<n>

The night was very clear -- having very few light clouds in the sky.  I can&#39;t remember the moon, so it must not have been very visible at that time.  I was sitting in the house, watching a television program while perusing through old newspapers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, Mom is quite a skeptic in UFOs, so it was rather surprising for her to come inside and ask me if I could identify what planet was shining up in the northwest.  I wasn&#39;t up-to-date on what celestial events were happening that night, so I just went to look and see what she was questioning.  When I went onto the back porch, I could immmediately see a very bright white light in the northwest corner of the sky -- about 40-45 degree angle from the horizon.  Mom told me she had been watching this light for quite a few minutes before coming to get me, so her interest was sparked.  As I watched the light I noticed it was slowly moving toward us.  Mom was hesitant about my saying it was moving, since she had watched it for so long.  However she did notice the movement after a few seconds.  The light headed straight in our direction (southeast from it&#39;s original point) at a rather steady pace -- somewhat the same as a plane coming into landing.  (We live just a few miles from Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport, so we do know what planes look like and recognize landing lights or directional/warning lights.)  There were no blinking lights alongside the one bright light, so we were baffled.  As the light came nearer to the house -- still traveling in a southeast direction -- we noticed the strangest thing of all -- there was no sound coming from the object.  NO SOUND!  And the object was coming just over the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed directly over our house, I noticed something rather startling -- two smaller lights suddenly appeared behind the bright light.  This aspect gave the shape of the object a triangular appearance.  I was stunned!  Mom was rather excited, since she had never witnessed anything like this before -- especially taken by the fact of no sound coming from the object.  The object passed over the edge of the house&#39;s roofing, so I ran through the house to the front door -- about five seconds timing.  When I got out the front door to look where the object was going, it had disappeared.  The view from the front road to the night sky is rather wide, so I was surprised not to be able to see the object anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of days later, we were mentioning this to my younger sister, who had worked at the Port of Greater Baton Rouge at that time.  She was excited, because a co-worker (both security guards) had told her of a very strange light which had played around the port for a few minutes.  The original witness had thought it was a helicopter -- except for the fact there was no sound coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had asked for my sister to have this witness write her story down, but the witness was too frightened to do so.  This is why I am reporting this sighting now -- on August 21, 2006.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When looking at it I saw like these rays beaming off it from the brightness.  It appeared to be moving slowly, lower towards the earth and north.  Then it just started going up till I couldnt see it anymore.  It didn&#39;t move sideways at all while going up.  I didn&#39;t observe any colored lights on it at all.  From the time I saw it till it disappeared was approximately 45 seconds to a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed that there were many commercial aircraft being diverted from the airspace in which the show was taking place as i saw plane after plane pass i then noticed an object near the airspace in which the planes were flying. At first i thought it was just another plane but then i noticed it was stationary in the sky and there was no sound that i could hear coming from it. The object then dissapeared and reappeared again and then did the same about two times more. I tried to get a video but i could not find the object i was seeing in the viewfinder as the sun was in my eyes and also the object was so small. I instead went to get my Dad who came out but when he did the object was no longer there. I thought no more of it and continued on with the watch for planes in the skies and now i was watching for UFO&#39;s also. This sighting occured at around 1:50pm on July 30th 2006.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few hours past and then at around 4:55pm i noticed an object the same to the one i had seen at 1:50pm going across the sky to the west i aimed my camera and pressed the record button but i did not know were to aim the camera as the object was not appearing in the viewfinder the sighting lasted for seconds and i got some very poor footage but its still footage i would like to show. I have slowed the footage down 18X so you can get a better look the object appears to the top right of the screen and is quite hard to see but if you look closely and view it a couple of times you will see what i am getting at. I am positive that what i saw was not a plane of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you would like to see the video please visit - www.alienationsam.com and take a look at the &#34;My Encounters&#34; page i would be interested to get any feedback on the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sam,<n>

So posting this is not easy for me, but this is too unexplainable to keep all to myself. This entire event happened within a five minute period and I had 4 other eyewitnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed this object in the sky while helping my son fly a kite in the park. It took me about thirty seconds to realize it was not a kite as it was about 300 feet higher than the kite I was flying. The object seemed to be stationary, but I soon realized that it was slowly moving higher and vertical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I ran to another friend also flying a kite and asked him &#34;what&#39;s that in the sky&#34; he was baffled as well. I then grabbed my camera and start taking pictures. My camera is expensive and takes great shots but I&#39;m an amateur photographer and could not lock the focus on an object that was moving away, getting smaller and had nothing but blue sky&#39;s and clouds as a backdrop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a total of 10 pictures and to my amazement, one out of ten came out perfectly clear (by luck) to reveal something that is very hard to explain. I cannot describe the object other than it looks like a very large white camera with a large lens looking downward with four booster rockets and two fuel pods all of which are perfectly symmetrical in shape!  Yeah, I know; crazy huh?  As I tried to rationalize what it might be, I dismissed that it was a weather balloon, US aircraft, satellite and defiantly not a kite. What ever it was, it wasn&#39;t moving with the wind and it was still visible far beyond the cloud layer meaning that the sunlight was reflecting off of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dare not show or send this photo out to anyone unless they are willing to pay very well for it. If there really are aliens and spaceships from another world, I may have one of few real pictures as proof!  The most logical but still crazy explanation I can come up with other than it being from another world is that some foreign country has developed advance spying technology that can silently hover over American land and then return home at altitudes over 40,000 feet!<n>
7/30/06 04:11|Midlothian|TX|Formation|5 minutes|Three star-like objects seen moving in shifting triangular formation.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51800.html|23|ndxe200607| Three star-like objects seen moving in shifting triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Outside in the backyard letting the dog out around 4:10am.  Looked up, saw a shooting star, decided to look for a few minutes to see if I could see more.  Then, directly overhead, I noticed three star-like objects in triangle formation moving south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had originally been unsure whether I was seeing one large triangular object or three separate objects.   Then I noticed that I could see stars between the moving objects and decided that they must be separate objects.  Also, after that determination was made, at least one of the objects made very quick movements out of the formation, then back in, although the triangle was not the same shape afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The triangle kind of bent and warped as it moved, so I surmise that all of the objects were probably moving in varying patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked for any signs of strobes or running lights, but found none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a very strange feeling to see this.  The fluid motion of the triangle gave the feel that these things could just move any way they wanted to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the size, the objects were about as large and the same brilliance as a star.  The triangle they formed itself approximately as wide as my fist when I held up my outstretched arm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever they were, they were way way up there.   No sound.  No lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have thought they were maybe satellites or something.  But moving around like that, I really don&#39;t think so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I know a lot of people are going to probably say these were planes or jets, since I do live in the flight path of a major airport about 40 miles away (DFW).  But I am telling you this were not planes.  They just did not move like that, the snakelike movement of them individually, making that triangle fluid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time I saw them directly overhead till I lost them in the city lights to the north, was about 4 or 5 minutes.  I would say that I watched them from about 90 degrees to about 60 degrees before I lost them in the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got a smoke and went outside in the back yard and grabd a patio chair and moved it out on to the grass so I could look at the sky. It was real clear with no clouds. I sat down and leaned back and looked up. I saw a couple planes flying north. But a few seconds later three lights caught my eye off to the south moving northeast. First I thought they might be planes, but they had no blinking lights. They had solid lights. There was no fancy pulsing or anything. But they would move as a group and they suddenly did a sharp turn and went east. Not an arcing turn but like on the dot change direction. They flew past my line of sight. BEAL Airforce base is around 8 miles east of where I live. After a few more moments looking at the sky a Jet flew in a wide circle. From the speed that it was moving I made it out to be a Air Force jet. I dont know what the three triagles were. But I have never seen anything like it before or move like it. My wife told me about this site. so here I am<n>

All of the sudden there was an orange flash and a neon orange oval appeared with what appeared to have multiple lights on it. It was far bigger than a shooting star and seemed a lot closer. It instantly zipped away, almost down towards the earth and disapeared. 5 minutes later we also saw some spotlights turn on under where we had seen it, but the spotlights shut off after about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was at about 3000 Ft and would fly a circle pattern and drop to about 10 ft off the top of the ocean in about 1/2 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it would fly an s pattern back up to where it was first at and circle closer drop.  It did this many times and kept coming closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to get it on my cell camera but my wife was freaking out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a FA-18 avionics technician for the Marines for five years and I currently hold a top secret ssbi clearance and work with avionics systems and I am on the new JSF program for the company I work for.

I am also 3/4 of the way through ground school and I have 28 hrs in a R22 helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my time I have never seen anything move so fast.  I started really researching into this after I lived through what was called the San Diego Boom read the article on this if you want to hear some crazy news that just died away with no explination...  It was on the front page of the San Diego union tribune...  then everyone just forgot about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/northcounty/20060423-9999-1n23bigboom.html   Read this!!!!

Nothing unusual but then I noticed one was moving in unusual patterns and was flashing red light.  It would hover without any movement then it would suddenly move in strange directions.  It darted left, then right, then forward, then backward in random patterns.  It even made half circles, full circles, and a figure 8.  I called my family out to see it because I couldn&#39;t figure out what it was.  It wasn&#39;t a plane because of the patterns and it wasn&#39;t a helicopter because it was so far up in the sky.  This went on for about an hour until it faded in the distance.  I called the local police and they said they had no other reports.  I then noticed another one several miles away from the first one which was still visible.  Finally I went out in front of the house and noted a third.  Also while this was occuring, there were continuous flashes of white light which appeared to be closer to the ground.  It was not raining and the skies were clear with no reports of thundstorms in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It had to be about 10 foot around I&#39;m guessing it was a sphere.  The flame trail was probably 10ft long it shot over a field on our right heading north.  It wasn&#39;t going really fast and the green flames suggested something was wrong.

When we first saw it looked far away and like less than 15 seconds it was getting closer and closer a very high speed we then  realise that it wasnt a big truck whit high beam light it was a Big Ball Of Fire. And jusr before our eyes it went by really fast an landed by the opposite of the freeway like heading to Sunnyside,Wa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband asked me if you should go and checked becasue the was a U turn close by I said no. Later that week in a Latino news ( primer Impacto) I was cooking when I herd Strange lights in washington state and I quickly went and see what they were talking about and there it was the same big ball of fire that me and my husband had seen. But they didnt explain it any more because they were just doing a recap of news that made news.

She said she had seen the flashes of light the night before but did not want to tell me, because I might think she was insane. so i stood out looking over the ocean for about 10-15 min. then i saw what apeared to be a redish flash of light come on then go off within a second or so, i at first thought it was a plane, then i saw the same light apeare a little bit to the left of the last light then fade out now i thought it was just a plane moving to the north, but within a few minutes i saw the same light again in the exact same spot as the first light to the south.(let me add that the ball of lights themselfs do not move) next i saw someting that really freeked me out, the light to the north lit back up with three other lights almost apearing out of eachother. then i thought how the hell can a plane move from the south to the north then back to the south and then back to the north giving birth to two other objects all within a few minutes. this sighting of either a ufo or a plane realy scared me and my mother. me and my family have been visiting myrtle beach for years and now own a house on the beach an we both have never seen anything quite like this, and by reading other reports of these sightings in the area we would love to know what caused these flashes of lights over the ocean? we have asked family members that have spent their lives in the airforce and do not know of any aircraft that can emite these types of lights. Please, any type of explination would be helpful.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we headed toward it, driving from Salem to Portland, it appeared to be an extremely bright star in the sky, then perhaps an aircraft of some sort, but as we got closer to it we realized that there were no other lights, like small blinking lights that planes usually have.  Eventually we got close enough to it that we actually drove under it - it was hard to tell how many feet above us it was, but it wasn&#39;t as high up as a plane would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were very similar to the space shuttle we witnessed last week. These lights were all seen at different times, all within one hour. Two were witnessed at once traveling from north to norteast. They were of considerable distance apart, and I could not be sure if they were traveling together. From my location I am located approximately 75 miles south of DFW airport, and directly under the flight path from Dallas to Houston, San Antonio, and Austin. We get alot of air traffic here including the big helicopters I hear are headed for President Busch&#39;s ranch just 50 miles sw of here, as well as various other aircraft in the very large sky I am privy to every night. In the last week we have spotted approximately 25 unknown flying objects, and we have witnessed these lights off and on for the last 5 or so years but only with the frequency of about 2 or 3 a year. These ufo&#39;s are called such because the erratic flight of these lights. They frequently stop, start, veer left and right, speed up and slow down frequently. The light can travel across the sky as quick as 30 secs. or so, and take as long as 5 mins. I have always been a little skeptical as to ufo&#39;s, for I have all my life looked to the stars. Now I&#39;m convinced, and as I have been writing this my son has reported seeing another two more lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Over the next 30 minutes, the &#34;light&#34; moved Westward of Jupiter  ~3 degrees (in addition to Earth rotation of ~7 degrees during that period of time) for a total of ~10 degrees apparent angular motion relative to a fixed point on the earth&#39;s surface. The object appeared to have a similar angular size as Jupiter (38&#34;); it shape was not discernable as being different than circular at 7x.)  The object&#39;s motion was not noticeable to the naked eye, but became noticeable as the Jupiter to object separation increased as viewed through 7x50mm binoculars over this interval of time.  In the final five to ten minutes of observation, the light bagan to moved more rapidly westward, barely noticeble under binocular observation, though still at a very slow rate of apparent angular motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At ~20:50 EDT, the the object began to dim significantly.  Within 2 minutes it faded out completely, and was no longer visible, even in binoculars.  The fade out time of 2 minutes is consistent with the time it takes for the disk of the sun to set; ergo the fade-out at approx. 20:50 EDT corresponds to the sun setting at the objects&#39;s altitude, and its illumination being reflected sunlight.  IOW, sunset at the object&#39;s altitude was at 20:50 EDT, while local sunset at observing location was at 20:17 EDT (as per planetarium software).  A cursory calculation indicates this diference in sunset time corresponds to the object&#39;s altitute being roughly 250,000 feet ASL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Starting location of object @ ~20:20 was 30 degrees altitude, ~27 degrees W of South azimuth.  Ending location @ ~20:50 EDT was ~27 degrees altitude, ~38 degrees W of South. (Location based on planetarium software data for Jupiter at local time/location)  A cursory analysis of this data, assuming same angular size as Jupiter, is an object that is about 100&#39; wide, at altitude of ~250,000 ft, about 100 miles slant range from point of observation.  Its average speed is about ~10 degrees of angle/30 minutes; this works out to be about 35 mph at the estimated distance, slower at the beginning of the observation, somewhat faster toward the end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Geographically, this object seems to have been located over the Catskills in New York state, based on plotting azimuth angle and estimated distance on an aviation sectional map.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what &#34;flies&#34; at 250,000&#39; at speeds between 0 to perhaps 100 mph, and is about 100&#39; across, but that what the data says it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see similar report from Twin Cities, MN, for August 19, 2004.

At first it appeared to be an airplane, but it never resolved into any singular airplane shape. Sometimes it appeared to be a biplane flying in an extreme crab, sometimes it looked like a star. From first sighting, its shape was constantly moving, in a rotational manner, with a period of approximately 12 seconds. At its closest approach, it appeared that there were many (c. 20) discrete shapes rotating around the center. It maintained an overall spherical aspect at all times, and the rate of internal motion never changed. One observer saw the rotation as around a perpendicular axis. It seemed that the front of the object shifted its shape less, while the rear (as it travelled) seemed at times to be anemone-like, though with slower motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained black, never showing any other colors, nor reflecting any light, though it didn&#39;t seem to pass into any sunlight. As it passed, both of us saw what appeared to be a halo around the object, perfectly circular, about a third of the object&#39;s diameter further out from its center. The halo appeared as an indistinct lighter ring, with a slightly darker ring around it. One observer felt it was a lens-like effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its apparent speed was comperable to a light airplane, and its apparent altitude was also comperable to where a light airplane would fly, as it remained beneath all clouds. A rain storm had recently passed, and the cloud deck was moderately high - not low, but not as high as airliners travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of us grew up around airplanes, and has been obsessed with them in varying degrees for his whole life. He is a musician, and has a strong background in the sciences. The other observer was raised in a very socratic household, where everything is open to question, but where the simplest answer must prevail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The best way to describe it would be like a shaking light that was in the middle of the round metallic shape. The object was crossing the sky at around 18:00 hr on a clear day with an approximate altitude of 6000 ft heading north at low speed. The object never stopped its trajectory but the speed wasn’t constant, it did change a couple of times.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They appeared to be connected one atop the other as they moved simultaneoulsy.  The wind was blowing the clouds quite strongly North easterly.  The object(s) remained stationary for about 5 minutes.  Around 4 people saw us staring and asked us if it was a hoax so we pointed and they stood with us for several minutes.  Whereupon the object(s) began to move in the opposite direction of the wind, but very slowly.  As we all remained focused on it, it began to move more quickly over the next couple minutes due east.  As it headed this direction, we lost sight of it in the clouds.  As soon as we lost sight of it, a jetliner came from the exact location heading NW.  This jet confirmed our object was not a plane as it was moving very quickly across the sky and appeared to be flying at the same altitude of the spherical object(s).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was shaped like a fuselage of an airplane and at first thought it to be such. It was very large and difficult for me to deterime just how distant it was. I would guess 2-4 miles. I consider it larger than the biggest of airbusses. I kept looking for a tail fin and tail wings but could not locate either. It was the same for the major wings. This object was segmented into 3 segments. The fore and aft segments were of the same size and color ( silverish-white ). The segment in the middle was approximately 1/3 of their size and white. That would be the part where one would expect to see the major wings of an airplane. I never saw them materialize into wings from my perspective. Other vehicles were around but as usual noone was looking up. I was traveling the entire time and observed it for 1-2 minutes.  It appeared to move a little faster than the largest airplanes I have seen at about the same distance. I am going to guess that this object was about 40 degrees going mostly East to West. The strangest thing about this sighting is that I became disoriented after watching it and I feel that on occasion since then I still have periods of disorientation or confusion, if you will, in my work that is not normally present. The background was mostly sunny with partial clouds. I never saw this go thru the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I ran to the deck and looked to the sky.  I saw three shiny balls conneced by a fine rigid line (it looked like fishing line, but did not bend)in the shape of a triangle.  The size and shape of this triangle remained constant, with the balls at each &#34;tip&#34;.  The sun was reflecting off the balls and also the &#34;lines&#34;.  The lines also seemed to glimmer in the sun, as if irridesant. This object appeared to be drifting slowly in a southern direction, coming across the tree tops into a clear sky.  It moved so slowly that it appeared to not have propulsion for movement.  I knew this object was moving because of the treeline, but I would not have recognized the movement without this point of reference.  The triangle was moving very slowly and still humming. This sound was very deep, vibrating in my stomach and ears.  There was a very slight breeze moving the tree tops back and forth.  I watched this object 5-7 mins. It continued going south and then  immediately disappeared.  The humming continued constantly throughout these 5-7 minutes and stopped suddenly when the object disappeared. I wallked out to the yard from my deck and searched the sky, but found nothing.  My house sets in the southwest side of Clinton, MO. My deck faces west, looking out on a field and then woods.  Behind the woods are Railroad tracks and then residential area.  Further southwest of my location is another new addition, then Truman Lake begins.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought they were just planes seeing as I live near an airport but after watching them I saw they were hovering in one spot but yet they moved up and down. About 5 mins passed and they were still in the same spots side by side. Then as quick as they appeared they shot across the sky and then straight up and were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous;  provides no contact information.

7/29/06 07:07|Fife|WA|Disk|1/640 second|Three disk shaped objects in photo of Mt. Rainier|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51502.html|43|ndxe200607| Three disk shaped objects in photo of Mt. Rainier<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my residence, I have a nearly unobstructed, other that neighboring apartments in the foreground, view of Mt. Rainier. I have taken many photos in the 11 years of being here. I saw the mountain this particular morning and it had a layer of clouds surrounding its flanks and the early day sun shining on the north side. So I grabbed my Canon 30D and mounted it&#39;s EF 75 - 300 mm f4 - 5.6 IS USM lens. I took a total of 4 shots, the first with just a UV filter, then added a polarized filter for the last 3. Then I scrolled through the 4 images on the camera monitor to pick the best one and deleted the other 3. I noticed in the one that I kept, 3 dark dots in the blue sky above the mountain. I have taken many images with birds or aircraft between the mountain and here and when you download into the computer, you can tell that is what they are - either birds or aircraft. Not in this case! These were certainly disk or cigar shaped. I snapped this particular image at 1/640 second and an aperture value of f9.0. The ISO was at 400, giving the &#39;grain&#39; or &#39;noise&#39; in the shot. My computer monitor is not that sharp, but I have viewed it on others that were. These also were not specks of dust on the imager, which I would have seen on the other shots. I have showed this to others, whom thought they looked rather odd. I did not physically see these - may not have been able to, given the shutter speed, but then again, it may not have caught my attention at that moment. Mt. Rainier is about 40 Miles away from Fife in a straight line - and these objects, by my guess, were about 20 miles or less from where I took this photo. I have no other explaination for what they are. I can not give a better desciption than this report, being I did not witness these with the naked eye, other than showing up on the camera imager.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No sound could be heard.  Lights about afar apart as in Orion constellation.  In this triangle formation, the point light was in the rear.  Crossed the sky in about one minute staying in a perfect triangle.  This was also the night of a meteor shower which is how I noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Also, ceiling was 1100 miles in Petaluma(10 miles W).<n> <n><n> <n><n> confirmed altitude of object from observer to be 26.75 deg. from observation point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> did this by locating a star that matched location of object at the same time the following night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By my calculations, this object would have to have a diameter of 10.1815 feet at .4629 miles away. Or a 27.7679 foot diameter at 1.2624 miles away. These are actual diameters based on the visual size of 1/8&#34; at 2&#39;1/2&#34; away from my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly, there has been a 4.4 earthquake just a few miles from the observation point, 5 days later. This location matches the origin of the object. Could this have been &#34;earthquake lights&#34;? I have no frame of reference to confirm this possibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon reflection, I see aircraft in nearly the same location, only never North to South, always South to North on this same path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please feel free to scrutinize my findings. I also took pictures of the exact location of the sky and horizon in which the object had previously appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My previous information was based on a very preliminary review of the environment, and almost no depth of field, in a cloudy sky at night. I believe my new information to be extremely accurate based on the limited but specific facts involved.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/29/06 03:00|Sonoma|CA|Circle|7-10min|An extremelly bright circular orange/amber light traveled NW to SW pausing for 20 sec. 3x. Not far away|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51791.html|46|ndxe200607| An extremelly bright circular orange/amber light traveled NW to SW pausing for 20 sec. 3x. Not far away<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working in the grocery store while my co-workers were outside the store, taking a break. One of my co-workers yelled from the door for me to come outside, quickly. I ran, suspecting some altercation or car accident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got outside, my co-workers were standing in the parking lot looking north east. I imidiatly saw a bright orange/amber light about 30-40 deg. above the horrizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then ran due east to the edge of the parking lot to gain darker skies. There is a field direcly east of the store, with less light pollution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood for about 10 minutes, facing east and watching this &#34;object&#34; move from left to right. It paralleled the horizon in that its over all altitude with respect to our location deviated only slightly as it stopped and remained motionless for up to 20 seconds. It stopped 3 times. Each time the object began to move again, its altitude remained some what stable. It did not appear to move on an exactly strait path but the deviation in alltitude was minimal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw the object, it was large compared to regular air traffic. If I tried to &#34;pinch&#34; the object with my thumb and index finger, arm strait, the object would be 1/8&#34; to 1/4&#34;. I am 6&#39;1&#34; tall. The distance from my eye to my thumb, held in this manner is 2&#39; 6&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About half way along the objects path, it encountered the marine layer of fog that is common this time of year here. The object lost some brightness and some size, but it still apeared larger and brighter than any normal air traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> also, I did not see the object &#34;pause&#34; until it had encountered the marine layer. This is where the object lost some of it&#39;s disk like appearance. I mean disk like the sun, and not like a frisbee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before the fog there was a slight whiteness to the center of the object, but it remained mostly dark orange, not red, but a rich orange that I have never seen on any air craft. I have seen orange in many air craft lights, but never that rich and intense a color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only noise we could hear was our own conversation and speculation with respect to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object gradually began to deminish in size and brightness and did look like commom air craft in the last minute and then dissapeared. In the last quarter of our observations, the object looked very much like Mars did the last time Mars was at it&#39;s brightest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to cut a path between the Sonoma Valley and the Napa Valley. This would put it about 5 to 10 miles away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must add that I have eaten lunch in the same location for 7+ years. I am very aware of the normal air traffic attributes here. Sitting in the same spot in the dark for 7 years, you would think that I might have seen something sooner. I am an amature astronomer and have made several sundials. I have seen many &#34;Life Flight&#34; Helicopters and Sherrif helicopters. I have watched the air traffic surrounding the Sonoma Valley from home and to work, and I have never seen any thing like this. I know what it isn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved from north west to south east. It was about 45 degrees above the horizon. This orange light was so bright, it looked like the orange street lights around our location, but this object was 5 to 10 miles away and moving quite slowly. Its speed changed gradually and it also froze for 20 or so seconds-about 3 times. It paralleled the eastern horizon in a very shallow S pattern. It seemed to stay under the marine layer of fog for the first half of its passing, then it was only blurred and less bright. I have taken my lunch break in the same spot for 7+ years. I have tracked iridium satellites, and watched the air traffic in the same location as this fireball-five days a week. I am very aware of the sky and it&#39;s changes-I can only tell you what it wasn&#39;t. Also, it made no noise what so ever. The most similar object I can come up with is a naval flare, but the color is wrong, there were no &#34;sparks&#34;, no tail, and the trajectory is all wrong, not to mention the over all distance it traveled.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was outside hoping to see some of the Perseids and to show them to my friend.  We were both gazing in the W-NW area of the sky between these two very bright stars (staring at the dark space between them).  We have been talking and laying down watching them for quite some time when suddenly to our amazement one of the two stars moved smoothly and quickly in the N-NW direction and then focused into a single sharp point of light and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it was.  We both tried to figure it out and I&#39;m a huge skeptic of aliens and spacecraft, in fact, I do not believe in it.  So, ruling out extraterrestial, insects, bats, birds, airplanes, and helicopters, and anything that makes noise... what was it?  It looked just like the rest of the stars, white in color, though now that I&#39;m thinking about it, it didn&#39;t have that twinkle like other stars did, or not to be knowledge anyway.  It could have been something near to outside our atmosphere, but small so that it appears to be far away such as a star.  It did not move for almost two hours (when we started to watch) and then made it&#39;s disappearing act.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The following day on July 29 I talked to two of my neighbors regarding the event of Friday night 28 July and I was told that their lights were flashing off and on at the  same time around 10:30 pm.

The light appreared to hover for at least 1/ hour before I alerted the neighbors who agreed that the light(s) were very unusual.  Upon further viewing the lights slowly moved N.W. and grew smaller.  We thought it would go away but within 15 minutes it came back to it&#39;s original location where the balls began to turn yellow, green, blueish purple.  It stayed hovering for so long that we finally decided to go to bed at 01:00.

I have finally been given the strength and courage through much prayer, as to have a record be given of this experience and the significance of this event. On the night of this sighting, I felt compelled to go outside for reasons only God knows the answer to. On or around the the 28th of July, 2006 at 7:00pm....I was witness to a craft which was traversing the sky, at around or above 18,000 feet. I observed it from on our balcony facing due south, in the direction of its flight path. If you know where the I-5 and 14 freeways intersect, this is the general area it was heading from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location was over the Santa Clarita Valley,(Canyon Country is where I lived specifically) and was headed in a southwest direction toward the San Fernando Valley...(both are in the Los Angeles County area respectively). This craft was a boomerang or chevron configuration. It closely resembled a letter V.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It emitted no sound and had red strobing lights running laterally down the trailing edges of the body. These lights did not blink, but rather faded one after another before cycling again down the craft&#39;s wing structure. I would with near 100% confidence estimate this V shaped vehicle to be in excess of 1,000 feet...or nearly a 1/4 mile in width wing tip to wing tip! The speed of this vehicle defied aerodynamic law for a vehicle that would have been under conventional propulsion with regard to aircraft such as fixed wing prop, or jets. It moved very slow. The length of time of our sighting was roughly 5-7 minutes, before disappearing beyond mountains that obscured further observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can estimate the altitude of flight because it was higher than the Cirrus clouds. Enough light was present from the still fading sun to observe cloud cover and the black coloration of the craft, and was coming back into view from behind (or above) clouds at times. The clouds were sparse and not very many were present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think you will love to know, that 2 others were able to observe this UFO with me. My mother and father. When I initially saw this thing, I ran into the house and alerted my parents to the presence of this craft. They followed me to the balcony and stood in utter shock as we observed it together. My mother noticed something that gave her a point of reference to the scale of this thing. She pointed out that a passenger aircraft was flying literally UNDER it! Yes we saw it pass under the V shaped craft because the jet was visible with the craft behind or above it in the background. This was possibly a 747 jet aircraft (we saw the jet had 4 wing mounted engines). I made the comment,&#34; Holy crap...that jet could land on it Mom&#34;! The size of the jet was like that of a tic tac in the sky, the V shaped craft was bigger than her fist when she held her hand in front of her and tried to cover it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more key element that is quite possibly VERY significant. After our sighting of the V shaped craft, for many days afterward, we saw numerous times F-16 aircraft making a highly unusual amount of flights over the area we saw this thing. These F-16&#39;s were seemingly &#34;looking&#34; for it. They traversed the same direction (south western), then east to west and north to south, between the hours of 7pm to 9pm for the next 3 days. They would also fly quite low and then would be at higher altitudes when making grid like flights.They flew in formations of 2 and 3 at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is also unusual is they were flying in airspace that is used by commercial aircraft, let alone the UFO itself had done this also. In and outbound flights use that same airspace from Van Nuys A.P., Burbank A.P. and Whitman A.P. It is interesting to note that Edwards Air Force Base (about 90 miles) and the Naval Air Weapons Station (about 97miles) in China Lake are closest to the location of our sighting and possibly where these jets were based out of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father later made the comment, &#34;I was in the navy, and that thing was bigger than an aircraft carrier, and it was in the damned sky&#34;! They are now true believers that there are things in this world that are not of this world. Whether or not this vehicle was of our own design, that of extra-terrestrials or a combination thereof or somewhere in between does not matter, it was there and they exist...PERIOD!<n>
7/28/06 04:40|Loveland|CO|Formation|1 minute|3 object formation over Loveland, CO|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51771.html|60|ndxe200607| 3 object formation over Loveland, CO<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had gone outside in SE Loveland, about 2.5 miles west of I-25 and the 402 exit, just after 4 AM on 7/28/06 to watch the Aquarid meteor shower. The night was clear and cloudless with just the barest hint of approaching dawn on the eastern horizon, and an occasional airliner or 2 from Denver International Airport was visible far to the SE. After spotting 1 or 2 unremarkable meteor trails in the southern sky within half an hour, I was about to go back inside when I noticed a formation of 3 faint unblinking starlike objects in a triangle formation in the mid southern sky moving N/NE at about airliner speed. It was positioned &#34;backwards&#34; as it were, with the point of the triangle in the rear of the direction it was travelling. It also was a longer distance from the front two objects to the rear, giving the appearance of a long thin triangle.  Size was unknown but my extended thumbnail at arms length would just fit in each point of the group. Other stars could be seen behind the objects as they travelled so it didn&#39;t appear to be a single object. When the formation was almost directly overhead I noticed another starlike object, somewhat brighter, that was travelling to the south and which crossed the formation&#39;s path, although I don&#39;t know if the objects had any relation to each other and I kept my attention on the formation as the other object passed by. No noise was heard nor any other effects from the objects. After watching for approx. 1 minute the objects began to fade and I lost sight of them about midway into the northern sky. It almost seems like they stopped in the sky but due to their faintness that&#39;s only speculation. Further scanning of the sky revealed no more objects or meteors and the sky was beginning to brighten towards dawn.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Canada<n> <n><n> <n><n> very bright light (looks like  a row of 3 or 4 searchlights) suddenly appeared above the English Bay area in Vancouver, B.C. Canada. I was smoking outside looking at the lights from West Vancouver. I seemed rise into the sky and fly toward West Vancouver (toward North from the English Bay). I felt a little strange but thought that it would be a aircraft. When the light came closer to me, I saw a red light on one side and a blue light on the other side. So I was almost sure that it is airplane. Still I could not figure out the shape of the flying object because of the bright light in front. When it passed over me (not exactly above me though), I could see the silhouette of the flying object reflected by moonlight. It did not have a airplane tail or tail wing. It was round shape and I heard the very low and loud &#34;booing&#34; sound. The whole shape looked like a disk with 3 or 4 searchlights in a row side by side in front, a red light on right or left side and a blue light on the other. It did not spin. It just flied over West Vancouver toward Grouse Mountain and disappeared in the dark sky. I do not know how long it lasted for but it was very quick, maybe for a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We looked through telescope and saw like a dome shaped top, and they sened to travel in a circle, too fast to be a plane, helicopter, jet, or salelite (satleites dont orbit in circles). only one of us sworn to have sawn a red striek like a speed of light, definetly not a shooting star.  It seemed to have lasted for 3 hours!  It didnt leave a smoke trail like a plane would, too silent for a helicopter or jet. please dont tell us we are the only ones who saw this!<n>

Anyway I noticed a shiny silver cylinder shaped object moving in a steady direction. Why I stopped to observe it was because it was too high in the sky to be a helicopter or a zepplin, it had no apparent wings nor was it emiting a trail of exhaust like a jet liner. The sun was starting to set so it made the object bright in the sky and it could be why I at first noticed it. It was moving too fast to be a weather ballon. Then after a while it dissapeared behind a building that made viewing it impossible. And after a while I kept looking up when I could have sworn I saw another. Then I felt silly and just got to were I was going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentionned this to a friend who suggested I get it out of my mind and not tell anyone for fear they would consider me a bit kooky.  Still it has been nagging me and I just wanted to get it off my chest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for being there for this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Just before getting to Gagetown I noticed something shining to my right, up in the air.  It was approximately a couple thousand feet from us flying along the trans Canada highway.  I said &#34;what&#39;s that?&#34; and two of my companions looked up, the front passenger saw it then it just zoomed at incredible speed and stopped around 20 miles away, we could still see very well then the third passenger see it.  The characteristics that were most interesting is it was round (looked like an aspirin pill), shined like chrome and moved at incredible speed.  I&#39;ve seen jets move before and this was no jet, it would be going like Mach 7.  When it was close by, if you calculate by distance at 2000 ft from us, it must have been like 200 ft in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched it from a distance and the shine was still very intense (seemed just like the sun reflecting from the surface of this craft) it just moved again and we just lost it, it was way too fast to follow with our eyes.  We just looked at each other and no other comment was made, this was no doubt a very odd experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were on the balcony of our hotel facing the ocean and saw 3 amber colored lights hovering out in front of us probably a few miles out.  At first we thought it was the lights of a plane that was flying directly at us.   This obviously was not the case when the light on the right split into 2 lights. This was not a flare either because the lights were not falling, they were stationary.  This got my attention! I knew then that this was not our technology.  After a few minutes passed the lights just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we all were just in astonishment that we just witnessed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later the 4 lights reappeared in a different location on the horizion. It seemed like they traveled miles and miles in only a minute.  The lights disappeared and reappeared again in a different location.  This happened 4 or 5 more times in the next 60 minutes or so. During this t! ime the sun had set and it was dark outside.  My cousin and I went down to the ocean and we sit on the sand and just watched.  As I looked up at the stars I saw around 20 white lights in some kind of formation traveling together and leaving together.  That is what happened to us so I thought I would share that.  That day changed my whole perspective on this ufo phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for letting me share.<n>

It was raining lightly as the cloud bank was beginning to clear the area.  My daughter asked if she could take a picture with our digital camera. I told her not to use the flash because the light reflects back at you when it hits the raindrops.  She took several pictures some of which did not comeout for various reasons.  When I downloaded the pictures to my laptop I observed a picture that had a white streak in it that was not there when we took the picture. My daughter, wife and I did not see this object in the air when the picture was taken.  The picture you will see has some streaks in it from the raindrops, but this streak of light jumps off the screen at you. There appears to be another in the distance on the right side of the photo. Object I would say is at appx 30,000 to 35,000 ft in altitude. I do not believe this to be a contrail for several reasons, I would have noticed them being an airline employee, and during this time of year contrails are not usually that visible or bright and would be visible across the pictue. Object(s) are moving towards the west, resembles a comet in appearance. Picture is being emialed to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was about to turn and then the bigger star moved, I mean enough to get my attention and make me pull over and get out. Time seemed like it paused for a while,a man and his friend was walking up the road and they started pointing up. The regular size star just stood still while the bigger one moved towards the north. Just when I was going to pass it off for just a falling star, the big one started moved sideways and faster. It flickered, and then vanished and reappeared back by the spot by the regular looking star. A hugh square of the sky around the two objects went black and the big object sort of disappeared in the darkness, but the smaller one still shined like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the people that were watching began walking away saying that he had seen enough, I stayed.The big object seemed to appear grayish as it reappeared from the darkness. ( and that was the strangest part to me, you could see color at 6:00am in the morning, that far up in the sky.) In about 40 secs the big object started away from the small one and seemed to go faster and faster away. Then the big object turned grayish blue and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Continuing watching, the &#34;plane&#34; appeared to stop for a few seconds and then it headed right in my direction.  Object was at an elevation of approximately 100 yards and was about 0.2 miles away upon heading toward me.  As the object approached, the airplane lights shut off and some subtle white lights lined the bottom. Right after this, a disk of white/yellow light began radiating for the object.  The light was so bright it was like a flourecent.  This part of the sighting was definitely unearthly to say the least.  It lit up the way a spinning ufo firework appears from the bottom.  The entire time this was happening it was heading in exactly my direction from 0.2 miles away, and lit up when it was perfectly clear for me to see!  By the time I ran from the window thinking I personally was being pursued, the object was about 100 yards away and closing. I&#39;m not positive, could have been from initial shock, but I think I remember beeing shined on with a directional light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been paranoid at night after this event occured.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The front of my house faces directly south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening at about 10:00pm I went out the front door to make sure my vehicle was locked when I immediately noticed a bright light in the sky.

It was perfectly round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a note I am an armature astronomer with an 11&#39; Schmidt cassigrain telescope. So I am families with the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately thought the light was not a normal occurrence. It was motionless. As I looked at it for a minute or so the light literally began to shrink until it totally disappeared. I&#39;m thinking that was weird. I told my wife about it and to be honest, she didn&#39;t think too much about it. Then about a week later at about 10:30 at night I and my wife were outside smoking a cigarette on our deck. Our deck faces due north. When all of a sudden there is another light of the same magnitude to the north. My wife asked me what star or planet it was and I informed her it was neither. It was motionless just like the one earlier in the week and as bright. We watched it for a minute or so when the same thing happened again. It shrank and then disappeared. I never saw it again. I moved to Ozark, MO in the summer of 2007. Thank goodness the only thing I’ve seen there was an occasional satellite orbiting over. Do you have any explanation to as what me and my wife witnesses? By the way, both nights were clear. Please reply.<n>

Sitting outside in lawn chairs catching up on eachothers day is a common practice amongst us.  I had been looking up at the sky when i noticed a silver metalic looking object in the sky above.  I immediatley jumped out of my seat and pointed towards the sky.  It sort of just hovered there right next to the cloud.  Now this shape is unlike anything i had ever seen.  It almost looked like three different circles combined into a solid shape.  I guess the best description would be the krylon spray paint can.  Imagine those three circles meshed into one.  My 5 friends sat there in aww of the event that was occuring.  My friends also being the biggest skeptics on this planet were also pointing and trying to figure it out.  We sat there and watched it hover for about 15 minutes, keep in mind this was broad daylight about 6:00 p.m.  After about 15 minutes the object began to slowly hide behind a cloud.  But it floated around the cloud and we never saw it again.  Now this is were it gets very strange.  About 10-15 minutes after the object went into the cloud, a all black helicopter appeared and went into the same cloud, almost as if it was chasing it.  The helicopter dissapeared into the cloud.  Roughly ten minutes after that event, air force one flew over the same area.  This was the same day that 520 bridge had been shut down, so the president could come meet with bill gates.  I have never been known to lie, and i can put this on my life that everything that i just described was 100 percent real.  I have seen many crafts in washington state,  but that was the clearest observance of a ufo.  Was an extra terrestrial craft watching the president of the united states?  Was it a daylite satelitte and a large quinsidence?  Or was it a spy plane or device used for watching us or the president?  I will never know, but that will go down as the most remarkable thing i have ever seen.  This definetley beats back in 1996 when a streak of light flew by sammamish,wa.  All of the neighborhood kids and i chased it down the street as well as many adults.  It was a 100 foot streak of light.  The news as well as the goverment alerted every one that it was rocket debri from space.  Im not buying it, and i will devote my life to this trade to uncover to the public that we are being observed and visited on a daily basis.  Next time you see military choppers over your house, i would do a little investigative work.  Watch the skies, the truth is right in front of your eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was laying in a field looking at the stars when I noticed what at first seemed a very bright V-shaped grouping of stars. The lights were bright, well defined and clear like LED lights, with the point of the V being the brightest. I realized that this cluster of lights was moving very slowly. I don&#39;t recall seeing a definitive shape other than the lights, so that is why I say it could have been between 1 and 7 objects. But the lights did move exactly together, so they seemed attached to a body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like a flashlight in the distance, I noticed one of the side lights seemed to be searching, by its growing duller and brighter. But, as I was laying on my back looking up to the sky, I didn&#39;t notice the ground being illuminated and there was no definite beam in the sky. Then it grew extremely bright, and it seemed now pointed directly at me, though I am not sure this is the case. Then the light started flashing at me or in general, in steady strobe pulses. But I can&#39;t say that I, or the ground around me were illuminated. Time is somewhat illusive to me during this, but I don&#39;t think I watched the light flash at me any longer than a minute before I got up, frightened at this point, and left. I have no idea how long the lights stayed, I didn&#39;t go back to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were definitely moving very slowly and I think there were seven lights total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am usually pretty cautious about stories such as this, and only twelve hours later the event seemed too surreal to be true. But I was absolutely awake and aware, during the event, that it was really happening. But I am wondering if anyone else saw this? Hopefully someone did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were laying down on the trampoline in the backyard so that we could comfortably survey the stars and possibly catch a glimpse of any sort of celestial movement. Such as, shooting stars and ironically UFOs. We were both smoking Durahm Black clove cigarettes as we lay there while making idle chatter about many subjects. Including but not limited to, me giving him advice on a biblical teaching he had to give to his local fellowship, the topic being, &#34;fearless living,&#34; also, talking about whether he made out with his girlfriend on the trampoline, just idle chatter. Every now and then, one of us would say, &#34;did you see that shooting star?&#34; At 11:45 pm we noticed two objects heading due east. They were flying at the same speed and were obviously flying in formation. I heard no sound from them but my friend said he could hear slight movement of the air. The appearance was, oval and conical at the ends, to me it appeared like I was looking at the bottom of a wider-than-usual boat. The craft were lower than an airplane, we could tell that much. They flew right over head. These objects appeared to slowly move across the sky, but must&#39;ve been moving much faster than any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen, seeing as it took them less than 20 - 30 seconds to appear in sight on the west clear sky and disappear out of sight into the eastern sky. We lost sight of them mainly due to the glow of the city light. We probably could of still saw them for another 5 to 10 seconds at the speed they were going. One of them remained at a steady course but the one on the left wobbled at somewhere in the middle of the trip. And after it wobbled it moved closer to the other craft. The color of these craft were a faded peach-orange color. There was a haze around the objects as well. We had no camera, we took no pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought they might be really weird looking planes, but they were traveling at speeds far faster than any plane or anything in the sky I have seen in my life travel at, except perhaps a bird swooping very quickly downward...except these things weren’t traveling downward. They were also the wrong shape for any type of plane and glowed all over like really big, really close, really bright stars. Despite all the evidence against it, I rationalized that they could be fighter planes...until I realized seconds later that there were making no sound, at all. It was at that point that I decided to stop rationalizing what they were and just watch them, since I was obviously looking at something I probably wouldn’t see again. To my amazement, and slightly to my horror, one of the objects on the fair right of the other two moved at a crazy speed to the object on the fair left and went really close to it, almost touching and then moved away, almost like those tiny birds that move together, moving close to each other for a minute before smoothly swerving away; although, nothing like that at all, the movement was way too smooth, too fast, too big, it was more like oh I don’t know two cartoon ovals on a screensaver or something almost touching and then (usually with some weird windows ping sound moving away)they were kind of like blood cells, on the Virgin Airline TVs when people get on and off the plane, except smoother and faster in their movement, but much like the relationship of the blood cells in that movie. Anyway the three objects then proceed to begin (again much to my amazement and horror) to weave inside and outside of each other, making a pattern like weaving a plait. All the while moving amazingly fast and glowing faintly orange. It was as if they were playing with each other, I could not see more however, as the weaving pattern and their movement caused them to move out of my line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in shock. I stood there for quite a while going over what happened in my mind. The whole thing must have been less than a minute long; I stood by my window for much longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first instinct (strangely enough, since I’m not usually like this) was to forget it ever happened, to assume that it was simply something normal than appeared abnormal from my location. My conscious mind kicked in at that point and stopped the panicky defense mechanism of repressing and rationalizing from taking hold, and I told myself as I went to bed that night that I had to ask anyone that would listen and understood my Spanish if they saw anything strange last night or if there are any weird birds in this part of the world who reflect the electric light from the cities they fly over (my rationalization that allowed me to get to sleep).<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I go into school the next day, happy that I hadn’t repressed the experience in the night, and asked my friend if she had seen anything odd last night (drawing her a crude picture). She shook her head and had no idea what to say to me, so we both asked the teacher if they were in fact any birds that reflected the electric lights of the cities they flied over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The teacher glanced at my drawing, listened to my rationale and description and proceeded to tell me that it was probably a UFO and that not only that he’d seen several odd things shooting across the sky growing up here, but also that ¨a lot of people see them, usually in summer.

The sky was completely clear and you could see the entire sky with-out cloud obstruction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was looking at the stars, as I often do, I saw a satalite moving accross the sky. I have seen them several times and followed it across the sky, when all of the sudden, from a totally different direction, a smaller object caught my eye. As I began to trace it, I noticed two more that came close to it from different angles. They moved around vey fast and in no planned path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I have never seen anthing like this before, and it made me whatch more intently after I lost track of them. I remained with my eyes affixed to the sky for approximately 1-1.5hrs. To my surprise, I was able to wittness at least 6 or more similer objects in the sky. They were way too high for our aircraft and too stealthy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It makes no differance to me whether I am believed or not, my views will remain the same. There can be no other explanation than extraterestrial. I am 35yrs old, and fairly well educated. I know what I saw last night. No. It was not a &#34;saucer&#34;, or a shape that I could identify, but the movements and distance tell me it was not from here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am trying to find out if anyone else has seen this sort of thing before, but I don&#39;t know where to ask. For now, this will have to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At about 8:00 p.m. there appeared two cigar shaped objects overhead flying in parallel lines, one slightly behind the other, with no sound, no lights were seen, but they seemed to be very shiny, silver looking.  We watched them go out of sight into a cloud cover.  Several people on the ferry were pointing to them, and others seemed not to notice them at all.  They left no vapor trail.  They stayed exactly at the same speed and distance from each other until we could no longer see them.  The witnesses were from age 16 to 80.  I tried to take digital pictures.  If they appear on the pictures, I will send them at a later time.  I have never reported any sightings before as I have never witnessed anything that I thought to be a UFO before, but these objects were strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had heard the aircraft it was load!  Thinking I would see three fighter jets (which would have been typical, especially since we have the National Guard here cleaning up from the storms).  But when I looked up it was a black triangular shaped aircraft where it was wide in shape with two of the points being squared off, and completing the triangle.  I ran fast to the end of the drive pointing it out to my three daughters but it moved so quickly and then disappeared through the clouds.  As we discussed what we had just seen some answers maybe Boeing has a new craft-possilby gearing up for a war?  My husband said maybe a UFO?  My husband explains while sitting there with our two year old he heard it coming and felt it, it rumbled as it went over him, when he realized it was something he had never seen he started to call us.  He said, &#34;I thought I&#39;d ask you to grab your camera but I didn&#39;t want you to miss it, it was moving so fast.&#34; Seconds later we heard another aircraft off in the distance, like a 747 airplane, not sure if it was following.  Couldn&#39;t see it but heard it once the sound of the first aircraft was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Looking out from our front steps is a few degrees south of due east.  There were a few clouds out.  The first seen was by her. She said she saw a strange configuration of multiple colored light appear out of nowhere and move into a cloud high in the sky lasting only for a few seconds.  I missed it, but she said it didn&#39;t look like aeroplane lights or a star.  She said it was just really weird looking.  A little dismayed that I had missed it about 5-10 minutes later we saw a flash of white just to the left where she saw hers at about a little more than a 45 degree angle from our position upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flash of white was really brilliant and moving in a northern direction.  This happen just a little left of where I was looking, so I could not have missed it moving across the sky.  It was almost as if it just popped into that spot or entered the atmosphere.  The flash turned to an whitish blue orb with a little of a steaking tail or a blurr. At this point it was little bigger than the size of venus viewed with the eyes.  It then faded to a smaller size looking like a dim star.  Moving north it kept this appearence till I lost it behind a rooftop.  Distance of travel seen would be about the length of a ruler held at arms length.  I have seen ALOT of shooting stars, meteorites and the like in my lifetime and this was NO shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my girlfriend and I witnessed the second light.<n>

The light was white and did not blink.  At first I did not notice it moving and did not give it much thought and looked away.  However, my eyes were drawn back to it as I saw it move from north to south and fade out.  I have seen many meteors (was awake for the Leonid showers) and this was moving too slow for a meteor...although, at that altitude (not sure but it seemed way up there) it must have been moving along.  Thought maybe it was a satellite that just happened to catch the sun reflecting off of it but I then saw two airplanes move in that direction.  Those were easy to identify since they had the traditional blinking lights.  The two planes appeared to be at the same altitude and moving in the same direction as the white light was moving.  I live about 2 miles from the southern lake erie shoreline and everything was moving from north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no clouds in the sky, no moon was visible (it&#39;s always in the opposite direction anyway), and no wind. It was about 85 degrees (F).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly &amp; seemingly from out of no where, a goldish circular light appeared in the sky. It was about 1/3 the size of a full moon when it&#39;s highest in the sky. It was an intense (but easy to look at) soft gold color, that seemed to be pulsing on the outer circumfrence of the object, which had no visible defined edge. No other shape within or without the object was visible. There was total silence as is moved laterally &amp; slowly in a westerly direction. The object appeared to above Mt. Burdell. No commercial jets or other aircraft were in the area at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Totally suprised by what I was seeing I quickly thought about fireworks or flares, both ideas which I discarded quickly. I called for my son to come here as I continued to watch this amazing &amp; mysterious celestial display. Then just as my son was about to step outside, there was a quiet, low frequency popping noise, &amp; the object seemed to dissapear, or rather transform. In it&#39;s place was a dot of light, appearing much like a small distant star, except it was moving, still in a westerly direction. It was difficult to continue to see as it became fainter, until it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I recently moved back to Lincoln, and have been staying with my parents while looking for a place of my own.  Some weeks ago I had a dream in which an otherworldly craft flew over the house while I was alone on the front porch.  In the dream I called my mother out to witness the thing with me so that at least someone would believe what I had seen.  Then, several nights before the sighting described below, I stumbled upon a video of a 2001 press conference given at the National Press Club in Washington, DC by Dr. Greer and The Disclosure Project, and was stunned by the information presented there by him and his 21 government, military, intelligence community, and corporate witnesses.  This testimony shattered my preconceived notions about ufos--indeed my entire worldview--and forced me to admit that I likely have been a victim of disinformation my entire life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was still reeling from what I had learned from this video, and was weighing telling my parents about it as we sat on their front porch on the night of July 21, when my father said &#34;there&#39;s a ufo.&#34;  He is a level-headed retired journalist who coincidentally spent years as a member of the National Press Club working as an award-winning White House Press Photographer under the Nixon administration.  I saw that he was joking about an airplane flying nearby, but his comment gave me the opportunity to broach the subject of The Disclosure Project press conference and tell the two of them that I thought it likely that we world citizens had been lied to for generations about the reality of extraterrestrial visitation.  It was a difficult thing for me to do, as I am a rational person and was risking my credibility, but I feel that this is supremely important information that everyone needs to hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three of us had an interesting conversation in which my parents expressed their own doubt about the official ufo story, and generally we all just soaked up this astounding revelation without waxing overly dramatic about it.  Some time later my mother went up to bed and my father and I stayed up talking.  Just after 11 pm, as if it had been summoned as verification of my earlier assertions, a glowing, bluish-white object about the apparent size of a pea held at arm&#39;s length, brighter than anything else in the sky, appeared about 20 degrees above the horizon (below the clouds) almost due south of us, glowing brightly and streaking rapidly westward at a 30 degree downward angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said &#34;do you see that?&#34; and my father replied &#34;I&#39;m looking at it&#34; in a stupefied tone.  The object (I call it an object rather than a light because it was a sharply-defined ovoid shape with no flames, rays, or tail) shot in a straight line toward the horizon and disappeared behind the buildings a few hundred feet south of us, absolutely soundlessly.  It seemed to be about a half-mile or so distant, though it was difficult to tell with certainty.  There was no explosion or flash of light at the time the object should have hit the ground, had it been a meteor, comet, or other sort of space debris.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my dad if we shouldn&#39;t call the local papers and tv stations the next day to see if anyone had reported anything.  The veteran journalist replied &#34;why would we do that?  They wouldn&#39;t tell us anything we don&#39;t already know.&#34;  A man of few words, he paused for a second or two and then said &#34;that was what you would call &#39;a classic ufo&#39;.&#34;  He later admitted he&#39;d never seen anything like it before.  The next day he joked, &#34;the ufo people were listening to our conversation,&#34; with his typical dry humor, but who knows--is that so unlikely?  Just two or three minutes after the sighting I took out my PDA and recorded detailed notes, which formed the basis of this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, the animation on your site provided by a witness to a March 19 sighting in Seattle is very similar to what my father and I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I noticed an object that appeared to be a large and bright star, similar to what Venus would look like at its brightest.  Within a few seconds, this object expanded, became bigger and even brighter, then suddenly disappeared. I watched the area for a while longer, but saw nothing re-appear, nothing else unusual.  This object never became unnaturally large or bright, but it was odd in that it increased in size before completely vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it to be some sort of star, but as it started to fade away (there was no horizontal or vertical movement just fading) another object started to fade in to its right. Then that faded and at the same time, another object was fading in downward to its right. Then that faded, as it faded, two lights faded in next to it. Once those lights faded there was nothing else.

They seemed to just vanish and looked like they were putting on some sort of a demonstration.  Anyway I went back into the house and thought who would believe me even if I did report it.  Then I saw some of the photos taken by the Mars rovers and cameras and found what looked like a similar object in the background of sol 605 photo and other photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

7/21/06 04:15|Florence/Queen Creek|AZ|Sphere|5 minutes|Spotted UFO, then object let out blinding white light, then shot off into the sky leaving a trail of fire like a astroid.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51835.html|133|ndxe200607| Spotted UFO, then object let out blinding white light, then shot off into the sky leaving a trail of fire like a astroid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So im on my way to work at like 4:15am or so driving down a deserted road heading south towards Coolidge. Well, the sky is awesome, you can see tons of stars, I was just blown away at how clear it was. So im kinda glancing around as im driving, and spot this little off-white light out my left window that is moving, like an airplane or whatever. Well, it doesnt have any flashing lights on it or anything, and its not really moving that fast at all. Well, I keep an eye on it for a few minutes, figuring that it&#39;s probably a satellite or something that is low in orbit and can easily be seen because of the clear sky. Well, next thing I know it emits an extremely bright white flash of light that lasted about 1/2 second, and I dont mean like a spotlight on a helicopter, it looked like a flash of lightning, extremely bright, and extremely big, it made a circle pattern, and was so bright that it actually reflected light off of my windshield. Then that thing shot off, and made a trail of fire in a very sharp streak pattern heading Southeast at an upward climb. Kinda interesting, reminded me of Star Wars when they put it in hyper drive or whatever they call it.  Im sure it had to be something un-earthly, because there are no planes, satellites, or meteors that do those things, however, I suppose it could have possibly been a military project or something of that nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/21/06 02:20|Adelaide  (South Australia)||Triangle|1-2 minutes|Triangular craft witnessed in Adelaide, Australia|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51472.html|134|ndxe200607| Triangular craft witnessed in Adelaide, Australia<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m an 18-year-old female from Adelaide, Australia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night (Friday 21st July 2006 at approx 2.20 am) I witnessed what I believe was a UFO. So far as I know, I was the sole witness. The weather conditions at the time of sighting were like any crisp winter night. The moon was waning (although it was perhaps oddly well lit outside) there was minimal cloud clover and the air was still, no wind or rain. I was brushing my hair before going to sleep, when I heard something like the noise of an approaching aircraft. Only, it didn&#39;t sound like a jet engine - it was of a indescribable, strange pitch and more thunderous... strange enough to give me the heebie jeebies. Given that there&#39;s a flight curfew in Adelaide between 11 PM - 5 AM, and the sound it made was so odd, I went to look out the window in time to see it almost right overhead. It wasn&#39;t very high up, and I could see it was shaped like a backwards triangle with rounded corners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two steady clear, blue-white lights with a pulsating red tail light on the underbelly of the craft, but there was enough light outside for me to make out the shape of whatever it was. There was no nose - it was literally a triangle. It was bizarre enough for me to get a chill down my spine and I was contemplating reaching for my phone to take a photo, when it just disappeared! I could hear it but I couldn&#39;t see it, even though my line of sight in the direction it was going was unblocked. I should&#39;ve been able to see it with no problem. I can only assume it went above a cloud - but like I said, it wasn&#39;t at a high altitude, and it wasn&#39;t cloudy last night. I am not located near any airports or air force bases. Besides, it was well past the aforementioned curfew. In addition, I noticed afterwards that the air seemed to be charged with static.<n>

7/21/06 01:55|New Delhi (India)||Fireball|5 - 7 minutes|Huge glowing object spotted at eastern horizon and in the south - west much bigger than the stars and at one - fourth the size of moon.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51680.html|136|ndxe200607| Huge glowing object spotted at eastern horizon and in the south - west much bigger than the stars and at one - fourth the size of moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi, I&#39;m an engineering student from New Delhi, India. Before describing the actual details of what happened that night, please allow me to describe the general geographic background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> New Delhi, though an emerging cosmopolitan city is still lacks from high rises and military exercises which are anyways apparent during the republic day rehearsal and that too once an year or two in the locality i live in. The gist being, its a calm locality at night where one can see all the stars as clearly as in any other location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever since i was a little child, i had always been taking routine walks on my terrace late at night after studies or for a cigarette or two. The time period ranges from any where between 12 AM to 3 AM, with most of the visits occurring after 2 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date: 21st July 2006. Time: Around 0150 hrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my yet another late night walk, i saw a huge ball of light emanating from something which looked spherical in its shape. I am not able to describe it&#39;s exact shape, but because of the light that was coming out from it, it resembled a sphere which was on fire. I am totally into astronomy and space sciences and for long have been an observer or night skies, hence, i am completely able to discern a commercial aircraft from something this spectacular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO (as I&#39;ll call it) was spotted on the eastern horizon, almost exactly aligned with my line of sight. It was not a light coming from a Mobile Receiving Station, it was very high up in the sky and was non moving. For once, i decided not to pay any attention as generally i don&#39;t expect such things to crop in New Delhi sky (i thought they could only be a part of lives of people belonging to developed countries) But once it stayed still at its position, different from any air borne object i&#39;ve seen in my whole life, i came to deciphering that it has got to be something Unidentified. i kept a close look at that thing. To describe more about its appearance, it looked like lots of stars have conjoined into one object to emanate a big ball of fire, which some times kept low and sometimes kindled to life again. (By this time, it was already 3 - 4 minutes into the whole phenomenon) Out of anything that came into my mind, i decided to light a cigarette, i went to bring a cigarette from a room which is on my terrace itself, but to my utter amazement, i could now see the same Craft from a big frame less window from that room itself. It had the same properties - stayed still in the air, glowing very very brightly and differently from any other object in the sky. To confirm what i was seeing was the same Craft i saw 4 minutes ago, i rushed back to the same spot where i had spotted it initially. And to my utter amazement - It Was Not There. I went back to that window again. I could now see it brightly staying still in my south - western line of sight. The &#34;thing&#34; had almost covered more than half of New Delhi within seconds of its appearance and disappearance. I rushed to the stairs to call my father and by this time i could see the &#34;thing&#34;&#39;s light going down slightly. But when i bought my father upstairs to witness the phenomenon, it was not there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date: 22nd July 2006. Time: ~ 2315 hrs My little reported seeing exactly the same kind of Craft (that is today at the time of writing this) of exactly the same appearance and at exactly the same position. Witness Time: 5 - 7 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/21/06 01:20|Vancouver|WA|Disk|nearly an hour|Saucer like object with clear red & blue lights|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51471.html|137|ndxe200607| Saucer like object with clear red &amp; blue lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 1:20 a.m. we went out back of my house, which is facing dirrectly West.  We see a light in the distance but I quickly shrugged it off as an airplane because of the red and blue flashing lights.  We BS&#39;d outside for a few more minutes before we realized that the object hadn&#39;t moved in the sky (or atleast not enough to be a plane).  We got our camera with a high powered lense, and were able to get a better view.  The object was undoubtably saucer shaped, with a red light that was traveling around the object, and a blue light that appeared to be stationary at top.  The red light was very prodominant every time it circled around the object.  The longer we watched the object, we realized it was starting to move West.  It moved West, a really really long ways for almost 45 minutes, to the point that it was getting a bit more difficult to see, but the strange thing is the red light was still very prominant.  You could tell it was a red light (looking like blinking now) but it was thousands of miles away at this point.  The object then changed course and started heading north.  It was obviously too far away to really see it moving from looking at it.  But we used landmarks (trees, other objects) to be able to tell when the object was staying still, or moving in a particular direction. I know of no aircraft that is known to the public that can produce the results that we saw tonight.  Hopefully someone else saw it !!!!  I believe the object was someone over our coast range when we first spoted it.  Then again I am not expert on telling how far away objects in the sky are.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving to the south (over and parallel to Freeway 5, perhaps?) close to the same speed and altitude as most local small aircraft traffic (I am just a few miles from PDX). It was not what most would call a spectacle. It was black, had a diamond shape with four rounded edges and had no lights, no visible features (tail, landing gear, windows) and it produced no audible sound. The sun was setting at the time and the sunlight on the bottom western edge of the object produced a warm orange glow on the surface despite being black. It left me with sense that the object had a matte rather than a high-metalic surface. My friends and I agreed that the object was not a plane or a helicopter. We considered the possibility it was a baboon. The wind was mild and steady and coming from the Northwest. The object was moving more directly to south, It follows, the winds aloft would have to have been moving in a somewhat different direction than the wind on the ground - and I realize this is very possible. I could just about cover the object with the tip of my index finger at arms length. And from this vantage point in could most certainly have been a diamond shaped balloon. However, I would think that such an odd shaped object would be more likely to tumble through the air rather than glide. Nobody was particularly impressed with the event. Nevertheless, I felt compelled to report it on the off chance that somebody else may have gotten a better look at the object and needs corroboration.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am prior Air Force and have seen lots and lots of aircraft coming and going and maneuvering in the sky and I&#39;ve not seen anything like this before. I have also seen aircraft reflect the sun (like this may have been, not sure tho) but the thing with this was the fact there was no slow moving plane...we sat there and looked and looked for an aircraft after that and there was NONE. The light I feel must have been a reflection of the sun, and it was a round reflection, like whatever it was was round or perhaps it could have been the underside of it? (engine???). Who knows, but it was there and it was gone ...I know that meteor&#39;s have been coming into the atmosphere and it did not look like that because there was no tail or smoke or fire.....and it did not look like it had fallen into the atmosphere, it looked like it was leaving the atmosphere tho....<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son has better eyes than I do and he didn&#39;t see a plane afterwards either, but he did see something bright disappear, like I did....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I realize that &#34;college students&#34; have been the subject of submiting hoaxes, however I do believe that this report is not a hoax although determining such is left to subjective review by this site.  At about 10:32 am at Riverfront Park a large oval shaped craft was spotted flying very slowly while I was relaxing under a shaded tree in a large grass field area of the Park.  It had a high glossy silver color, and reflected the sun rays exposing the highly reflective metal.  It was as large and oval like a blimp and just after about 13 seconds, it completely vanished, leaving a short chem-trail just before it disappeared.  The day this occured, the sky was completely void of clouds and the object did not decrease in size before vanishing like airplanes do, it was simply there one second, then gone the next.  I searched the sky for it after it left but couldn&#39;t find it.  Im convinced from this experience and others, that they are here, and they do exist..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was going up toward the sky at a angle then leveled off what was strange about it was it was all one color from the front to the rear a golden yellow color the object was kind of cigar shaped, flat on the top and bottom and tappered on the ends. The object flew smoothly across the sky just like floatly with no effort and there was no noise at all it passed thru some clouds you could still see it thru the the grey clouds glowing and still see its shape it kept going toward the southeast then just faded away as it went!<n>

We were lying on the docks, watching the stars and having a smoke *about 1 AM* (his girlfriend was back at the camp site) we started noticing some strange activity when we saw a shooting star, not unusual right? Well we didn’t think so wither except we saw over 30 in a brief time period, about an hour. We went back to our camp site after things died down. We had separate tents, he and his girlfriend were in one and I was in the other. I couldn’t sleep and was lying awake watching the shadows on the tent. There was a bright white light, moving across the top of the tent, casting heavy shadows of the tree branches like a search light. I didn’t think much of it, dismissing it as a plane or helicopter even though there was no noise. I got up to go to the bathroom *about 2, 2:30* I was walking back when I noticed a white light flying across the sky. Being an aviation nerd I noticed the object (a plane to me at the time) was flying very fast, but then I focused on it and there were no strobes, as by FAA regulated law, you must have strobes on any flying aircraft. You’ve seen then on the tips of the wings and also a red one on the belly of the craft. I thought that it was strange but again dismissed it as a possible government plane with permission. When I got back to the camp site my brother was standing out of the tent looking at the sky, he said he saw a bright light, like I had, except he saw the one I encountered and then another one a couple min. after I left. We were just messing around looking at the sky, and saw another bright white light; however it was coming from the side, and was growing brighter, as if heading straight for us. As we looked on, the light suddenly shot off the right, and up. The light was the same color and brightness as the one I saw earlier. We watched it till it disappeared behind the trees, though it was still flying as we could just make it out behind the branches. We saw more lights (howeve!  not near as bright) flying the same direction. They appeared to change altitude slightly every few seconds, though I cannot be sure. All I know is that they were NOT planes, helicopters or any sort of FAA regulated craft, they were too fast, and did not have enough lights to be planes. Unless there were 5 planes without required lights, and one plane that could change directions extremely rapidly, then there is something weird going on. The sightings lasted between about 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM, the sun came up and we were unable to see more, or they had all left. I have though about this for a while and am unable to come to any conclusions as to what they may have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *If investigators would like to contact me, please do so via e-mail as I currently have no phone.

Anyone who has been across the bridge knows that it takes about 2 minutes to get across by car.  For about one minute you have a clear view of all the surrounding areas.  In this area, I just happened to be looking South when I seen what looked like stars, but they weren&#39;t in the sky, they were hovering a little higher than the bridge about an eighth of a mile away from my location and heading south at a VERY slow speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was an airplane, so I opened my window to hear the engines and didn&#39;t hear anything.  After I didn&#39;t hear anything, I pulled over (like you&#39;re not supposed to on the bridge) and just sat and watched the lights with my windows down.  It took me a second to realize that they weren&#39;t just lights, because the space in between the lights was blocking out lights behind it.  Other cars started slowing down and stopping to watch the phen! omena with me.  The so-called &#34;craft&#34; or &#34;glowing lights&#34; spun around to where the point of the triangle the lights formed were heading kind of south east and it proceeded to pick up speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back on the road heading south trying to catch up to it because I knew it would eventually go right over the express way.  Every car I passed seemed to have people inside looking up and pointing at the same thing I was watching.  When it finally crossed the express way, I was about a half a mile away and every car in the area started hitting their brakes.  After it crossed the express way, it proceeded south east and disappeared behind a large wooded area.  Everyone on the road that night seen what I seen and it showed by everyone only going 20-30 mph for the next 5-10 miles.  I&#39;m a complete skeptic of UFO&#39;s, but THAT, I could not explain.<n>

At first glance, it seemed to be just a white weather balloon of in the distance. However, after I had brought out my video camera and zoomed in about half way the object took on a very distinct saucer shape. The object had a metallic color to it and the suns light was reflecting off the upper half of the U.F.O.. The object seemed to be relatively large because it was easily visible without any magnification devices, and it had passed over some clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do have a 5 minutes video of such object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a blue light, shaped like a globe/orb, with a &#34;tail&#34; of orange behind it/ connected to it. On impulse I got up really quickly and looked out, but it was gone. It was travelling really fast, straight forward and making no sound. It wasn&#39;t as high up as an aeroplane, but a lot higher up than my building. It was definitely not a firework. I&#39;ve never been interested in UFOs, but this was totally weird and I got a bit freaked out/confused and decided to see if I could find an explanation on the internet. I found this website, but noticed other&#39;s descriptions don&#39;t match mine. I don&#39;t know... Maybe there&#39;s a natural explanation for what I saw, but I swear, I have never seen anything like that before or heard of it. It was so weird.

They somehowe seemed odd, though, as they were much brighter than any other star. I was wondering if I was witnessing an explosion of two (!) stars when, to my surprise, their light started to fade and they - simultaneously - started to move slowly to North-North-East, constantly losing their brightness, as if they were getting further and further from Earth. They kept their distance from each other all the way, as if flying in a pair. I could trace them for about three minutes before losing them - as if they had become too distant to see without any equipment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was just flipping through channels but stopped dead when I saw an artist&#39;s rendering of what appeared to be a trianglar craft with several lights on it. I also saw footage of the Phoenix Lights. My friend and I were driving to his house some night in the middle of July when we saw a flying object much like the Phoenix lights. I made a comment on how strange it looked and how low it was flying. We slowed down and watched the lights until they were out of sight and then almost instantly forgot about them. Both of us don&#39;t actually believe in UFO&#39;s so it was easy to put out of our minds. But tonight when I saw that show it made me wonder. I am serious when I say that I was absolutely stunned to see on TV, what I saw that night about half a month ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Suddenly the orange light flashed yellow and a craft appeared in its place. the object proceeded to the west and changed course to the south sharply and had no sound. The object was less than a half of a mile away and was only about 1500ft overhead. Having served in the United States Navy of a period of years in Virginia and being exposed to many military aircraft, as well as having many years of experience as a amature astronomer, I had never witnessed any thing such as this. I was quick enough to grab my friend&#39;s cell phone and recorded 37 seconds of video.

It was made up of a large fireball type light and several smaller lights and left a trail for a second or so. I would guess by the detail that I could observe that it wasn&#39;t flying at too high an altitude. It travelled parallel with the ground and took approx. 2 seconds to travel from where I observed it to out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was white, cigar shaped, silent and seemed to glow. I looked at it for maybe 30 seconds and decided it could probably be a blimp, but I ran inside to get my camera anyway. It took no longer that 20 seconds to get back out with my camera and it was gone. I spent several minutes looking for it, because I thought it couldn&#39;t have gone that far, but I never saw it again. Just as I was going back inside two helicopters from Kirtland AFB took off in the direction it had been going. I also noticed some very high jets flying in that direction. I have no clue what it was, but I watch planes fly over all day and it wasn&#39;t a plane, it was also too damn big to be a bird. It could have been a dirigible, but if so it was a very fast moving one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The one picture has a strange object in the sky above the house. When I looked at it the first time I never thought anything about it. I thought maybe it was on the lens, but none of the rest of the pictures taken at the same time have that object in them. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s anything, but you can look at the photo and the others taken at the same time and decide for yourself.

I make it a habit to turn all of the outdoor lighting off for better viewing with my telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event began at 3:30 am in Montgomery, Alabama with a single, low altitude object arriving from the northwest and becoming stationary. I immediately realized the craft was not a plane, helicopter or anything I recognized because of it&#39;s coloration and behavior. Minutes later, other objects began to eminate from the first object in all directions at different intervals. All of the other objects were similar in shape and light features to the first object, just smaller. Then the show began.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects in total were too numerous to count and performed spectacular aerial manuevers for two solid hours. My wife, who also witnessed the event, and I were exhilerated beyond description. Neither of us have ever witnessed such a massive UFO event before and I can assure you that we were completely mesmerized. We simply sat down on the ground and watched in total awe the magnificent display that was occuring right in our own backyard! We did not lose sight of the objects until the sun rose, and only then because they just seemed to &#34;fade away&#34;!<n>

Have seen bright meteors in the past - but am sure this was not one. There was no streak, and the light was maintained in intensity throughout and the colour was very distinct. Could not judge height, nor distance from object, but it seemed to be moving well above the speed of sound. Even though the night is clear, there are no stars visible due to being in a built-up area. Due to profession (air traffic controller working on Approach at London Gatwick) I was able to phone to see if anything was picked up on radar - which proved negative. Cannot say more - apart from the fact that I instinctively feel that the light was something very out-of-the-ordinary (however, I do not believe in alien visitors) and is the first time I&#39;ve ever seen such a thing. It is something I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was dark (10:08 pm), when suddenly, just to the left we saw a very bright set of multiple lights ahead of us.  They had suddenly appeared out of nowhere and were very large, guessing approximately 6 blocks above.  The lights were shaped in a curved like boomerang or curved triangle shape.  We could not see an object because of the darkness, but these lights very clearly were outlining something. The lights seemed to glide slowly to the right, as if the object was moving very slowly.  The distance was much, much lower than an airplane would fly, yet, still off the ground some distance.  The lights were white, but my afterthought recollection remembers some hue of orange.  The lights appeared to suddenly begin to fade away as the group of lights in unison, tilted to the right, and amazingly, it was gone as fast as it appeared, it seemed to simply fade away.  We kept looking, thinking that it had to still be there, but could not see a thing. After it disappeared, we realized there were several star-like lights, much smaller, moving very quickly, higher up in the sky in a tight circular pattern. Very shortly, we came to a train crossing by a small dirt road on our left &amp; pulled off the road and got out of our vehicle.  We heard multiple jet noises and realized that these 5 star-like objects which were moving very fast, were fighter jets, as we watched them for several minutes.  They  kept circling above, just to the left, where we saw the object, at a much lower altitude. My husband and I both agree that we have never seen anything like this before.  The whole experience as short as it was, is very incredible.  I called the Wood Co. sherrifs department when we got home about 30 minutes later, to tell them about the episode.  They said they had not received any other reports.  I am interested to see if anyone else experienced what my husband and I saw. Wow!<n>

My son joined me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never saw the animal, but started looking up at the night sky.  It was clear and the stars were bright.  There was a waning moon rising.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two other objects caught our attention.  One seemed to hover over the south end of the range and the other, off to the left, appeared to be over the central part of the Wind River Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance  they both looked like stars or planets.  However, both &#34;danced&#34; around a bit, entirely unlike every thing else in the night sky.  These two lights did not act like airplanes.  And the Mountains over which these appeared are over 13,000 feet above sea level, so it was doubtful they where helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound except the nearby stream and occasional sounds of wildlife moving around in the willows down by the bridge.  The two odd lights both rapidly changed color; red to blue, to white, to ornge, over and over in very short repetitions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, weeks later, I can&#39;t be sure what order the colors appeared in.  But it was very strange.  We watched for about half an hour, until we just got too tired.  We had a big day hike planned for later that morning, and needed to get some sleep.  I thought it was a curious coincidence that we had been told the day before that there were no motel rooms available in nearby Pinedale, Wyoming, because of a U.S. Air Force conference taking place there that week.  I have no idea what it was we saw, but my first guess would be some experimental man made aircraft.

These lights then appeared to follow hin into his bedroom becoming blue and green rays? He then blinked to ensure he was awake got pretty frightened and ran into my room, I followed him back and looked out of the window also but there was nothing there. My son then left the light on all night I asked him if it was possible he may have been dreaming but he asured me the noise woke him up and he was wide awake?

It is just strange.

And then suddenly out of nowhere this strange light appeared to come down from the trail and appear just below it. The light then appeared to get brighter and I could make out the object I was seeing was orange in colour and then the strange light went upwards and it could no longer be seen but I am sure it was still there. I kept on seeing little flashes across the sky and at some points I could see objects flying around and at one point I even noticed the object was in the actual trail of the plane. I am positive it was not a Plane, Helicopter, Satellite or Flare I have seen all four of these and this object looked nothing like any of them for one Planes and Helicopters cannot move in those amazing ways neither can flares or satellites.

Moved awkwardly up and down as it traveled across the sky...Like a fireball at one point then suddenly moves<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first there was just one bright light that closly resembled a planet that was really close though and more of an orangy color than a white color. Suddenly after being still for a few minutes the object moved backwards quickly, did a circle, moved to the left and started to become more distant. The object moved away awkwardly. It was moving up and down. Really weird. Later, we saw 5 of them they were further away then the one seen before. They were all on the same side of the sky, as well. THey resembled stars even more. They were still for a bit then one by one or two at a time they started moving away to the right, all in the same direction. As they moved they did not travel straight they moved up and down slightly as the one before did as well. These objects were definitely not planes, because there were planes in the sky and they moved and looked very different. Plus, planes do not move up and down and do weird loop-d-loop things, nor do they stand still for a few minutes then move rapidly away. I swear this is true I am not even one to totally believe in UFO&#39;s. It was so weird. Oh and at one point it was like a fireball, and was stationary, then suddenly would start moving away and didn&#39;t look like a fireball anymore but more like a plane, but obviously different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The first object appeared very high in the western sky and looked to be a test missle (Im assuming) of some sort...two more of these were seen some time later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really caught our eye was the triangular shaped craft with three large lights...one in the center and one at each of the tips of the &#39;wings&#39;.  This object came VERY close to the ground and &#39;disappeared&#39; and reappeared several times while making some rather acrobatic movements.  This was unlike any plane Ive ever witnessed and cropdusters do NOT make these sort of movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later a bright blue single light came across from the hills in the West at a VERY high rate of speed to east ultimately out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure what they are testing in those hills...but these were some very strange phenomena.<n>

It`s forward speed, however, seemed inconsistent with that of a ball of lightning.  It seemed too slow to be lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The forward movement was in a straight trajectory and even, not erratic as one might expect from lighting.  It somewhat resembled a searchlight spot but, again, movement and rate of speed seemed inconsistent with that type of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Searchlights usually occur repeatedly over periods of time. This ball of light was a one-time occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orbs color was white. Blowing sand, dust and some precipitation at the time may have made a clear view of the object impossible.  Hence, any features were indefinable.<n>

We saw a light just above the horizon where the sun was coming up...there were no stars in the sky because the sun was rising, but this stayed visable, so we examined it for a while...we kept seeing multiple flashes around the area of the light, so we continued to watch and see what was going on...after about 30 mins i saw what i would say was a wave of energy come from the light, it was in the shape of an arch and was colorfull, and i felt that something big was happening, for a few second i actually feard for my life...just after this small burst i saw multiple objects shaped like J&#39;s turned 90 degrees to the right, coming from the direction of the light...they appeared very small from where we were, but they were within the atmosphere...we watched as they went in seperate directions across the sky...after we could no longer see the small objects, we continued watching the light... after a few minutes, the objects returned from the direction they had gone in and were heading towards the light...after a minute, we no longer saw the objects and the light began to fade until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore...ever since this event occured about 17 hours ago, the sky has felt much more occupied than before, i can&#39;t shake the fealing that w/e i saw is still present...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was blinking red and green lights very brightly.  We found it strange and continued watching.  We noticed that there were many more (apprx 6 others) flying at farther distances all going in different directions.  We could tell they were moving incredibly quickly because there was a normal plane in the sky and the strange blinking crafts flew straight past it (we thought they were going to crash) and was out of our sight range in a matter of seconds.  There was even one or two large crafts (flying low and quickly) that had a strobe light effect and were incredibly bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are sure about what we saw and we found it very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I decided to sit down at a bench to answer my cell phone. after the call, I looked to the sky, and I saw a bright yellow light, It had come closer and closer until it slid out of clear view behind a tree. The light turned blue, the next thing I remember is waking up 23 minutes later in the middle of the field with a brown blister on the back of my hand inbetween my index finger knuckle and my thumb. I woke up about 30 yards from where i was sitting at the bench. Before I had become unconcious I had taken a picture of the light. Although it was the camera on my phone and its a real poor shot. You can see the yellow light behind the tree. Where the yellow light is, there is no street light or any lamp. I have also taken a picture of the blister after it had popped.

Mine was on 7/16/06.  Perfectly circular object, slivery with kind of glowing quality.  I though I was looking at the bottom of a disk.  Bright sunny day with this thing sitting next to a cloud.

I was outdoors by our condo swimming pool.  I looked up an next to a cloud saw a silvery, circular object.  Perfectly circle.  I was looking up directly almost and was seeing the bottom of whatever I was looking at.  It was about the size of an erasure on the end of a pencil.  It was shinny and circular.  I could not see the top.  I assume it was pretty high up.  I live by the lake michigan close to Cubs park.  Aircraft to Ohare airport frequently pass through this location, approximately, when landing.  I shifted position in my lounge to be more comfortable, looked up and it was gone.  Don&#39;t know if it was a weather balloon, satellite, ufo disk or what. Occasionally I see balloons floating at low altitudes from here, after they have been lost.

As the object came closer, never asending nor decending and keeping its pace of what would be considered a casual stroll, the appearance became more detailed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 50 feet overhead, traveling above the the telephone lines that run paralel with my street when I had a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound, infact I experienced silence, not even any sounds of the chirps and bird songs usually heard in my neighborhood on normal occasions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was rectangular with rounded edges. It seemed like various cubes stacked on one another with rounded edges forming a long rectangle. The size seemed to be aprox. 10-12 ft. tall x 5-6 ft. wide. Its exterior was clear opaque with a tinge of color like natural sinew. Inside the object a liquid looking substance that was blood red in color seemed to be circulating within, but only circulating within the object through its center keeping aprox. 2 ft. parameter within. The texture appeared to be like a latex form. The bottom of the object formed 4 bulbous cubes where the red substance seemed to be in four different sections. I stood in amazement and watched it travel in the southern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overall, the time duration from when I first noticed the object till it traveled into the horizon was about 1/2 an hour. As the object traveled into the horizon it  appeared to have an aura.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen many unusual objects in my life but this was by far the most unusual thing I&#39;ve ever witnessed, it was beautiful! My occupation is in the preventative health field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see unusual objects in the sky from time to time and it has been a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To the best of my knowled|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61039.html|223|ndxe200607| ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the source of the reports below re-submit them individually.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I myself have not seen a UFO, members of my family and friends have had various types of sightings.  To the best of my knowledge, only one has ever been reported (July 2006 in Virginia).  I feel that perhaps some of these stories may be helpful in collaborating other sightings.  All of these individuals are down to earth, honest, and intelligent, and have no reason to fabricate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The July 2006 sighting that my son’s half sister and her boyfriend reported:  They saw an extremely large triangular shaped object over her boyfriend’s rural home in Virginia.  It moved slowly, also with no noise.  It was in the evening and had lights. They watched it for several minutes and when it seemed to notice them, it shone a light over them.  They were also completely frightened by it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following is a list of other sightings; exact dates are unknown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early 60’s – my sister and brother drove over a hill on a farm road outside Dell City, Texas, and stopped when they found gigantic tumbleweed blocking the road.  As they were trying to decide if they could go around it, it suddenly lifted noiselessly off the ground and slowly rose straight up, then shot across the sky.  It happened in broad daylight, they were very frightened by it, and their story has never changed over the years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1995 – a niece and nephew spotted an extremely large triangular object moving slowly over Las Cruces, NM, and followed it for some time.  It appeared to follow the Rio Grande River, moving from south to north.  It was nighttime, was lighted around the perimeter, and had a low hum.  They also noted several military helicopters in the area that also appeared to be following it.  My nephew is now an English professor at the DABCC of New Mexico State University.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early 80’s – a good friend who was living on a ranch outside Tatum, NM told me of seeing an extremely large object over their ranch home.  It occurred around dusk, and her teenage daughter and two of her teenage girlfriends also saw it.  As it was told to me, the daughter and a friend were sitting outside waiting for another girlfriend to arrive when the object suddenly came over a nearby hill and hovered over their home.  The girls ran in and told the mother (my friend) who was on the phone with her husband.  My friend told her husband to hold on, and put the phone down while they all went outside to look at it.  As the other girlfriend’s approaching car became visible in the distance, the object suddenly sped over to the car and followed it to the house.  The girls were completely hysterical and as they watched, the object suddenly went straight up and across the sky.  It had some lights and moved noiselessly.  When my friend told my husband and I this story, her husband confirmed it, as he had heard them all screaming while he was holding on the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1998 – another one of my four sisters also encountered something mysterious, possibly a UFO.  She was driving on Interstate 25, from her home just north of Las Cruces, NM to the university for a class she was taking when she noticed a small blue ball flying alongside her car.  At first she thought it was a reflection, but then it started to move around her car.  It continued to follow her car for some distance and it freaked her out completely.  When she got off the Interstate ramp at the University she drove straight to another sister’s home a few blocks away.  This other sister confirms her story and says it took a long time to calm her down.  She and her husband had to drive her home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> August – 2007   My son, who is 36 and a schoolteacher, and his mother-in-law both saw what they describe as a “large invisible object” cross the early evening sky.  They noticed this invisible object because it blocked out the emerging stars as it crossed the sky.  As it moved slowly and noiselessly across the sky, they could note the triangular shape.  They also noted some military helicopters in the area right after the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also have a cousin who is a missile guidance engineer at White Sands Missile Range who has told me on that he has been present on several occasions when pilots have returned from flights and reported seeing UFO’s.  On these occasions, if any photos or videos were taken, there is always a group of government personnel (unknown dept.) who show up and confiscate the photos or video.<n>

I have noticed on numerous occasions (pretty much every night so far this summer) a light that when you first notice it looks just like a star but is moving, so I always assume it&#39;s a satellite but it acts differently than the hundreds of satellites I see every clear evening, I&#39;ve counted with my wife 15 of them in a 20 minute period going in every direction you can think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This star/satellite seems to increase it&#39;s light intensity 20X so that it becomes larger than any planet one can see from the earth and extremely bright, I&#39;ve noticed others reporting the same type of object and I am stumped to identify what exactly it is but once it has intensified it slowly starts to loose illumination and finally will just disappear within a couple of degrees of travel, normally I can follow a satellite for 90-120 degrees with no variation in how it looks.  To try and let you know where I see it most often is west of didsbury at about 30 degrees but I have seen them farther east at about 100 degrees as well.  We even witnessed one that was very large (instead of a pin sized light it was about the size of my pinky nail holding my arm outstretched.) that flashed in varying frequencies flying to the south heading east not intermittent like airplane flashers but more irregular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I encourage anyone reviewing this residing in the same area to watch the western sky as well as I mentioned it seems I see it/them every clear night I go out and look.  Would love to find out what it is or get some explanation of what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were mainly white but changed to blue and to green over a period of thirty seconds. I tried timing them mentally to predict what color would come next, however there was no logical order to the color pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my two friends onto the deck to confirm what I was seeing and after approximately twenty minutes two more lights appeared. It appeared as if one of the larger objects was emitting the smaller objects, which also resembled the same shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects slowly rotated around each other in a clockwise motion. One of the objects moved farther away from the others into the West of the sky. The movement was not smooth, rather sporadic. Eventually it returned to its orbiting formation with the other crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After roughly forty-five minutes I began to get tired and had smoked nearly a pack of cigarettes watching this scene. One or two of the crafts got too far away to view any longer and I went to sleep. At a family dinner with my aunts, uncles, and cousins I mentioned seeing the lights. They said they saw the same thing and were puzzled by it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked down to configure my camera on the settings I wanted it on and then turned it off I then looked up to see a light that was brighter than anything else in the sky.  I compared the light to stars in the area and also a plane that I had seen moments before and it was way brighter than anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then got even brighter than in initially was to begin with and slowly started to move to the right. I began to get my camera ready when the light slowly began to dim out until it disappeared into seemingly nowhere. I looked around the area but could see absolutely nothing else in the area the only things I could see were stars in the sky and nothing else.  It was a very weird encounter and reminded me of the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; that have been seen over Arizona State, USA for many years now.  But my eventful night was not over just yet, at 5 minutes past midnight I looked up at the sky this time in the opposite direction of the first light this light was much different to the bright one this light was quite dim and looked like an ordinary star but the difference was the object was moving very slowly across the sky I estimate at around 3MPH the object was very small and I got my video camera ready but the light was just not bright enough and I could not see the light in the viewfinder and then the light just disappeared and could no longer be seen. At this point I was getting tired so I ended my sky watch feeling very happy that I had seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((e-address deleted))<n>

Over the Ontario side of the St. Clair River.  It was very bright almost like a jet with it&#39;s landing lights on and sort of moving towards us in the heavens.  All 4 of us saw it as it was very bright for about 4 seconds and moved south as if the speed of a satellite.  It then continued and got dim (like a satellite) about 5 seconds later, it appeared to break into two different satellite like lights and moved in 2 different directions at satellite speeds.  The two objects then moved out of view traveling two different directions to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Shape could not be recognized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A single object with pulsating green lights (as described above) was visible traveling approximately 025 degrees true, (compared against the position of Polaris with the chair of Cassiopeia in the North-east sky), followed in less than a minute by two more identical objects in rough trailing formation. The last two objects were visible for three minutes through binoculars over a hill with an estimated topographic crest of 200 feet above base terrain. Estimated speed of 24,000 feet per minute when the course was measured against a satellite image of the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the next hour and a half solid green intense single points of lights were visible, having the color and intensity of an emerald laser or targeting laser of Russian design moving in an approximate arc from Southeast to Northeast, but these did not appear attached to a solid object as the first three objects and on occasion emitted an aura or laser-like luminescence that rotated or changed relative position to the point of light intensity. The speed of these lights appeared slower than the first three objects, but altitude, distance and speed were difficult to estimate. All appeared height above the high terrain to be approximately 5-6 inches when measured at arms length. All solid lights appeared remarkably in the same airspace (course and altitude) over the duration of their individual observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of the objects or lights produced audible sound, were devoid of conventional aircraft running lights, and were radically different in appearance from aircraft, satellites, meteors and other normal night sky occurrences visible that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Air Temperature: Approximately 75 F.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cieling and Visibility Unlimited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lightning visible in the distant northern sky near midnight.<n>

My girlfriend and I were traveling on US Rt. 50 heading east from Parkersburg to Clarksburg.  We were passing through (around) Salem when I noticed a large triangular-shaped object in the sky just above the horizon.  At first I thought it was an oil-rig on top of the ridge (a common sighting in WV), or a cell phone tower, but I had made that particular drive hundreds of times and felt as if something was unusual, so I dismissed both of those notions.  I woke my girlfriend and asked her if she recognized the object in front of us; she didn&#39;t.  The object was vertical, at first, with bright red lights in each corner.  Immediately after waking my girlfriend an extremely bright white light came on in the middle of the object, seemed to make a sweeping motion, and eventually &#34;highlighted&#34; us for a brief period of time.  This made both of us nervous, but not particularly scared.  I had to look down at the road and when I looked back up it was floating horizontally above us.  When I looked down at the road again and back up it had disappeared.  The object never seemed to move while I was looking at it, nor did it make any sounds.  I originally thought it was a helicopter but dimissed the notion when I realized it had to have been within 100ft. of us and not making any sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my girlfriend and I were fascinated with the unusual sighting and had thought about calling the regional airport in Clarksburg to see if there were any aircraft in the area at the time.  We never did and never really talked about it the remainder of the time we dated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I probably wouldn&#39;t have really thought about it much more until I watched a UFO special on TV sometime in 2001.  They were discussing a case and had an artist&#39;s rendering and animation of the exact same object that I had seen.  Since then I&#39;ve told the story to some people, always siting what I saw on the television special.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The sky was very dark, and we had a nice view of the Milky Way.  Cassiopeia was clearly visible, although it was very difficult to make out Andromeda, due to its closeness to the horizon, and the lights of Champaign.  As I was walking the dogs, I noticed a white light go on then off in Cassiopeia, about ½ way between the two stars that form the wide “top” portion of the “W”.  At first I thought I had seen a lightning bug (firefly), so I kept watching to see if it happened again: it did.  This time it was a little further south, but still, keeping parallel to the Cassiopeia “W”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light would come on for about ¼-1/2 second, then go out.  It was not a quick on/off, but there was some ramping up and down of the amplitude.  It almost seemed as though it was rotating or something.  The on/off nature reminded me of a lightning bug, but it clearly was not that since it maintained a very consistent path in the sky relative to Cassiopeia, even though we moved about ¼ mile during our observations.  It “flashed” about 8 times or so before stopping.  We estimate it was traveling about 1 to 2 degrees per minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a mechanical engineer, and my wife is a student of veterinary medicine.<n>

We have camped at this location, an abandoned mine shaft, many times over several years.  We used to spend entire weekends up here and around most of the mountains in the silver valley exploring old buildings, mines, and hiking into the forest to find untouched ruins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a day of exploration we settled at the campsite which is a large flat area out of a steep hillside created by the removal of waste rock from the adjacent mine shaft.  It has a view and we have traditionally shot clays over the edge because of the drastic drop off.  So we had a campfire, beers, dinner, music and just waiting for the stars to shine for a few hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10pm or so, it is almost completely dark and I noticed a light glowing on the hillside across the valley or draw.   It was small but bright and amber in color.  It appeared to be near the ground or in the trees.  It did not light up the ground or the trees, it did not move, it made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat and reasoned about what it could be.  I am very familiar with the area and there are no roads or even trails on that side of the valley.  The hillside is quite steep with tall trees and loose talus, making a camp spot unlikely.  I also think we would have noticed people over there during the daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to get a closer look with a rifle scope but my scope was not strong enough.  I did not shoot at the light for fear it was people or something more dangerous.  My brother, friend, and I were very spooked and decided to retire to the tent and sleep with our small arms for the illusion of safety.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up early before sunrise to pee and the light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, there was no trace of anything across the draw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We discussed the situation for hours the next day with no decent explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will try to find a picture of the area where the light was seen, again, we have been to this spot at least 10 times over the years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

From about 45 degrees south way higher than airplanes can fly, about satellite altitude this white light that looked like a satellite came out of no where and moved so fast north it could not have been a satellite.  From south 45degrees to north 45degrees in about 7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything move that fast before. No tail, just a white light about the size of a star moving at incredible speeds.

While looking and pointing excitedly at the all these dots of lights, i also noticed an airplan crossing in front of these group of lights,it appeared to be high enough that one could not discern the kind of plan it was except that it was metalic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, about ten minuts past since i first notice the first light, my neck and my eyes were strained and i had to go into the restaurant (because the lunch buffet was closing at 3pm, which was in a few more minuts). After serving and placing my food on the table, i went back out and notice that the original light was still moving slowly to my right away from the group and was relatively about five times larger and brighter than the other lights. After a minute or two, it appeared to stop moving, and again i had to go back into the restaurant, figuring, that i will finish my lunch and go back to keep track at these strange light formation, but about five minuts later when i was out again, there was nothing in the sky other than the usual low flying private plans.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It,the craft, stayed with us observing us as we observed it for about 3 minutes then it scared a deer from the corn rows before going on behind us once again as a small blue light. We were going 60-65mph at the time and it stayed with us. The craft made no noise, was oval in shape, what i call bright pepsi can blue in color and had a white flashing light on one end. I was continually able to watch it and was not afraid of it at all! In fact I was facinated with it!<n>

Suddenly I saw a bright light outside a window.  I looked out it and saw three lights that moved at the same time and rate.  The lights were in a triangle.  A light in the middle of the three lights, that couldn&#39;t be seen before, flashed red while the others turned off.  Then the red light shut off and the others lights turned back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft appeared to freak out when it flashed the red light because it began going back and forth at extraordinary speeds very recklessly.  It then seemed to control its self because its movements were more orderly.  It went north, then south, and then north, and sped off at speeds that must have exseeded 100MPH south, past the horizon.<n>

At first I thought it was a long airliner, but noticed it had no wings, nor upright tail fin. Trying my best to keep my eye on it, I pulled over and searched (with my hands) for my cell phone/camera.. Just after pulling over the object vanished. I got out of the vehicle and seached the sky and never located the object again. The total duration of the sighting was 1-2 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very high up in the sky clearly in space, it was silent, and it very much left me with the impression that it had taken a picture.  The iris portion of the shpae it had taken from the white image it first appeared in was a warm yellow while the green lines were cool and unearthly in appearance.  I cannot explain it, it happened sometime roughly around 11:30pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were laying on top of my car, and I noticed 3 different colored flashing lights in the sky. At first I thought it was a plane, but as I&#39;m watching, I notice it&#39;s not moving like a plane. I nudge my friend and asks if he sees what I&#39;m seeing. Then, it starts circling the area of sky it was above, and slowly makes it&#39;s way to the right in the duration of the two hours we were there. At this time, we&#39;re all watching it. Eventually it starts to fly off away from us; or so I&#39;m assuming, it started getting dimmer and dimmer. I look for more, and saw another with the same attributes as the first, only farther away in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We go out again the next night, and see two more out there. I don&#39;t know what else it could have been, because it definately was not a star.

(About 4 miles south of Harpers Ferry IA and a few miles north of Effigy Mounds Natioal Monument). I went out to the porch outside to talk on my cell phone. At the time it was about 10 P.M. and I was facing eastward toward the Mississippi River. While talking on the phone, noticed a light near the cabin directly to the right of me. I saw it with the corner of my eye; it caught my attention enough so I turn my head to look. I then saw nothing; I figured that it was just an individual with a flashlight. I continued talking on the phone like nothing had occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10:30ish, a half hour later, I am still talking on the phone when I noticed a light again with the right corner of my eye. This time around when I turned to look, I saw a bluish-white light about the size of a basketball or a large flashlight. It was about 2 feet off the ground and moved to the right side of the cabin out of my sight. At this time I figured for sure that it was someone with a flashlight but there was no noise of gravel from footsteps or sounds of any kind during or after, just the sounds of insects and other bugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An hour later I was done talking on the phone but was eating a snack on the porch, mainly looking at the night’s sky. No manmade lights to distract from the star light, a great night to stargaze. I was getting done with my snack and was cold so I was about to head inside for the night when the main event occurred! I saw the same bluish-white light across the Mississippi River at a small island a few hundred yards away. It was moving in a straight line southward a few feet off the ground. It was moving about as fast as a car and that’s what I first thought it was till I realized that no roads existed on the small island. It stopped immediately then came back northward on the same trajectory. During this time I was thinking it was an ATV or some other motorized vehicle of that sort. It made no noise and did not change shape or brightness. It moved over the River and moved westward toward my direction (I am sitting at about 150 yards away) and then moved southward down river at the same speed and same height above surface. I then knew this was a UFO of some sort and it seemed to be flying over the surface in a grid like formation. I was no longer sitting in the porch chair and was now standing scared. I said to myself if this thing gets any closer, I was going to run inside. It then moved northward aging still flying at the same lined trajectory and stopped, it came toward my direction even closer. I ran inside as fast as I could not a look back and hid in the cabin trailer of my grandparents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following night at about 11pm Saturday, I went outside on the porch with my mother. As soon as we got outside she was the one who pointed out and asked me about an object that was hovering a few feet off the waters surface. I looked at the object and it was the same bluish-white basketball sized object! It was flying downstream on the Mississippi River and we stood watching it till it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As of 3/27/2008, I have not seen it again or anything else like it.<n>

This was a triangular shaped craft approx 500-1000 feet off of the ground traveling from the west to the east at a slow rate of speed.  Craft was not large. perhaps the size of average airliner.  Visibility was clear and there were numerous other aircraft flying at what would have appeared to be higher altitudes.   The car was running so unable to determine if this was a silent craft.  Craft had a row of 4 lights on what would appear to have been the aft end, with 2 in the center and 1 on the leading edge.  There were no navigational lights visible.  The &#34;aft&#34; row of lights were somewhat dim on what would be assumed to be the port side.  I have witnessed numerous phenomenon in the night sky from all sorts of atmospheric condiions including aurora, this was not any sort of aircraft I have ever seen before and I had a perfectly clear view of this craft<n>

It almost looked like the long side of an airplane when the sun shines on it but it wasn&#39;t.  It was over the ocean.  There were planes coming in and even flying below this object but the object was stationary for about 20 minutes when it was first noticed.  At one point it seemed like it was flying in the same direction, parallel to the plane but then it stopped.  It just stayed in place.  Afterwards it started to move south.  Still it was not moving as fast as the airplanes passing (en route to Newark or La Guardia).  It was also much higher than the airplanes because it only looked like a bright white line.  After a few minutes moving south it stopped again.  Then it became the shape of a ball.  A bright white ball and then started moving Northwest towards the beach.  Then when it was over land it looked like it had a long straight gray extension which didn&#39;t shine bright like the bright white ball shaped light it was attached to.  Maybe it was a satellite.  I don&#39;t know, but it was odd.  Also from the angle I was seeing this, it didn&#39;t look like it was at the same altitude as the airplanes because it was higher, looked smaller, and the planes sometimes passed below it.  This object didn&#39;t make any noise.  You could hear the planes approaching and if you didn&#39;t hear them, you could see the white trails behind.  The way this object followed, hovered,changed direction and made no noise just seemed odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Up ahead, an object &#34;hovered&#34; across the road in a diagonal fashion. Though I was tired I knew right away that it was NOT a car, as there were no crossroads where it came and went, just straight road. The object was slightly off the ground, and it was slowly rotating, displaying red blinking lights. It happened so quick I wondered if I was seeing things, but my boyfriend, who was wide awake and driving looked right back at me when i looked at him in awe. We both just knew it was nothing man made...when we passed the spot it had crossed, of course there was nothing to be seen there! We turned right at the next road (northbound)and low and behold all the way down at the end of the road we saw a blinking flash of red and then nothing. We are still in awe. I cannot believe that no one else saw this &#34;thing&#34;...Just now I read a report from MY SAME TOWN and that reporters statement sounds remarkably closs to what we saw!<n>

It floats straight up into the sky as though to reach the atmosphere by the time daylight rolls around. It is above the hollywood hills by griffith observatory.

We noticed a very bright star and notices a star off to the right or the bright one brilliantly sparkling. We were talking about how bright the colors were when it jumped to the right and left again. We looked at each other and my kids said cool. The light stopped sparkling and got bright white and a circle formed around it and it disappeared. My kids were dumbfounded standing there looking at me for an explanation. Two military helicopters flew down our valley and over the mountains were we viewed the object. Shortly after the choppers disappeared over the mountain another brilliantly flashing object flew silently overhead and veered away. We heard a jet coming and it altered course to chase the flashing object toward the east. We went to bed shortly after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

By my window there are no streets at all, and this was up in the sky.  I saw it go behind some trees, and I saw it fully again.  I rushed to the kitchen to get my camera phone, but I didn&#39;t look and the door was shut, so I ran into it.  I ran back to the window to see if it was still there, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD))<n>

The night was clear and commercial aircraft could occasionally be seen flying from east to west.   This orange light was at an altitude of approximately 35-40 degrees above the northern horizon and appeared to be moving from north to south...towards my location.  It flew slowly.   The light itself, however, seemed to pulse arhythmically.   The deviation in the intensity of the light wasn&#39;t extreme but was enough to catch my attention.   I noticed no navigation lights, no beacons, nothing one would expect to see with FAA-compliant aircraft.   The color of the moving light was an orangish-golden-amber.  About ten seconds after I began to closely observe the light, it disappeared at about 45-50 degrees elevation.   I looked closely for the aforementioned FAA-mandated lighting but could see nothing.   I also noticed no clouds in that particular portion of the sky which would&#39;ve obscured my view.   Approximately three seconds after it&#39;s disappearance, the light suddenly flared again to twice it&#39;s previous intensity, about 50 degrees elevation and still to my north.   The light seemed to be sitting in the sky, still pulsating arhythmically.   It sat for approximately five seconds before it began to move again southward, over my position.   Approximately 5 seconds after it&#39;s reappearance, it immediately shot to the west at an amazing speed and disappeared from sight.   The pulsations seemed to quicken and brighten just before it shot off to the west.   I did not see anything else out of the ordinary in the skies the following hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upon lighting up after a few seconds, they then converged symmetrically into one object, which seemed to fade away in the distance.

At first I thought it was a balloon but it was traveling too fast and too straight for a balloon, plus there was no wind blowing at all for it to be a balloon traveling that fast. I started thinking maybe it was just a rock formation of some sort floating through the sky because surely if it was an aircraft I would have seen some sort of light. It was very faint but I could barely pick it out with my vision and there is no doubt in my mind that it was moving. I called my wife but she couldn&#39;t hear me so I decided not to tell her afterall for she might think I was nuts. Plus when my focus returned to the object I could not longer find it in the dark sky. But soon after I saw another (I would say 10 minutes after). I chirped my friend on the Nextel and luckily he was on the line immediately. I chirped him because he is the type of guy who has a telescope for the stars and is all in to aircrafts and knows about Astronomy somewhat. I told him what I had seen and asked him to check the sky. Of course nothing else could be seen for a while until I seen another to the east of where I was at and I couldn&#39;t pinpoint the coordinates to him from my house in time for him to see it. Realize that after a minute or so it became lost in the haze of the darkness. I was trying to explain to him to where the object was in relation to certain bright stars but it was difficult to explain since I know nothing of Astronomy. I thought Orion was out and according to him the 3 stars I was looking at was not Orion so we were lost for a while. Until we established two points of reference in the sky the 3 stars which I thought was Orion was the secondpoint and the first point was the brightest star to the East with two faint stars which sort of formed a triangle. So time passed and eventually he had a couple of friends visit him and I could hear them in the background and then like at 10:30ish I saw another object, also traveling north that coincidently was crossing right by the first point of reference which we had established and that was the brightest star to the East of the second point of reference. This one however we both saw. I chirped him on the Nextel and asked him to look at the first reference point and apparently all the guys who were with him also looked up at that exact time and saw what I had been seeing, except this was the fourth one that I had seen and only their first. One of the other guys that was there said immediately that it was a satellite. And they unanimously agreed that it must have been a satellite but I still had my doubts. The fourth one did something different than the first 3. Since the fourth one passed right through my first point of reference (the brightest star)the object seemed to get brighter as it passed right by the point of reference. It seemed to reflect the brightness of that star and as it passed it the darkness began to swallow it up as it again grew fainter and fainter and finally disappeared. We then began a big discussion on satellites and the speed they travel and how many there are as if we knew what we were talking about and to make a long story short I still have my doubts because I could not Identify this object, thus making it a UFO for me. If you could identify it then I guess it will no longer be a UFO but the fact is I saw what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s it.

This happened 4 times over the span of about a half hour. Each time they seemed to get brighter.  Approximately 30 minutes later, we saw about 4-5 blinking white lights flying back and forth across the sky very eqi-distant and at a high speed.  They went back and forth across the sky at least twice.

This was around 10:15 p.m. and we set the chairs up to face out over the ocean to get a good view of the moon rising.   We sat there for several minutes observing the sky as it was a clear, cloudless night.   We carried on a casual conversation as we tried to identify constellations and planets, and two of us even caught a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, suddenly, around 10:30, I pointed up at the sky because a bright orange light had just appeared.  It was stationary for probably 5 seconds and then, almost like a firework, six more (though i&#39;m not sure it was exactly six) orange lights emerged from the first light.  In fact, my first reaction was that it was a firework.  However, the lights did not descend, but instead remained in a &#34;V-like&#34; formation for a few additional seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends and I immediately discussed whether it could be some strange firework, but came to the conclusion that it could not be for three reasons:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)  The small number of lights and their duration were unlike any firework we had ever seen;<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)  There was a firework show going on a few miles up the beach, and it was neither as bright nor did the tallest firework reach a quarter of the height of the orange lights; and<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)  The lights were directly over the ocean and would have had to been fired from the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then suggested that it was an airplane, but we didn&#39;t think it could be that.  Firstly, it didn&#39;t move or act like an airplane; the sudden movements and sudden appearance of lights were unlike any airplane I have seen before.  And secondly, airplanes have red, green, and white lights while this aircraft had a single, bright orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes of discussion, some of the lights suddenly appeared again, this time all at once and slightly south of their original position.  It did not appear, however, that the lights were all on the same shit as they seemed to move independantly, sometimes blinking and a few of them oscillating a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The final time we saw them was several more minutes later, much further down the beach.  They behaved in the same way, but appeared to have picked up speed.  They were only visible for a few seconds, and that was the last we saw of them.  The event has perplexed me as that same night I witnessed a shooting star, fireworks, a definite plane, and what we thought might even be a satelite- yet this was something completely different than any of those or anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps they were just fighter jets, but it didn&#39;t seem like it to me.  The unusual lights and the sporadic appearances have left me wondering what the source of these lights might have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this, the moon had risen and my friends didn&#39;t share the same interest in the lights as I did and do, so we left the beach, but since that point i have been looking for some explanation.<n>

It was stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then looked at it through a telescope, it was amazing!!!! It looked like a square inside a sphere, the sphre area looked as if it was spinning and casting off gold light . Inside was this square that looked  VERY machine-like. It looked almost like the surface of a giant computer chip , except that the lines and shapes inside were always moveing and changing. This was NOT a heavenly body or planet!!!! Then very slowly it began to rise, straight up, we continued to observe it  both through the telescope and with the naked eye. It took about an hour or so to just rise untill it looked as it it left the earths atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was nothing like i have seen before , it was very differeint and strange and I cant explain it.

I have looked at other reports on here , going back quite aways and there are a few other accounts that sem to describe the smae thing!!! It was also perfectly silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were travelling rather fast and at the exact same speed the entire time we saw them, one slightly below and behind the other.  The light went from similar to that of a star to very bright (resembling a spotlight) then gradually dimmer until we could no longer see them.  Almost as if the light was rotating very slowly.  When the light was brightest, it appeared to be vertically oblong in shape.  We waited to see if they appeared farther down the horizon, but they did not.  At the same time, airplanes were visible in other areas of the sky.  Since they looked nothing like the planes, we decided they must be UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/13/06 08:45|Christchurch (New Zealand)||Rectangle|20 seconds|Unidentified Object East Of Christchurch, New Zealand.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51369.html|285|ndxe200607| Unidentified Object East Of Christchurch, New Zealand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing on my parents’ outside deck last week (13th or 14th of July, 2006) at approximately 8:45 a.m. New Zealand time.  Unfortunately, I cannot be exact about the date because I was there on both days but it was definitely either the 13th or the 14th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents’ house is on a hill in Christchurch, a small city situated on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The house faces north but also affords excellent views to the east and part of the west due to the fact that it is built on a reasonably high cliff-face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had gone outside to have a cigarette when I noticed a moderately large sea bird gliding gracefully across the sky on an upward current of wind.  I mention this detail only because of what the observation led to.  The bird swooped up higher than I normally look and as I followed it with my eyes I noticed a strange and very small object very high in the eastern sky.  I was immediately intrigued due to the fact that in the 35 years I have stood on that outside deck I have never once seen an aircraft at either that height or position.  I have seen thousands of planes from that deck throughout my life.  Most travel in a broadly north or north-eastern direction as they travel up the coast and the ones that head south or west are usually obscured from view.  To see a plane in the eastern sky well off the eastern coast of the South Island of New Zealand is very unusual as there is basically nothing but the Pacific Ocean all the way to South America.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I have already mentioned, the object was very high in the sky; certainly higher than any plane I’ve ever seen.  In fact, I would never normally crane my neck back so severely if I hadn’t been watching the sea bird’s arc. I remember thinking to myself &#34;Is this a large object far away or a small object somewhat closer,&#34; and I felt without hesitation that it was the former. I have excellent eyesight and I am convinced that what I saw was neither a conventional aircraft nor a weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In shape, the object was rectangular more than anything and seemed to be slightly reflecting the morning sunlight as it moved upward and away. There was a thin layer of high cloud above and the object steadily climbed through it (or appeared to) and disappeared slowly over the course of around 20 seconds. It moved at a very gradual pace and had no other distinguishing characteristics. I must reiterate that the object was very small to the naked eye and that my gut feeling was that it was a very long way above me. The reflective nature of the object suggested to me that it may have been of metallic origin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to stress the unusual nature of this sighting. I have never seen anything like it in 35 years. My initial assumption was that it must have been the space shuttle but I have not been able to establish whether it would have been viewable at this time and date from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’d love to know what that strange object was!<n>

I looked to the west to see a clear, bright orangish white light in a stationary position above the tree line. It did not appear to be moving toward or away from me. I have previously lived near Willow Run and Detroit Metro airports and have not seen anything like this before. I could not hear any sound. I went to my basement to retrieve a fan as it was a warm night and is expected to be in the &#39;90&#39;s today. When I looked for the light again a couple of minutes later in the west and then in the east it was gone. I then wondered if this may be why my normally quiet inside dog was woofing last night?<n>

The sky was overcast and the moon, which seemed nearly full, was barely visible as a round circle and a glow through the clouds to the rear of my vehicle. The object was moving at a very high rate of speed from south to north. The object was visible as a bright light that was behind or in the clouds. I&#39;ve seen meteors/shooting stars before, but I don&#39;t think they would have been this visible through the cloud cover. The object itself was only visible as a glowing white light in the sky, due to the clouds I could see no shape except for the light itself which was circular in shape. There was a glow of light around the object that was nearly three to four times the size of the actual light itself, but I suspect that this was due to the clouds. The object did not change course or move from a straight line and I quickly lost sight of it as it went behind some trees that line the street. I only saw the object through the front windshield of my vehicle as I was driving, it started out near the middle of the left side of my windshield and moved to the upper right side of my windshield over the 5 seconds or so that I saw it. It was not any sort of reflection of a streetlight or anything like that on my windshield, it was clearly an object in or behind the clouds. I did not notice any change in brightness that would indicate if it was moving toward me or away from me. I quicly drove to a more open area near an industrial park next to Highway 101, which took me only about 15 seconds, but I was unable to regain a visual on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not on any regular flight path that I&#39;m aware of. Many flights into SFO fly past Redwood City, but they are closer to the bay and don&#39;t move nearly as fast or in the same diretion that this object did. I am hoping that maybe someone further north in San Mateo County or perhaps in the east bay (Oakland, Hayward, etc.) got a better view of this object since when I drove north there was hardly any cloud cover at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a bright orange light flying in a southeast direction coming from the west(the beach).  It didn’t make any noise, and did not resemble an airplane.  It just seemed to be floating by at a very steady pace.  I ran into the bedroom and looked out the window there, by this time I had called my husband to come look at the object.  That widow faces south. The object was still moving in a southeast direction.  A shooting star shot across the sky, and the orange light dimmed and faded away, it left a cloudy haze. It looked like a parachute came out of it.  It was dark and I could not see the color of the parachute, but it resembled a giant transparent jellyfish.  It slowly floated downward until I could no longer see it.  My husband saw the faded orange light and the giant jellyfish.  We figured it might have just been an aircraft since there is a naval base in that area.  As I researched what we witnessed, I found this site with similar sightings.  We both believe it was a UFO we saw last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I told the person driving to look out the window and he said it was an air plane because it had two small flashing lights and 3 big white lights in a trangular shape totaling about 50 feet wide. We slowed down on top of the bridge and it was 200 yards away from us just sitting above the block below the bridge it was so low, we rolled down the window to hear noise to see if it was a helicopter or an airplane and it was silent outside. If it was a helicopter or an airplane we would have heard a noise because helicopters fly over my house all the time to get to the hospital. Once we got off the bridge we took the first left to turn around the block to get a better look at it... but in seconds it started to move and get lower but it was gliding through the air away from us. we were trying to catch up to it but it was so far away, we thought it was going to crash into the local grocery store it was so low. Once it started moving it turned off the white lights and had left on the two red lights...but the red lights weren&#39;t flashing like an airplanes. There is a local airport over that way, but after it glided over the grocery store it just disappeared into thin air it was gone, it was like it crashed into the bay or something like that. The event probably lasted no longer then 45 seconds but we dont know how long the object had been floating over that city block. It was just so weird how it disappeared, we went out to the airport and no plane had recently landed either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was freaky sleeping afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> **NOTE: We didn&#39;t see all six UFOs at once.**  At about 10:45, I sent my younger cousin downstairs to ask his mother if we could go outside to watch for UFOs. We&#39;ve seen them before while looking up into the night sky, so why not look again? Anyway, she said no at first. So we just sat on the bed, then the twins were acting up and the mother was angry. She was trying to get them to bed, since they were only six years old. I finally talked her into letting us go outside. So we sat on the chairs outside at about 11:00 PM. We sat there looking up for a while. We were talking about dreams about aliens and UFOs and the such. About the Roswell incident, about the government and them making deals with aliens. Suddenly, my older cousin sees a white, round light moving in the sky. I would&#39;ve thought it was just a plane or something like that, but it wasn&#39;t making any noise. Nor was it blinking. We just sat there looking at it move across the sky. Then all of a sudden, it disappeared! We didn&#39;t see anything after that, so we went over to another spot. Then, one of the freakiest things happened; We saw 5 of the same lights moving. They were a bit dull, but were still visible. They were moving, shifting directions, passing each other up... real freaky stuff. Then, it gets freakier, they all disappear. Not all at the same time, but they do. We can&#39;t see anything after that, so we sit down and talk about aliens and UFOs and stuff. And then my older cousin said something that freaked the hell out of me: People who see UFOs have a much bigger chance of getting abducted than someone who haven&#39;t seen one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first we thought it was the trail from a jet, but the line didn&#39;t move, it seemed to get smaller at first and then got larger again. It seemed to change direction, first moving straigh across, then down and then up, but never changing position in the sky. About five minutes later we noticed another similar light which acted in a similar way fairly close to the other one- too close to be an ordinary aircraft. This lasted for about 30 minutes - never changing position in the sky. Never seen anything like it.!<n>

I Was on Vacation at panama city beach with my Girlfriend,Dad, and Sister. As i was looking in the sky with my Girlfriend on The back porch I noticed a Flashing light in the Sky out toward sea that was flashing red,white, and blue. I told my Girlfriend&#34;hey look up in the sky right their&#34; as she did she gave me a look like is that what i think it is. Then i told my father(a little inebreated)look at that in the sky flashing. He looked into the sky and said oh that&#39;s probably a meteor Andrew( the ship was going down). Then the ship started to move up in the air and he said&#34; now it&#39;s moving up&#34;. He continued to say their was a air base near by and it was probably a plane. About 10 minutes later after seing the Ship move left to right and up and down he agreed that this was no man made craft unless it was top of the line secret projects. Not to long from then we noticed more space craft in the area spread all over. In all i saw about 9 Ship&#39;s at one time over the beach. Some were alone and others at a glips you could mistake for a constelation because of their grouping. The next day At about 9:30 pm we all went outside ( including my sister)to look to see if the Ship&#39;s were still their. Sure enough their was all the same events taking place. This continued every night until We left from our Vacation on july the 16th. One night my Girlfriend went to bed early so I went Outside because of my curiousity of these ship&#39;s. I thought to my self they have to leave at some point, so i decided to stay outside until then. I was outside for about 3 Hours and I noticed that less and less were outside(1:30 am) so i kept my eye one until about 2:00 am and it started to get less visible because it was moving back I guess. Eventually I could barely see the Ship and it shot up into the air at a 90 degree angle and then at a 45 degree angle out into space at what i assume was at the speed of ! light. T his is all the information i have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

She noticed a Black circular object and pointed it out to me saying &#34;what is that&#34;. I looked and couldnt tell either. The object appeared to be very high in altitude and was traveling south to north fairly slow. We both watched it for about 5 minutes as it got closer until it finnally was over her roof and we lost sight of it. She lives in a very populated part of Tampa Florida and there is alot of airplane traffic around her place. However, as we both watched I said there is no way that is a plane or a helicopter it was Just a Black Circular object. about 10 minutes later we went outside and saw a real plane. Seeing a real plane fly over definitly made me believe the object we saw was NOT an ordinary aircraft.

The object appeard to be blue - small - and very high.  What attracted my attention was the fact that the object was not showing signs of a commercial craft as it was not on the normal course that commercial flights take into Philladelphia, the blue light was not pulsating but was instead constant.  Also, at one point in it&#39;s progress, the object stopped and remained unmoving for a period of perhaps 8 - 10 seconds before continuing.  Soon after, it could no longer be seen, I assume due to the presence of pollution in the air or indirect light sources on the ground. I would just like to know what this object was / is.  I have not seen anything like this since I was a kid watching for Sputnick in the late 50&#39;s.  I never watch the sky, have little interest in stars and the only reason I was watching tonight was because I heard that meteor showers could perhaps be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a bright formation in the sky with bright colors. His firend said  he saw an object come from a distance in the sky. It moved forward quickly, then moved in another direction then it was gone. Leaving behing a very weird shape and colors. During all of this, I had went back into the house to get the kids, so they could see this amazing sight!! My husband and his friend left for work and I had told my son to go in the house and get my camera. My husband had gotten pictures of this sighting, but I wanted pictures also. While my son was in the house, my daughter and I were sitting outside still observing the sight, when a distance to the side of the sighting a bright light in the form of a circle appeared in the sky. It got bigger and bigger. It looked as tho the sky was opening up. My daughter and I were speachless!! Then all of the sudden smoke formed around the object and it moved forward then was gone. Leaving a smoke formation in the sky of a circle and a trail. These two sightings were got on picture by my husband and myself and nearby neighbors.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was clear.  The larger object had a central section that was clearly glowing with rainbow colors. Long curlicues extended outward, mostly to the east. These crisscrossed repeatedly. Both objects gradually expanded, the curlicues especially extending over a large distance. Though the edges of the curlicues softened slightly over the next half hour, they maintained their distinctiveness, spreading to cover a vast portion of sky. The smaller object dissipated into a more cloud-like form, while the larger maintained its shape for a much longer time. Both objects were nearly stationary for several minutes, then began a gradual motion to the northeast, as though driven by the wind. Throughout all this time the ends of the curlicues appeared to be extending in length, creating sinuous patterns. The overall impression was of a &#34;chemical bomb&#34; slowly expanding and changing. Just after sunrise, around 6:20, the objects had almost completely dissipated, and were now far to the northeast, but could still be faintly seen covering almost the whole of the northern horizon, having expanded from a very tight center just over or to the north of Silver City to include the whole visible extent of the Gila Wilderness area. Note: the next day the news was full of reports that what observers had seen was the result of a successful antiballistic missile test over the White Sands testing area. However, White Sands is east of Silver City, and this phenomenon looked to be more to the north, over the Gila Wilderness area. Photos of this event were taken by the observers and others. Photos appearing in various news media match in appearance those taken by the observers,<n>

At first, it appeared to be fighter jets very high in the sky, but then we realized it couldn&#39;t be, they were too high in the sky for one thing, and also were flying at a speed that cannot be achieved by even the most strategic aircraft of them all.  It was as if they were playing, flying back in forth in the sky, chasing each other from south to north, and then back north to south, and occasionally an east to west and so forth...this went on for about 20-25 minutes, maybe longer, we were all in such awe of what we were witnessing.  Then they just stopped and dissappeared.  About 3-5 minutes later there was a very bright bar of lights in the sky to the south and it hovered just above the tree line...this entire property where we were is completely surrounded with trees, but this bar of lights appeared over the tree line and then it was just gone.  Just like that, gone! The bar of lights seemed to have like 4-6 lights running from side to side and it was very hard to see any type of structure to it, just the lights.  It was strange, and after hearing about the sightings in Texas recently, it made me think of that night, and I started looking and researching to see if anyone else saw what we saw that night, but I have not found anything so far.  Just wanted to share our experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We went to the festivle on Sat.. The Blue Angles were there on both Sat and Sun.  The next day, Sunday, My girlfriend I were at her Mothers house with the dogs in the front yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Side note, I was a stinger missile gunner in the Army and ever since then, I have a habit of looking in the sky/air.  I was trained to look and observe and identify aircraft.  Since then, I tend to look upward often and try to challenge myself to identify aircraft whenever possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This day however had a very high overcast.  I would guess 5-10 thousand feet.  We were  in her Mothers front yard playing with the dogs.  I happened to look up and noticed  a single sphere silhouetted against the backdrop of the overcast skyline.  I quickly called for my girlfriend to come over and see it as well.  As we stood there watching the ONE sphere/round object silhouette against the background of the overcast sky, suddenly a second sphere/round object appeared, then an other sphere/round object, then finally a fourth.   All were perfectly aligned and all where exact same size/symmetric.  Within less than one minute they suddenly simply streaked off or more accurately, just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what the looked like once all four came together: (although they almost perfectly blended in with the skyline/clouds).  I’m simply trying to point out the symmetry and alignment of the way they appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you,  US Citizen<n>
7/11/06 08:10|Gila Indian Reservation & S. Chandler, Ocotillo area|AZ|Changing|5 minutes|Large, fast, transitory, reflective object seen over Phoenix southest east valley suburb or Gila Indian Reservation|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51304.html|312|ndxe200607| Large, fast, transitory, reflective object seen over Phoenix southest east valley suburb or Gila Indian Reservation<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving eastbound on Queen Creek road, east of the I10 freeway but west of Price, the object was visible initially in the east in the sky probably 10-20 thousand feet altitude between San Tan Mountain and the Intel factory facility (both visible landmarks from the vantagepoint) which could have placed it somewhere over south Chandler, south Gilbert or the Gila Indian reservation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were few or no clouds at least in this area of the sky and the sunlight was very bright - the object initially had a mirror-like display and was extraordinarily transitory.  If one imagines a vaguely metalic, oblong sphere, where the sunlight reflected on it in such a way as to make a &#34;Nike&#34; like swoosh around the edge of it, that would be a fair enough approximation.  The object remained visibile initially only long enough to see the reflection-like swoosh glisten around the edge, then seemed to disappear from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Judging from the size of airplanes at that distance and height, the object would have been huge for anything that flies.  My guess is that you could stack up ten or more 747s to get the height and if it was genuinely spherical you wouldn&#39;t still approach the volume.  The only thing I am accustomed to seeing in the sky of that size would be a small cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1-2 minutes later, from the vantagepoint of the southbound Price curve intersecting into Dobson, another whitish object (the same?) was similarly briefly visible overhead, this time much higher (35-50 thousand feet depending on the actual size of the object) and characteristically smaller to sight.  It had the look of making an upwards arc, in a corkscrew-like motion - that this motion could be perceived in such a short time - no more than a few seconds - would suggest extraordinary speed.  It gave the impression that it was moving so fast that to take one&#39;s eyes off of it even for an instant (i.e.: to pay attention to traffic), one would lose track of it - and in fact that happened.  Assuming both of these were the same object, the first view was from the side while the second was more from below and in the second view it had a rather boxy quality.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Despite scanning the sky, no further sightings were made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in the Phoenix valley and am familiar with cloud types and formations and their general altitudes, so on a clear day like today I believe I can make reasonably accurate estimations of aerial objects&#39; altitudes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It came from behing me and traveling east in the direction I was going.  It was about 12 o&#39;clock from my point of view exactly.  This thing started at the top and ran along down the atmosphere until it looked like it had turned straight away from the earth out towards space.  It was unique and was not a shooting star, this object was bright blue and about twice the size of the brightest star and more intense than the brightest star.  Shooting stars are red!!! And does not last this long and travel that far.  It also was moving at an incredible speed.  As fast as you taking your arm and pointing it at the horizon and move stragiht across the sky to the opposite horizon, taking about one second to completely move your arm.  It did not have a tail but only a light trail that my eyes had to keep up with it. I was a skeptic and still am in some cases, but I have never seen a shooting star do this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51353.html|315|ndxe200607| An Orb over Phoenis on July 10, 2006 10pm to 1am<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10:00 pm, A friend and I were complaining about the dog&#39;s barking next door as we sat by the pool at a house in Paradise Valley. It was a full moon and we simultaneouly saw a light appear, move and stop about 15,000 feet above downtown Phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The easiest way for me to explain its movement is to have you hold your extended arm straight out in front of you, then hold your thumb and index finger about four inches apart - that is how far this thing move in a second, after appearing out of nowhere. After acting like a satellite, it just stopped and hovered in the same spot for 20-30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had convinced ourselves that we imagined it before it moved about the same distance in downward and behind a desert tree. Before moving, two airplanes with navagational lights passed over the orb, and Phoenix at approx. 30,000 feet. The orb was a good 5 miles from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The round, glowing craft had colors &#34;scanning&#34; around it which reflected off what seemed like a mist around it. Two of the lights coming from the orb appeared to scan a wide swath around my friend and I. The first was a bluish color that was wide and tall, and it moved up and down. The second &#39;beam&#39; was more focused and white, and it seemed to come directly nears us and scan through us in a sideways motion. Pink and red colors were also present in the overall rotational pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About that same time, strange noises were coming from the brush on the other side of the cattle-guard, steel fence surrounding the house and pool area. The nearest house was two hundred yards away with open desert and tall brush between houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On two occasions, and in two different areas, I swore that I could see a blue glow that seemed to be coming from a specific point 100 yards into the brush.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first noise was like a muffled duck call, very quiet and over and over again from different areas. Then the brush moved violently as though something ran through it in one area. Then crackling was heard in another area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other noise sounded like pieces of hard wood knocking together because something was moving around, or communicating from different areas of the brushy desert - multiple somethings moving around with them around their necks or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The hair was standing all over my body at that point. My friend concurred. I felt as though I was begin watched from outside the fence by something, much like an animal in the zoo must feel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then there was a flash (like a camera flash 100 yards away) and all the noise in the brush suddenly stopped. It was deadly quiet! Even the dog quit barking. We joked that the aliens took the dog (it barked again later).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since left my friend&#39;s house and have been watching the orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is now 12:46 and on the move again. It has now moved two inches straight down and to the right since 12:11 (at least it is straight down the side of my window. By 12:55 it was five inches farther in same direction and then blocked out of my view by highway 202.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like it was slowly going west across the city toward Buckeye when I lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A sighting of a genuine UFO, which lasts for almost three hours in the vicinity of a major metropolitan area, is quite unusual.  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been looking at the planet, Jupiter, which is quite prominent in the southern sky, at present.  PD))<n>

But after reviewing the MiniDV Tape, I did capture a few frames of what I saw after all! I just did not know how I could slow down the frame rate of the video for better viewing of what I was tryng to tape. When I was taping this object, I guessed and zoomed in as best as I could where I THOUGHT the object was hovering near the contrail and clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know my report is very late in coming forth to you, but because of the other report I recently found on your web site I thought maybe I should also report this to NUFORC.<n>

I watched the object first assuming it was a balloon. After sometime I noted that it was stationary in altitude and traveling in an arc from south-west heading northerly and arcing toward the west. Its speed was very slow where it took aproxamatly 1 hour to travel about the length of my hand (from fingertip to wrist). It apeared about the size of a pea at its distance and with passing aircraft leaving and aproaching the Fullerton airport, I was able to guess it to be about the same altitude. It apeared silver or metalic in color and had a dull hue to it, almost gun metal grey. I pointed it out to my girlfriend who watched it for some time. It eventually moved out of sight behind our apartments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I noticed that it was a more than an average stary night as if there was no light being generated from Earth to hide the stars, basically it was very clear and the stars seemed closer and larger than usual.  As I looked out, what I describe as a small triangular craft with one round bright white light at the end of each point landed outside the front of my house.  It was totally silent.  I noticed the texture of this craft, which was a pure black and a shiny material, quite outstanding.  Whatever it came for, it stayed for some 5 minutes, then took of again and as quickly as it came.  Now we have all heard about people who have whitnessed triangular craft before, but after deliberation, some I am sure have been lucky enough to whitness these strange phenomena, I beleive.  Either way, as so many claim to of seen these triangular craft with simular descriptions across the world to what I have whitnessed, there appears or must be something behind it, rather than the scientists claiming it may be a trick of the mind, or a weather phenomena, which I beleive is an insult to the intellegence of the average person.  Why would someone make up and go into such great details, and why so many people?.  To  gain attention?, I think not, not in my case and I am sure not in many other cases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now last night, what I can only describe as a larger triangular ship that can only be from the same means, whatever it is was hovering above my house.  But this time, it did not land, and it was at least 5-6 times larger than the one I had seen previously several years earlier.  It was the same material for sure, was the same shape, and I suppose as mad as this sounds the only way I can describe this shape, as being something like the US military would design going on maybe a larger stealth bomber style maybe?.  I was not scared of this, felt at great ease and I was allowed to observe this craft which I am obviously in awe off and honoured to off been allowed to view as it was quite magnificent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is one of many strange experiences that have happened to me since I was around the age of 5 years old when I have experienced a number of major outer body experiences &#34;OBE&#39;S&#34; I beleive people call them, such as waking up within my sleep I assume?, and being unable to turn lights on and feeling either the energy of mother nature making its buzzing present, or an unknown force nearby etc, etc, if that makes any sense.  But from 2001 they had been more prominent in my life, where seeing and doing stuff out of the norm such as (spinning into pure light, and being helped and guided to the exact spot in order to do this by what I call the &#34;unknown force&#34;, whether mother nature or other?) seemed to happen on a regular basis.  I am far as I am concerned, this is one of a number of unexplained things that have happened to me and I am convinced others have the same ability, or have experienced simular phenomena, which I have tried hard to understand, but I still have not quite got to grasp with what it is I have been whitnessing through my life, whether I am simply going mad, or whether there really has been something aiding me through my life in general, or something trying or has been communicating with me?.  One thing it has given me is faith and belief in myself which has made me a far stronger person for it.  Is this simply a mind thing, am I mad, or have I genuinely whitnessed something out of this world?.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also is it possible that one can gain information about future technological breakthroughs via the subconscious mind?, before they have happened or been discussed, such as Fusion technology to name just one, even though one had no knowledge of this before?.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realise this mail is somewhat jumbled and may look like jargon to many of you.  But remember, when these things happen to people, to explain them in a mail is harder than you think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am open to suggestions and I have not made my final decision as to what I think it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Now I wasn&#39;t here to post just to read up on Oshawa sightings.  Until I read a couple, and I know the  area well.  (Polish hall, Airport, Apartment buildings around Airport.) These are all areas In the northern unlit part of the city, just entering the country and farm type area.  My apartment building is right beside the airport and I&#39;m on the 11th floor.(good view)  The other sightings are what caught my attention, they are similar to my own.  On my balcony I was watching these lights hovering over the airport, yet there was no sound no movement...............nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hear the helicopters take off and land every day and all the other types of aircraft as well.  I would know the sounds off by heart without even looking out the window.  This freaked me out.  My girlfriend was very excited so I kept telling her to listen.  It was so silent yet there these lights were mabey 150ft from the groung and less than a quater mile from my building.  She got spooked by the silence then the power in our apartment turned off.  Just our breaker in the power box poped.  All other apartments had no power interuption.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To see this for yourself..................wow.  I know my aircraft and this felt like a ghost.  No noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What aircraft is able to hover with no engine noise? The lights never flew away, they just dimmed then turned off.  Like the aircract was still there and just turned its lights off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any other Oshawa sightings like this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I had gone out to have a cigertte and was relaxing in a lawn chair and happened to notice a round metallic object hovering in the north sky. When I looked again it had three other round object circling it. They seemed to circle around the first one in a steady pace.This lasted for five or ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the three began to spead out away from the fisrt one in a triangular pattern. I continued to watch as the three objects fanned out to my guess would be 40 to 100 miles from the original circle. Then the three seperated and began to circle each other over a 2 hour period.This covered approximately 300 to 400 miles of sky. Then around 2 p.m. they regrouped in the north sky and one by one faded into I would assume would be space as the first stayed for a few more minetes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The craft was passing from the northeast to the southwest at an incredibly slow speed.  The engine never changed it&#39;s effort and the noise almost hovered in the sky it was so slow moving.  No lights or evidence of the craft were detectable.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was outside swimming in my pool with of my friends at about 18:00 and I just happen to look up in the sky. And what I had first thought to be a bird or a plain wasn’t.  It was a light that looked like a star. As I continue to look I noticed their  were 5 of them that formed a circle.  It surprised me because it was still very light outside and not dark enough for stars to be shining.  I told my other two friends to look however only was able to focus and see what I was seeing.  These lights appeared to be far from earth and would fade in and out of our sight as the clouds moved in the view of them. But each time we gain sight of them their location would be slightly different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were able to see this circle for about 1/2 hour and could have continued but  because my other friend was not able to witness what we were seeing she became bored with us so we decided to stop and continue with our swimming.   But later that night about 21:00 I alone went outside to see if they where still there, but there wasn’t no sight of them or any stars that matched the deception of what I saw earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were approximately 150 North of LA.  Over the farmland we thought we saw a plane doing a crop dusting.  But the closer we came to it we realized this was not a crop duster. We thought it was some kind of pole with lights on it.  But when we finally got close enough to see what it was, we noticed that it was a black triangle UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft follwed along side of our car for thirty minutes or more.  And it did all kinds of amazing flips and flew back and forth. It would do this light show.  One side of the craft would light up and then it would flip. Then another side of the triangle would light up, and it would do another flip. It did this probably a half a dozen times.  It had One bright light in the middle, which was also surrounded by three smaller lights. And these would light up, almost like it was trying to talk to us. It reminded me of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, when the scientist were using lights to try and communicate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO finally jumped accross the Highway and got behind our car, which was when I started to feel fear from amazement. The strange thing about this story was that when this whole event started there were all kinds of cars on the highway with us. In front of us, behind us. And when the UFO got behind us and finally disappeared all the traffic was gone. And there was no one in front of us or behind us, and then suddenly there was. There were two hours that dissapeared. The clock went from two am to four am just like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights and beam were brighter than anything you&#39;ve ever seen. Bright as the sun.<n>

They moved in patterns around one another. I was driving north on the parkway at around mile marker 60 when this began. There were many other cars on the road, but for about 15 mins the lights kept pace with my vehicle.  Towards the end of the observation, it looked as though they were shining &#34;spotlights&#34; down into the woods, moving in a circular rotating formation. They would come together and make a brighter spotlight every 10 seconds or so. I thought there was an explenation for these lights, but it wouldnt be possible for spotlights to shine up into the sky from the woods, at pace with my car for 15 mins. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before, but will keep my eyes open for similar lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We all went outside and noticed there was another red light which appeared to be following the first one. At first we thought they must be hot air balloons, one following the other, or perhaps they were attached in some way but it was too dark to see. We were looking for bursts of flames as we were looking for these balloons or perhaps the sound of a burst but there wasnt a single sound during the whole duration of the sighting nor did the lights flicker or distort in any way. We didnt seem to be able to focus correctly on the objects, they appeared to be blurred somewhat, i thought it was my eyesight at first (which is normally A+) but we all mentioned we couldnt focus on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be travelling at identical speeds, one following the other. They werent travelling very fast, it almost looked as though they were being carried by the wind until we noticed that the second ufo appeared to go closer to the first and then slow down again. We couldnt determine whether they were low flying or high flying. They were quite bright red lights that appeared to be flying low but because we couldnt hear any sound at all we all assumed they were flying quite high in the sky. If they were at a high altitude then these objects must be quite large in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them for about 15-20 minutes, one constantly following the other. They appeared to be increasing altitude as they were getting further away. The second ufo kept moving closer and slowing down from the first ufo. The leading ufo appeared to remain at a steady speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they gradually moved further away heading north, the second ufo appeared to break away from the first moving off to the right in an easterly direction. It then disappeared either into clouds or just out of vision we couldnt quite make it out. About 20 seconds later the first ufo disappeared also either into clouds or out of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never thought i&#39;d witness anything like this and have always been sceptical about other claims. I even took a photo on my camera phone, its not brilliant but its still evidence. I&#39;d be willing to discuss this with anyone that wishes to.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They appeared to be in formation about five to ten objects width apart &#34;line astern&#34;. They were moving fairly rapidly, at a guess about 250Kts, in a straight line to the East where after about two minutes dissappeared from view. A minute later a third sphereical orange object appeared on the same heading as the other two and followed them over the eastern horizon. The whole episode lasted about three minutes. Most striking was the complete lack of noise generated by the objects. Of the witnesses there were three school teachers, one social worker, one professional artist and two children.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

7/8/06 01:45|Federal Way|WA|Changing|less than 1 min|Saw a blue floating orb outside my window that proceeded to explode emitting a LOUD sound|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54173.html|343|ndxe200607| Saw a blue floating orb outside my window that proceeded to explode emitting a LOUD sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im not sure of the date, but I remember it was after the 4th of July and it was a weekend. It was 1:45 in the morning and I was in my living room watching tv. To the right of me I have a huge picture window and out of the corner of my eye I saw something BRIGHT blue. I turned to look at what it was (figuring it was late fireworks)and saw a BRIGHT blue orb-like thing that was a bit larger than a basketball. It was just hovering about 5 feet outside my window (Im on the 2nd floor of my apartment building and all thats outside that window is about 15 ft of air and then a green strip of trees). It was blue with a small glowing white center and a light, I guess, foglike white around the outside of the blue section. After starring at this maybe 10-15 seconds the thing exploded. It was like watching pictures we have of a supernova explosion. It turned completely white and exploded in this blinding shiny white and was probably the size of a kitchen table at its largest as it exploded. And the really weird part is while it was exploding it let off the loudest sound I have ever heard. It wasnt a rumbling like thunder, it was like a pop and a snap that seems to resonate throughout the apartment. I have never heard a sound like this. I felt like I could feel the waves and it shook my floor slightly. I mean my ears were ringing it was so loud. And then it was gone. Not a trace. After sitting there just flabbergasted for about 1 min I went to the window and looked out and saw nothing out of the ordinary. I know I wasnt dreaming or hallucinating because my cats were looking at the orb when I was and both ran across the room and hid when it exploded and the sound came out. I dont know what it was- but I think its safe I can say it wasnt of this world. I never saw or heard anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

July 8, 2006|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51279.html|344|ndxe200607| Red/Amber light in east coast Florida Sky. July 8, 2006<n> <n><n> <n><n> to bed around 1am. I looked out my window, as I always do, to look at the skies. I glimpsed at the Northern Cross, began to close the curtains, and then something registered...I saw something odd. There was a faint, red/amber thin bright line residing in the middle of a glow. It was in the middle of Daneb and Vega. I looked at it and wondered if it was a plane, reelection of panels front the space station, gas, etc. I then thought I saw it move. I watched it some move, and it did in fact move. This went on for about an hour. By its distance from me I can assume it was over Jasonville, FL. There are a lot of bases there. It was about 22 miles up, definitely in the stratosphere. It was about 1-1.5 miles in width, and it moved left to right at a rate of about 10-20 miles a second. It did move up and down a little. However, it mostly moved left to right...and not in a clean manner. It stayed about 55-65 degrees about the horizon. It stayed in the Northern Cross as the constellation moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a weirdo. I am a night sky watcher; for fun. I am real into NASA. I have never seen anything I cannot explain until last night. I do not believe in ET, so I must assume it was a military craft, or perhaps an experiment of some kind...the shuttle is docked with the station. I know that Leonardo was caring experiments to the station. I know it was an object, it was flying, and I could not identify it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I saw a light as bright as Jupiter moving SSE (away from me) about 20% faster than the jets I see. I went inside and got binoculars and returned to observe. The object was a bright white light. It had no FAA lights at all. There was another plane or jet in that quadrant of sky and I could make out its FAA lights clearly. The object moved behind some trees so I rushed forward to observe it further. I only lost sight of it for about 3 seconds while I moved but it had disappeared by the time I should have had line of sight. I don&#39;t think it was sunlight reflecting off a fuselage as the sun had been down for too long. It wasn&#39;t a satellite (I note those often) this was much much brighter. I am an avid skywatcher and this is the first time I&#39;ve seen something I couldn&#39;t identify. Tonight, (7/16/06) my wife and I observed an object that could have been the same one. I&#39;ll file that sighting next. I give you my word as a Texan that this is the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I continued to watch realizing it was not a jet, no navigation lights as well as being way too bright, the object was heading south east and passed directly over my house. I ran inside to tell my wife and daughter to come outside and look, the three of us watched as the object dissapered over the trees. The brightness of the object never changed, it was just as bright comming at us as it was going away from us, WOW, please tell me someone else saw this! It is hard to guess the altitude other than to say it was pretty low, however we could not hear any engin noise. I would sure love to know what we just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

THERE HAS BEEN TIMES THEY HAVE EVEN KIND OF FREAKED ME OUT. THEN I DECIDED TO SERIOUSLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY ARE.

I live in Madeira, Ohio which is an hour away from the hospital.  The route I take is north on I-71 to the Route 73 exit, east about a quarter mile and then north on Route 380, which gors straight into Xenia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 0220 I was on 380 when I noticed two bright headlight appearing lights in the sky to the northeast of me.  I assumed it was a plane and continued driving.  A couple of minutes later I noticed the the lights appeared to be in the same place, not moving.  Again I assumed it was an optical trick and that the plane wass coming straight at me and that was why it looked like it was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another couple of minutes I began to realize that this object was not movingg in the manner of a plane, if at all.  I slowed my car down to a stop and in deed the object was hovering about a half to a mile away.  Now I drove on toward it and and it remiained fairly stationary.  As I neared it appeared to be just above the treetops and the lights were very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my car and looked at it sticking my head out of the window.  There was no engine noise and I could not make out a distinct shape because of the light and a foggy mist which enhanced the bright light effect, but my impression was it was long shaped  (?cigar vs cylinder). I was afraid to leave the car and was aware that I had a patient waiting for me in the ER. The craft then began to move to the southwest (behind me) at a slow rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see anothers car light in my rearview mirror and I proceeded to Xenia. On my return trip I went the same way and saw nothing. That&#39;s it in a nutshell<n>

We drove up the 15 Freeway, past the Arizona border, to get away from all the city lights, and got off the next exit up, about 10 miles north of Mesquite, it was called Beaver Dam, AZ.  We went up a road, about 3 or 4 miles, looked as if it was a back route to St. George, UT.  Cars would pass by maybe every 15 or 20 mins...<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got fully dark, my husband and I, are our two older sons, got on top of our van, and just started stargazing.

Then another and another... every several minutes, we&#39;d see another. They&#39;d go in different directions, always silent, most seemed very high up.  Several planes were going by, but they had strobes,and the different colored lights on them, these were just white like stars in the distance.  We watched for irrational patterns, but all seemed to go in straight lines, or only turn slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most at one time we saw was 3, and ONE was different than the rest...it seemed very LOW, the light was very bright, it came from the west, moving east, and went right over us.  You could see no shapes, hear no noise..just a light, it turned to go more toward the south, and then just disappeared...  we&#39;d watch them all until they&#39;d fade out that way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hung out about 2 hours...counted 9 of them...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As the bus moved away from it, the UFO&#39;s color changed to an almost imperceptible flat-gray due to the angle of the reflected sun-light; it disappeared after a tree blocked its view (as the bus slowly traveled in traffic) and after other-passengers started noticing it.  Within a few minutes, two common-looking helicopters were seen ahead of the bus racing towards the UFO&#39;s area (while traveling in a westernly direction).  The day was perfect summer-weather:  no clouds, blue skies, slight breeze and sunny.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 1000 ft in the air, and at first seemed like a capsule shape. It then had several spheres that bulged out of it, but never entirely separated themselves from the rest of the object. This thing was huge. If a C-130 flew by it, this thing would be about 10 times as large. Like I said it started ot as a capsule shape and them appeared to become a blob, as all the spheres were coming from it. At the time I was about 4-5 miles south of Robbins Air Force Base. I pulled over and stopped to watch it. And with my passenger window rolled down I could see it.

It was somewhat bright and hovering. The moment I saw it, I knew it was not a plane, helicoptet, star, or anything of familiarity. I parked to look closer and it was  moving very oddly and traveling toward Moorpark. I called my sister and drove back toward my parent&#39;s house where she was at the top of First St. This is where my sister, her friend and I saw the object travel further away, upward. It sat and looked like a star for awhile, but occasionally hovered from side to side. Then, the object dropped something!Whatever it dropped was a white light. We waited for an explosion or something but nothing happened. Then the object disappeared, came back, and then disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The light had stopped at exactly 12 o clock (right above my house) and was hovering for about 10 minutes. I called my family outside and 2 of my neighbors to witness this object. I looked at the light with my binoculars and i could tell how the light would change shape from round to triangular and then from triangular to round. The light would change shapes constantly. The light then started traveling south again and stopped aproximately above Aviation and Country Club. A helicopter started circling the object (for about 3 minutes) with the spotlight on the object. After the 3 minutes with the helicopter circling the object, the red light turned off and completely dissapeared in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was expecting to hear more about this event on the news but was not covered by any news channel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I saw a helicopter in the sky (nothing new around here) but it was orbiting around a bright red light that wasn&#39;t moving in the sky. The helicopter was about 1 block away from the object an it had its nose pointed to it the whole time - along with the spotlight on it. There was nothing to see other than the bright red light. As we headed south down the road towards 8th Street (and getting a little closer) I noticed that it could have been 3 bright red lights close to each other. From our position, it was located SE, not too far away, and probably around 100 feet in the air. The helicopter continued to orbit the object with the spotlight on it. My eyes dashed to the road and back up and it was gone. My wife had continued watching and said that it just turned off. The helicopter hung around for about 10 seconds more before heading south. By the time we stopped the car at our house and got to the sidewalk, the helicopter was long gone and there was still nothing in the sky where the helicopter had been orbiting the object. The whole event lasted maybe 2-3 minutes before the light had turned off.<n>

7/5/06 13:00|Ann Arbor|MI|Rectangle|30 seconds|Rectangular box-shaped UFO spotted northwest of Ann Arbor, Michigan in the summer of 2006|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56666.html|372|ndxe200607| Rectangular box-shaped UFO spotted northwest of Ann Arbor, Michigan in the summer of 2006<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost a year ago now, some friends and I were eating lunch outside one of the buildings on the University of Michigan&#39;s North Campus when I realized I was observing a small box floating near the bell tower. I turned my head from side to side to make sure it wasn&#39;t cargo being held up by a crane, or even something hanging from a nearby tree. On the contrary it seemed to not be very close to the bell tower after all but a good distance behind it, a mile or more away, and perhaps five hundred feet in the air. I pointed it out to my friends (we were all associated with the University), but by the time I got them looking in the right direction it had slowly moved out of sight into a low-hanging cloud and behind the tower. Its color was not much different than the hazy sky around it, so for all I can remember it may have actually faded out of sight entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO looked like a nondescript, light gray rectangular box, slightly taller than it was wide, and it rotated slowly. It may have been quite far away, as it was not much larger than a fingernail held at arm&#39;s length. From my perspective it was just to the right of the tower, where it hovered for maybe thirty seconds (though I don&#39;t know how long it had been there before I noticed it), then moved slowly up and to the left and disappeared. My friends did not see it but during the following discussion one of them admitted having seen a similar box-shaped UFO a few years before. I don&#39;t recall the details of his sighting at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any case some basic Google research suggests a few clues. Following the direction I had been looking, the UFO was northwest of Ann Arbor. Aviation maps reveal that the only things of any interest in that area are a public air traffic radio tower, a particularly wide section of the Huron River, and the Gooding private/restricted airspace, serial number 920-20. Most other box-shaped UFO reports I&#39;ve read seemed to have occurred near a military airport of some kind, including one reported on this site from around the same time last year, here in Michigan near Sault St. Marie (which had an Air Force Station that was reportedly closed in 1981), which also occurred in broad daylight and was supposedly witnessed by several people. However there don&#39;t seem to be any current or former military bases of any kind around Ann Arbor for hundreds of miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before this sighting I was quite skeptical of all the UFO nonsense...now it seems I&#39;m forced to take it more seriously. Maybe somebody should wander on over to those &#34;abandoned&#34; Air Force bases and do some bird watching, or if for any reason these things really do need to be kept a secret, it seems to me they shouldn&#39;t be floating their secrets around urban areas in broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

They told me that they had filmed the incident and I came over to see what they had,  My lead guitar player and myself joined our friend with our own camera the next morning when at approx. 5:15 not only did it do a repeat performance, but it was followed by another craft of approximately the size of 5 football fields.  The smaller craft looked like sparks in the early morning sky, and we didnt even know they were smaller craft until we slowed the film down to frame by frame, and were amazed to see many of them entering and leaving the larger craft.    The air around where they flew seemed to be mixed up like ripples in the water, it was like looking into water, and like someone took a sponge lightly dipped in paint and went over what was really there.  This cloaking activity seems inherent after sunrise, and the only time we have been able to actually SEE them is right at sunrise before the sun rises high enough over head for them to reflect the sky back at themselves.  So I went back again with my digital camera, which has filming capability for short spurts of time, and waited.  I almost thought (even though this was a week later) that I wouldnt see a thing, but right at 5:23 the sun started comingup and there they were , like they appeared out of nowhere, this one took off to the east.  I lost sight of it around Bailey hill, and figured Id have to wait another day, however as I got closer to home, (13 miles away from where we had photographed  them, I went under the train trestle down the street from my house, looked up and bigger than shit there it was.  I barreled down the driveway grabbed my camera and bolted up to the street in time to catch it on an .avi file.   The next day, my friend Bobby calls me and tells me that he caught it landing on the far side of the power plant, the far side of the power plant is delta of the Sacramento River, and an island that is mostly marsh and hazardous waste.  No one goes there, no one human anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured that since they were appearing close to the power plant that the draw of the electricmagnetic field had to have something to do with them appearing there over and over again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So 4th of July, we went up and w atched fireworks from Bobbys back yard on the top of the hill above Bart in Pittsburg, California,  I took off at about 1 am telling them i was going to get my high powered telescope, my bushnells and my old fashined type of VCR recorder, you know the type that actually took the big VCR tapes to record?  I was back at 4 pm. setting up the telescope and the vcr recorder to watch the sky.  I had a feeling whatever we would see this day was going to be HUGE. and buddy i tell you what it was freaking HUMONGUS.  The size of the city of Concord at the very least. With hudreds of hundreds of the size flying ships that only days before we were referring to as &#34;mother ship&#34;  WHAT A LAUGH!  OH MY GOD.  The video I got of it this morning, actually shows movement on the ship, shows crafts set to depart, on platforms that swing upwards to a sinister or forward slash direction, and when the ships departed, they didnt go straight up, the platform they rested on inclined, and these fast mother flockers left with the force and speed of a projectile,   what looked like might be a jet trail, turned out to be motion blur.  We found all kinds of sparks and fast movement in the sky that many were unable to be seen by the naked eye.  As a matter of fact, when you pointed the camera at them, you could not see the craft on the preview screen of the camera at all, and looking through the eyehole, they werent there either, we had to just point the cameras in the general direction, hit the zoom and width mode and even then sometimes couldnt see them until you slowed the film down by 900 percent.  i AM going to try to translate the film to my computer from the TV somehow and copy it to a DVD.  But I tell you what I am so blown away by the whole thing I dont even know what to think say or do.  The blow away at dawn was looking at what appeared to be an elogated fireball, with the multitude of disks and smaller craft, AND stationary &#34;buildings&#34; with activity able to be seen usning the zoom lense of the camera.  Ill have to enter more on this later.<n>

Report  I’m writing this report more then a year after the event originally happened, I feel that what I saw was substantial, and needed to be known. I also have heard of other similar sightings and felt this may contribute some important information. The event took place in early July 2006, the night was clear and weather was warm. Some friends of mine took a sailing trip to Thompson Island, located in Lake Superior, this is about a 4 hour sailboat trip from the Thunder Bay Marina. The unidentified craft was seen at night. Some of our friends had decided to sleep on the sailboat in the small bay that the island offers, however due to the warm July weather 5 of us had decided to take the 15 minute walk to the other side of the island and tent. Rather then tent, we actually decided to lay our blankets out upon the beach and lay beneath the stars. We  rested on the beach and talked late into the night, during this time 2 of the 5 of us drifted off to sleep, the time was now nearly roughly 3 or 4 am. The stars were out and visible all night and we had been looking at constellations and the stars all night. Well in mid conversation,  one of us was distracted by what seemed to be a star and commented “ Guys look at those stars they seem really bright”. So all three of us looked upwards and the same distance as a star would seem away was a ball of light, it seemed to be a star at first but it was getting brighter without at doubt, upon closer inspection it seemed to be slightly blue/white light, the type you would see in some peoples headlights for there vehicles, and as we looked.. off to the right side of the sky faded in two more lights of the same type and size. They moved parallel to each other and then moved into a triangle formation with the third and original light. They then stopped all motion, and unexpectantly began what seemed random looping and changing of direction, something a plane/ helicopter/ or satellite could not accomplish, the movement was from nothing to very fast in no time at all, after doing ! what see med at random series of movement the three lights split apart and moved away in different direction. This whole series of events happened in probably 5- 7 minutes, and was viewed from this remote island in the middle of Lake Superior by 3 people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

But the lights were moving WAY too fast to be a plane. We were staring out a window at them and they would blink and then totally show up in a different spot, they were moving incredibly fast. Also, just when you thought it was going straight it would change direction and go backwards or go left then right. It was as if the 2 lights were playing with eachother. We tried to think of what they could have been, but there&#39;s no way to explain how fast they were moving and how bright they were and how they changed direction. Also everything was totally silent, you couldn&#39;t hear anything. It also looked at one point that the object came down to tree level and dissapeared in the trees. It may have landed. but it was very far away, we couldn&#39;t tell at all. The next morning we told our neighbor he is a retired military officer at the local arsenal (Picatinny) and he told us he sees the lights all the time over the lake. And he cannot explain them, he knows of no secret tests at the base which is (about 25 miles away.) He pretty much had no idea what they were, he was just glad he&#39;s not crazy and other people have seen it too. Please if you experienced a similar sighting let me know, I&#39;m really interested in this whole thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As i was watching i saw a large object that was shaped like an octagon, but taller than it was wide.  The top and bottom were a dark reddish-orange color and the middle was a wide  rectangle of white light.  The object was quite noticable because it was just over the tops of the trees.  I saw the object move from way back towards the mountain to almost right above me, giving me an excellent look at it.  I took several looks around my apartment to see if it was some kind of reflection.  It was not.  I observed the object for several minutes, getting a breath taking view, when a large flash of lightning lit up the sky behind it.  The sighting lasted only a few more minutes, before the object hovered left some and then right some and was gone.  This sighting made me feel strongly   enough that the next day i had to draw and color what i had seen, so that i could see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched it and noticed the object seemed to be completely lighted - from front to back, but no blinking or colored lights, just steadily illuminated. I watched it for a moment and it seemed to stop and hover - I would guess about a mile from where I was standing. It was stationary for about 1 minute then a lighted object dropped from underneath the lighted craft and dropped straight down before looping back up behind the original craft and hovered behind it at the same altitude. I didn&#39;t hear any noise or sounds, other than the faint jet engines of the planes approaching LAX to land. The craft then started moving off to the northeast where it dimmed it&#39;s lights as it crossed the area where incoming LAX traffic began their approach but then illuminated again after a few seconds. The lighted object that dropped from the craft was still in the same location and I never saw it move, but eventually it just became non visible. I have no idea what I witnessed, but I don&#39;t believe it was a helicopter or airplane. Were there any other reports from the Corona California area on the evening of July 4th, 2006 ?<n>

There was no sound, no flashing/blinking lights, but while it flew it seemed as if it were shaking or moving in a side to side manner, while still continuing in the nw-se direction.  There were 7 of us who watched this (5 adults, 2 children). Us adults were quite amazed and it left us all wondering what it was we had just seen.  I can tell you that we are all 100% sure this was not any firework, or anything of that matter. There were hundreds of people in the vicinity and we are hoping that someone else has seen the same thing we did and will report it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/4/06 21:20|El Cajon|CA|Unknown|10 Minutes|Red Lights Over El Cajon, California|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51228.html|387|ndxe200607| Red Lights Over El Cajon, California<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 4, 2006, my son and I observed an object consisting of three red lights, which changed color often. The object was to our East, between Fletcher Hills and the City of El Cajon in California about 15 miles East of San Diego.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared to be moving away from us slowly in an Eastward direction. The three lights formed a triangular shape, and the top light would pulsate on and off, as well as the red on all three lights would change in color and intensity. The red color was about as red and bright as a laser pointing device. There was numerous small aircraft in the area from Gillespie Field  (Three letter airport code: SEE)in El cajon and as well, many commercial airliners passing overhead (altitude would be about 3000 to 6000 feet for the commericial aircraft on this approach - yes I am a rated private pilot) in the approach pattern to Lindbergh Field in San Diego. However, the light pattern was not conistent with an airplane, nor was the movement consistent with either a helicopter or airplane. The object appeared to be steady (non-moving) for about 5 minutes, then it started drifting slowly to the ESE. The object then vanished. Our view was not blocked or obstructed, so it did not go behind a building, tree, cloud, etc., it just appeared to go dark all of a sudden. A small plane in the touch and go landing pattern at Gillespie Field (they use runway 27R during night ops) flew through the area within two minutes of us losing visual contact of the object. We tried to take digital photographs, but my son has yet to download them to the computer so we can see if we captured anything or not. This was also not mistaking the local fireworks displays going on around town, as we could not see any fireworks from our location and the object bore no resemblence to any fireworks. The weather was clear, with no clouds or low lying fog in the area - visibility was about 20 miles, temperature was approximately 80 Deg F, with light winds. We could see plenty of stars in and around where we saw the object both before, during and after the event. There was no sound heard from the object, nor was there any sudden movements. The appearence and disappearence were the only quick actions by the object, and the movement was similiar to a hot air ballon, in that it seemed to drift more than fly. We have seen many hot air ballons, and there was no flame present such as what a hot air ballon would have, only three red lights and a visible dark area between the lights, which we believed to be the structure of the object. I tried to logically explain what it was to myself since observing the object last night, but I can not come up with anything which I can say, yes that is what it was. I have had to file this in my mind as &#34;unknown&#34; or when my son asked me what it was, I said &#34;I have no idea kiddo&#34; and that is where it remains.<n>

I was standing in my driveway looking north when I noticed a bright red light in the sky about 10 to 15 degrees below the pointer stars of the big dipper.  Initially I thought that it was a helicopter observing the fireworks, but the light was not flashing and it stayed stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about a minute and then went inside to get my wife so that she could see it too.  When we came back outside the red light had gained altitude and was at the level of the pointer stars in the big dipper.  As we watched the light it continued to slowly gain altitude and was pulsing at irregular intervals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally about halfway up the big dipper, the red light pulsed several times, turned white for 15 or 20 seconds and slowly faded out until it disappeared.  The whole event took about 8 to 10 minutes.  This was definitely not an aircraft.  There were several aircraft in the area and they looked and moved completely different than this light.  I thought that maybe it was a rocket launch, but I had just seen a rocket launched at night within the last week or so and it did not look the same at all.<n>

We (my wife and I) were sitting in the back of our explorer, waiting for the fireworks to begin. I saw the orbs slowly moving across the sky, in perfect formation, just as I turned my camcorder on they were gone. I am NOT some UFO freak, I have never claimed to see anything before, I am VERY skeptical of these things. Just recenlty relocated to NC from Wash, DC<n>

I saw three distant objects in the sky which moved very slowly, sometimes getting into a triangular pattern and then very slowly fade back to a straight line of 3. I showed my wife&#39;s father and family and he concluded that it was airplanes.  However there was NO NOISE AT ALL from any of the three. They stayed around for at least 30 minutes, slowly making their way out of site behind clouds and mountains, only to appear again about an hour later. I ALMOST called 911 to report this and have wondered ever since if anyone else did. I kept telling the others that it was UFO&#39;s. Could it have been weather balloons? If so why would they go from a triangle pattern back to straight line? They did not change color and appeared to be white/blue lights, but they definitely moved, although slowly, and definitely were not stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We were all impatiently waiting for the fireworks to begin. I was looking to the south when I saw what I believed to be a plane coming in our direction but as it passed over us I realized it was the same silvery cylindrical object I saw in June (see June 2006 NUFORC report). As before it was much lower than a large passenger plane or blimp. It was around 8:30 this time so it was a little darker and the object seemed a little higher than in June, but I could see that it had no wings and no tail.  The direction of travel was about the same as the June sighting. There was too much crowd noise to be able to hear any sound from the object. I looked around to see if anyone else was looking at it and I could not detect anyone looking up. I tried to get the people I was with to look at the object but everyone was too busy having fun and talking. A simple glance and it would be mistaken for a plane. One would need to really look at it to realize it wasnt ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have one airport, Regional. The runway does not accomodate larger planes. Planes traveling across Missouri are always at a higher altitude than this object was. Small 2 or 4 seater planes fly over at a lower altitude and it is always easy to see detail such as wings and tail. The engine noise is audible as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not seen the object again since July but that doesnt mean it cant still be flying around. I saw it in July because I basically came to it. Had I been at home I would not have seen it .  I have no idea what I saw nor can I guess. I just offer this report up as another oddity of this haunted planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Persona sighting  - B.

I was facing east with my son in front of the window. When I noticed something flying by the window. I had a set of binoculars from sight seeing on the table so I grabbed them and view the object. It was flying at Approx 50-60 miles per hour. It was a rounded Octagon in shape with what looked like some sort of raised ribs that had the shape of a Turbo Charger Impeller. It was Rotating around and was colored with what looked like Polished Aluminum or Chrome and Black Anodized Aluminum. After using other items in the area as a guide, I would approx it to be 50-75ft across. We viewed the object head Northward and gained altitude. We started viewing the item when it was at our eye level. It appeared on the Arizona side of the Colorado River Approx 1 mile East of the Bullhead city Airport. It was viewed by myself and my 11year old son. I was in the Airforce and have a good knowledge of Aircraft. I have never seen this item ever before.

7/4/06 02:37|Osteen|FL|Sphere|At least 10 minutes|Round black object hovering in and out of clouds during and after space shuttle launch.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51213.html|400|ndxe200607| Round black object hovering in and out of clouds during and after space shuttle launch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always try to watch all of the rockets, especially the space shuttles launch from Cape Canaveral.  On July 4, 2006, the space shuttle Discovery took off at 2:37 PM. I wasn&#39;t in a good spot to see the launch (trees in the way), so about ten minutes before the shuttle took off, I started driving from Deltona looking for a unobstructed view of the east.  I was hoping to get to the St. Johns River bridge along 415 and pull over there to watch the shuttle since there would be no obstructions over the river.  I didn&#39;t make it that far, and at 2:37 I pulled over into a church parking lot in Osteen that had an open field behind it. By the time I got my camera out, the shuttle was probably about 30 seconds into it&#39;s launch.  I started taping the launch, and once the shuttle was no longer visible, I noticed something else in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was round black object up in the sky off in the distance in the same direction that the shuttle took off from.  Judging from the clouds that the shuttle passed behind, and what the object was in front of, the black object was closer than the shuttle, but it was hard for me to estimate a size.  My initial though was that somebody released a balloon that was rising.  After watching the object a bit, I realized it wasn&#39;t moving correctly to be a balloon.  For example, it would be at one spot in the sky, and then would move back and forth horizontally.  Another time it started getting low in the sky rather quickly compared to the speed that it was drifting at at other times.  It also appeared to be just barely entering clouds at times.  It would fade behind a cloud, but never actually disappear totally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched (and video taped) the object for about 10 minutes until I finally left.  About 5 minutes later, I was able to look past the trees after driving along 415 in the direction of Sanford and still see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on, as I am writing this, I looked at the video that I took of the object and the shuttle launch.  At one point I am not paying attention, and move the camera off of the shuttle, and the object shows up there showing that the object was in the sky before I noticed it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have video footage, along with still frames that I took from the video that I will send to you.  With so many people watching the shuttle launch, I wonder if anyone else saw something similar?<n>

The vehicle was driving on interstate 65, moving toward Chicago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event began when the driver of the car sighted what looked like a large fireball was  falling from the sky.  The driver referred to the object as an extremely large meteorite, because the movement of the object and what appeared to be fire surrounding it resembed a meteor entering into the atmosphere.  After the object had fallen for about 1 minute, it came to a complete stop in the sky.  It was a pause of about 10 seconds, and then the single object broke into 5 separate large balls of light and moved into the shape of a pentagon.  The 5 lights moved as one for about another minute, and then they began to fly their separate ways across the sky.  The flight did not seem to have a distinct pattern at this time.  After watching the lights dance across the sky for the next few minutes, trees blocked the line of site of the passengers.  Once the vehicle was beyond the trees, the lights had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes down the road, right around reaching Gary, the passengers all noticed a bright light, which put off much more light than an airplane or any other craft the passengers had seen, shoot from the left side of the sky to the right and paused.  This took less than 1 second to occur.  After the light had paused, it lowered altitude, paused for another second, shot straight up into the sky, and was gone.  The passengers of the car all agreed that the object had moved at about the same speed that a &#34;shooting star&#34; shoots across the sky.  After this short event, no other lights were spotted by the passengers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I My girlfriend comes out to stands next to me and I say  &#34; is that Venus?&#34; She doesn&#39;t know, I see that it is brighter than a normal star and flashing green, orange, and white.  I was crown shaped yet the thing changed it shape. Then to our surprise it slowly and I mean slowly moves to the right, then quickly back.  It did this several times... slow at first, then decisively going back.  Staying for 40 minutes or so we know the position has changed in the sky way to the right.  It was as high that I mistook it for a star. Seemed as if tiny white lasers were leaving it or crossing it&#39;s path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7 months ago I was driving home at 3 pm or so northward here in town. I saw in the sky from way high several flashing white lights descend toward earth each flashed at different times yet at the same speed. They were arranged like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Imaging an upside down pointing rack of bowling pins set them apart wider, and add two more on the top row:<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Orientation of objects did not survive transfer to database.

7/3/06 03:00|Gladstone|MI|Other|1 minute|Strange object with two lights.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51206.html|405|ndxe200607| Strange object with two lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 3rd of July at 3:00am almost exactly, I saw a very strange object\objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work the night shift and when I came home, I noticed I needed to get milk for the kids in the morning and went outside to go to the local gas station to get a gallon.  I forgot my wallet and began going inside the house.  I had just peeked up towards the south sky for a second and thought I had seen a satellite or fireball at first moving across the sky. I took a couple of steps back to see around my roof line by my front porch and noticed not only 1 large star, but one small one directly under it and moving exactly with it. Measurements are hard to describe but it must have been low and very large as I will explain. As it moved east slowly, I noticed it must have been a solid object since it would block out other stars in between the two star type lights. It suddenly stopped and began going south, now directly in front of me, and as the lights seemed to dim and become closer and go up higher , the more stars would show around it so I know it was moving upwards and away from me at the same time. The size must have been huge although I cannot honestly say how big. We don&#39;t have any type of blimps, laser displays or anything of the sort here as it is a small area with mostly woods and a lake. The only example I can give is to look at the two end stars on the cup of the big dipper as that was &#34;aproximately&#34; the distance between them, and picture those two stars moving in unisen sideways. There was no noise at all, not even a whoosh or anything, like it was gliding in a sound proof room. The two lights eventually looked like one as they seemed to merge and at this point very faint, and then just dissappeared. I may add that there were no planes and living in the country , it&#39;s easy to hear even a small plane or jet that is very high.<n>

It was around dusk and with about 15 min. or so left of light we noticed a black object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was first noted moving east and north (was getting smaller).  It stopped moving east and thats when we noticed a red light not blinking, but &#34;scrolling&#34; across it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After staring at it for a few more minutes it was confirmed from multiple people all observing that there were flashes of light, almost like fire flies dancing around it.  It was hard to count since they were not constant in their luminescence, however we did note their patterns etc.  They seemed to be all around it and the lights formed a larger sphere orbiting around the object which seemed to be some kind of EM field.  Everyone confirmed they saw this sphere of lights around the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made a sudden arc of altitude as it moved west.  The arc that it made in the sky would be about the size of the moon or so (.5-1 Deg).  After about another minute or 2 the object became smaller as it apparently moved north and gained altitude and it was finally lost in the incoming darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the entire time 3-4 planes with contrails were all seen flying in different directions which all seemed to closely intersect with the location of the UFO. All parties agree to the aspects of the summary and were all coherent and sober at the time.<n>

Sunday, July 2nd, 2006 around 6:30 - 7:00 pm a storm was coming in, i went to go close my window and i glanced in the sky a few hundred feet over the building across the street and seen what i thought was a hot air balloon and thinking what are they nuts!?!? flying a balloon in Brooklyn? in a storm? then i got a better look as it flowed towards me and realized, holy $h#* what is that?!?!it was triangular in shape, but reminded me of a stingray fish. very aero dynamic, it was porcelain white in color very shiny, had a bright orange glowing border, and a metallic sphere orb attached at the center bottom of the craft. turned on it side slowly hovering back and forth carefully. all of a sudden a bolt of lightning came sideways from a cloud and hit the metallic sphere. in an instant it made a air burst sound, completely turned bright red orange, then gone. at first i thought it exploded so i kinda jumped back. but it just like magic, disappeared. i freaked out because i always imagined if i did see one, it would be at night, all the way up in the sky flying around with lights. never would i have expected it to be this way. i mean broad daylight, just above the buildings. and i seen it if it were the size of a baseball! right in front of my eyes! everyone should have seen it, it was very large and right there!! i can&#39;t sleep. i can&#39;t stop thinking about it. i can&#39;t stop going to the window out of curiosity. i was afraid to tell anyone for the reason of people thinking im on drugs, or am just crazy! that&#39;s what i would have thought! thank god my girlfriend heard the sound. later on around 10:00 pm i went to the store, i look up in the same area, and see a white orb floating very slow and straight towards the gowanas. i said this can&#39;t be! i shook my head and convinced myself it was a bird or something. then i look again and see a black orb leading 2 more white orbs in a triangle formation and said i must be going crazy!. i walk fast toward the pizza store and the guy asked &#34;you ok?&#34; i said no but if told you i would just be a nut so forget it. the guy said i tell you something people think im crazy that last week i saw a ufo in bensonhurst. i almost had a break down and got this feeling of being in like the twilight zone or dreaming. this cant be happening i said. i told him that is exactly why i am freaking out. so he tells me to tell his friends at work the story i just explained and they all look real scared. they say word for word it was the same story except for the lightning  hitting it. and for a week they were all abusing him about it. so we basically felt a huge sigh of relief. says that his brother seen it as well but did not hear the noise he heard which was strange and could tell that confused him the most. so i go home bugging out and just see and search google not expecting anything to come up, but to my surprise i was not the only one. very similar stories and descriptions all over. my gut tells me it is dimensional. like beings from other dimensions or something. i mean the way it just flashed gone!! like a light switch. the craft honestly was beautiful! perfect! floated like a balloon. like it weighed nothing. i think it was searching for the lightning to give it that charge boost or refueling. it was just moving in a way that it seemed to like get the right spot. like fine tuning a radio station. or harpooning a fish. what i saw was surreal. i mean right there!! in front of me and my eyes! in real time! wow i can&#39;t stop picturing it! it all happened in like not even 1 minute which seemed like 10 min. i was speechless and in shock at the moment. lost for words. and was shaking like a leaf. never would i think i would be one of those people who had a story like this to tell. now i am one of the so called crazy ones. all i have is my sketch of the craft and in my view is a very good one. i know i will always be lookin in the sky from now on. its not the question anymore if they really exist, but what does earth, or the 3rd dimension do they seek or need.  and is the goverment involved? because now i do reserch and see that there are hundreds of sightings per year!! and we deny them. are they here to help, or destroy? too many questions i now have and definitly wont be sleeping tonight! wow is all i keep saying. for the records i got this impression, or feeling that they or it knew i saw this. for what ever reason. hands down the most shocking thing i ever seen. this exp. made me a skywatcher.<n>

I do not want any publicity at all.  I am a 56 year old business professional.  At a family wedding the photographer was taking some infared pictures that bothered him greatly.  I am the last in our family to have the picture but have sent it to multiple friends around the country for use if anything happens to me.  The picture itself shows long and circular vapor trails going around a tree and stopping right in front of the church.  There is an insect or fish looking thing in fron to another tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon close inspection, I was stunned to notice what looks like a disc trying to be invisible above the church.  My son reversed the picture on microsoft paint when the details became much clearer. The scary part is that whenever I was traveling (by air for business) with the picture I kept running into people that were related to the history of these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I met a relative of James Forrestal that told me a frightening story, then a nephew of a guy by the name of ((last name deleted)) who again told me a frightening story.(said his relative&#39;s first name was ((first name deleted)) and he was ((deleted--with a military unit)) in New Mexico in 1947)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event that really affected me was sitting next to two Wright Patterson civilian scientists with creditials that went crazy when they saw the picture. They claimed that they had never seen everything in one picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first question they asked was are you running into people with interest in the same subject matter.  I said yes and they then suggested some rules that I should live by whenever I carry the picture.  The conversation went on for over an hour and I have never traveled with the picture again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also met a DOD guy that began talking about the subject matter and was insistent that I send him a copy of the picture which I never did.  I have no idea what is going on but I just can&#39;t get all of this out of my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, the Wright Patt people shared that they work on cloaking.  I had recently seen an old movie called the Philadelphia Experiment and I asked them if cloaking was anything like that movie and they said yes, do you think we stopped there?  They also suggested that I should not trust anyone in the public eye regarding this subject matter.   I never wanted any of this and quite frankly didn&#39;t believe any of the hype but gentlemen, something is happening to me with this nonsense and I just can&#39;t put it out of my mind.   Can you help me with all of this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will show you the picture if you like.  In case you are wondering, I have never seen one of these things myself that I know of?  Thank you for your time and I really hope that you can help me.  I would be extremely happy to be convinced that it is a camera problem but I still can&#39;t explain the people I kept meeting.<n>

I looked around the window and show flashing white lights. I went up to the window and noticed some aircraft flying. My first thought was a helicopter because it was moving very weirdly. It went left and up and right and up and zig zagged a few times and it moved pretty fast. I pressed my ear tot he window but i didn&#39;t hear any sounds of a helicopter instead it was just silent. I focused hard and noticed with was triangular shaped and it had a red light on each angle. there were white lights flashing but in an irregular patern. I moved away from the window and a couple of minutes later notices white lights flashing right above my house. they stopped and a couple of minutes later they flashed again. This was not the first time I&#39;ve seen this. A couple of days before for a cuple of seconds i saw some red and white lights moving in a zig zag patern out the window, again at night. But they quickly disappeared behind other houses and trees. Again, completely silent.<n>
7/2/06 01:31|Chula Vista campground parking lot, Mt. Pinos|CA|Light|15 seconds|Two white llights accelerating and changing directions in M31 binocular FOV observed from Mt. Pinos|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51215.html|412|ndxe200607| Two white llights accelerating and changing directions in M31 binocular FOV observed from Mt. Pinos<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was observing and photographing all night at my usual dark-sky haunt on top of Mt. Pinos 8350 feet altitude in the Chula Vista campground parking lot.  About a dozen other astronomers were observing or doing astrophotography.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was using my 15 X 70 binoculars (4.3 degrees TFOV) on top of my monopod/mount and was looking at M31, the Andromenda Galaxy, when I noticed two points of light enter the field of vision. They had no apparent diameter, similar to the field stars in the FOV.  I estimate their magnitude at about 8 or 9. They entered the FOV from the left (north-east) with one light leading the other by about half a degree.  At first they were almost on the same track, maybe just slightly offset.  Then the second following light accelerated and pulled abreast and below the first light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time they were basically parallel with each other and about half a degree distance apart. I estimate their speed at about a half arc-minute per second. They stayed like that for about 2-3 seconds and were just below the galaxy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the lower, second light accelerated slightly ahead of the first and then their trajectories started diverging with the lower light rapidly turning downward out of the FOV (eastward) while the top light started slowly rising (westward) out of the FOV.  Needless to say I was amazed at what I was seeing and was yelling to the rest of the crowd (some with binoculars) to quickly look at M31.  I was in a quandary as to which light to follow and I was wildly swinging from one diverging light to the other until I lost both.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I has lost them in the binoculars, I tried to see if I could see something with just my eyes.  I could not see anything near M31.  Limiting magnitude that night was the typical 6.1 for this location.  I am familiar with the behaviour of satellites as this is a very common sight at Pinos with the ISS, Intelsat, HST and Iridium constellation commonly visible.  It was not an Iridium satellite since the lights maintained their magnitude at all times with no dimming or brightening.  It was not any of the common satellites who usually have a much larger visual magnitude and always maintain the same speed and direction across the sky.  The lights had a much greater speed than other satellites that I have observed.  I have never witnessed a satellite changing accelerations and directions.  There were only the single points of white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think they could have been extreme high altitude aircraft since I would think the only visible light from such aircraft would be their exhaust jet which at my observing location would have have been oblique to me.  Also if this was common high altitude aircraft then their speeds would have had to be very great at this long distance to account for my observations of extreme accelerations.  At this time I don&#39;t know what I observed.  Experimental military spacecraft or vehicles of LGM, I don&#39;t know, first time I saw anything out of the ordinary in the night sky. At least I have a story to tell now when the conversation turns to observed wierdness.<n>

We were kind of in the country and traffic was low.  We thought it was strange because we had no idea what it was, and we had never seen anything that bright before.  We found a run-down dirt road off of the pavement to get a closer look.  The orbs were about 10-15 feet in diameter and were amazingly bright.  We have no idea what they were or why they were there.  We did not have a camera with, nor did we go any closer because they were over private property with &#34;No Trespassing&#34; signs posted everywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe it is something for an upcoming 4th of July ceremony, but it was too weird to be normal...

It appeared to be travelling in a slight zig-zag pattern and then stopped and hovered, I estimate between 5-10 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly thereafter, a jet aircraft appeared moving very quickly and I believed that this might be an investigating fighter because of its speed but it continued right on past the red object. It was, I should point out, flying both higher and further away than the object. Within a matter of seconds of this passing, the object descended in a straight line below the trees in the neighborhood and out of sight. I grabbed my video recorder, jumped in my car and headed in that direction but did not find this object again. I have either been an AIr Force brat or active duty myself for all of my 45 years, I believe I know an airplane or helicopter when I see one. And I have seen aircraft on fire with my own two eyes; this object was not on fire. The number of witnesses should be substantial because this siting was near a freeway (I80)which I think westbound must have been pointing almost, if not directly at the object. Highway 12 is also heavily travelled and is about 2 miles closer to the object than I was with nothing but virtually roadless/lightless swamp to its west. This thing was bright; it had to have been noticed.<n>

Inspection with binoculars revealed a sphere covered with a mosaic of white lights, some tubes, some bulbs.  This was about 10:15 PM.  There was a quarter moon, there was a high thin cloud layer with no stars in sight.   Inspection of the sky with binoculars revealed very many small dim lighted objects with the same features as the bright object.  Several times spheres blinking white and red moved fairly rapidly across the sky from south to northeast.  Only one, a white one only and a bit larger than the multicolored ones moved from NE to S.  A couple of planes readily identified as such passed overhead.  The most bizarre event was the appearance (I don’t know where it came from) of a sphere with red lights, about 6-10’ in front of a fir tree on the other side of a grass seed field about 2-3,000 yards away.  It stayed there until I went in about 11:30 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night the brighter-than-anything-else-in-the-sky was at about 45 degrees above the southern horizon with a second, smaller and dimmer, almost directly overhead.  All exhibited the same appearance as those last night.  Only one flashing sphere traveled from south to northeast.  By 10:35 the stars were out in the clear sky, but none as bright as the strange object.  There were no strange red spheres in the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night  I invited my neighbor, ((name deleted)), to join me to verify what I was seeing.  Again the bright object was 45 degrees up and again there was a smaller one directly overhead.  ((name deleted)) confirmed the lighting configuration and the existence of several objects seen only through binoculars.  The sky was brilliantly clear showing off the stars which even without binoculars looked different than the lighted object.  We saw on sphere blinking red and white, but it remained stationary, no traveling spheres and no strange red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be watching tonight<n>

7/1/06 20:00|Leesville|SC|Other|20 seconds|radial light seen as two object separate in night sky|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57402.html|420|ndxe200607| Radial light seen as two object separate in night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a year ago I was visiting with my neighbor at the time standing in the yard talking when we noticed what I thought up until today really was two airplanes converging.  They came together for a while and then we saw a burst of light going our into a radial pattern that almost resembled a large flash and the expected burst of a firework shot.  This had to be several miles away and up and the burst would have to be fairly large.  After the burst of light went out in the almost perfect symmetrical pattern, the two lights separated and moved away from each other until they were out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both wondered what in the world it could be and I surmised that it must have been a jet doing a mid-air refuel and maybe the fuel upon separation caused the light.  I had not really thought about it in a while until watching a show this evening reminded me of the event.  The radial burst was so vivid that it makes me wonder what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Not metal.  No sound and it was pretty close to a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up in the sky and I saw what looked to me (I am not trained) a military jet and just beneath it I saw what looked like a white/opal/colored sphere.  It was going pretty fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it may have been a weather balloon but after much thought it was moving much too fast for that.   crazy don&#39;t you think?   I never believed in UFO&#39;s.  Made fun of people that did.  Maybe it was something that the military is working on????<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
7/1/06 13:35|Buffalo|MN|Disk|45 sec|These were not  fireworks|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51193.html|422|ndxe200607| These were not  fireworks<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were outside with two other cuples and there son when three disc shaped objects moved towards our home from a distance. There were alot of fireworks going off that night,and we were unsure what it may be until they contiued to move closer it was our belief that it was an ufo they moved closer until they were about 200 feet from us and about half mile above. They hovered over us for nearly a minute and then in the blink of an eye they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I work consruction and we had to poor cement at 6:00 am. As i walked around to the driver side door of my truck, a light in the sky got my attention. At first i thought it was a holicopter but i looked again and the object was not moving but only spinning. it seemed like it had 2 lights as if searching for something moving left to right, and the right to left. the object was a disk shaped and dark, the sun hadn&#39;t risen yet so it was still a little dark. after about 2 minutes the strangest thing happened. as i was watching, the craft formed a cloud around it as to be hidden. i could still see the glowing light behind or in the cloud. but the light faded away. it was odd looking because it was the only cloud in the sky. the cloud soon faded away as well. my boss which was driving seen the same thing. and a guy at the job sight seen the same as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I saw a spinning disc flying N over the ridge line.  It had flashing lights that were spinning around flashing different colors.  It made a 90 degree turn W over the higher temple hall. Then it turned due north over the next big peak and sped out of sight.  I got scared and got up to run back to the kitchen door. The monk was up having tea.  I told him I just saw a ufo.  He believed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/1/06 01:00|McMinnville|OR|Circle|15 minutes|UFO seen above hills in McMinnville Oregon- (2 witness see UFO 5+ occasions-)|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60395.html|425|ndxe200607| UFO seen above hills in McMinnville Oregon- (2 witness see UFO 5+ occasions-)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was honored enough to have seen a UFO before this incident. So, I feel blessed writing this. I am scared about talking too much about this. A friend of mine and I were star-gazing at his home in the hills of McMinnville- Which is miles up into the forest. We had noticed this bright star. Similar to the one I saw a few years earlier. But this wasnt blue as that one was. This was almost metal. It shined like a big ball of aluminum foil.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it bob up and down for about 15 minutes. It would jet from one part of the sky to the next. And seemed almost unstable. Kept wobbling as it hovered. It did little designs as it flew. Almost like seeing how it flew in our atmosphere. Very much like trying to drive on ice...it seemed strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my lighter out and flicked it. And the crafts glow got really bright when I did that. CONTACT!!! It saw me and it was very much like Close Enounters....It was INTENSE!! I was crying from shock- I felt suddenly very emotional and got very sleepy and we tried to talk about it later and couldnt hardly speak words about it- We would literally stutter....and it still is hard to talk about! Ever since, I have been drawn to the subject strongly- Almost spiritually-  As my friend went to get a coat for me...it burst out of sight. WE have seen this craft or one like it over 5 times. And I keep going back to see it and once in a while its still there...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks- And Again- I take a personal oath to my intent and truth-<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

7/1/06 00:00|Decatur|MI|Light|15-20 minutes|Star like objects moving rapidly through night sky.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56228.html|426|ndxe200607| Star like objects moving rapidly through night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At appoximately 12 am I happened to look outside &amp; saw what appeared to be a really bright star or planet in the horizon.   I sat looking at it for a few minutes, only to notice that it was moving.  I continued watching it, thinking that it might be a plane.  As I was watching, it suddenly disappeared &amp; reappeared much closer to the house.  It was moving too fast to be a plane.  So I went outside to see if I could get a better look.  I then saw it disappear then reappear much farther away.  It remained motionless at that point, then much to my disbelief more lights appeared until they were 5-7 of them.  They remained motionless, somewhat lined up, approximately the height that planes fly.  Then one would disappear &amp; reappear farther away in a matter of seconds. I recall them changing colors, red, blue &amp; yellow as well. Each of these lights continued to do this for approximately 15 minutes until they all vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live out in the country with only one yard light, so it was almost pitch black.  These objects looked like stars, but moved.  There were no blinking lights as one would expect on a plane, plus the speed at which they were traveling was much too fast for an airplane.  I happened to ask my 16 year old son one day if he has noticed the lights to the West of us.  He replied yes.  He then described exactly what I saw plus he didn&#39;t think they could be planes either.  I have seen these lights multiple times and so has my son.  We don&#39;t live near any airports either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
