He flew B-17’s out of England during World War II.  He has enthralled the family for years telling of his riveting encounter with a UFO while flying on a post-war mission.  And this, coming from a man famous for skepticism!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This round, fiery orb – resembling what one would see looking into the tail-pipe of a fighter jet taking off - suddenly appeared off Dad’s wing tip and tracked with them in the night sky, then sped  forward at technically-impossible speed.  Dad said the cockpit was lit up so brightly that it was possible to read print - it caused them both to turn to see the source of light.  My Dad and his co-pilot were so dumbfounded that neither of them spoke about what they had witnessed.  Then, the object returned 30 minutes later!  (Much detail left out.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given my dad’s advanced age, I’m feeling the urgency of capturing his story before the opportunity is lost forever.  Please, make suggestions.  I take it these types of sightings are no longer considered rare, but my dad’s credentials and credibility are sterling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS  I am very unsure of the time, date or location of Dad&#39;s sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

6/30/54 15:00|Pasadena|CA|Circle|5 minutes|An incandescent white circular object passed over Pasadena, CA and ejected a smaller version of itself.|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69531.html|2|ndxe195406| An incandescent white circular object passed over Pasadena, CA and ejected a smaller version of itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This UFO (meaning Unidentified Flying Object) sighting occurred in the four-year interval starting mid-year 1952 to mid-year 1956. I was 16 to 20  years old at the time.  I am now 73.  The observation occurred in Pasadena, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother was working  in her garden behind our house in mid-afternoon on a beautiful sunny day.  There were no clouds, the sky was blue, and there were no winds.  She called me to come out of the house because there was something in the sky she wanted me to see.  Her voice was urgent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to my mother (now deceased), the Unidentified Flying Object was heading South, made a 90 degree left-hand turn and then was headed East.  When I came out, it was headed East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was incandescent white, like a light bulb, and had a perfectly circular cross-section.  There was no exhaust of any kind or any vapor trail. It was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was flying very close to a jet aircraft.  After 50+ years, I’m not completely  sure of the following, but I believe that the object was trailing the jet aircraft and to its right.  I could see very clearly the swept wings of the jet aircraft, one jet engine under each wing, the two horizontal tail stabilizers, and the fuselage. When jets fly at 35000 feet, you can hardly see them. This one was much closer, possibly 10000 to 15000 feet. If you placed the circular object on top of the jet, I believe it would be just large enough to cover up the jet. Since the direction and distance from the jet to  the UFO did not change, I believe both were at the same altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the UFO was traveling  toward the eastward horizon, it ejected a smaller version of itself (maybe one-quarter of the diameter, incandescent white, circular cross section) to the South. It moved South through a 30 to 45 degree arc in about 3 seconds. It stopped at this point and just faded away. Possibly because it was moving radially away from me. The jet aircraft and the main UFO continued until they disappeared over the eastern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this UFO. It was either from this Earth or it was not. I wish I knew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be exceptionally capable as a witness.  PD))<n>

This happened in 1954.  I was 17 years old.  I was with 2 friends, coming home from somewhere.  One girl lived across the street from me, the other was coming home with me to spend the night.  The night was pleasant, and we dilly dallied as we walked.  Was the time of year it was dark between 8 pm and 9 pm.  We were stopped, they were talking, while i looked up into the sky, and my sight was drawn to a light which, if still, would have looked no different than a star, but it was moving.  So i thought it curious, and watched.  It was moving left to right, or north to south, seemingly very fast, tho i couldn&#39;t gauge the distance.  It did seem extremely far out there, not a nearby airplane.  And there was no sound.  For it to be any further away than a local small airplane, meant it was going extremely fast.  I said to my friends, &#34;I think i see a flying saucer.&#34;  In those days that&#39;s what we called them, not knowing the term &#34;ufo&#34;.  They ! told me it was an airplane. I said it was going too fast to be an airplane.  They said it was a meteor then.  I said it wasn&#39;t going that fast.  They told me i was not seeing a flying saucer because they do not exist.  I looked away for a while, then looked back up to the area in which i&#39;d seen the light.  It was there, but it had changed directions, and was larger and brighter than an ordinary star.  It was moving more slowly, and instead of moving north to south it was coming westward, at a slower pace.  I said to my friends, &#34;I think it&#39;s coming towards us.&#34;  They both screamed and ran towards home. I really wanted to watch to see what the light was going to do, but the told me to &#34;come&#34; and &#34;hurry&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So the girl that was staying overnight and i ran to my house. But that was not all that happened that night.  I don&#39;t know if you want to hear this part.  It involves, not a ufo but what must have been an abduction.  Me.  I questioned my friend the next morning.  Too afraid to mention it to my mother.  &#34;Did i miss out on some activity, or goings on during the night? too tired to wake up?&#34;  I asked her.  She said  &#34;not that i know of, I slept well and didn&#39;t hear anything.&#34;  She was not in my room, but in a spare room during the night.  The things i was remembering involved activity, moving around, and - flying in and out the window.  I didn&#39;t want to mention the part about flying to anyone, not even my friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is all i can recall of this event.  I&#39;m 75 now and have had other experiences but this event is the only one in which i may have actually seen a ufo.  I could tell about an alien encounter, but not at this time.<n>

USA<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 25,1954, I was visiting my family, who lived in the middle of the country, in Thrifty, Texas.  My husband and I had a travel trailer, which was parked on the south side of the family house.  The night was clear and there were no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 4:00 AM, I went outside to go to the restroom.  I looked into the northern sky, and I saw a red circle of light.  It was not pulsating or making a noise.  It was about one mile in front of me hanging over the old oil well pumps.  At first, I thought someone put up a light, but suddenly the red circle of light shot straight up and stopped, and then about 2-3 seconds later it shot, at a 45 degree angle, to the north leaving a red trail.<n>

My cousin, looking out the driver&#39;s side, commented on the full moon. I was looking out the passenger window, observing a much larger object, moon-like in shape which was hovering over the hangers. It began moving, slowly at first, in a straight line, accelerating as a group of 3 F-101 Voodoos began chasing it. The object made 2 90-degree turns and &#34;floated&#34; back to initial position. Minutes later, a group of 3 F-100 Super Sabres did likewise, but the object made 2 spectacular 180-degree turns, then soared directly upward until it disappeared.<n>

I believe it was an experience that greatly impressed her and the story was substantially the same at both tellings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was approximately 24 months old (born 1/16/52)my Mom and Dad and I lived in the two upstairs rooms of my grandparent&#39;s house in Virginia.  At that time the area was very rural.  My Mom said that she woke up one night after midnight and I was crying.  She was also aware of a loud buzzing sound like bees.  She went to the crib and tried to quiet me but was unsuccessful.  She began to become frightened and the noise was intensifying and hurt her ears.  She tried to awaken my father unsuccessfully.  She said that her thought was that the noise was coming from a UFO. (I guess they were often in the papers at that time.)  She thought of going to the window to look but was frightened and reports feeling they did not want her to look.  Eventually she picked me up and rocked me until the noise gradually faded.  When the noise stopped I stopped crying and, eventually she went back to sleep.  The next morning at breakfast she tried to tell the family about the experience but was ridiculed.  Nobody else heard anything. However, when the paper came that day the headline story was about UFOs over Washington.  The one thing that doesn&#39;t make sense to me is the date.  Apparently the date of the big DC sighting was July 1952 when I would have been only 6 months old.  I was in my early twenties the first time Mom told me about this.  It is possible she got the dates wrong or was confusing the Langly AFB chase, which I believe also made headlines with the Washington sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also seems that the way she discribes my behavior, simply crying might be more characteristic of a very young baby that a two year old.  I spoke quite well by the time I was two.  In any case when Mom told me this story again this summer and was so consistent I thought it was worth recording.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Riding in the car with my brother-inlaw driving, my sister riding in the front passenger seat, I was sitting in the back of a 1948 Plymouth. We were heading to a wedding breakfast at a place caalled Naamans&#39;Teahouse on the corner of Naamans rd (rt. 92)and Philadelphia pike (rt 13)As we turned onto the driveway of the Teahouse and parked Igot out of the car (it was a four door)I stood up and was facing toward the Delaware River. There is a refinery ( Sun oil Co, In Marcus Hook Pa.)Where the Teahouse is located  on the border of Pa. &amp; De about a mile north of where were. I barely had time to say look!! to my brother-law And out a bright white cloud came this huge almost silver disk shaped object. It was headed torward our direction maybe about 600 ft in the air.     From our vantage point it traveled about maybe 2 miles toward a stand of trees. No soone had we saw it, it bcame ghostlike, as it headed toward a bank of puffy white clouds and became invisible again. This of course was before &#34;Star Trek&#34; and how the used a cloaking device. If it was possible to have seen this craft up close, it would have been at least 300 ft in diameter.I said to my brother-inlaw did you see that? He said yeah! I said do we report it? he said nah, no one would believe us anyway. That was nearly 50 yaers ago and I have never forgotten that incident or how the UFO looked.I&#39;m 66 years old now and live about 2 miles from the Naamans Teahouse and will always visualize that craft when I pass by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is retired from the aerospace industry.

I was probably 7 or 8 years old at the time.  The address where we lived was XXX Downing Street.  A brand new housing project in Palm Beach.  My father was a career Marine which is why we were in that part of the country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the back yard playing and my mother was hanging clothes on the line.  Suddenly, we both noticed several bright lights high in the sky.  As I recall it was late morning and since I was home at the time I can only assume it was summer.  No school or I wouldn&#39;t have been there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All we could see were the lights.  No shapes were seen.  They flew a bit eratic (up and down motion) and not in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember asking my mother what they were and I remember her saying, &#34;Oh, nothing to worry about&#34;.  At that young age I had all the faith in the world in my parents and always took their word as exactly that.  I went back to playing and that was all there was too it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have reviewed all your postings during the early 1950&#39;s and have seen nothing similar to what we witnessed.

Our personal experience with an UFO was in Estes Park, Colorado, somewhere around 1952-1957 (truthfully, I am not sure of the date), but I was around 8-10 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived on a small ranch on South St. Verain Rd, about 3 miles out of the town of Estes.  It was in the evening, it was dark outside.  My mom was in bed with the mumps, my brother was laying on his bed reading.  My dad and I were in the kitchen doing dishes from dinner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother’s bed sat along the south wall with the foot of the bed next to a window looking south out to our horse pasture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of us a sudden, my brother, approximately age 13-15, started screaming for us to come.  We all ran into his bedroom and saw an extremely bright white light coming through his bedroom window from an aircraft floating above the tall pine trees.  It came from a ship, for want of a better word, that looked like the fuselage of a large airplane but there were no wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft was about the size of a smallish to medium size commercial aircraft.  It looked to be metallic silver and there was absolutely no sound coming to us from the open windows.  The lack of sound is the one thing that has stayed in my mind all these years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not sure how long we stood there and stared at it--it did not move at all.  Then, suddenly, it moved upward--we could then see a glow kind of like a lit cigar but no flames coming from the back, still no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it reached a certain altitude, it went toward Twin Sisters Mountain and then continued on through a gap in the mountains in the general direction of Boulder/Denver, Colorado.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked with my brother recently to refresh what we remember.  He said that the fire lookout people stationed on top of Twin Sisters also reported it and that the Rocky Mountain Newspaper reported that the nearby Air Force Base sent airplanes up after it was reported in the Boulder/Denver area.  He remembers reading that the planes could not keep up with the UFO and lost sight of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom called the Police Chief in Estes Park, and his only comment was, &#34;Don’t tell anyone what you saw.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She did tell our neighbors to the northwest of us.  They seemed to believe us but didn’t say much at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3 years later, we moved to Longmont, Colorado. One night after we were there a few months, our Estes Park neighbor lady called us and said she had seen the same thing that night.  She had picked up her daughter from a school dance and was driving back out to the country area we lived in when her headlights hit an object crossing the road in front of her.  (This was pretty deserted country at that time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said the description we had given her about our UFO fit this one exactly.  She seemed very upset and scared when talking about her experience.  I do not know if she reported it to the police or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any information of other sightings, that fits the area of time period or in this area, we would be most interested in hearing about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

My route took me south on Pomona three blocks to Eureka and I turned left on Eureka to go up the slight incline to Colusa which would take me to As I came up to the intersection of Eureka and Colusa, I looked up and noticed two large stret he horizon.  Having lived int he area all my like, I noticed the two lights were close together, and in  strange place close to the hill horizon. I stopped to wat5ch and noticed that the lights began moving upward, together. The moved off into the night sky at a 45° angle and when they had reatched a place high in the sky, I suddenly noticed that there were about 6 - 8 little star like lights dartging about in the sky behind the double ligthts.  I was absolutely fascinated.  asuddenly, all the little lights sped toward the two big lights and went in the lights.  I concluded the two lights were a mother ship and the little UFOs went into the mother ship. when I told about my experience at JC, another young womans siad she saw the same thing. She lived in El Sobrante which is about 10 miles north of El Cerrito.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date.  Source is anonymous.  PD))<n>

Object, 3&#39; long, crystal type cylinder, pinkish color came in fast from the East and hovered over me for 5-10 mins.  A light glowed over me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m trying to find out if anyone else has ever seen an object of this shape and color. I was playing in back yard when the object suddenly came in and hovered over me 15&#39;up. It was small, pulsing shades of pink and sort of cylinder shaped, but more like a crystal, some areas clear.  At first I was startled and afraid, but then a pinkish light came over me and I didn&#39;t feel afraid any more.  I remember a humming sound.  My mother was also outside using the outhouse (we lived on a farm in rural central IL).  She came up to me later after the object had quickly flown out of site.  I was very excited and asked her if she had seen the pretty pink light.  She said no and thought I was &#34;playing a game. This has bugged me for years.  I know what I saw.  I have only told a few of my friends who I trust, but they said I was very young, so probably didn&#39;t happen (non UFO believers). I was 4, not in kindergarten yet.  We didn&#39;t even have a TV then.  All the pictures I have seen of UFO&#39;s do not look anything like what I saw.  Do you know anyone who has seen something similar?  Please let me know by e-mail if it&#39;s not too much trouble.  I know this is not a very exciting &#34;sighting&#34; for you, but I don&#39;t know where else to turn to get information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

At the end of the driveway was a barn.  It was in the early morning while my parents were still asleep I climbed up on a dresser to look out the window.  I saw two objects sitting in mid-air next to the barn roof.  The two of them together were the same size as the barn. The closest one was shaped like a disk with a round ball in the middle of the top.  The other one was shaped like a top. There were no lights or markings on either.  They were silver/gray and not shiny.  After I realized they didn&#39;t belong there I turned to call to my father, and when I turned back they were gone.  Every time I see a picture of a top or the planet Saturn I am reminded of this childhood experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approxiate.

Comming out of the mess hall I saw a circular object, in line with the runway, appearing like brushed aluminum at about 3000 feet.  It was early evening and I said to myself that perhaps its a ballon.  I looked just above the object, but there were several stars above the object. I left and went into the barracks. Several months later I took a course in communications.  The person teaching the course used the UFO as an example of an incident that percipitated the use of a &#34;Flash priority&#34; message to the Pentagon. He stated that flash priority is used only in cases of national emergency and that it was the first time that flash priority had been used at Ramey AFB since WWII.  It is my understanding that aircraft, in this case the B-36 had not been able to land and aircraft had been diverted to LA. The person giving the course did not explain.  He talked about it as if everyone in the class was familiar with the incident.  I take from that that the whole base was familiar with this UFO.
