The craft approached from due east just above the Boca inlet at appox. 100 m.p.h.(estimated) and as it approached it performed a complete 360 degree barrel roll within 50&#39;, giving my other witness and I complete and unobsturctive view of the top of the craft. Close enough to notice no rivets were used to hold the plates together. One aspect that should be noted ; (there was no sound) a third member of our party was at least 10 to 15 feet closer up the sand dunes than ((initials of witness #2 deleted)) and I were, and yet he saw nor heard anything! Roll your lips into a big &#34;O&#34; and blow ; sounds just like a U.F.O. to me!

I looked up and saw a cylindrical shaped object with rotating lights hovering over me at about the heighth of the telephone poles.  I stood in the middle of the street for about 20 seconds just watching it and it took a deep dip and sped away in 1/2 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued on to my babysitting job, and while there got very ill and threw-up a couple of times.  I decided no one would believe me then, so I never told anyone until now.  I also lived very close to the Los Alamitos Air Base at the time and I decided there was some experimental stuff going on...obviously to justify what I saw.  I have since talked with many engineers who have informed me that we did not have and still do not have the technology that I describe here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On this route between Millers Falls and Greenfield are towers or high intensity electrical wires that drape across the landscape for miles. Just off the highway at about 50 feet, we saw an unusual figure at the   base of one of these steel towers.  The shape looked human (two arms and two legs) however, the whole body glowed.  Imagine a dark room and you are flipping channels on the TV - the figures resembled the &#34;snow&#34; on the &#34;inbetween&#34; channels of a tv.  It was so bright.  We stopped our car at the edge of the road.  It started to walk toward us - we were petrified and quickly left.  Looking behind you can see the figure twisting to follow our departure.  We promised never to tell anyone for fear that people would think we were nuts.  Some weeks later, that same sighting was reported in the Enquirer solidifying that we would really never tell anyone.  However, must exposure  today warrants me telling my story without fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in March 1972 is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a clear starry night, comfortable temps.  I thought I&#39;d seen a star go out and mentioned it.  As we watched,  it came back on, repeating this on a few seconds then off.    It approached to about 50 yards out in the gulf, dropped to the water,  raised back up,  came in to where the water (calm) met the shore.  Hovered about 30 feet away from us, 10 feet off the ground, silently. It was spherical and just smaller than a soccer ball.  We stood up,  I took one step to go look closer, it took off in an arc to the sky westward, must have covered 3 miles in a second or better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later, I was contacted by my friend and I asked her to recount the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She still had the same story I had, except that as we stood.

Because of the moon light I could make out a dark object hovering and moving about.  As we got within about 5 miles the object lit up a part of the hill side with a light that did not look like any light I had ever seen.  The light was not instantaneous but moved toward the ground and then would go back up again.  It was also a differant color than one might imagine from a search light.  I woke up one of my sisters and pointed the object out.  We were within a mile of the hill now and the object(possibly round?) was moving around and occasionally shining the light downward.  As we got within a half a mile it rose approx. 500ft from the 100ft it was at and then accelerated at incredible speed SSW and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We had happened to look up at the stars so that I can see if the Planet Venus was out that night?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Meanwhile, while we were stargazing, there was this odd looking airship that had neither any wings nor any propellers on it.  It was in a shape of a bottom of an ice-cream bowl. it made a low gargle-ling humming sound.  It had started to floated eastward towards by Midway Airport, and then this object had flown out west just like a shooting star.  And we’ve never seen it again. My grandma said that it was a shooting star, but I saw it different, it was more of a strange object to me rather than a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back then, I was 12-years-old at the time back in 1972, we were living over on xxrd and Oak Park Ave. I was living with my grandmother at the time, because my mother had passed away in 1970  During that time frame my life was much different than any other ordinary child, due to my handicap disability my experiences were un-explainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Up til this day I often have nightmares about UFOs and that day that we&#39;ve seen this strange looking thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

He lives a few short miles outside of Scottsville, Kentucky.  This man is still alive today, and he is in his middle 70&#39;s now.  He has always told us this same astonishing story over and over again many times over the years, and his story is always the same with great detail involved.  Recently, he told me this same amazing story again just like he has so many times before in the past.  So I decided to share his fantastic story with you.  While this story is really bizarre to say the least, I do strongly believe that it actually happened.  I have seen UFO&#39;s myself, so I can relate to his unique experience.  This is no lie on my part either-just the truth.  According to this man, one night back in 1972 (estimated year), he was sleeping in his home when all of a sudden his children came into the house from outside yelling for him to get up.  Thay were terrified about something outside and wanted him to come and see it for himself.  They yelled at him telling him that he would not believe it.  After he had finally awakened, he at first noticed that the inside of their house was really bright and lit up for some reason.  He realized that something was causing this to happen from outside.  His dogs were in an uproar too.  He hurriedly got dressed and went outside with his family to see what was happening.  To their astonishment they could clearly see off in the near distance a large glowing disk proceeding to land out in a field directly in front of their house.  The disk had different colored lights rotating all around it-sort of in a swirling motion.  It did land, and it just sat there for half and hour or so glowing brightly.  He and his family just stood there in shock at what they were witnessing.  After they had observed this huge disk for the lenght of time mentioned above, the disk then began to lift up slowly from the ground and just flew away at a tremendous rate of speed.  The disk never at any time during this sighting made any sound at all either.  As a believer in UFO&#39;s, I did want to share his story with you.  What this all means is a mystery to me.  I wish to remain anonymous, and I do thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  Source of report elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>
3/1/72 23:30|Salinas|CA|Cigar|2 - 3 min.|Huge object. At least 2 football fields long. Altitude approx. 500 ft. Observed moving slowly westerly direct. No lights. No sound. Und|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05724.html|9|ndxe197203| Huge object. At least 2 football fields long. Altitude approx. 500 ft. Observed moving slowly westerly direct. No lights. No sound. Underlit by city lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting took place in the early seventies, in Salinas, California.  I think I was about 15 or so.  It late and I didn&#39;t feel like going to bed, so I decided to do some stargazing.  I grabbed a soda, and tossed a folding chaise lounge chair up onto the garage roof to lay back on.  After being up there for a short time, I noticed movement in the eastern sky.  It was not a moving point of light that I saw, but rather an area of stars being blocked out by a huge object moving slowly across the night sky.  At first I thought it was a blimp, but quickly dismissed this when I realized that it was much too large.  The best way to describe the object is to say that it looked much like a naval battleship turned upside down, only a little more rounded at the ends.  It displayed no lights of it&#39;s own, but I was able to observe the underside as it had become dimly lit by the city lights.  The thing that was really weird about this craft, was the fact that it moved in total silence.  At one point, it was no more than 500 feet almost directly above me. I heard nothing from it.  The object continued moving slowly in a westerly direction towards the ocean, and disappeared from sight.     I am 42 years old, married 18 years, and the father of six.  Up until now, the only people I&#39;ve told of this were my parents, my wife and kids, and my best friend.  I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;ve ever been abducted, but when I think back, there were some pretty weird things that happened to me during my childhood.  I can remember being scared in the middle of the night, and getting out of bed.  I remember looking down the darkened hallway, and seeing a small figure backlit at the end of the hall.  I remember the figure appearing startled.  I didn&#39;t recall anything after that, and dismissed it as a dream. When I awoke in the morning.  Another time, I awoke in the middle of the night to see a small hooded figure kneeling by my bed.  When I moved, the figure stood up.  It was wearing a long, hooded robe, much like what a monk would wear.  In ! the darkness, I could not see a face.  This really freaked me out, and I snatched the covers up over my head.  The next morning, I asked my parents if either of them had checked on me during the night.  They said they had not.  My mom said that maybe it was an angel, so that&#39;s what I told myself to keep sane as I grew up.  The last weird thing I&#39;d like to mention about my childhood, is a small metallic object I noticed under the skin of my outer thigh.  I say it was metallic, as it was just under the skin to the point where I could tell it was grey metal color.  I don&#39;t remember how it got there.  I remember telling my friends that it was there from getting shot with a pellet gun, and that he pellet was still there, although in fact, I was never shot.  the small &#34;thing&#34; is gone now, and there is no scar.  I&#39;ve never really put all this weird stuff together until the last 10 or 15 years.  I kind of look at it as all being pretty circumstantial.  I have, and do experience sleep paralysis from time to time.  I know what that is.  REALLY scary, but I don&#39;t remember being beamed up to a mothership or any of that stuff.  I&#39;ve lived a pretty normal, relatively uneventful life.  I&#39;ve got some baggage, like most people do, but nothing related to my sighting and the few unexplained occurrences of my childhood.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m an abductee or anything.  If I am, I don&#39;t think I want to know the details !<n>
