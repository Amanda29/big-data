It was overcast when I suddenly remembered that the news said that a comet would be visible on Christmas day and that it could be the same one seen by the wise men.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and I saw a ball of blue light come out of the clouds and back into the clouds.  I saw the ball that was covered with blue flames, really beautiful like an aquamarine gemstone.  I could see the flames licking the surface of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my mom but of course it was gone.  I felt very fortunate to have seen the comet.  I wasn&#39;t until a decade or more later that I thought, wait a minute, a comet isn&#39;t low enough to be in the clouds and it was traveling slowly.  I could have been my active imagination maybe.  If so then the mind is an incredible thing.  I saw it as clearly as any object is see before me now.<n>

Of particular note was the rootbeer metalic color of the craft. I have since seen such metalic colored material on 5 inch wide ribbon cabling used on experimental micro wave missiles. This area is very near a military airbase. Moffett field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft remained motionless and no noise was heard. It was as if it was hovering very still as observations were being made. After approx 10 minutes of viewing the craft, I went into the store. When I returned 45 minutes later, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
