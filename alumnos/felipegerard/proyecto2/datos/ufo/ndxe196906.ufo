Multiple objects which appeared to be about 2.5 times bigger than the evening star suddenly appeared from the North moving rapidly across the sky to the South side of Durban.  There movement was extremely erractic and they zig zagged accross the sky and vanished.

Emitted dots (in data-style format) from side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never reported this, but if I could find some of my old neighbors, I&#39;m sure someone else could confirm this, as many of us saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began very high in the sky as a bright light (apparently the setting sun reflecting from it). Many of us were outside because it was warm weather, didn&#39;t get dark until late...us kids playing back in the days when you had three channels on TV and all doors and windows open because no one had air conditioning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object descended very slowly, but was in a straight down descent...no shaking or moving otherwise. It eventually settled right over our street (Phillips Drive) and was huge. It sat there for several minutes. Strange how there were no airplanes going to Weir Cook Airport during the duration of this sighting...usually, we could expect a jet to fly over every 3-10 minutes...they would get low enough to rattle the windows because we were very close to the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many adults and children stood in their yards watching as word spread quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft was directly over my front yard. It was silver in color. At one point, I distinctly saw what looked like six dots (we didn&#39;t have computers then, but now I know it looked like computer data) emitted from the left side of the vessel. They were in perfect order.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the dots were emitted, the object began a very slow ascent, in the same pattern it had followed downward: straight up, gradually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually it ascended from our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think everyone on our street made phone calls trying to find out what it was. Dad called the airport and they said it was a weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it wasn&#39;t a weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m now 45 years old and I have never forgotten this experience. I&#39;m a lifelong community journalist and have seen a lot of things, but I have never seen anything to match this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I could find someone in the old neighborhood who remembers it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Lauderdale from Miami, I saw what appeared to be two stars in the4 distant sky above the trees. (About 9:30 p.m.) I watched as they moved upwards gtom their position and met, becoming one star. Later I wrote Isaac Asimov of this and he replied that &#34;Stars are too far away to show motion I do not know what you saw, but it wasm&#39;t atsrs. Then I wrote David O. Woodbury, author of &#34;The Glass Giant of Palomar&#34; (Dodd, Mead), 1963), and he replied, saying that I  saw Venus. He said thsat this planet has strange appearances, looking differant at differant times through the atmosphere, aAND SOMETIMES APPEARS TO BE TWO PLANETS and in strange colors. (Asimov had said in a followup that &#34;Sun, atmosphere and dust are all necessary  in earth conditions.) Morris K. essup has written that there is a &#34;neutraL ZONE&#34;  somewhere between the sun and earth, and hen it is feasible that space people ot objects could utilize this neutral gravitational/magnetic field (or plane) for such materialization. This agrees with Ruth Montgomery&#39;s gides who maintain that space people come from all over the universe invisibly taking no time to do so (by thought travel), and then they materialise within our atmosphere. Timothy Good in his book, &#34;Above Top Secret&#34; quoted a scientist who studied under Einstein, saying that nations and governments have no weapon against  the paranormal, and thus must keep this UFO information secret (evidently so people will not think we earthlings are under the control of Extra- terrestrials. However several former military men anonymously have written that our government ,ade a secret agreement with ETs receiving scientific information and knowledge in exchange for abductees for their &#34;study&#34;, however it was found that they are abducting more than agreed upon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Noe:  Witness states a precise date for the incident, but we wonder if that is the case.<n>

6/21/69 23:00|Ronkonkoma|NY|Unknown|1 hour|A unidentified craft with multi-colored lights that hovered silently and could move at Incredible speeds,|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46479.html|12|ndxe196906| A unidentified craft with multi-colored lights that hovered silently and could move at Incredible speeds,<n> <n><n> <n><n> A teenage friend (age 18) and myself (age17) were lying in the grass on our backs in a school playground at about 11:00 PM at night.  After a short conversation about the days events, my friend ((name deleted)) pointed to a cloudless sky and  told me that he learned about  the location and names of constellations in Science class and began pointing out the Little Dipper and the names of certain other star formations for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As our eyes were scanning the horizion,  my friend happened to notice 3 colored lights that appeared to be close by.  It was dark of course,  but I would estimate the lights to be about two miles away and about one mile high above the ground.  We were with-in 5 miles of an airport,  so the occasional appearence of multi-colored lights of small aircraft in the sky was not unusal,  and  we agreed that this is probably what the lights were and continued to scan the night sky looking for other interesting constellations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes later, my friend looked to the horizon again and brought to my attention that the multi-colored lights were still in the same place as they were before.  We naturally thought that this was very odd,  but decided that it was either another airplane traveling the same flight path or the same plane had circled and just happened to be in the same location that we were looking.  We quickly went back to obsevering the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some time later,  about 20 minutes,  I happened to look in the direction of what we both dismissed as a airplane sighting,  and again,  in the very same place and of the exact orintation, I saw the same multi-colored lights.  I quickly brought it to the attention of my friend and together we tried to come up with a rational explanation as to why and how an object could suspend itself in the air in the same exact place.  I finally  came to the conclusion that it must be a helicopter,  but my friend reminded me that heliocopters are extemely noisey and it was a very quiet night with no breezes.  If the object was a helicopter, we would definitely hear the sound of the motor and rotor blades.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both became very puzzled,  and our attention was now focused directly on the object for about 10 minutes.  As we stared at the lights, I strained to make out some kind of outline or silhouette of the object, but I could not see any discernable shape because the object seemed to absorb what little light was available and blend into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as we were discussing what this thing could be, it suddenly moved at tremendous speed to our left at a 45 degree angle, upward about 5 miles in the sky, paused for a brief second, and then shot straight upwards  to the very outer  stratosphere of the Earth,... then stoopped,  hovered,  appearing as a point of light for a second,  and then suddenly  propelling itself into deep space at an even faster speed than I had ever seen any man-made aircraft accelerate to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I looked at each other in astonishment,... all we could say to eachother is &#34;Woa&#34;,... &#34;What was that?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day we told all are friends.  Some of are friends believed us,  but most did not.  However,  those that did not believe us, could not come up with an explanation either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in my 50&#39;s now,  but I will never forget the experience, and the memory of it is still fresh in my mind like it happened yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the age of 17 years old, I was a (&#34;I don&#39;t believe it, unless I see it&#34;) kind of a young man, and I cerntainly did not  believe in extraterrestial spacecraft, but after this 1969 sighting, I soon changed my opinion..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident may be approximate.

In fact, I&#39;m not sure of the exact date except that it was either in 1969 or 1970, late in the evening (it was also reported in The Washington Post the next day as an experimental aircraft).  What prompted me to report this is the recent Sarasota, FL incident, where a man reported seeing a huge blimp-like craft near Myakka.  He described it hovering above him.  I began to think about what I had seen and decided to say something.... I was driving west on Rt. 50 toward Fairfax.  My friend and I both spotted this thing &#34;hovering&#34; over Rt. 50, with lights that seem to revolve around the center of it.  We slowed down to look at it.  It looked like a blimp, but wasn&#39;t.  It made no noise.  Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t stick around to observe it better.  But, I am sure this was no experimental craft.  I have never forgotten this incident and I have never seen anything like it since.  I spend a lot of time in Sarasota and from now on, I am going to spend a lot of time outdoors in the wee hours of the morning.  If you should know anything about this incident, I would love to hear about it.  Thank you for listening.

There was a pleasant breeze out of the south and the sky was clear and moonless.  I was approx. 16, and he was 15, and we were very up to date on &#34;known&#34; aircraft at that time.  We were watching the skys and out from the southeast moving northwest, we observed an aircraft with 3 colored lights, moving in a silent slow pace within what I was assuming normal jetliner height.  With the breeze coming from the same direction we saw the aircraft but, we never heard it.  Within 10 seconds after seeing the object the triangular patterened non-blinking lights on the craft turned off.  We both thought this was quite unusual and I began to track the craft with my right hand index finger extended under my right eye to judge the speed.  Approximately 7 seconds had elapesed and we heard the afterburner of a jet aircraft, with its light flashing, persuing directly behind the first craft.  I would say within 5 seconds of sighting the jet aircraft, the lights of the first craft turned back on and, to both myself and my friend&#39;s amazement, 2 more identically lighted aircraft zipped in on both sides of the lead aircraft making an arrowhead formation.  The three aircraft started to speed up and then make an extraordinary sharp 90 degree turn to the north/northeast. After the turn there level of speed was unbeleivable.  We raced to the right side of the house down the driveway and we saw all three aircraft dissapear within seconds.  We raced to the back yard where we saw the persuing jet just making it to the point where the three craft had meet.  The speed was just incrediable, in a blink they were gone.  From that day, my friend and I have seen each other only twice and we never talked about the event again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Past the 7:00 PM with my family saw a triangular formation of some 6-8 objects that emitted light of colors (yellow, green, orange, blue, reddish), descending to 2 kilommeter of my house in a hill to some, toward the NW of San José. Did the objects lower and they then appeared more in similar formations and did they also lower (¿go down to land?). Always stayed a &#34;ship&#34; in the air, without descending (size more). The location of Conception of Alajuelita witnessed the alarmed event, somebody called to &#34;Radio Clock&#34; (more popular station of notices) in order to warn of the event. To the while, for fatigue of seeing many that &#34;go and come&#34; (without noise some), many witness were gone retiring to sleep. To the being the midnight, suddenly, to the front of the district, in a site of filly with cultivation of coffee, to some 80 meter appeared a &#34;red sun&#34;: a sphere the double of size that a ball of basketball (1-2 meter diameter) to some 2 meter of height of the floor, still, without movement, of a red yellowish tone. The following day, from the crossroad of &#34;The Gardenia&#34; (a hill), we saw (whatever that it turn their face) in that place a silver shine, like of a roof in dome, that reflected the rays of the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1986, working with the Ministry of Atmosphere and Energy in the Refuge of Life Wild Black Pipe had, with witness, other sight in form of cylinder or pure of tobacco, including a contact of answer with signs of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had gotten out of the car first, and was heading toward the house, when I turned back to see if my mother was behind me. I looked up a bit and saw a large craft, floating silently in the sky. It was round in shape but had a raised section in the center. The section had angled sides and a flat top. I yelled out to my mother, who came over and stood next to me while we watched and discussed it. I had the impression that it was quite big. It was floating what I think was about 6000-8000 feet above a very tall tree that was there, which helped me get perspective on it. There was nothing unclear about it. Over the next 10-15 minutes the sun began to set, we were entering into twilight, and some light clouds started moving in. At that time, the fire alarm for the town, which was a few blocks away, started sounding, but instead of just doing so several times, it just kept sounding, over and over again, without stopping. I spotlight appeared in the sky, which was scanning all around the area where the craft was. We speculated that other people must have seen it, and that they were probably trying to find it with the spotlight. It was frustrating, because they came close to it a few times, but missed it. At that time, I left my mother there and ran inside to get my father. He was a pilot in the navy, and had experience with observing aircraft. By the time I got him up and outside, the craft was gone. My mother said that it took off so fast that she wasn’t sure which direction it went in. She told me a few years later, before she died, that it had actually vanished, and that she was so stunned by having seen it that she said it took off instead. She was afraid that if the said that it had simply disappeared, everyone would think she was crazy, or that she made it up, because in her and everyone else’s mind, huge objects, especially ones found floating in the sky, do not just disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told many people about this at the time, but found out very quickly that very few people would believe me, and that the one’s who didn’t would ridicule me. It was frustrating, but after a while I just stopped talking about it. The only thing that made anyone realize that I was telling the truth is that I was with my mother when it happened, and she was a very honest, rock-solid person. Any time the subject of UFO’s came up in our presence, we would just look at each other and sort of roll our eyes. We knew what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting I had was with five other people. We were outside during the summer, on a hot night. Our family friend, Mr. M, pointed out what he thought was a satellite, moving across the sky. We (me, my sister, mother, father, Mr. M and another young friend) were standing in our driveway watching it, and talking about satellites. But when it came to a certain point, it suddenly stopped, right next to a second light of approximately the same size and brightness. We were all quite surprised, since as far as I know, satellites don’t stop like that. It stayed in that position for a few minutes, and then came the big shocker – the second light simply disappeared, as if someone turned off a switch. A few seconds later, the first light continued across the night sky, and over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had one more sighting, in the summer of 1973. I was alone, in my bedroom, at the rear of the house. I was lying in bed, when I saw lights coming from above the house. There was no sound at all. When I pulled the curtain back, I could see a triangular shaped craft, but it was hard to see, because it was 10-11 at night, and very dark. There were lights on bottom that were strongly colored. I believe they were primary colors: red, a bluish color and a yellowish one. These lights were in groups of three and seemed to be rotating, on the bottom of the craft. It seemed to be hovering VERY low – maybe 200-300 feet. I was frightened, because it was so close, and my parents were out, so I was alone. It was all over in a minute. It moved on, heading north, over the house. I few minutes later, I went outside to see if I could still see it, but it was gone. At that time, a helicopter with no lights hovered over the house at a low altitude for 1-2 minutes, and then flew off in the same direction that the craft had. It was quite loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These sightings were in Islip, NY, between approximately 1969/1970 and 1973. I know you don’t want names, but I would like you to know that I would gladly take a polygraph, or testify about this in any forum. I think a lot of people have sightings but are afraid to tell anyone, for fear of ridicule. I didn’t tell anyone about these experiences for years, for that reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks-  Mr. G  (my new code name)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Five days later a Lefteneant in blue (Navy) from project Blue Book and anastronmer and astrophysiscist and interviewed myself and other sighter. We even drew them a map of the exact movements of craft against background od constellations visible at that time.The report was filed in Washington DC this was the last six months of Project Blue Book and the scientists shared some amazing sightings that had seen as well as other reported sightings. If they say that Project Blue wasn&#39;t actively seeking sightings and compiling data, I and friend can testify that they were. The object suddenly stopped at zenith directly overhead and then dissappeared in spiraling upward spin. The US government has this information and lots more !<n>

We both could see a streak of light form between the original light and the one that looked like it came from the bigger one. Now they both were just stationary. About two minutes later, the original light started to move toward the west again, and the smaller one went toward the east.<n>

They were just falling asleep when the backyard was lit as bright as noon on a sunny day. My fiance also told me all three guys mentioned that their zippers and/or metal buttons on their clothing and sleeping bags got very warm. There was no noise, just the intense light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They darted into the house and tried to watch whatever it was out of the patio door. They never saw a &#34;shape&#34;, just the light beam at that point. After it moved away, my fiance ran down to the house where I was staying while my mother was at my grandmother&#39;s funeral.  He tapped on the window and when I awoke, he told me what they had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got dressed and joined him in a grassy field across from his house and we watched as this bright light moved slowly around the Orangevale area (very rural in 1969).  As it moved, it shot a beam of light down every once in awhile.  We heard various animals make noise in the area the beam was shining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this for several minutes, then I told my fiance to call McClellan AFB in North Highlands, CA since that is where my step-father was currently stationed.  He did but they claimed they didn&#39;t know anything about the object we were seeing in the sky so they referred us to Mather AFB. We called them but they claimed the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We no sooner got back outside and all of a sudden there were 4 jets flying in from 4 directions, directly at the light.  As they approached, the light became brilliantly bright, then shot straight up in the sky and disappeared. The jets circled for a couple of minutes, then left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one minute later, the light came slowly back down and continued its slow progress around the countryside. Every time it made an abrupt turn, it became brighter, then after it turned, it dimmed to &#34;normal&#34; again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BTW, there was no moon that night so it was pitch black outside and all the stars were clearly visible, and if anyone claims it was Venus, well, it doesn&#39;t move - at least not very fast! No helicopter whump, whump, whump. And besides, helicopters - even today - can&#39;t do what that light did. And whatever it was, it out flew 4 jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

As we were returning to the city where we lived, we saw in the night sky what looked like a small green (glowing) cloud.  Initially it appeared close to the horizon, then appeared to move higher into the night sky.  The &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot; after a few minutes appeared to move within itself and form into a ball... then from the left side of the cloud, what looked like a white star, became a larger and larger, bright white dot.  The speed of its grown was very fast and as it became bigger than the green ball it developed in a few seconds, what looked like a hole in the center and seemed to &amp;quot;explode&amp;quot; and disappear.  There was no sound and the only thing left after the explosion was a green haze (the green ball had at the same time dissipated into a haze) and a slight whitish haze next to each other.  The sky had been clear, it was summertime and! as we were still a considerable way from the main city and in the country, the night sky was not polluted by city lights and stars were clearly visible.  The four of us saw the event. Initially we were in my father&#39;s car but we then stopped got out of the vehicle and watched the phenomenon happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my father and his friend were Police officers... used to see strange things, but I must confess that at the time I did notice that  both my father and his friend were shaken by the sight.

Must have been between 9 PM and Midnight. it was foggy, ie, marine layer pouring over the hill separating our area from the pacific.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked up and saw stationary lights, I&#39;d guess no more than 1000 feet up, probably 500. No sound other than the traffic on 101. It was at least 300 feet long, as it was dark no shape could be determined. Lights on the object were flicking on and off in random. At one point we saw a flume of thick white vapor (steam? smoke?) pumping out directly adjacent to one of its lights. As the vapor was not being batted away by turbulence we knew it couldn&#39;t be a Chinook Helicopter, and it was certainly twice a Chinook&#39;s length. Eventually it moved west out of vision. We were surprised this hadn&#39;t been seen by the volume of traffic on 101.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next day in the San Francisco Chronicle (daily paper) it was reported that many had called in about &#39;something&#39; and the official response was test firing of a Minuteman missile. They fired/tested them going west over the Pacific. Of course, this was either coincidence or absurd. We observed this stationary object for a quarter of an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Per the article in the SF CHRONICLE (surely researchable) the exact date could be determined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This experience made both I and my friend calmly believing we had observed a craft unknown to both us or the public. Silent, huge, hovering, no turbulence.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After maybe 5-6 minutes, they zipped off so quickly, she didn&#39;t see exactly where they went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom has passed on, but she told me this story right after it happened in 1969, I think.  She never talked about it much, as she was very religious, and wasn&#39;t prone to believe in aliens and UFO&#39;s, but I had her repeat the story to me shortly before she died.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

This object looked to be several miles away - maybe 3-5.  It was similar to the first one, but this time had something like a very bright (like an arc-welder) spotlight that it could turn around and shine different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for several minutes, not mentioning it to anybody else as it floated around the general area and then floated off towards Great Falls and disappeared in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It moved about 3-10 degrees as viewed from sea level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a lower rank enlisted person, I was not informed of what measures took place.

There are other people, trees, houses ect on the shoreline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the tops of the trees, I see a glowing gold orb, ball shaped, but no way to tell the size, not very big from my vantage point, but very bright.. It sort of darted around some, and then 2 more glowing gold balls showed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They all went together in one spot, 2 of them went to the 3rd one, but it didnt get bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But when they were all in one spot, after less than a few seconds, all of the  sudden, 5 split off in different directions up and away, very fast, and were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whole thing took less than 10 seconds. I can still see the relative scene, but I never could decide how big they were, or how far away. It seems I was rather far out in the water, that area is very flat and you can go 100 yds or more out in the gulf and not be in very deep. The shoreline was very far away as I recall, at least 100 yards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NO one else seemed to have noticed, and I dont remember anything after that. Sure do remember it tho! They really glowed, and were very golden colored. didnt pulse. Darted around like a hummingbird does, zip zip, back and forth, up and down, nothing we have can do that even now really. It was totally cool and I wish I could see more stuff like that.!!<n>

At first I thought it was a Shell gas station sign that was five miles away.  That particular sign was very tall and located next to an interstate hwy.  Then as I thought about it, I realized that it couldn&#39;t be that sign it was simply too far away and I had never noticed it before. This was a rural area with open fields and scattered houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I paid more attention, I could see this round orange ball, which must have been 75-100 ft. in diameter and maybe a mile away, was gradually descending to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought there should be a logical explanation even including a hallucination, but as it descended (very slowly)it started to change shape from round to elliptical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it decended it&#39;s light filtered though distant trees as it apparently settled in a field. At this point I knew it was real but I was totally puzzled as to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The change in shape has fascinated me.  I ruled out a hot air baloon; I have see those at night and the entire baloon is illuminated.  I have thought that the orange color was produced by heat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until now, I have only told a few people about this. In those days there was even more stigma and most people just laughed it off. I now know others have reported seeing something similar to this, and that is why I am offering my account - to support this mounting evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That early morning I simply went home to bed and never investgated it further.  I wish now that I had explored the area where it landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whether it was from this world or another, I can say it was not natural, it moved in a very slow and controlled fashion. The color was not glaring but more diffused almost like a harvest moon would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This event took place while camping above Boulder, CO. on Flagstaff Mountain.  At this position we had a very clear view of the sky &amp; the town below. The object went from one end of the sky to the other &amp; was witnessed by myself as well as 4 other friends. This took place approximately in  July of 1969. We were all just kids &amp; no one would believe us. Since then I&#39;ve been in the military &amp; have traveled abroad &amp; have witnessed another sighting in Terrell TX. The object was copper in color , it came out of the woods as I was driving down the road late @ night &amp; I lost sight of it as it shot straight up. This happened in 1978 on or around the month of May right off highway 429. This was an unpopulated area @ the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness records 1970, but states that the incident occurred in 1969.  We have amended the date here.  PD))<n>
