The sound came from the west (freehold)had a piercing effect for about 30 seconds or so. We saw a burst of light in the sky and the power the next day was flickering on and off. We also discovered that our dashboard &gt;speedometer in one of our cars was out. IF anyone heard the same metallic piercing noise around 4:30 am in freehold NJ on December 31,2007 please post back to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On other occasion i was not in freehold,NJ but at home when talking to my friend who lives in freehold. I heard a loud piercing metal sonar noise again while on the phone. My friend described a triangular almost diamond object that seemed to hover and had three lights on it. Yellow, green, and appeared white. It was traveling very slow came to a stop and then took off. Again freehold,NJ two reports  1. December 31,2007 Second one &gt;August 2007<n>

It was mostly a whitish light (almost ghostly or see through )with several other colored lights in and around the edges of it. From the distance we were positioned it appeared to be the size of two or three hot air balloons on top of each other. I would say that it lasted 15 - 25 seconds and must have been traveling 500 to 700 mph. It was overcast so I could tell it was below the clouds. If there was a powerful enough spotlight on the ground that could produce this and size, shape , and detail then I would say thats what we saw due to the transparency and the way it floated across the sky with no noise, but it is definitely something I have never experienced before. I am 37.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/31/07 23:15|Santa Monica|CA|Other|2 Minutes|Rapidly moving rings of light in the sky over Santa Monica, California on New Year's Eve.|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60608.html|3|ndxe200712| Rapidly moving rings of light in the sky over Santa Monica, California on New Year&#39;s Eve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At roughly 11pm, while sitting outside, a small group of party-goers witnessed an oddly-shaped formation of lights almost directly overhead, moving east to west.  The object appeared to be two interconnected rings of lights on a single object spinning around a &#34;fixed&#34; center.  The pattern of lights was somewhat gyroscopic moving around an unidentifiable central shape.  The object moved rapidly across the sky.  Two people passed it off as airplane lights.  However, the rings were clearly moving around one central object and unlike anything I or the other guests have ever witnessed.  There was no trail of light or sound that accompanied the object.  The object also appeared to move faster than a typical plane, was very hight in the sky, and was not in a typical flight pattern for Los Angeles or Santa Monica Airports.  The height of the object made the rings difficult to make out.  However, on close study, there were two clearly defined rings of light moving about a central object.  The central object could not be seen clearly enough to describe it&#39;s shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/31/07 22:55|Palm Coast|FL|Other|10 seconds|I spotted a white light with a wavy tail that vanished midsight as I was watching it.|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61002.html|4|ndxe200712| I spotted a white light with a wavy tail that vanished midsight as I was watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object seen between 10:45-11:10 PM  on New Year&#39;s Eve 2007(12/31/07) In the C- Section of Palm Coast Flagler County Florida USA. (This information included in the main body for further clarification.)  Object glowing seen out of the corner of my eye as I looked behind me to make sure there was no one stalking me. (I had heard there were drunkards out that night.) I then turned around and looked directly at it. I lasted over five seconds after that . it was roughly half to three-quarters the size of the full moon in size and glowed white and had a wavy tail almost like a shooting star except it was fluid and almost like it were made of a fluid light. The object dimmed and then vanished after traveling across the sky and was facing diagonally downward-right from my perspective. There was no obstruction in the way that could have blocked it to make it vanish a the point in the sky it did. May not be an aircraft at all...may be paranormal in nature though this is not provable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound as it was moving through the sky but was most certainly low altitude due to it&#39;s relative size and clarity in comparison to an airplane that was passing at the time. It was not low enough to make a glow on the landscape below it. No sound of a crash was heard and from it&#39;s general size if it had crashed into the ground something should have been heard. It did not look like any form of aircraft or living thing that exists to my knowledge.It was not really a fireball so much as it was a hito-dama shaped light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not tired, emotional, under any  great  amount of stress and have never had any form of drug or any sort of hallucination. When I saw it I got excited because I had just seen something really strange. I was surprised but not at all fearful. To my knowledge no one else witnessed this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Are there any spacial experience at this moment that need 3 satellites at nearby position that you know? The 3 points of light had the same bright, just like a 3ª magnitude star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/31/07 22:15|San Carlos (of San Diego)|CA|Light|1 to 2 Minutes|A well definied red light, that looked electronic, drifted overhead and disappeared right above us.|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60620.html|6|ndxe200712| A well definied red light, that looked electronic, drifted overhead and disappeared right above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the past few years, I have read about the reports of red lights being seen over the city of San Diego during both the 4th of July and New Year’s Eve. I believed that due to a vast number of reports over the years, coming from all over town, that this must be a legitimate sighting. I believed that something really was being spotted by people in the skies over San Diego.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reports usually involved at least two red lights appearing high above the city at night. They appear to hover or drift slowly, lasting a few minutes, and then the red lights either flicker or fade out. It sounded like flares to me. The behavior seemed to mimic what they do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I wanted to hold my opinion until I saw it with my own eyes. Last night, I finally did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I brought a friend with me to Cowles Mountain, located near San Carlos and the Mission Trails Regional Park area. The summit has an elevation of 1591 feet. I figured this was the perfect location to see anything that might appear above San Diego’s skies because I could see so many communities in and around the San Diego area, while still high above the city, close to everything. The majority of sightings seemed to occur around the Le Mesa area which we would also be very close to. There would be no missing it should the red lights appear in the same skies. We just hoped the weather would be clear, which luckily for us, it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived by the mountain side at 10:15pm. After grabbing our gear and locking up the truck, my friend and I started walking towards the entrance to the trail. We didn’t get too far before I stopped and stared at a light directly above us. We hadn’t even left the neighborhood street yet and there it was! Sure enough, I was staring at a single red light just hanging in the sky. My friend turned, wondering why I stopped and followed my gaze. He saw it too. We couldn’t believe it. It wasn’t even midnight yet. We hadn’t even started our climb yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it, expecting to see it turn or flash some other lights that might identify it as a normal aircraft. The red light was clear and crisp in the sky. It didn’t glow or appear fiery. It looked electronic to me. It was sharp. We watched it very slowly move to our right. Had this been a normal aircraft, only seeing a red light, it should have been going the opposite direction. The light should have been going left as on a normal aircraft. The left side light navigation light is red and the right side light is green. Seeing nothing but a red light, It should have flown to our left. The red light was instead drifting right. That was the other thing. It was drifting. It was traveling way too slow for a normal aircraft as well. It moved so slow in the sky that a normal plane would have stalled. It seemed to hesitate and bob in the sky as well. It flew a certain direction, but it wasn’t a perfectly straight line. I thought it might be a trick of my eyes at first, so as I watched it, I compared it’s movement to the stars behind it and a palm tree that rose up into the sky near it. It really did appear to be inconsistent in it’s forward movement. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even watching it, I was thinking, “Balloon. That’s gotta be something attached to a balloon.”  We watched it move to our right, directly overhead, towards the mountain. This was flying in a NW direction. More specifically, I would have to say the object was directly over Navajo RD and just past Boulder Lane Ave flying towards the northwest. Quickly, I swung the backpack off my back and set on the trunk of a parked car. I fumbled for the video camera I had packed. I wasn’t ready. I was expecting to climb the mountain, have time to settle in, and break the camera out when I was ready nearing midnight. I didn’t expect that I would see it so soon! I fumbled in the dark for the zipper, but I didn’t want to take my eyes off it either, so I wasn’t able to get my camera right away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I did this, the light dimmed. My friend commented that, “It’s going up.” It appeared to be the case, but I wasn’t sure if it was going upwards or if the light had a direction to it and now was turning away from us, so that it appeared to dim. Watching a fainter light now, it did appear to raise up higher into the sky for me too. Before I could hit record and zoom in, it faded away completely. The light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two of us stood there and kept our eyes on the same general spot in the sky. We couldn’t see anything there any more. There was nothing was moving. There was no light, no silhouette of an aircraft with it’s lights off. Nothing. There was only the stars of a clear night sky with nothing to be seen in the air at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We began out trek up Cowles Mountain. As we walked up the long fire road, we occasionally looked back up into the sky, hoping to see something like that again, and we discussed what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was certain that the light was actually lower than it seemed. The very first thing I tried to gauge was how close the object may have been to us. A lot of people say that the lights are really high up in the sky. I actually got the impression that the light we saw was a lot lower to the ground than it may have seemed. I thought the object was only as high as the mountain itself, of maybe a little bit higher but not by much. So, I would say it was under 3000 feet. Saying that, that would also mean the object was really small. I thought the object could not have been any larger than the size of a tire. I also thought that I could see a vague shape behind it, like it was attached to something. However, it didn’t expand beyond the light much so it was very hard to see. I thought I saw a dark enough shadow behind it to be something attached to it and I’ll be honest, it did look triangular shaped. The red light was on one point, towards the back of the direction it was moving. I will not report this as a triangular sighting, however, as the light is the only thing I&#39;m sure about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend disagreed on a few points. He didn&#39;t see anything behind the light. To him, the light also appeared to be much higher. He did think that it was high up in the sky, above 3000 feet. He thought it was high enough for other planes to possibly see and be up near. I asked him about the size and he thought it had to be something closer to the size of a car, maybe 6 feet wide. We pretty much agreed on everything else, though, including movement and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my friend that I was sure it was a prank, still. The light didn’t do anything “out of this world.” I thought there was still possible explanations for it. I told my friend that, in my opinion, someone somehow attached a red light to a balloon and released it into the air. The wind that night was blowing in the same general direction the light was going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, there are some things I wonder, like how the light went out. We watched the sky for a while. If the light was simply on a string, it should have turned to face us again. It never reappeared. I also find it hard to believe that it would simply go out after being released into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn’t a flare because we were close enough to it, we should have been able to see smoke, a flickering of light, or some fiery effect. It wasn’t a glow stick because it didn’t “glow.” There was nothing vague about the light. It was sharp and clear, like a bright bulb, unwavering in it’s brightness. It only dimmed before fading out. We watched flares later that night. I pointed out to my friend how flares were different. We were given plenty of examples as people near and far fired flared into the sky for new years. The flares were much brighter. The red light would be suddenly real bright in the sky, burn with a fiery effect, even have a hot pink fluorescent glow to it as it drifts back down towards the ground. This object was definitely not a flare. We ruled that out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We’re pretty sure it’s a prank, we just couldn’t explain how it simply vanished right over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To add more weirdness to the night, the very next time I checked my watch to check the time, the light inside it died. That could have been a coincidence. It is an older digital watch, but some people like to know about electronic things failing during UFO sights.  That actually did happen, so I’m reporting it, but I think it’s just an odd coincidence there too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing else was seen by us for the rest of the night, to our disappointment. We did get to see fireworks all over the city. It was cool spending New Year’s up there. It’s an amazing view, but no other unexplained lights appeared anywhere over the city that we could see. I was hoping that if it was a prank, that what we had seen was a test, perhaps planned before they would release more lights into the sky right at midnight, but that never happened. It was just that weird red light at 10:15pm over San Carlos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I are in our mid-to-late twenties. I have investigated UFOs for a short while and was in the Navy as a trained observer for close to 6 years. I extended and got out with an honorable discharge. I currently work security for a tele-communications company in the San Diego area where I have lived for the past 10 years now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Three round fire orange spheres were moving (at a seemingly slow pace) from the Northwest to the Southeast.  These spheres appeared to be about a thousand feet above my vehicle.  As I continued southbound down the road I noticed several people looking towards the sky, so I assume there were other witnesses.  When I returned back travelling north up Scott Mill the lights were gone.  They were only visible (to me) for a few short minutes - maybe three or four.  I&#39;ve seen plenty of airplane lights and stars and these were definitely not either of those.  WEIRD!<n>

We saw a slow moving object in the sky coming from the southwest direction. The object appeared as if it had large yellowy, orange flood lights shinning from every side of it and the lights looked like they were in a fog (a hazy, glow around the object). I looked everywhere else in the sky and the sky was very clear. The object was large. My sons thought it was a helicopter and they heard a sound from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved slowly across the sky at a 45 degree angle between us and due south of us. As it got approximately due south of us, the orangey lights went off and a small single white light was on it (not shining out from it, just on it). The object was not hazy anymore. The sound stopped and it changed direction immediately (not a smooth turn, but instantly). It moved towards the southeast sky from our location. After it changed direction, the object moved extremely fast and was gone in approximately 3 to 4 seconds. The object then looked as if it was extremely high in the sky and went higher as it moved away. It did not go out of sight towards the horizon, but went out of sight moving up and away. A plane could not have covered that much distance that quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son called the local airport that night and again the next day (to talk to someone else) to ask if anything had been reported. They had no reports of anything. The sky was very clear that night and stars were all around.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The event occurred at around 8:15-8:45 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed the lights as we were walking on the pier back to where my car was parked. I told my daughter to turn around and look at these lights that were in the sky off the coast. I knew that it wasn&#39;t a plane because planes aren&#39;t stationary in the sky, and it was too low in the sky to be a star, there was no sound, and the  lights were red on top and yellow on the bottom, close together, one light on top of the other light. We kept walking on the pier and continued to look back at the lights. All of a sudden there were no more lights in the sky. We just went down the stairs, got into the car and drove home. Of course, we talked about the lights on the way home, and speculated about what it could have been, but it wasn&#39;t until I started hearing about reports of lights in the sky in Phoenix, and the documentary about UFO&#39;s on the Discovery Channel that I&#39;m watching right now, that I felt compelled to report the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

From 2007-08  I have seen on numerous occasions a &#34;floating&#34; orange/amber light just above the mountain ridge as I would make the last turn coming up Morningside Lane heading home.  I have seen at times two lights, seemingly independent of each other, drift up and down over the ridge line.  Sometimes as I turned the corner and my vehicle was pointing directly towards the light(s) they would either slowly descend behind the mountain or gradually fade out.  Other times the light(s) would just sit there and remain until I reached the farmhouse.  A couple of times I stood and looked at the lights for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We often have fighter jets in the area that practice maneuvers in the daytime, so I always assumed that it was some kind of new military aircraft, but really was puzzled by its characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have heard that others in the area have also seen the same lights and couldn&#39;t identify it.  It happened so frequently that I assumed someone knew what it was and it was really no big deal.

The lights became clearer in a few minutes, we thought at first that  they were some kind of fireworks, since everyone was busy withthem that evening. We live at the eight floor. It became clearer later that they were more objects, we counted 8. They stood suspended on the air for a long time, at least 2 or 3 minutes and suddenly they went up and started to disappear, they didn’t make any noise. I took a few pictures with my digital camara, but they are unclear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was twinkling like a star, but moved from left to right, then up and down and then in kind of half-loop executions. I compared it to a stable background of mountains and trees to try and make sure that it was not my eyes. The other stars did not move as it did. I called this reporting center at 18:40 hours and was told it was a planet that had commonly been mistaken for an UFO. To my reckoning planets do not twinkle. I then compared that to I think it is Mars (on over to the right/west of the object). Mars did not move, but the object still made the movements as it had before. I did not record this event with camera because the camera could not focus on it. My mother came by to see it as well and ... she got scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Since this area is in the landing path for DFW airport, I was not initially alarmed by what I saw. The objects were visible due west from a position located near 33.23 N by -96.68 W. I studied the objects with binoculars, comparing their distance to landmarks, and determined by their orientation to those landmarks, as well as compass readings, that they were not aircraft in the landing path. After several minutes of careful observation, it was determined they were fixed. Five minutes later, one of the objects changed its position. Then, another. Eventually, all three objects departed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 3 January, another set of lights was seen over a different part of the city. From a closer vantage point, it was clear the object was hovering over the east side of US75, possibly 2KM, near US380.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression of these objects was that they were helicopters performing some sort of high-altitude scanning. It is unusual to see helicopters flying so high, especially when they are stationary. The lights, again, were very bright, similar to the landing lights of large commercial jets. Indeed, they were even discernible against the brightness of the western sky just after sunset. The lights did not appear to be flashing from any place on the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I will have to return to see what the cross street was, but I had passed 60th St. It was about 4PM, perhaps a little after. Looking through my windshield, on the right side of the street, I could see the neighborhood buildings and beyond them, the hills South of Pasadena dotted with houses, across the LA River, not very far away at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In between, I spotted a rectangular object in the air. It was a flat gray. I could tell that it was slowly moving southward, perhaps above the river, which winds with the 110 freeway but more likely, above the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ll state right now that I know it wasn’t a billboard, although it was positioned in a manner a billboard would be (long side down) and was at least the size of a billboard. The difference being this object was floating and moving through mid air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ll also state that it wasn’t a blimp and I had already seen the Goodyear blimp earlier in the day, around the Pasadena area, since tomorrow is the Rose Bowl Parade. That was my first thought, that this was a promo for the Bowl and a plane was towing it, even though a plane at that low an altitude in that area would be a freak flight plan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My “mission” then became to see this thing and the plane that might be towing it together, but I’d have to see it in enough open space as I was getting my view blocked by buildings and trees as I drove. The next chance revealed the rectangle still moving with no plane to be seen anywhere. Now I thought it might be a balloon and I tried to get a good look at it, replacing my sunglasses with my glasses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There seemed to be a texture to it like a chain-link fence pattern. Also there seemed to be 3 segments to it with 2 vertical lines from top to bottom. So it looked like left side, middle, right side, all about equal width. There may have been a circular shape in the middle one. No sound from it that I could hear. No lights or glows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It still continued to move behind things that blocked my view so I tried again to get a better view and was frustrated by slow moving traffic. I’ll state it was moving unlike a loose balloon might. It was heading in an edge-first, sideways manner, as if the bottom edge was on a track. I could also tell by the edge it was not very “thick”, that is I wasn’t looking at one end of a house-like frame. It was much more flattened like a billboard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It occurred to me to get to a spot where I could try to photograph it with my cell phone. I took out my phone and prepared it, still trying to keep the shape in sight. I approached an intersection and saw it again. This time it seemed to be picking up speed as if going around a curve and I stuck my arm out the window of my car and tried to snap a picture above the roof of my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the intersection I realized I could go down the street toward the freeway and at that point, my view would be unblocked. I made the turn and raced down passed the cross streets, hopefully on an intercept course, as that was the very direction it was headed. It took anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds to get there without seeing the rectangle (blocked by neighborhood houses).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I reached the end of the street with its open view of everywhere around, hoping to see a larger version of the rectangle or maybe even some explanation, it was totally gone from view. I looked in every direction. Nothing but everything as it usually is in broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possibly, I thought, it could have turned and descended on the other side of the hill ridge (it seemed to be low enough). Or, if it had simply dropped straight down, the trees would immediately block it from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my car and then inched it along each block. Finally, I gave up and looked at the camera photo. The shot doesn’t show it as it may have been pointed away slightly and I tried a vertical shot (done again I’d have held it sideways or even chosen video capture and turned it to get the best coverage). The shot is oddly over exposed but it may have been the time of day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also immediately turned down the way I had come up Figueroa and retraced the road from the last 5 minutes, looking for any billboards I could have mistaken for it, etc. I saw nothing like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I hear of any explanation of it, fine. I just would like to know what it was. I won’t believe it if someone says it was pulled by something…there wasn’t anything in front or above. Also, anything loose that size near a highway and homes is hazardous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll try to send along some illustrations.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At about 15:00hrs pacific time while I was on break from work I looked up to the skies near interstate 15 &amp; 52 and I notice what appear to be a weather ballon the object which was white, was only about 200 feet off the ground and it slowly floated away towards the east. I know that around the area there is a large vacant field which is part of the Miramar Air space which the military uses for training. I also know that less than a mile away from were I was at there is a weather doppler which was the location that I assumed the weather ballon was coming from. Although I never saw any bright lights and I only notice one ballon (my brake was only 10 minutes long) others could have been released. I just think it&#39;s a strage coinsidence that people reported seeing strage lights later on at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I also know a couple of the astronomers working up the mountain at Whipple Observatory.  I called them today to see what they had to say.  Nobody on the mountain does astronomy anymore sitting at the telescopes.  They all sit looking at computer screens.  So, nobody saw anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I looked up into the sky, I saw two very bright, glowing, distinctly orange lights.  They were very close together and seemed to be interacting with each other, getting brighter, then fading, before regaining intensity again.  The leading light seemed to break from the pairing and head off in a north, north easterly direction, before fading away and dissapearing, leaving the original light to continue shining.  This orange object then proceeded in a north, north easterly direction, following the same path.  A further, even brighter orange light then appeared in the same spot as the first two, making a total of 3 unknown objects.  This third orange light took the same path and within 3 to 4 minutes, all three had dissapeard.  I am an astronomer and professional meteorologist and i&#39;ve never seen anything like it in 24 years...  this is a memorable day as i&#39;ve witnessed something quite special.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had some confetti we were trying to throw into the air and after I heard alot of fireworks go off in the distance.  That caught my attention to look to the left of me and I saw four reddish orange circular lights appear out of no where.  I told everyone else to look up to the left as well and we all saw the same thing.   We couldn&#39;t figure out what it was.  They were all four in a row .  Then all of the suddne a fifth one entered from the left side of the formation.  They stayed there for what seemed about five minutes then they all just disapeared at the same time into the dark like magic they were gone!!  It was quite strange.  Never had we seen anything like this.  However there have been quite a few sightings of other things in this general area of Antioch, Pittsburg , and Oakley, Calif.  A few friends of my family have actually had a UFO hover over them in their cars .  That was really strange as well.  They were so shook up they thought for sure they were going to be abducted.  Lots of real life stories out here.  I have had alot of ghosts in my houses out this way as well.  The police said they have even seen them and have had so many calls about strange things happening  in their homes.  My last home that a sold at least five more families have moved into it just to move out again.  I know why !!!<n>

Sky conditions were dark, clear and starry.  No cloud cover.  I did not notice any wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife pointed to a point above my neighbor&#39;s house, one to the north of ours, and said something like &#34;look at that.&#34;  There, at some height was a pale, whitish object, with two distinct lights hanging down a distance greater than the length of the object&#39;s body, and a third light right at the object&#39;s tail end. The object&#39;s body was about the same apparent field-of-view as the length of my finger held up at arms length.  The object made no discernible noise, yet moved in a forward sense, and turned slowly, such that the &#34;tail light&#34; was always to the rear.  At this time I took three photos with my digital camera (that I had been wearing on a hip pouch, therefore was immediately at hand), with flash disabled so as not to wash out the picture.  The object seemed to be above the tree-line of a eucalyptus grove behind our house, so it was probably between 100 ~ 400 feet above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10 X Nikon Binoculars were at hand within our family vehicle and I grabbed those, and saw the object clearly and in some detail.  The body looked to me like a sack or bag, and I could see texture to the bag&#39;s surface, like the material had some kind of &#34;lay&#34; to it as if it had been made from layers.  It got weird when I saw the two front lights up close--though there was no apparent swinging motion of the lights at all, the lights themselves were actually swivelling independently and looked like miniature searchlights, scanning the area beneath the object.  The lights were intense as they projected from their mount position, such that I could clearly make out the narrow &#34;light cones&#34; just beyond their source.  My recollection is the light had an orange-ish hue to them, and when the object had moved directly overhead I could see the light &#34;flare&#34; as it passed directly over me, and then one light seemed to train on me directly for a few seconds (evidently as I was looking at it, it looked at me looking up at it).  But the light was not blindingly bright as it did not even leave a &#34;blind spot&#34; of persistence of vision when I looked away, though I had been watching through binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I ran inside and grabbed my videocamera and came outside.  My wife pointed to where the object had moved, which was now a few houses down to the south, apparently along the same course that the houses on our side of the street took.  I then shot twenty seconds of video of it as it made a 180 degree turn, allowing me to make out the shape of the craft, seeing it from below and to the side, and as it turned head-on.  A striking feature to me was that in as much as it was always moving around up there, it followed a pretty much straight-line course that took it over our houses.  My understanding is that that is an exceptional engineering feat to get any kind of balloon or blimp to manuever like that and keep to a course.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I happened to catch it in the corner of my eye, atfirst thinking it was a bird (we have geese and a large white owl in this park). Unfortunately, I had on earphones listening to my mp3 player so I did not hear any sound coming from the object, however, even at my usual volume I can hear autos and small planes. I heard nothing during my viewing. The object was heading due East (flying west to east). What immediately caught my eye was that it appeared transparent, it was a starry evening, relatively clear, and it looked like the stars were reflecting from the bottom of the object. I saw no lights whatsoever so I knew this was no a civilian or possibly even military aircraft. Size wise, I would say it was about as big as a small private plane. Oddly, the most striking resemblance I can compare it to is the wingshaped B2 bomber. It had a dome cockpit type area and wings that had cut outs similiar to the B2. This object was much smaller. I did not see any lights until it was almost out of sight and it appeared that above the edges of the wing tips there were circular housing that emitted a bright, glowing red light. Again, above, not below like a normal aircraft. I would estimate it&#39;s speed at approx. 150-200mph.(I do that having been to many air shows and observing other aricraft over the years. I was approx. 200-500 feet high, which I also found odd seeing that it was heading directly over the center of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I go to the same area many nights during the week. I have yet to see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

My brother and I were watching T.V. last night and eating snacks in our living room.  We have two couches.  I was sitting on the couch closest to the west wall.  Sitting on this couch, my back is facing the neighbor’s front yard.   My brother was sitting on the couch closest to the basement.  From that couch he had a good view of the kitchen and more importantly the kitchen windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Half way into our movie we heard a very strange noise. It sounded like a “WHOOOOOOSH”. Something flew past my house.  I never heard anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since my back was facing outside, I heard it more and felt it!   It seemed like it was going very fast.  It seemed like it came down and flew over my neighbor’s yard!  The lights and the T.V. flickered as if they were about to turn completely off- and they did for about 1 second! It was scary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog sleeps in the kitchen and he immediately got up and started barking.  Me and my brother looked at each other and were like, “What the hell was that?!”  We looked out the windows- him in the back and me in the front but we saw nothing.  We talked about it, decided it may have been my sister making noise upstairs and were freaked out but we continued to watch T.V.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 minutes later the same thing happened but this time it was louder and had more of a thunderous sound. “WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH”!!!! It flew passed my house again in the same spot but this time went towards my back yard. Then suddenly my whole backyard lit up with blue lights!! My brother saw it most because he could see the yard through the kitchen widows. My living room lit up. It was like a beam shot down and hit my backyard. My whole family ran down the stairs. We were all freaked. We didn’t investigate. We were too scared.<n>

As we neared it, it remained in the same location (Trigger Ave, outside of Bangor base) as in still or hovering. Then my coworker thought maybe it was a tower but, I’ve lived in this area for a long time and knew there was no tower there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached it, because it was hovering, I looked at it closely to determine what it was. When we first saw it looked like a plane with wing tip lights (white), a head light (white) in the middle and I think I remember a red light. Underneath the object there were more lights (white), not sure how many. From what I could make out between the lights was the object was triangular or diamond shaped and looked to be made of a shiny metal like aluminum of some sort. It was hovering about 500ft. in the air, a few yards from the highway, over a farm. That night skies were clear for the most part but a little cloud cover. The object was in a little low cloud but, still visible. The object was large and it was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather it be alien or new military technology my co-worker and I know for a fact we saw something out of the ordinary that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Time 19:18 hrs<n> <n><n> <n><n> At a distance of around 100 miles due south I saw 8 star white oval shaped objects of fairly good size, about 3 to 4 times the size of the brightest or biggest star in the sky, it looked as though they were being shot into the sky at around a 45 deg angle into the sky one right after another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were very fast, faster than a missile or jet plane, there were about 8 of them. It reminded me of what missiles look like when they are fired off from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They fired off from the ground one right after another, there was no fire trail or explosion, they shot up fast and then disappeared it only took a second for them to reach a great distance in the sky and then just vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is it? I don’t know, but I have never seen anything like it before. There is a military base Fort Leonard Wood in this direction at about the distance I saw them in. Maybe they came from there. The whole thing only lasted seconds.<n>

It was a cold clear evening. The stars were bright and the visibility was excellent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was large, triangular shaped, very dimly lit (unlike the stars that were sharp and bright) and quiet. It moved just east of the shoreline from north to south. The object then turned approximately 45 degrees toward the east. It traveled a short distance then disappeared. We did not see it move away rapidly, rather it just vanished or we lost sight of it. The duration was 3 to 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a light that could have been a small aircraft behind it. It seemed to follow it for a distance. Both of these objects appeared to be fairly low in the sky, like the altitude of large aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was white or silverish in color and appeared to have several windows in the side I could see. I had the impression of the windows being ringed in red but I can&#39;t be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seeing aircraft in this area isn&#39;t uncommon but flying parallel to the river it caught my eye. Being it also looked sort of like a small space shuttle I though that it was out of place as it flew past me and banked left near the 210 &amp; 435 Highway intersection. That&#39;s when I noticed that it had come to what appeared to be a complete stop in mid air!  I watched the aircraft for a few seconds over my shoulder and even was able to see it in my rearview mirror a couple of times before I exited 210 on to 435 South toward Kansas City. I immediately called my husband and described what happened to him and asked him if there were any aircraft he knew of that looked like that or flew like that to which he said only the Harrier jet and a plane called a Osprey but they were much smaller than I was describing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 42 year old woman who has lived my entire life near the area and I have worked at the same location, driving the same route for ten plus years. I have never seen anything like this ever. I wasn&#39;t even going to report this but my husband convinced me that I should, if for no other reason to validate anyone else&#39;s sighting what may be in question. Being I&#39;m the only witness that I know of I&#39;m not sure how much credibility I may have but I can&#39;t explain how an aircraft smaller than a commercial jet but larger than a commuter jet could come to a stop in mid air!  I took into consideration that an aircraft looks like it&#39;s standing still when it&#39;s a long way away and turning. But this was close enough I could see individual windows. And I was able to keep it in view for close to two minutes from first noticing it to loss of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I makd a left on sycamore and made another left onto South Santa Fe Avenue heading North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right  after I passed the new Sprinter crossing I noticed lights floating in the sky  slightly to the left of the way the road runs.  There are houses on that side where it was floating, and lots of trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down to about 5 to 8 miles an hour. There are no cars around me.  I turn my stereo off.  I stare at the lights. They look exactly like the halogen lights people use as security lights above their driveway.  There are 3 of them.  They are very bright.  There were  no flashing lights like on a plane, and a plane would not be that close to the houses like this thing was.  It was hovering really slowly.  It reminded me of a donut the way it was curved around.  The lights were in a line, they were the same size and shape.  They were the same brightness.  There was an actual airplane off in the distance so I could see the difference between the 2.  This floating mass of lights was no plane.  It was no helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled my window down and I didn’t hear any sounds like a plane or a helicopter would make.  I proceeded north and made a right onto Cypress drive.  The lights seemed to float away over the hill and towards Shadowridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I raced home to get my husband and made him drive with me out to where I saw this lighted floating object, but we could see nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am absolutely sure I saw something and whatever it was that I did see was not normal.<n>

At the time listed above, I saw what resembled a very large meteor (but was not a meteor or space shuttle) traveling from north to south, as you look from the west at a downward angle of appx. 40 degrees.  The total visible path of the object was around 8 inches with your hand held at arm&#39;s length, though the visible light trail was around 2 inches long and 1 inch wide.  It lasted around 4 seconds, and had a very visible color tint, which I saw as green, but could have been a trick played by my eyes, since it was, after all, nighttime, and I had been looking at a television.  I fetched my DSLR and telephoto lens, but nothing ever showed up again.  Please continue reading, as I will tell you the results of my foot search.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (The movie was &#34;Swing Kids&#34; not a sci-fi movie or anything at all!  This rules out any influence from the movie making me &#34;want&#34; to see something.)  I have seen meteors lasting for over 8 seconds, and shuttles re-entering the atmosphere, and this resembled them, except that it seemed much, much closer.  The dimensions of said trail are seen above.  I estimated, based upon the horizon, trees, etc. that the object was 1.8 to 3 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that evening, I wondered if the object could have been a plane crashing in the area, and decided to go search.  I pulled out my GPS, marked 3.5 miles, and set out.  I trespassed for hours, and the only civilization I observed was a large oil well complex, with a small metal building.  I got the number to the oil company, and after a little asking around, I found that they do not have any aircraft in our area.  Therefore, I have not resolved what I may have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t believe in ailens, there were no &#34;substances&#34; in use, either!  In addition, I called the attention of my mother and brother to the object by saying, LOOK, LOOK!  Upon which they responded, &#34;where?&#34; and the object was, by that time, gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you, any information is much welcomed.<n>

We were traveling on Interstate 20 and suddently there appeared 3 three bright light circles which appeared in the sky.  These were not spot lights because there was  not a reflection coming through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights seemed to be playing or dancing with each other.  Then they got in a straight line, they went together and then separated again.  They danced or play for a few minutes.  They went together to make one circle and then separated again and suddendly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we traveled the lights stayed in front of us very close, even with us traveling approximately 75 miles per hour we could not catch or leave the light.  We were not frighten because we were trying to figure out what they were.

It was diagonally going down, like it was going to land. It was a VERY overcast day. The craft was dark gray, no lights. I was embarrassed to tell anyone but this website. (see previous entry) I heard no noise, but definitely saw a fluid-like metal object up in the sky for several minutes. It was not a reflection because it kept going down to the left and I was traveling straight ahead down the highway.

I want to ask if anyone has seen this, or if it was just me. I believe what I saw was on December 27, 2008. I was driving to work at 7:30 in the morning, driving on I30 Westward towards Dallas, Texas. It was VERY overcast this morning and traffic was not very full, due to kids being out for the holidays. I was looking straight ahead down the highway and I thought I saw a dark gray cloud. It looked like a plate sitting there up in the sky right above the highway. It was not quite to the skyscrapers, yet. It was between Mesquite and Garland, Texas. It was dark gray and was not like a plane, not silver, not outlined. I was afraid it was just a reflection from my truck windshield, but it moved. It did look like it was made of dark gray smoke under gray overcast sky. There were no lights. I watched it and it laid flat, like the typical UFO, but it was neat because it went lower and lower, in a slow, diagonal direction, like it was going to try to land. I was fascinated. It was like one description I had seen before on this site: “Smoke moving weirdly”. I was trying to see if anyone had ever seen anything like this by reading all your descriptions on the site.  Anyway, the shape was a saucer, but it was very very smokey. It then kept going lower and kind of stood up again like a plate and then got horizontal again. It moved REALLY fluid, like water. I kept looking and looking as I finally got up to the place where it should have been, but could not find it. Sort of like a rainbow situation. I could swear it was invisible and the gray overcast actually made it stand out, somehow. It was a dark gray ship and I could see the outline of it against the sky. It was truly weird.  I could have sworn it landed somewhere, but I could not see past the buildings. I was embarrassed to tell anyone. I tried to call the news, but got shy to ask if anyone had seen anything and shy to tell my family. I am still so curious if anyone else saw it. I also wondered if it could have be! en a ref lection from a car dealership, but why would they shine a shape of a UFO changing form and shape up over the highway? It is hard to believe in these things. Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My dogs started barking and there was something large in the yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 22:15 on 12-26-2007, I was awakened by a strange motor sound and a light.  My family lives near a rural well traveled road, so I was confused by the sound but not really by the light. Sometimes car lights will shine through our windows.  The sound I heard was like nothing I had ever heard before except for maybe on a movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I laid my head back down and then our dog, along with the neighbors dog, started barking frantically. This was a real shock, my dog normally does not bark. This was when my wife and I both were startled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10-15 minutes of the barking, I had enough and got out of bed.  I looked through the shade and saw something very large at the outer edge of my yard.  It had no lights, it was on the ground, and it made no noise.  It did not move. The moon was bright, but there were clouds in the sky. I did not have on my glasses, but there was something defiantly there. Approximate size was probably 30x25 ft. It seemed a lighter color on the outskirts and very dark in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was half asleep when all of this happened, I remember saying something to my wife about it then going back to bed. Then hours later I awoke realizing what had happened. I looked again and there was nothing there. I went to work that day thinking I imagined the whole thing until I got home that evening. That’s when my wife made the comment about our dog barking and not sleeping well. I realized then that possibly there had been something there after all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Thursday evening, the 27th at around 18:39, while my wife was cleaning up after supper  cooking supper, the dogs started barking again. I arrived back home after taking some trash to the dump. She explained to me about the dogs and I went outside on the back porch. At this time the dogs had stopped barking and I could not see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a skeptic, and I don’t know what it was that night or the next.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And I don’t know what is going to happen tonight.  All I know is that something happened.  Believe me or not, that’s your prerogative.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for listening.<n>

It moved kind of like a jelly fish. When it moved out of my site because I was driving, I asked my boyfriend what it was doing. (He was in the back seat) and he said that it turned sideways then zoomed off quickly in a diagonal motion upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking into the southern sky just looking at the stars and passing satellites when out the left side I saw an almost see thru, very dim, brown, round light. It was flying south west and 45 degrees in the sky when I first noticed it. I am not sure of the altitude since it was night but I would have to say it was at least 500 feet and lasted about 10 seconds until I couldn’t see it anymore. It faded into the horizon. I can’t tell the size of it since I don’t know the true distance but to me it looked like 3/4 the size of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometimes birds flying at night can glow from lights in cities and I have seen this before but this didn’t seem like that. It was flying way to fast and it didn’t change direction at all. It was very windy so if it was a bird it would have been tossed around a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been around and worked on all types of aircraft most of my life so there was no chance of it being one. I can usually explain everything I see at night that other people might find strange but this one has me a little baffled. I just thought I would report it. Maybe someone else saw something. I doubt it though. Most people don’t look to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I noticed a really bright light just flashing on and off with about 2 second intervals. At first I thought it was a light to warn planes flying by because the hill on the horizon was hard to see.  Finally I realized that the light was way too bright and it was something else. We were all very focused on this light by this time trying to distinguish what it was.  All of a sudden it stopped flashing and was in a different location and started flashing again.  You could tell how far it was moving from the stars in the background.  I saw this flashing object move from one location to another in just mere seconds, probably miles away.  I was driving so I couldn’t keep my eyes off the road for too long but I saw it clearly as possible with my family reassuring me.  The light was very bright almost seeming like UV lights but did not cast any outside light, so I could not see what was around it.  I did not see any fire or anything that seemed like a blast or rocket.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ---ALSO, all three of our phones had no service for miles when we were right under the cell phone towers, and have had service at that location before.<n>

Suddenly, in an instant, the light changed position about 100 feet to the south. Then the light was steady white, a blinding white light, then it went dark, then it flashed again and zoomed up and away in the sky in an instant, unlike anything i have ever seen. This was no aircraft, but rather some sort of bright white light. It did not emit a beam, or a trail, but more of a flash, and was blinding bright, flash and changing positions instantly, then it zoomed up and away. I saw it, my 16 year old son saw it and also my 15 year old daughter. We all saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Passenger side of the car was facing our house and drivers side facing across the street toward the neighbors. I exited the car on the driver’s side and something caught my eye at almost star level, very high in the sky. I saw three extrememly bright amber lights,first in a straight line formation, stacked on top of each other. The objects hovered around each other, moving as I describe in “slow motion”. They 3 lights floated out of the stacked line formation and made a circle type formation, then back into a slightly curved line. There was no noise coming from the objects at all. This was nothing like I had ever seen before. The objects or object didn’t move like any airplanes or helicopter that I have seen. The silence and “slow motion” movement  looked extremely fluid and bizarre. The objects were completely stationary in between these intervals of formation for seconds at a time. The objects did not move across the sky, but stayed in the same area for the entire duration of our sighting. My wife,nervous from my silence standing outside the car, remained inside the car, asking what I was seeing. I urged her to come out and take a look. She instantly was taken aback by the strange lights and told me to run in inside and grab the video camera. The objects were seen by us for about a minute or two before I got the camera and returned. There is where the video begins. The lights were stationary ,extremely bright and slowly went back into a straight line or up and down formation. When switching the camera to “night mode” and looking back up into the sky, we noticed the lights now formed a triangle. This triangle began to move slowly just slightly to the left. All of a sudden one of the lights faded out completely, then the second, then the third.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While I was waiting, I was observing this bright star ( I think it was the planet Mars that I was seeing) and some of the other stars that was shinning that night.  I noticed the moon was just beginning to rise on the horizon.  The moon was mostly hidden by some oak trees, but I could still see the moon’s light shinning through the trees.   Then I noticed a blinking red light moving in the sky near the upper left of the moon.  The red light would stay on for about 1 second and then off for 1 second as the object traveled  North in direction.   I watched it for about a minute, then I ran inside to get my Mom who I was visiting Christmas day.  We both hurried back outside, and I was able to quickly locate the object again.  She had a little difficulty at first in locating the object, but finally she was able to locate the blinking red light  in the sky.  It might have been a plane flying, but I thought a plane also had a white strobe light that flashes brilliantly off and on, not a red light for a strobe light.  Normally when I see a plane flying at night, I would see a white, strobe light flashing off and on, and red lights or green light that is continuously lit on.  The red light seem bigger in light effect than the red lights I normally see on the wing&#39;s tip of a plane. I didn’t hear any noise of any planes flying while observing the blinking red light; it was just really quite outside except for when a car occasionally drives by me on the road. Maybe it was a plane flying, and if it was a plane flying, it definably didn’t have the normal lights it suppose to have to indicate that it was a plane flying.  It almost seem like it was a satellite moving across the sky, but it would have been way too low, I think, for it to be a satellite, especially blinking off and on a red light.<n>

We were walking on Roxiticus Golf Course and we were on the highest hill on the golf course. The hill was about 100 ft higher in elevation than most other parts of the golf course. We decided to sit down and catch our breaths. While half way down the hill, I looked above a partially developed hill called Brookrace and saw three whitish-red lights that were over the hill. It appeared to be a bent radio tower because they were not directly above and below each other, but in a curve shape above Brookrace. I said to my dad, “What’s that”? He said, “I don’t know, there’s no radio tower or anything up there, right”? After two minutes of observing them, the one that was placed in the middle, vertically, started to move to the right and closer to the hill. It now appeared to be about 300 ft above the top of the hill. The hill in which Brookrace is on is about 450 ft above the surrounding land. The other two lights started to drift to the right in up, down, circular, and diagonal motions. It appeared to us tat they could move in any direction that they wished and also come to a complete stop at any time. One minute later, the UFO that is more to the right and about 300 ft above the hill, corkscrewed down in a spiraling motion to about 150 ft above the top of the hill. About 20 seconds later the highest UFO dimmed its light and started moving left of the other two UFO’s. Again it was moving in odd, non-pattern like motions. Very soon after the same UFO appeared to turn on lights that went horizontally down the side of the craft. The colors of the lights were green, white and, red. The craft was about ½ of a mile away from us in the air. We could clearly see the description of it. It looked like we were seeing the side of a triangular prism. At no time did they change shape. Soon after the first craft moved away form the others, the most left UFO out of the two that were still above Brookrace started! to foll ow the other, it appeared to follow the same or a similar flight path. The third UFO stayed in the same area that we first saw it in but was doing amazingly odd movements such as zooming up and down. The top of Brookrace, as a crow flies, is about ¼ of a mile away from our position. We would have gone home to get a video camera if we knew how long they would be there, except our house was about ½ of a mile away. While the one UFO was still over Brookrace, the other two UFO’s were now directly behind us (if the starting position is directly in front of us.) The two behind us seemed to be about ½ of a mile higher in the sky than when they started. Than, about 8 minutes after first discovering them, another UFO started slowly coming over the hill in which Brookrace is situated on. This one as well as the other UFO that was there from the start headed towards the other two UFO’s behind us. They also put their side lights on and as well as all of the other UFO’s dimmed their lights before going into major (fly mode). For the entire time that we were watching the UFO’s, about 500 geese that were on the lake below Brookrace, were making loud distress calls as if something were hurting them. Over a period of about 20 minutes 3 more UFO’s came from over the hill and followed the same flight plan. Behind us, the 7 UFO’s were forming a formation that seemed to be like a sideways “T” shape.               This is the formation that they made about ¾ of a mile up in the sky  directly behind us. The formation consisted of 7 UFO’s. This may sound odd because most UFO sightings consist of 1 UFO, but we saw what we saw. Thirty seconds later, another UFO started coming towards the formation. It looked like this UFO was coming from over the nearby town of Chester, NJ. This was flying at a reasonable rate of speed (about 40-50 mph). The other UFO’s seemed to be going about 20-30 mph considering the amount of land that was passed in a certain amount of time. Thirty seconds later, it eventually joined the formation. “Wow, this is amazing” my dad said as we walked home in disbelief. As we looked up into the sky, we saw what appeared to be a shooting star, but the beam of light kept going and going, it must have been one of the UFO’s blasting off. As we walked home we saw the most amazing part of our night. While walking we glanced over at the lake where the geese had been making distress calls. We saw a UFO hovering about 80 ft above the lake in a kind of wobbling motion. It appeared to have an internal light and a triangular shape to it. It also appeared to be about 30-35 ft long. When my dad saw this, he shined his large spotlight that we had brought with us on it (it was about 600 ft away from us, the light did nothing to help us see it) as soon as he did that we felt a large vibration through our bodies. then we left and thought about it the rest of the night.<n>

Out the front window I noticed from the back seat a very bright light just to the left side of the road about 1 mile ahead of us.  I said to my wife as she was driving, &#34;What is that bright light out of your window at your 11:00 O’clock position?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said that she did not know.  My mother was sitting in the front passenger’s seat.  She said that she did not know either, but that there was another light just like it ahead on the right about 2 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I was sitting in the back right hand side I did not notice that one at first because I could not see through my mother’s head.  I repositioned myself and looked out the front to the right and noticed that object as well. My son was sitting next to me in the back seat and saw the two objects also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were very bright and sparkled like the finest diamond with a thousand bursts of colorful flares inside them.  The closer we got to the one on the left hand side of the car, the further down I had to get my head to the floor so that I could see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few moments I could not see it anymore and so I asked my son if he could see it out of his side window.  He said it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my wife where the bright light on her side of the van was.  She also said it was gone.  There was quite a bit of traffic on the road moving with us and coming toward us, so she was mostly paying attention to the road, like a good driver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother said that the light on the right side 2 miles ahead was moving away from us.  I stooped down and looked at it as it slowly disappeared to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking into the sky on the rest of our journey home, which took about 25 more minutes after that, hoping to get another look at what I had just seen.  I saw many lights; they were all just small planes having the small red flashing light on them, dim compared to the two we had just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a full moon, partly cloudy, crystal clear stars above, snow on the ground (which reflected a lot of moonlight around to make it seem no so dark that night), and it was about 20 degrees F.<n>

I like looking at the moon, so occasionally I would look at it again. One time I looked at it there was a bright light just to the right of the moon. I assumed it was Venus or a bright star, although I&#39;ve never seen one so close to such a bright full moon. I looked again about 10 minutes later, and now the same light was to the LEFT of the moon. That didn&#39;t seem right to me. Someone told me they thought it was probably Mars. Two problems with that: it didn&#39;t have the usual reddish tint and was brighter than it would be EVEN IF it was AWAY FROM a full moon--it should have appeared even dimmer to me because of the brightness of the full moon so close to it; and how did it move over to the other side of the moon? I decided at the time to doubt my observations, but now I am more curious, as there have been other reports of this object, one with photos, on this site. I didn&#39;t mention it at the time to anyone; they were only looking at the holiday lights in that neighborhood. I am a member of MUFON and Colorado MUFON.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Moved to NW, vansihed, then flashed brightly and vanished again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on the pool deck in the rear of the house.  I noticed a bright light 60 degrees above the horizon to the northwest.  Surrounding this light were several departing/arriving airliners all of which were trailing contrails.  The light was unmoving and had no contrail.  I am a pilot, and estimate the altitude at 20k feet.  After watching for 10 seconds, the light became brighter and changed shape to a grid, that I can only compare to a grid on a bingo card, and all lines of the grid were brightly illuminated in white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after I mentioned the light to my friend and dad, it reverted back to a bright, single, white light.  They only saw the object as a bright light having missed the grid-shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched I mentioned that it was not moving.  Suddenly, it began to slowly move to the NW.  We watched for about 10 seconds and it simply vanished.  My Dad and my friend looked away and I continued watching.  It had vanished for about 5 seconds when I saw it flash brightly one more time and finally vanish.  I watched for 10 more minutes yet saw nothing more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangely enough, a month and a half before, I was in Orlando on a Greyhound bus.  We had just left the station headed to Tampa and were sitting at a traffic light.  It was dark, and I noticed a bright light above the bus about 30000&#39;-40000&#39;.  It was stationary with a changing brightness, brighter than the star Sirius.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began moving south toward Miami, and rapidly diminished in brightness until it vanished.  It appeared very high in the sky, and appeared to move slowly south, but I could tell it was moving very quickly, but due to it&#39;s altitude it overall appeared as though it was moving slowly.  Very hard to describe.  I noticed that no one else on the bus were paying attention, and I didn&#39;t say anything to anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These are the first two sightings in my life, and I watch all the time for such activity, and have always been skeptical.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking out the window, having a cigarette.  I noticed 2 bright lights and it took a couple of seconds to register in my head, and I thought to myself those are not supposed to be there!  The 2 bright lights were huge, Southeasterly  direction.  I started to say to a visitor, come here in a stern but unwavering tone, but the visitor did not listen to me for about 5-10 seconds.  The other bright light started  to dim out when the visitor finally came to the window and saw the 2 lights, as the other light dimmed out, the visitor started asking me what those lights were, and I couldn&#39;t tell him.  All I could do was ask him if he saw what I was seeing.  He said yes, he saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 bright shining whitish colours shining unnaturally bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I opened my cell camera I could see something hovering, just below the moon. I know it was not Mars, because when I took the camera away Mars was a considerable distance away from what I was seeing. Mars being almost parallel with the Moon and the object that I saw was directly beneath the Moon. I could not see this thing with the naked eye, I had set my cell phone to a different setting so that I might be able to pick Mars up. I filmed the object darting around the moon across three separate video files (39 second intervals) until it appeared to leave, in three different sections.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As the “headlights” got closer (about 50 feet before passing us) they made a complete 90 degree turn in front of my truck, passed into the farm field next to us and disappeared.  This was witnessed by myself and the passenger of my truck.  At that point I slowed down to about 20 to 30 miles an hour the passenger of my car and I turned to each other and almost at the same time exclaimed, “Did you see that?”   About 10 seconds after this event and both of us being somewhat confused but alert we noted another set of “head lights” coming down the road in the same lane in the same Northerly direction as the previous set of “head lights.”  Although not expecting these second pair of “head lights” to perform in the same manner, that’s exactly what they did (a completely perfect 90 degree turn about 50 feet in front of us) vanishing, again into the field next to us (our right).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is important to note that the second instance was a more pronounced experience as myself and the passenger of the truck had just witnessed the first incident and were, by then, in a state of high sensory alertness but also completely dumbfounded and confused.  After the second instance, I immediately stopped and got out of the car to look into the field were the lights went and could find no trace of either object.  Please note that the color of the lights were off-white and seemed to be set farther apart then normal head lights.  As the lights passed in front of the truck they also seemed to have a tail…like a comet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also important to note is that if these “head lights” had just gone by us I would have thought nothing of it and would have assumed they were normal cars despite the headlights being set slightly farther apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was agreed by myself and the passenger that evening and over many, many recounts of the event at later times (these recounts continuing to the present) that neither of us had ever seen anything maneuver like these lights.  We also both agree that if there would have just been one event then we would have probably discounted it…but both events happened in succession…one after the other.  I can’t even begin to guess what those lights were.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Thinking it was just another police helocopter, I went up to the window, and noticed that there was no chopper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound such as a chopper would. It beamed for about 15-20 seconds, shut off, and then to my surprise saw a group of red lights moving away. This craft was large, easily 10 times the width of an airliner which do make their descent over this neighborhood. But there was no airplane  traffic that night as usually is seen. I was scared like hell! The sky was clear, no moonlight to speak of. It traveled real slow with these bright red lights flashing, southest, then east toward Camden, then south till out of view. I should note that this Northeast Philadelphia which is generally open and wide, not the congested area. It banked just where the congested area would begin as if avoiding that area. Heading towards New Jersey, it&#39;s wide open skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My conclusion was that this was an alien spacecraft on patrol. NO WAY WAS THIS A MAD-MADE CRAFT.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However as we got closer to the object it became apparent that the object was close and was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed my car down and tried to get a good look at it; I saw that the object was hovering about 100-150 ft. above a nearby house and not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was triangle shaped and had a white light on each corner and a red light somewhere near the middle.  It was a full moon so I was easily able to see the shape of the craft against the sky, the craft was not white like a commercial jet, it was either gray or black, the only way I was easily able to distinguish its shape was by observing it against the moonlight sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to tell how &#34;tall&#34; the craft was because I was observing it mostly from the bottom so the craft could have been pyramidal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowly passed the house the craft was hovering over and immediately turned around once I realized what I was looking at.  When I was about half way back to the house the craft started slowly flying away to the south-east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was drawing nearer to the craft it tilted to the right and gained speed and headed off towards Columbus (to the south-east).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I mentioned earlier it was a full moon out and there were a few clouds in the sky that were white because they were being illuminated by the moon, I believe this is the only reason I was able to distinguish the craft&#39;s shape.<n>

The second night 12/23/07, at about 11pm, I saw another stationary light to the north at about 40 degrees up from the horizon. I was able to get about 3 minutes of video of the three on the first night. I have an observatory in my backyard,  so I hurried out there and threw the roof open and I got my small refractor on one of the lights and it looked like a big square translucent parachute type thing with 3 spinning orange lights in the middle, and it kinda looked like it was shooting off embers or something wierd.  They eventually all burned out and I lost the object in the darkness.  They seemed to be about 3-4 miles north of the Salt Lake International Airport,  but they were not any kind of aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

12/23/07 21:00|San Martin|CA|Unknown|2-3 minutes|4-5 tight circle red-white-green-blue BRIGHT lights over Morgan Hill|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60479.html|90|ndxe200712| 4-5 tight circle red-white-green-blue BRIGHT lights over Morgan Hill<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 9:00pm last evening, I was looking out my window when I saw a very bright series of lights, somewhat in the shape of a tight circle.  You couldn’t see any space in between the lights at all.  It didn’t garner my attention initially since the final approach corridor for San Jose International Airport is over that general area.  But then I started to realize that it was much brighter than aircraft lights and didn’t have anti-collision lights, something that I can normally see on planes all the way to San Jose.  As I grew more curious, I realized it was not moving and seemed to be pretty low in the sky.  Ok, a helicopter, I thought.  However, there is a municipal airport about 3 miles away from me and I am familiar with all sorts of helicopters as that is where they normally stage aircraft for fighting the big wildfires up in the hills from me.  Ok, so what is it?  I’m officially very curious at this point and do a line-of-sight to see if it is just moving very slowly.  Nope.  Not moving.  The lights were what had my attention, as I’m watching I’m seeing white lights, a large red one in the center, and occasionally the flickering green or blue.  They were twinkling like starlight, but they were much larger than stars, lower in the sky than stars (fog was coming in over the hills) and so much brighter!  So now I’m thinking they must be having some sort of light show on El Toro Mountain, the large cone-shaped hill that most people think Morgan Hill got its name.  But that explanation didn’t sit well with me, it was truly very, very bright lights.  Then, as I’m watching, the series of lights cut in half, like someone had put up a card in my viewing and cut off the lower half of the object.  So now I’m telling myself, yes, it is a show on El Toro and they’re making their way to the other side of the hill, where I can no longer see them.  However, at that point, the lights dimmed greatly and it zipped off at a high rate of speed to the north.  Being familiar with the landing approaches of! aircraf t to San Jose, it was not on the flight path and the lights now were far dimmer than normal aircraft and there was still no anti-collision lights.  It was also much faster than any aircraft I’ve seen go down the corridor.  I’ve been pouring over the internet and newspapers this morning to see if anyone else reported something odd in the sky, because I am certainly curious to know what it was.  I couldn’t have been the only person admiring the night sky last night, and the object seemed to be over Morgan Hill and within sight of the 101 highway.  Thank you for the opportunity to report this (can’t wait to see what my IT guy thinks when he sees “UFO reporting form” in my internet search queries).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I grabbed my 20x binoculars and sat down on the 2nd floor landing facing to the west.  It was a clear night and I was looking at the planes coming toward LAX about 12 to 15 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a couple of minutes I noticed a fairly bright and steady light coming from the west to the east.  This was at about 12 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I focused my binoculars on it and didn&#39;t notice any wing or strobe lights. I continued to watch it and after about 30 to 45 seconds began a turn toward the south.  This was probably at about 8 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still didn&#39;t notice any wing or strobe lights.  Unlike an airplane, the light continued to remain steady when it turned and as it moved away.<n>

A few us took notice.  The object was very high.  A small aircraft passed near it which gave me the impression the object may have been 30 feet wide.  It rotated and would reflect off the sun every rotation.  One end was mirrored or metallic and the other was darker.  I couldn&#39;t quite make out the shape so I took several photos hoping that would answer questions. Unfortunately because of the height most people, once they didn&#39;t know what it was went on with their day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, I thought I was looking at the top of a silo then I realized it was too high for a silo or building because the airplane was above the clouds.  It appeared to be stationary in the clouds perhaps even hiding.  It was shiny like aluminum with 6 or 7 raised bumps on the top.  They did not seem to be in any particular order.  I watched as the airplane passed over the object and it remained behind.  I jokingly said I had seen a UFO then 3 weeks later I heard the reports of a mother ship and smaller vessels in the area where I observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As i began heading towards it, I noticed that this craft was below the treeline.  As soon as my headlights hit it it began to rise very slowly and the searchlight went off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped to see what it would do and it began to slowly move left and right still hovering approx. 25 to 30 feet off of the ground.  As it moved closer to me i noticed that there were several lights on the craft some singular and three linear banks of lights.  What was odd was that the lights were not the kind seen on conventional aircraft.  The single lights were very brite white and 2 of the banks were a very brite amber color, and the last bank of lights were both white and yellow and only the yellow lights oscillated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I noticed that the craft stayed situated exactly the same way as it rose from behind the trees and never moved faster than 2 or 3 mph for as long as I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few things about this sighting did not seem to make since.  First, it was wintertime at almost 2 am and the weather was not condusive to flight.  It was like 10 degrees below 0 and the wind was blowing that nite from 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 60.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out of my car as it crossed the hood of my car and there were visible means of propulsion or any wings or fuselage for the lights to be attached to no wings or anything other than the lights, it was perfectly silent!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of this craft as it slowly went over the house i was stopped in front of.  It was then that I realized that the lights on the craft were configured to look like a helicopter, but it was indeed &#34;ABSOLUTELY NOT&#34; a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went around the development to re-aquire this craft and never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I meant to say there was NO visible means of propulsion!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is not indicated by witness.

It was roughly 9:30pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 5 lights that I could make out.  Very faint.  They were traveling upwards it seemed, and they were traveling at different speeds, as if they were a family walking with a few child stragglers trying to catch up.  I had no explanation, and soon they just faded still travelling upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was dumbfounded people could just discard it and go back to dancing--this was my first time seeing anything in the night sky that couldn’t be explained.

It was approx. 7pm. relatively a clear night.  We were just talking and happened to be on opposite sides of street looking for any signs of a bus coming from any direction, when clear as can be, an object appeared and disappeared.  It was huge!  In addition, it made no sound at all.  In a particular site we gave seen five other sightings of the same thing over the last 1 1/2 years.  Seems to be on the same path.  It appears and disappears with never ever any sound.  Only the last to times it has been closer where you can see the lights flashing strobe like.  It just disappears! We like the sky, we like watching for planes, stars, satellites ECT.  In addition, if you look way up in the sky, beyond the stars almost...you can see the satellites moving but we have seen objects moving in straight lines and back at record speeds.  I know their are allot of satellites but these seem to be moving strangely.  I did not know this site existed, or I would have written along time ago.  There are ufo&#39;s out there, and their are closer then ever now.  How could two people see the same thing?? At the same time?  The government has found out a way to have these flying objects now and fly them around to be unselective for future wars.  Alternatively, another country has made the ship that disappeared many years ago, actually traveled in time but not without major problems and skepticism.  Also on our computers and on our TV, witch is all 2 years old.  Are picking up signs.  Someone said it is just other satellites passing by, but then why are we not hearing it none stop.  I think the plane that hit a” air pocket” last week in B.C. was probly on top of a ufo.  Skidding on top with out knowing it was there.  Because all the ones we have seen, they have appeared and disappeared, witch means they can become invisible at any given time. Some one knows and has had contact with them. Why else are they appearing more and more around the world?  More then ever.  How can we take a picture of them when they move so fast and so quietly?  I am freaked!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

As always, I was looking up at the sky as I walked to the car and noticed two bright orange lights. I thought nothing of this since there are many aircraft in the area (commercial and military) and I thought the odd colour was just due to atmospheric conditions or something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I kept scanning the sky I noticed that all “normal” aircraft’s lights were their “normal” colours, with the usual flashing red markers, etc. So I looked back at the orange lights and noticed that they hadn’t seemed to have moved much, nor changed in size or intensity. This was intriguing, so I kept on watching. I noticed that the lights were moving very slowly but regularly towards the south. Then they suddenly shifted direction and started moving slowly west and then north – without changing colour/intensity/etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a few other people in the front-yard of my friend’s house and I asked them to look – but they kind of just shrugged their shoulders since I was doing a pretty good Richard Dreyfuss as the realization of seeing a real UFO was dawning on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to my car to get my video camera and by the time I got that, powered it up and pointed it at the sky – all of 2 minutes – the lights were dim but seemed to be in the same position as when I last looked. One was dimmer than the other – even though they had both been roughly the same intensity before. I shot some footage but haven’t even bothered looking at it yet, as I expect the CMOS sensor and auto-focus probably screwed the whole “capture”. The world doesn’t need yet another crappy piece of UFO footage, I’m guessing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I continued to watch the lights dim-out which they did over about another 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, when trying to make sense of what I’d seen, I thought it must have been some rocket or satellite boosters or something of that nature, but there were no contrails or any smoke or haze around these lights. And if they were military jets, or something of that nature, then they must have been climbing for a hell of a long time – but without making any sound at all. And their motion from earlier wouldn’t fit normal aircraft flying characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, this was a UFO – I’d love to think it was ET and that 2008 was going to be the year – but I’ll be happy with a much less glamorous resolution to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BTW - I noticed that the following report, is very similar to my own: http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60019.html  I am a video systems software engineer, an amateur astronomer and a hang glider pilot. I like looking at the skies! And I’ve seen lots of video footage of rocket/shuttle launches/etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I asked my mother who was sitting next to me in the vehicle if she knew what it was, of coarse she did not.  We thought it might have been the north star however we were not headed north and the light seemed to get big, then we thought maybe it was a satellite however even satellite don’t get larger . What ever it was, seemed to stay in one place, it just seemed to get bigger and brighter.  My mom and I was talking and she told me something shocking, that she believe  that she actually saw a alien,  it was in a canister  which was completely sealed , the canister was army green with army wording, stating confidential and also had numbers and letter on it.  There was a glass like opening, on the side of it, she was able to see it, and she said it was in this green liquid and that this creature had huge eyes on it diamond chapped face two hole she thought could have been for a nose yet there were no mouth on it.  The thing was very small no bigger than 18 inches; it fit some what loose in the canister.  It had legs and arms.  I asked if she thought it was real, she said she believed it was because of the canister and were the canister was found. The canister was ceiled with tracking number on it she believed it also had a sort of lock on it.   The thing is locked away, the person that has it is afraid to come forward with it due to the government, and how it was received<n>

I began to walk out of my car that I had parked in front of my house. As I began to walk the stretch to my house I noticed four lights that were horizontal that I could tell that they were on craft but I could not see the craft. It traveled at a very fast speed. I have never seen anything in my life traveling so fast. The lights were white and they did not flash and no other red lights were present like they appear on airplanes. The shape went over my house and as it traveled over my head I could not hear a sound. It was a dead silence that I could not explain. The lights turned vertical as it was passing by my head. The lights did not break their form. I could tell that the craft just turned and it did not slow down. As I turned my head the craft kept on going and I saw it for another two seconds before the lights went out. I was left with an eerie feeling about what I had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
12/21/07 19:14|Honolulu|HI|Unknown|2 minutes|On the evening of December 21, 2007, I was driving on Interstate H-1 on the island of Oahu.  The incident occurred at approximately 7:1|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60454.html|118|ndxe200712| On the evening of December 21, 2007, I was driving on Interstate H-1 on the island of Oahu.  The incident occurred at approximately 7:13 pm Hawaii Standard Time (UTC-10) and I was on my way home after attending a Christmas party at the Pearl Ultralounge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was black, no stars, with light, intermittent rain falling.  As I drove down H-1, there were numerous other cars present when the incident occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed in the sky an unusual aircraft flying overhead from the mountains towards the Pacific Ocean with two extremely bright lights (a small white light, and an extremely bright pink light) far too bright to be normal anti-collision lights.  My estimation is that the distance of the object from myself was probably less than five miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be operating at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet above ground level and maintained steady altitude as it headed towards the ocean, flying above what appeared to be the Kalihi area.  During that time, green fireworks were being fired over the city at that time, but the object I observed was by no means the explosion of a firework or a signal flare because it did not suddenly ascend or slowly descend as one might expect of a parachute-retarded flare; rather, the object moved slowly on a level flight path from the mountains to the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see any distinguishing features on the object, because its lights were so bright.  As I drove down the road, I continued to visually track the object for a period of approximately two minutes, when suddenly the object disappeared completely.  I must emphasize strongly that the object did not &#34;fade away&#34; or fly behind a building or mountain causing it to be obscured from view, but rather completely vanished as if one minute it was there, the next minute it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That evening I was completely alert, not fatigued in any way, and I had not consumed any alcoholic beverages.  I am not currently taking any form of medication and I am in good health.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My estimation is at that time of night and level of traffic, many people must have seen the object from H-1.  I was extremely disturbed by what I saw and felt compelled to report it.<n>

Honestly as I caught the tail end of it, my first thought was, someone had set of some fireworks, even though there was no noise, and I just caught the cast off falling to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking at this spot in the sky, to hopefully see the next flash as it happened, another flash appeared to the left in the sky, I turned to look at it, but it was gone, then right in front of me again above the treeline, another flash, and then again to the right, yet another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever this was, it moved so fast that I couldn&#39;t keep up.  I never once got to actually look right at it.

Sighting  December 21,2007 17:20hrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cloud like object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a  60 year old business owner in WPB,FL. I was a Sgt. in USMC Air Corp.and know aircraft/atmospheric/astronomical events.I&#39;ve seen aircraft on fire in the air, flare drops, rockets launch,blimps,meteors,comets, space debris ect.both day and night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were driving home heading due west when I saw at our 12 oclock what appeared to be a small ,flattened oval shape, bright cloud about 50 degrees above the western horizon ,the sky was otherwise totally cloudless and blue, visibility unlimited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second assessment was an aircraft and contrail at high altitude,  yet the shape just wasn&#39;t right.It was larger, brighter and more rounded at the front trailing to the rear but overall very short and unchanging in length or appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were about 3 miles due west of Palm Beach International and a 737 which was climbing out on take off was of equal size .Meaning the cloud/object size was visually equal to the wingspan of the low flying 737, perhaps 3 inchs at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving S and after 5 minutes was at our 8 oclock and dropping to 20 degrees above the horizon as we drove due west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then watched the object move to the west of it trajectory as we were stopped at a long traffic light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say move instead of turn because the object changed course to the west 20 degrees of view within 30 seconds but did not change shape, no curve to contrail,no change of aspect, just change of direction and location .It then dropped slowly below the horizon.to the SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I judged its westerly turn as its view was briefly obscured by several concrete light poles at the intersection . We were stopped , watching through the drivers side window, the object began traversing from our left to right. First visible to the left of the poles then crossing behind and visable on their rightside. If it had not changed direction it would have simply settled below the horizon maintaining it movement to our left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the cloud appearance never changed, like a still photo of it moving accross the sky.Very strange event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About a week before she had seen strange aircrafts about a half hour apart. She described each of the craft as a perfect circle of light that looked like an over-sized star or planet, which was moving strangely around the night sky. When she paid very close attention to it, trying to figure out what it was, the circle of light disappeared, and was replaced by three smaller, dimmer lights, which formed an equilateral  triangle, as if it were trying to look less bright. The three lights then got dimmer and dimmer, until they disappeared altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a little skeptical. I believed she saw something, but I thought she must have been mistaken, and that it was really just a helicopter. However, early the next morning, I went outside to go to the bus stop, and in the sky were two circles of light slowly moving in random directions. They were definitely not helicopters, or any other kind of aircraft that I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the crafts disappeared while I had my eye on the second one. I stood staring at it for about a minute, and then I remembered that my sister had said that it seemed to retreat only when she really tried to figure out what it was. So I focused all my attention on it. Then, The craft spun to show a different side, which had three dim lights that formed and equilateral triangle. I was so in awe, that i didn&#39;t think to get out my camera, and all I could do was stare at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bus arrived, and so my sighting came to an end. I felt like I had been &#34;visited,&#34; as crazy as it may sound, and I felt like it was because my sister tld me about her sighting. It was eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We looked east toward the Mississippi River, the highway is about 70 feet above the river on a sloping bluff. We saw three lite blue lights at each point of a dark triangle box shaped air craft. The triangle shaped air craft was traveling north following at a height of about 500 feet above the Mississippi River at about 48 knots/hr.. The craft seemed to be following the the river, but then dipped slightly to it&#39;s right and turned north/east over the river and disappeared in the thick fog. There was no sound that we could hear. The triangle shaped craft seemed to just float in the fog like a gost ship at sea.  We seen the craft for only a duration of 10 sec., but it was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was dark here in Florida.  I noted the time because as soon as my wife said we have a UFO we checked the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft appeared WSW of my home and at a very high angle, almost overhead.  I would place the craft almost due west of Saint Petersburg proper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was heavy periodic cloud cover with some moonlight. The size of the craft to the naked eye appeared to be just larger than a star so it was very high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, we had low power binoculars, and night scope. When viewed through these two aids it was clear it was a triangle and had lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There&#39;s no doubt this was a craft as it was clearly intelligently guided.

12/20/07 18:00|Beirut, Tabariss (Lebanon)||Fireball|30 seconds|As usual every day I was on my way back home from work in a shared taxi service from Hamra to Ashrafieh Beirut, Lebanon (Middle East).|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63195.html|130|ndxe200712| As usual every day I was on my way back home from work in a shared taxi service from Hamra to Ashrafieh Beirut, Lebanon (Middle East). It was between December 07 and January 08 around 6pm. After “Murr Tower” we were crossing the Ring highway that gets us to Ashrafieh from Hamra. I was sitting in the front next to the driver and another passenger a young woman (around 26 yrs old) was sitting behind me at the back-seat. As we were crossing that highway I saw a motionless light-ball in front of us about 200-250 high and about 200 meters ahead. Let me point something here: Since a similar sighting of a couple of years earlier, I keep gazing in the sky when I’m in a car with someone. It was about the same timing but for a longer time, me and my brother were stuck in heavy traffic between Carantina and Dora when we noticed two still orangey Light-balls ahead of us in traffic about 250-300 meters above the horizon but looked much farther, about a km or a little less. We pointed and some people in close-by cars noticed them too. We kept guessing if it could possibly be artificial lighting over a high building or a road light but it sure wasn’t. The pair were too high above the horizon and after a while one moved towards the other and they started moving up and down and left and right in short sharp swift manner which exclude the possibility of a normal helicopter, they were too fast and froze too quickly when they stopped. Let me get back now this late sighting of last year, here it was motionless and grabbed my attention and excitement clearly so I showed it to the driver and then the girl at the back, they were both amazed by the strange nature of a frozen motionless glittering fire ball in the sky, it looked small but appeared like a ball not a point and felt too close. By the time the taxi driver had the chance to pull over on the right side of the highway we became exactly underneath it. The three of us got our heads out of the windows and looked at it from beneath. I remember the girl sayi! ng “we’r e exactly under it now, please move forward before something falls down on us!”. My best guess is that it was 200-300 meters above us now, looked 2x larger than before, fiery orange to yellow light sphere. The second the driver stepped on the gas and moved forward it gradually but rapidly darted straight towards the opposite way we were heading and that is towards Ras-Beirut (Hamra) gaining ultra speed. I kept my head out and my eyes pointed at the thing, as it first accelerated when the car was about to move, it started glittering and then as it gained speed it started blinking more, as it sped very fast reaching probably the shoreline over “Manara” it blinked faintly and disappeared. The time it took from acceleration to disappearance is no more than 4 seconds. The three of us were startled with what we saw and guessed that it might be some advanced Israeli unmanned reconnaissance droid which I doubt it because why does it shine so bright if it’s supposed to be sneaking discretely for sound or image?

Just under clouds a large disk with five to seven bright blue lights around the edges of the bottom of the disk.  The lights looked large from the ground; maybe three to four inches in diameter so again probably much bigger close up.  The lights were an octagon-like shape.  Hovered for a couple of minutes, then moved from side to side very slowly, then pivoted so you could see the entire bottom of the disk (stayed like that for at least ten seconds which is why I have so many details about what the bottom of the disk looked like), then turned diagonal and shot through the air in a diagonal.  Then it appeared in the same spot, hovered over the street, the lights turned off for a second, then back on, then off again, then on.  I had to drive away because I wasn&#39;t sure what I was seeing and had errands to run but spend at least 4-8 minutes looking.  When we drove off it was still there.  On our way back from errands we drove the same way, there was a helicopter flying around the area...my friend in the car said it might be military because it had strobe like lights on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I didn’t notice any clouds or smoke, but at times; some of the objects had a trail behind them.  The objects danced around the sky for about ten to fifteen minutes. There was no aircraft or power lines in the vicinity. Nothing that would create a pattern like this. There wasn’t anything between the objects, and me but there were light clouds. I was wearing my glasses at the time, which had been recently cleaned, I tried viewing the objects with and without the glasses, and I saw the same objects. I wasn’t wearing any headphones at the time, the objects were silent. I’m not on any prescription drugs, nor was I consuming alcohol. The sighting concluded around 8:10 or 8:15. (Eastern)<n>

It seemed to me that the military aircraft were in pursuit or observing the object.This object moved in a manner,with a grace and speed that I have never witnessed.It was quite fascinating.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We do not have a guess on their height relative to the ground; though each light appeared to be at exactly the same height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We witnessed this approximately 2 miles from what appeared to be the area below the lights.

I am  starring at it thinking it was an oil rig light, when I thought I saw it move a little bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to shine my bright LED Light at it and got its attention, and boy did I.  It started coming at me fast about 8 to 9 hundred mph. I was scared, but my curiosity got the best of me. It took 1 full minute to stop 30 yards in front of me in my car.  I had my car window down with my arm out the window and kept shining my led light at this no sound at all, the size of my fist orange ball of pulsating light playing with it for 2 or 3 hours.  It was frozen still staring at me, and moveing left to fight up and down.  I tryed to get closer to it by chasing it down the beach, but it would&#39;nt let me get any closer than 30 yards.  It just kept the same distance when I was moving or not moving.  It stayed with me untill sunrise and slowly moved away 3 feet obove the water and faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve also seen in 10/29/2008 another dark orange submersible ball light in another area moving squiggly fast under 2 feet of water in the bay very simuler to my first sighting.

The lights changed in color and intensity, although luminosity was maintained at comparable brightness to stars in the vicinity, over the course of the half hour in which they were seen, the objects also meandered across the sky, going various directions at most times, while stopping and staying still for more than five minutes at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first light was observed heading SW, then NW, then N, then back to the south, and so on. Eventually, three of the objects made a triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several attempts were made at photographic evidence, but the cameras in use were not powerful enough to pick up the lights clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some points, the lights moved fast enough to leave behind a slight tail of disturbance in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several commercial planes were observed in the vicinity of some of the objects, but distance was not able to be judged without better instrumentation to be able to determine how close the planes were to the objects.<n>

None more than 75ft from the ground. One was directly in the road and we drove right under it and it didn&#39;t move nor did anything happen with us or the truck. 2nd craft was to our right in an open field just hovering the same as the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A 3rd craft was on the oncoming traffic side of the highway moving away slowly while a 4th was coming towards us but on the opposite side of the highway.. the 5th craft could barely be seen between the trees on the opposite side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All crafts were displaying thousands of multi-colored lights on their underside, flashing at different speeds and no pattern. They seemed to be searching for something... We witnessed them from about 3miles away until we drive under and kept going. I couldn&#39;t stop, as my cousin wouldn&#39;t let me;  behind us was another car and a semi truck a little further behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting was in an area where there was no houses or infrastructure only cleared land Manuel for cattle.

We saw a bright light off to the Northwest heading straight towards us at a slow rate of speed. I pulled the car over and we just watched. As it got closer, we started to get afraid.  As it flew about 2,000 feet overhead, we could see a large football field-sized rectangular object with white lights underneath.  I turned the car around to follow it and it accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and was gone within a few seconds towards the Southeast. I have NEVER seen anything like it before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> News reports the next day stated others had seen it and that it was a Russian satellite or booster rocket re-entering the atmosphere and crashed in the Gulf of Mexico.

The lights looked like headlights of a semi truck, but in the sky hovering. As we drove closer it moved fast across the street over a sod farm and stopped and hovered again. We pulled off of the side of the road and rolled the windows down to see if we could hear anything. We heard a “whoosh” type of sound. It wasn’t too loud. I attempted to take a photograph, which of course didn’t turn out, but when my flash fired the lighting of the craft changed. That scared us and we left quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Soon 1 faded out of sight, and gradually another faded, then another.  After about 10 minutes all had faded away.  They did not appear to be projected, but they seemed to be a light source. At first we thought they might have been remnants of a recently shot firework, but they lingered too long for that.  We speculated they could have been weather ballons, with flames heating the air to fill the balloons, but they were too far away to see any balloon or flame shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We saw 5 large orange circles (what appeared to be fire in the foothills, or what looked just like wildfire in the foothills outside of Boulder).  They were very large--it looked as if it was fire moving up the foothills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched these, they were climbing up into the foothills (not far off the ground) in a straight line. They started to move together into a circle--at this point, it was apparent they were not on the foothills, but in the sky just above the mountain line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After forming a tight circle, two disappeared while the other 3 formed a triangle and started to climb much higher into the sky. The two bottom ones disappeared about halfway into the sky (I would say 15,000-20,000 feet) while the top one climbed to at least 40,000 feet and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were bright and it was only 9pm--so there had to be others who saw this.

We were traveling north. Now we are turning left at the light. I look up in the sky to my right and see an orange red glow. As I&#39;m telling everyone to look all of us except my youngest which is four, see the one red orange glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we were thinking maybe a plane blew up or a star fell from the sky. Then right after seeing the first glow, we see four or five other round orange, reddish glows below it and slightly to the east.  It was one glow and stayed glowed until the other four or five lit ,but they either had just appeared or lit up at the same time. They were not in a circular formation. They were in more of almost a straight line curving slightly east with the last two even more so to the east.  From the distance they seemed to be the size of a basketball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They stayed in one spot and glowing for no more than 10 seconds,it was just enough time to get a good look and then there was no glows..so we assumed they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we are all looking at each other saying we never saw this before.  After going through the drive thru teller as we are leaving we all look up across the street hoping we see this again so we can take a picture with our camera phone.  We are further west now than what we were but only about three blocks down the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two or three minutes later now leaving the bank we are starting to traveling east and my husband, oldest and self start yelling at the same time look their they are again.  It was the same thing pretty much the same formation as before.  They stayed in one spot with the same glow.  Again they did not stay long.  Its like the glows were there and gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t get a picture. It probably would not have came out good on a cell phone but I would have like to have tried.  You could clearly see they had moved, in the west direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange red circular glows best described, looked like the tip of a cigarette lit..that bright orange color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now after doing some research we believe these could have been some sort of ufo space craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do believe that we do have visitors that come to earth and some don&#39;t.  I&#39;m sure most people don&#39;t want to talk about it either since people will think the ones that do are crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could you let me know what you think.

I have a 1 minute video footage of part of this event, that occurred on a clear evening in the South East London area. I am very willing to send you the footage....I have put this on youtube, here is the link- http://youtube.com/watch?v=Fi6zqCIsam0  REPORT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time 7.10pm Date: december 15th, 2007 Location SE22, London Witnesses 6 Duration of sighting: 7-9 minutes Conditions: Extremely clear night  We were at work. I am the head chef and the other key witness is a kitchen assistant.At 7pm, he went outside to smoke a cigarrette.I was inside the kitchen and I was very busy. I could hear a helicopter at an uncomfortably low altitude (sounded like it was going to land outside!!)My colleague came into the kitchen shouting &#34;OVNI!OVNI!&#34; (Which apparently means &#39;UFO&#39; in Latin.)  I went outside and saw a black military helicopter (possibly a Chinook) flying very low and erratically over the neighbouring houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On closer inspection,it appeared to be chasing several small darting lights in the sky. We watched for 5-10 minutes as the helicopter investigated. There was also a &#34;static&#34; ufo that was there for about 5 minutes (you can see this in the video, it is the white orb to the right of the street light...this later just vanished, sort of de-materialized. During the sighting, 2 other smaller white orbs appeared to &#34;dock&#34; with the stationary UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were also several other smaller lights darting around it. One was flashing at orange and bright blue colour in 3 second intervals. The other smaller objects (there may have been a total of 20 during the 5-10 minute sighting, kept appearing and disappearing!! Weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This video was taken using a Samsung mobile phone- This video does not do justice to what we saw. The bright light in the middle is obviously a street light. You can&#39;t see the helicopter on here because it had no lights on at all! But you can clearly hear it. The one to the right is the stationary white orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The interseting thing is , that there were a spate of sightings in the same area in the same week (the sighting you have on your site in Brixton (Dec 12th) is approx 2 miles away from where I was)  What we saw was amazing.The video footage doesn&#39;t really do justice to what we witnessed. There is absolutely no way that these were baloons, military craft,civilian craft, anomolous lights etc...why was a military helicopter chasing them? And why did the military helicopter have no lights on? I find this very surprising as in this area of SE London, we are on several flight paths for 3 major airports.It seems that the helicopter may have been scrambled to investigate the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a bright light, not unlike a satellite but moving in a north to south direction; Brighter than any star. There were no other lights or colors associated with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued moving south in atypical movements characteristics of an airplane or helicopter. It didn’t move like an airplane and there was no noise. It was traveling fairly fast and suddenly slowed down and them took a short oblique move to the right and then to the left and the continued south. Too fast and abrupt to be a helicopter or aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued south for two or three seconds and then started to fade and disappear. Did not get a chance to observe it with binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within seconds after the light faded away, an aircraft (identified by flashing red and blue lights and noise) appeared above the tree line due south and passed directly along the same path as the object but heading north.

12/15/07 18:25|Newark|DE|Circle|15 minutes|Two very bright lights seen in the sky before vanishing, one seen a second time in a different location several minutes later|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60426.html|155|ndxe200712| Two very bright lights seen in the sky before vanishing, one seen a second time in a different location several minutes later<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last Saturday evening, the 15th of December, I was running some errands. I was on my way from my apartment to my place of work to pick up my paycheck (about a 5 minute drive.) I was alone in the car. There are two ways to get to my work, and if I had chosen the way that I usually prefer to take, I may not have seen what I saw that night. I thought that this other way would be quicker though, so I went that way. I almost made the light at the intersection of Wyoming Road (which I was on, facing east) and Marrow&#39;s Road, but it turned red just before I got there, so I was stopped for a few minutes waiting to make a left turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the south (my right side) of this intersection is a large suburban residential area. To the northwest (roughly behind me) is a shopping center. Directly east (in front of me) is a large warehouse of some kind, and slightly to the northeast of that building is a highly visible chemical factory building with large smokestacks (which I always jokingly call &#34;those pretty cloud machines.&#34;) I don&#39;t think there was anyone else stopped at the intersection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky that night was completely overcast; not a single star could be seen anywhere. The sun had set, so it was fully nightttime, but because of the cloud cover bouncing back the light pollution it was relatively light outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I was sitting at the red light and just looking ahead of me, when I saw two very bright, circular or spherical white lights come out of nowhere in the eastern sky, above the warehouse. I thought they must be planes at first, and Delaware does have an airport somewhat nearby with occasionally low-flying planes, but these objects were hovering and not traveling in a straight trajectory. The lights on them were also much brighter than on a plane. It was difficult to tell exactly how far away from me they were, and I did not hear any noise. The two lights were close together at first. The one on the right remained stationary in the sky, and its light was stable. The one on the left was blinking on and off, and moved slowly to the left (north.) I got the feeling that the stationary one was in some way controlling the movements of the other one. As I watched this I realized they were not ordinary aircraft, and it seemed that the instant I thought this, the lights stopped moving for a second and then gradually retreated back behind the thick cloud cover. From my perspective, it looked like they faded out before disappearing. I had the distinct impression that they had been aware I was watching, and the whole thing spooked me out. The traffic light turned green and I continued on my way, trying to analyze what had happened and think of any other possible explanations. I was mad that I had forgotten to take out my camera, but I was so shocked by what I was seeing and it was over very quickly (the lights were visible for maybe 20-30 seconds or so total.)  After picking up my paycheck, I went to my mother&#39;s house, which is in a residential neighborhood off of Kirkwood Highway. As I pulled onto her street (again facing east) I saw just one of these same bright white lights. The light was not blinking, so I assumed it was the non-blinking one I had seen before (it looked exactly the same), but it could have been the blinking one from before or possibly a third craft. I pulled into my mom&#39;s driveway while continuing to watch the light, which was still just moving slowly around in the sky, hovering. I looked at the clock so at least I would know exactly what time it was on this second sighting...it was 6:41 pm. Now I thought of my camera and fished around in my purse for it, but was unable to locate it. (I had taken it out a couple nights before to take pictures of something else and never put it back.) I kept watching the light, and again it was like the craft knew I was watching and conspiring to take pictures of it. Suddenly, the bright light was shut off, but I could still see three very dim lights in a triangular pattern in its place. The lights were (I think) red/pink, blue/green, and yellow/orange. This triangular formation then moved to the left (north) and disappeared behind a house. That was the last I saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home that night, I drew pictures of what I had seen and jotted down the details. I looked up the locations where I saw these craft on Mapquest, and I was definitely looking almost directly east both times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college student in my senior year, and I work part time in customer service. I was not under the influence of any intoxicants at the time. I believed in UFOs and extraterrestrial intelligence before, but now I am even more sure that they exist. I am not sure that what I saw could not have been explained by man-made technology, but I can&#39;t shake the feeling that they knew I was watching and altered their movements because of it.<n>

In our area the night sky is really dark and occasionally you can see satellites.  I thought it would be really cool to show my daughter an orbiting satellite if I could locate one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing in front of our house (which faces directly north) and I looked in a NNE direction in the sky and I witnessed a bright white light slowly heading in a NNW direction. I watched the light for about 45 seconds to a minute when my daughter started to ask me if we could hurry up and go. I didn&#39;t want to point it out to her becuase I thought she might get a little freaked out.  As I watched the light move across the sky it faded to orange and gradually got smaller until it completely faded into the night sky and was no longer visible. After about 2 minutes the light was completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed the light I almost thought it could have been a spotlight from a helicopter, but there was no sound and because of the mountains in the canyon we live in, my thoughts are the elevation of the light appeared to be much higher than a helicopter would normally fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light gradually disappeared kind of like when you turn a clear light bulb off and the filament is still hot and glows and as it cools of it goes completely out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object seemed to be almost directly below the moon and was much brighter and larger than any star I’ve seen. Approximate timing of the event was early in the morning around 5am or so. I can tell you myself I am a skeptic but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to report this. As I watched the object for about 10 minutes it never moved from that spot but continually every minute or so would dime very slowly to almost nothing and then begin to brighten to the exact size once again. I admit to you that I got scared so I decided to stop watching what I was seeing  out of disbelief of the situation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

12/15/07 04:30|Loves Park|IL|Unknown|15 seconds|Four unmoving, wide blue beams of light at night from sky to ground, with no light source.|3/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107541.html|161|ndxe200712| Four unmoving, wide blue beams of light at night from sky to ground, with no light source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In December of 2007 I had a newspaper delivery route that I did every night in my car for several years.  One night, around 4:30 am, I was doing my normal delivery route when I drove around a corner that approached a cul-de-sac.  Just as I turned the corner and was facing the cul-de-sac head on, I saw 4 wide blue beams of light that looked like they were coming from the sky to the ground, spanning the distance behind 2 of the homes at the end of the turn-around for the cul-de-sac.  I slammed on the breaks to stop and look at it because I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.  A few seconds after I stopped the lights disappeared as if someone flicked a light switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 4 beams were cut off at the top at an even level, so I have to assume they were actually coming from the sky to the ground.  I couldn’t see anything in the sky above the beams, there was no noise, and none of the homes had any lights on anywhere.  Behind the homes was a wooded area with no other homes built up behind them.  I can’t explain what I saw, and I have no other witnesses to it other than my Pit Bull that I took with me on my route, and she’s not talking.  I’ve never told anyone about it because I know how people react when you tell them about strange stuff like this, so I kept my mouth shut all these years, but it has been driving me crazy to this day wondering what I saw.  I had that route for 2 years and have never seen it again, but it always used to creep me out having to deliver to those houses after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never heard of anyone reporting a sight like that yet.  I’ve heard of maybe one beam of light, but not 4 all at the same time, the same width and height, and all instantly shutting off at once.  But the beams were a very bright blue and almost looked solid.  You couldn’t see through them.  Even the trees in the background couldn’t be seen.  The beams had a slight V-shape to them, with the widest point at the top.  They didn’t disappear into the sky, but seemed to have a source about 20 ft. above the homes, all leveled off at the same height, but I couldn’t see anything above the homes that would have been shining down or a light source.  It was just black night sky.  It all happened so fast that it felt like when I came around that corner and stopped and how everything suddenly shut off so fast, that it was something that wasn’t supposed to have been witnessed.  I’m just curious if anyone else has ever seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Seconds later a plane passed. Then after the plane noise died away, I could hear a strange noise that sounded like something being dragged on the ground, but it was loud and coming from above. Immediately after that, a bright green light appeared in the sky, out to the West. It hovered in the sky for a moment, then disappeared as it fell below the roof level of the house in front of mine. The only reason it didn&#39;t seem like a flare was that it was much larger, and didn&#39;t leave a trail as it moved. My husband, who was in the house, also witnessed the  sphere through a window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I mentioned the shooting star is because a previous poster mentioned seeing shooting stars in conjunction with his UFO sighting in Lompoc, 60 miles away, about a month ago.

I am very able to observe and report in extreme detail an accurate account of my observeration(s). I currently am still blessed with 20/20 vision in both eyes, but do need a 1.25 diopter lens set to read clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I observed this UFO, I was not under the influence of any vision altering drug, as I am sure Zegerid does not alter my vision and have not observed any problem whatsoever with my &#39;distant&#39; vision. It was moderately snowing, and I was actually in Escadillia Bonita Acres, (spelling) in New Mexico, USA which is just East of the Arizona/New Mexico border and is located in New Mexico. It was dark, and getting colder when I went out to my truck to get my coffee mug. As I turned to return to the trailer where we were staying at night during our elk hunt, I glanced towards where we had Dad&#39;s elk hanging in a tree nearby. As I did, a light in the sky caught my eye. As I looked directly at it, I thought it to be nothing more than a clearing in the coulds, where a star was &#34;shining&#34; through. I thought that this was strange, due to the steady snowfall, but no &#34;big deal&#34;. As I started to turn away, a movement in this &#34;star&#34; made me look again. I was amazed to see this &#34;star&#34; begin to move erratically at a rapid pace, looking very much like someone moving a laser pen light around on a darkened wall, except it was not red, it was white, much like a star. This light was due East towards Springerville, Arizona, USA, and at an approximate 40 degree rise from the surface of the earth. The thought immediately occured to me that I must be &#34;wobbling&#34; and I quickly leaned against the truck to stabilize my body and head and noted that there was another &#34;star&#34; just to the left of the one that was moving erratically, only this &#34;star&#34; was completely immobile. As soon as I realized that this observation was totally out of the ordinary, I yelled quite loudly &#34;Dad, get out here, there is a UFO out here!&#34; He came out immediately, and looked at it as I pointed at it. It was stationary from that point on, and slowly faded away as if the clouds obscured it. The other &#34;star&#34; remained visable, and we watched for a few minutes as it too faded from view, which I attribute to the clouds and snow. In our observation, I was the only one to! see the quick and erratic motion of this light/star like object in the sky. I am quite familiar with aircraft, and this was completely quiet and moved way to fast and strangely for me to think that it was ours unless we have some craft that is not a part of the general public knowlege. It was quite cold, and snowing, so we retired to the warmth of the trailer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The few stars I could detect were extremely faint in comparison.  I was transfixed by the object which dominated the sky and appeared to be triangular in shape and stood watching it for about 15 minutes. Finally, a neighbor was leaving for work and she also agreed it was an unfamiliar object. I called the FBI but I think they dismissed me as a crackpot. The weird thing is that about 11 hours later a manhole cover exploded on my street and we lost power for a little while. It&#39;s just one of those eerie feelings you sense when something is out of context in the world as we know it.<n>

I and another worker seen a bright yellow light in the sky. It wasn&#39;t very high in altitude, I&#39;d say around 1/2 mile or so. the light stayed there for hours(5-7) then dissapear. Few days later same place same light. About 2 weeks later. I asked other co-workers if they have seen anything weird around here lately. About 5 persons reported that they&#39;ve seen on different occasion the same light. I dunno believe in Aliens. However, I cannot find any logical explaination. Anyway, again this week I&#39;ve seen the same light, same spot. I&#39;ve decided to explore and have a look. I reached the light, however it was higher than what I was expecting. about 2 miles high. Not moving. But here is the problem, when I was looking at it, the light simply dissapear the light got smaller and smaller and smaller really quick and dissapear.  Again I cannot find an explanation. Wasn&#39;t a plane for sure. Wasn&#39;t a star or satelite, not high enough. there is no mountain or phone tower around the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As we entered in the Sacramento area we witnessed a long cigar shaped craft with row of light on the bottom. This craft was very large and moving as fast as a low plane would appear to be flying. It was really dark and cloudy in the sky so we really could not see above the row of 10 or so lights but could see almost the out line of as it blended into the sky. Now something really struck me later and I do not know if this could be related or if this has happened before to anyone that has witnessed a something like this but the smell of skunk was very strong for 10 to 15 miles of our trip. (I am thinking that animals were freaking out from this this craft?)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this because maybe someone got a better look at this craft then we did. I just wish I was not on the freeway and having to look at the road, so I am not sure what it was but have never seen so many lights and what appeared to be at leat 10 times the size of a lower flying jetliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

What caught my attention was the reflection of the minimal neighborhood lights reflecting off of it. I noticed it and immediately pointed it out to my wife who also saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was most interesting was that it appeared to be quite large, had no lights, and was moving quickly with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Possible Alien Voice?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi, this happened about 2 months ago, a UFO-type phenomena seems like a logical explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred in Cheney, WA on December 13th, give or take a day. I am a junior at EWU.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself, my roommate and 2 friends were sitting in the living room, we were all watching one friend play a video game, but the volume was really low, almost mute, and we had my computer playing music at a moderate level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sitting closest to my room, and all of the sudden I start to hear this weird sound.  It starts from nothing, and it sounds like a giant loud machine, like reactor is the best way to describe it, and it came in sound waves and each wave got louder and louder, like  pulsating vibrating waves, and the whole time I could not tell if this was in my mind until I looked at my friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of my friends jaws were dropped,  they could hear it to.  At the point of almost deafening, it then made just like a quick split second space type sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a voice asked in perfect English “WHERE AM I?” and clicked out with the same split second space sound and it was done, all of my friends agree that the voice was not in any way, shape, or form a human voice, I definitely agree.  The best way to describe it is like a creepy, confused little creature, but in a way sounded harmless.   We all agree that it happened in my room, which scares the hell out of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I emailed a guy who I thought was an expert and he tried to tell me it was a ghost sighting or something, but I cannot stress enough of how much like a creature it was.  I just really want a logical explanation, it was a very scary event, probably only lasting 10 seconds tops, and I am sure you have heard some sightings and events in your day, and all of this happened, even though it sounds really crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do you hear of this often? Or do you know what the hell happened to us?  Thank you very much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another question I have is why my room, my apartment, we live on the 3rd floor of a college apartment complex.  Prior to the event, probably a month or two I had been looking up UFO stuff pretty tuff, so when it happened, and when I started thinking about why it happened in our apartment, that scared me.<n>

The origination point of the lights were very sharp and clear, so I assume the thing was very low.  It traversed the entire sky in about two seconds.  There was no noise whatsoever - an absolutely quiet night.  I understand how worthless this report is in and of itself, but I&#39;m reporting it simply because there may be other (and better) reports in this area.  I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t be more specific and helpful. If it was as low as I estimate it was (possibly 100 feet over the ground), then the thing was going so fast it was completely unnatural and unusual.  There is an airport (the Charleston airport in that general direction, but this was no airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw an incredibly bright, white, flashing light above the trees ahead of the road. It flashed about every 4 seconds, very regularly, I could tell because it was flashing to the beat of the song I was listening to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the size of a pin head when I first noticed it and it was a bit too high to be a tower, or any kind and I was too far out in the country for any houses to be around, there are no light poles or even power lines along that road. I know this area pretty well, I live just a few miles away and I drive on that road all the time, I have never seen anything like that out there before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove closer I went around a few turns and it was now on the right side of my car, it got a lot bigger and a lot brighter very quickly. At the biggest, I saw it through the trees, it was almost the size of the moon and it was bright, when I looked at the center it was so bright it blinded my vision, the center looked multicolored or black it was so bright. I do not think it ever moved but I cannot be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything up in the air that bright, that big and not moving. When I could not see it I could tell it was there because it kind of lit up the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to highway 98 I turned west back to my house. I could not see the light once I got onto 98, I drove down hill and the light was behind and to the right of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

12/12/07 21:00|Birmingham|AL|Cylinder|20 seconds|A cylinder of blue pulsing light and some sort of craft concealed in a thick low hanging cloud|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61308.html|190|ndxe200712| A cylinder of blue pulsing light and some sort of craft concealed in a thick low hanging cloud<n> <n><n> <n><n> On December 15, 2007 around 9:30 p.m.  my husband and I were heading home.  We were on the Southside of Birmingham and were driving up Arlington Avenue South to cut through to Montclair Road via Carlisle Road.  We live in the Crestwood/Irondale area of Birmingham.   The weather was in the low 60&#39;s and overcast and a bit gusty and there was rain in the forecast.  Not really unusual for the south but for some reason it just felt odd almost the way it feels before a thunderstorm or even a tornado.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we turned onto Montclair from Carlisle, we drove just a short distance approximately a quarter of a mile to where the Pilgrim Church is and we noticed through the trees and up to the left a flash of a very bright blueish light that lasted maybe a second.  We both expected to hear thunder or a boom from a transformer but we heard nothing.  As we continued on maybe another quarter of a mile, we were approaching a red light and intersection.  It should be noted that there is a ridge to the left that runs parallel to Montclair and at the intersection there is a post office to the left and just up from there is another building that houses the Orthopedic Specialists.   This ridge is mostly residential.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were about to pass under the red light (speed limit is 25)  to our surprise the brilliant blue light reappeared on the ridge just behind the Orthopedic Specialists building. We were maybe 500 feet from it so you could see it very clearly.  What we saw was truly amazing and we have never ever seen anything like it.   The light was a brilliant plasma blue. It seemed to pulse, it was bright but not blinding.  The cylinder was very large, approximately about 50 - 60 feet across and about 100-120 feet tall.  There seemed to be a cylinder within a cylinder.  The outermost cylinder had a very 3D appearance and the best way to describe it...a Hexagon.  It was slowly rotating counterclockwise.  The innermost cylinder was smooth but it didn&#39;t really seem to rotate. You could pretty much see through the cylinder but because of the light it definately had a hazy glow to it.   The cylinder extended up towards what appeared to be a circular stack of levels starting with the lowest level closest to the cylinder, which was made up of rectangle shaped lights arranged around the perimeter of possibly the bottom of a craft.  It too was rotating in a counterclockwise direction.  The next  3 levels stepped up and out and disappeared into a very dense low hanging cloud.  You absolutely could not see what was up in the clouds and I have to say that the cloud was unusually low and very dense and despite how windy it was seemed to just hang there.  The craft just hovered there and it lasted approximately 5 seconds.    Then just like a light switch it turned off.  There was no way to tell if the craft disappeared or if the light just turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued traveling down Montclair and trying to put our minds around what we saw.  We had probably travelled less than a quarter of a mile and that took less than a minute when just like before it appeared again.  It seemed to be travelling very slowly along the top of the ridge.  When the light appeared it just seemed to hover over the houses along the top part of the ridge. Again, concealed in the cloud. This time we pulled over and rolled down the window.  There was no noise, no whir, no sound at all.  All of a sudden all of the lights to the left of Montclair Road where the craft was hovering all went out.  The entire neighborhood was cast into darkness.  Of course, curiosity getting the best of us, we decided to turn up into the neighborhood towards the area that the craft might be to see if by some chance we might catch a closer glimpse.  All of the houses were dark, no street lights....very eery but it was obviously gone.   As we made a U turn to go back down towards Montclair there was a very clear view of another ridge that is a few miles away and we could see transformers blowing one after another, maybe 5 in all .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The saddest part is I actually had my camera in the backseat, why o why didn&#39;t I pull myself together enough to get out my camera and record the event.  At any rate, this was absolutely the most amazing thing that either of us have seen or experienced.    I have to say I have always been a skeptic but I just have no idea what this could have been but it definately seemed to have some purpose or intention in what it was doing.  What would that be?  I have no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It fell down diagonally to the right. The sky was somewhat cloudy, and it was still bright outside, making it clearly not a shooting star, since no other stars were visible. The object looked bigger and closer than a star, and also had a shimmer to it to make it seem as if it were made of metal. The object went for a distance of about one fist (meaning if you extend your arm, aim it to the sky, and close on eye, the object traveled from the top of the fist to the bottom).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred at 5:52 PM on Wednesday, December 12, 2007, while driving south on Jameson Street in Ashville, Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Straight ahead, about a 45 degree angle, we saw a single medium to bright light. I asked him to watch it as I was driving. I asked him to look for the red and green sidelights to see if it was a plane. He could not see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He mentioned that we could be seeing the headlight(s) of a small plane. I said that I didn’t think they had headlights of that color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a left 90 degree turn. The light was nearing our position, so I could not see it anymore but he could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He rolled down his window to listen for noises. He could hear nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to the next intersection there was a store there with a large parking lot. I pulled in and parked, turned off my lights and engine and got out of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I saw it again it was almost directly above me and moving slowly to the North. My son asked if it could be a helicopter and again, I didn’t think they had lights of that color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He suggested that it might be a hot air balloon. The color of the light did look like it could be a flame of some sort, being a red/orange shade. That made the most sense, although if it were a balloon you would be able to see the outline of the balloon as the flame would ignite the air inside the balloon, giving us a good view of the shape and size of the balloon, if not the colors of he silk. We could see no shape of any balloon and there was no obvious basket below the object for holding the people who would be operating the balloon.  He mentioned that he thought the light was flickering as a flame would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as he said this the flame flickered out and disappeared. We waited, thinking that if it were a balloon, the operator would have to re-ignite the flame to keep the balloon from falling. There were no sounds of attempts to re-ignite the flame and there was no more light. We could not see anything falling to the ground, even at a slow rate given for the hot air of a balloon to cool, bringing the balloon down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting lasted about seven minutes. It was approximately 5:45pm, Wednesday, December 12, 2007, in the very Northwest corner of Washington State, about 30 minutes south of the Canadian border. There was a wispy cloud cover of about 1000 feet, but we couldn’t even see the diluted light of a flame going through the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued on our way with my son watching for a return of the light, while I drove. I arrived back home about 30 minutes later, not having see the light again.<n>

This formation appeared again, about 5 to 10 miles east within about 30 seconds, then again way toward the west in about 30 seconds, then far in the distance about 10 miles in the opposite direction...this basically repeated 7 times before I had to move on.  Tried to catch this on my cell phone, but the light wasn&#39;t bright enough.  The weird thing is, 2 other people who I go to class with saw this at the same time I did about 10 mile north of where I was at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned right onto auction road going west. I then turned right onto Junction Road going north, and in the the sky to the NNW both my wife and I saw a bright white light. The light was approximately 20-30 degrees above the horizon, and I couldn&#39;t tell from my vantage point what distance it was from our position. Normally, this is an area where commercial aircraft fly, flying towards Lancaster Regional Airport, so we thought nothing of it until the object split apart in what appeared to be several sections. The time was approximately 17:10 when this event occurred. I said to my wife, &#34;did you see that?&#34; she said that she did, and asked me if I knew what it was. I told her that I didn&#39;t know. When it split apart, it separated into smaller white lights that went left and right from center in a straight line, and then it disappeared. To the right of Junction Road going East is a lot that belongs to Manheim Auto Auction, to the left is holding ponds for water runoff, and directly in front is a few homes, and a shallow wooded area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were white in color and were too close together to be aircraft and were extremely bright.  They were in a &#34;J&#34; or hook formation.  I was in running distance to my residence.  I asked my wife to come out to see what I was looking at.  By the time she came outside, only two lights were present but she was able to see that they seemed out of place in that it wasn&#39;t something you would see in the sky.  The lights then faded out.  About a minute later they reappeard in a slightly different part of the eastern sky.  This time my wife saw the &#34;J&#34; formation and again after a few seconds of appearing they went out.  This occurred a few more times in the next 25 minutes.  During this time a neighbor was getting her mail and I explained that my wife and I were seeing strange lights in the sky.  I asked her if she would stay out and try to witness them with us so we would have another witness.  The lights appeared and our neighbor saw them.  Her comment was that she thought that they were as bright as fireworks and she never saw anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 34 year old male that is management in an insurance company.

This time I saw only 3 lights but it moved very fast to already be that much farther north in the sky.  Two guys in a truck in front of me pulled over and as I passed them I saw that they were both looking out of the windshield, meaning, their faces were right up against the window. I know I saw something now, seeing those two guys witness it also.  I never believed in this but I have no choice now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/12/07 17:00|Columbia, Wrightsville|PA||15 min|On Dec. 12, 2007, at just before 5:00pm, I saw three bright lights over the Susquehanna River.|4/17/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62521.html|198|ndxe200712| On Dec. 12, 2007, at just before 5:00pm, I saw three bright lights over the Susquehanna River.  I was just south of Wrightsville at Long Level in York County, facing north.  At first I thought it was a low flying airplane.  The three lights became only two then became three again then went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over a period of about 15-18 minutes I watched as lights emanated from that spot, I’ll call point “A”, and two other spots, one to my west, I’ll call point “B”, and a third location just north of the first sighting, point &#34;C.&#34;  The three points looked to be on the same plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights did not waver in position.  The lights were bright white.  They came on in a series, in a straight line as if from a large flashlight being turned on.  In other words they did not fade in and out but came on suddenly and brightly.  The line of lights emanating from point A, as they came on, seemed to radiate toward the SW.  When they went out they just blinked out one at a time.  It was not a quick flash like warning lights on a tower, they did not strobe or flash but appeared in a slower “on”, “on”, “on” pattern, in a straight line.  When the last in that series was lit, the lights then went “off”, “off”, “off”, starting with the one that had first come on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occasionally I saw one or two lights at point B.  No two of the location series lighted at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights that appeared over the river (points A and possibly, C) increased in the number of lights each time a series would light up starting with the initial 3 lights then 4, then 6, then 8-10 and as many as 12 or more.  I couldn’t count fast enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The series of lights from point C began after several series from A and B had taken place.  The first series from point C included 6-8 lights in a sequence whereas point A started with 3, those emanating from C appeared to be roughly radiating towards NE.   The longest series I saw looked as if it could have had 12 or more lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw approximately 4-5 series at point A, 3-4 at point B and 3-4 at point C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was clear, few or no clouds, no sounds heard, no airplanes seen at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 12/13/07 I e-mailed our local weather station (WGAL TV) to see if anyone else had seen sightings like this.  Their answer was negative.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later I spoke with a person who saw on Dec. 12, the three low lights becoming two then three again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Saw 3 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12-12-07  I was driving to pick up my son from daycare and it was 5:15 pm. The first series of lights I saw were red-orange and appeared for approximately 5 seconds as a series of straight line lights all of the same shape, and then all disappeared at the same time.  I looked around to see what could have caused the lights, perhaps a reflection, someone turning on Christmas lights, etc… but could not see anything.  I drove further towards town and off to my right, right above Palmyra center of town I saw a series of white lights “come on” one at a time and as each light (looked the size of bright stars) came on, the first one was still visible but looked less bright.  This continued quickly until about 9-15 lights along an arc were lit up and again, as quickly as this happened it all disappeared at once.  I was shook up by this and could not figure out what it was.  I again quickly looked to see if there were lights in my car that could be causing the visual images – but again couldn’t find an answer.  Finally, as I arrived at my son’s day care as I was about to get out of the car I saw another arc of lights form above the horizon in plain sight.  The arc was shaped different – different angle, but behaved the same in terms of the lights “coming on” one at a time with the one just lit the brightest until the next came on.  When all were lit  - it disappeared at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived in the area with my family for the past 18 years and have never seen such lights.  I am an organizational consultant and have never seen nor reported anything that I would consider UFO material until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights all came on very bright red and then all faded out at the same time.  It seemed to me that all the traffic was at a halt looking at the same thing we were looking at. The length was easy the size of a football field or longer. Im sure this will not be the only report of this sighting. I know hundreds of people saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then a very large  cylinder shape thing started coming out of the pink hole.This thing or craft look to be extremely long. At that same time, this rusted bolt(is what it looked like )seperated in the middle and all sorts of windows became visible. The next instant, two things happened. All shapes and sizes of anti started appearing all over the bolt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that same time all shapes and sizes of smaller craft came from the bolt. It looked like a bee hive .

We asked where, and they said,” It is above the second palm tree” and I looked and saw it. It was perfectly still.  It was a clear day, and I could see that the sun was glinting off of the object, which was the cover of silver, and it was not twinkling, or anything, other than the light of the sun reflecting off of it.  The surface seemed to be more muted, like the difference between glossy prints and matted prints of photographs. It was reflecting the sun, but not in a glare like airplanes do for example. The other 2 guys, who called our attention to it, said it had been bigger, huge, they called it, about the size of the moon, and it had just moved away, distally, and went from being that size to the size of a star, where it paused. They pointed out the object to me which was located above a palm tree, over the ocean, at approx. 45 degree angle in the sky. We were about a block from the ocean, in the down town area of Isla Vista. I immediately spotted it in the sky, and it looked smooth and oval or circular and was perfectly still. I asked one of the other spotters, who had his camera out if he had managed to photograph it and he said no, and as I reached for my cell phone camera, it zoomed away very fast.  It was getting smaller and smaller until it was gone. It took it probably less than 2 seconds to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were at least 4 of us who saw it, perhaps more.  At the time, there was about 15 people there, however most were distracted by breakfast, and conversations.  I think that only about 4 or 5 of us actually saw it. From our advantage point, it looked to me to be over the sea, probably only about 3 miles out. I do not think I would have seen it if not for the fact that it was about a hand’s with above the palm tree, and the other spotters gave good directions on where to look for it.  When I saw it, I noted my feelings about it, and I felt calm, which was unusual as normally just the thought of them scares me a lot. As an aside, some have said they show up when there are military things going on, and the night before, approx. 15 hours earlier, on December 11, 2007 at 6:31 P. M. Vandenberg Air Force Base shot off a rocket carrying a spy satellite.  I do swear that this report is exactly what I experienced this morning, and is a factual account of what I saw and experienced.<n>

PD))|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60343.html|207|ndxe200712| Before dawn, I saw a  source of light moving steadily, high in the sky for 10 minutes, then stop for 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awakened at 6:15 a.m. to go to the toilet at my residence on a mountain near Roanoke, VA.  Out the bathroom window, I noticed what appeared to be a startling bright star, and then I realized it couldn&#39;t be a star, because it was moving east to west at a high rate of speed, such as might come from a military jet, or satellite or space station.  But this appeared to be more brilliant than reflected light and, besides, the sun was coming up in the east, a wrong direction or slant to have made a reflection that would be visible to me.  The brilliant spot of light continued to move east to west for about 10 minutes.  I hoped it would not pause or sharply change directions, but it did pause.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was stationary for at least five minutes.  My wife also so it; we watched it together.  I can say that it was stationary, unmoving, because at that point I saw it through the leafless upper branches of an oak tree, and with those twigs as a still screen between us and the now-stationary and still as bright as ever object, the tree wasn&#39;t moving (windless night) and the object remained at the same location when seen through those twigs.   If it were Venus moving through the sky, it would not have stopped and become stationery for five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if it later continued its trajectory, is still there, or simply vanished.  After watching it in it stationary position for five minutes, I returned to bed and to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If tomorrow morning brings a cloudless early pre-daybreak, I&#39;m sufficiently interested to set up my camera on a tripod and at the appropriate time, look for this interesting phenomenon, taking several &#34;bursts&#34; of digital photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??

I thought at first it could be the lights of an airplane, but this light was behaving like a one side light of a round object that was circling it self, because the light stays for ( 3 sec ) and fade to the other side.  The object changed its position twice and at the third time it stayed lighting for ( 6 sec ) and disappeared for good.  I saw only a light but could not see anything else because of the dark sky.

12/11/07 22:15|Bell Buckle|TN|Light||High-flying light that grew brighter, then dimmer, showing a blinking red light.|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60332.html|213|ndxe200712| High-flying light that grew brighter, then dimmer, showing a blinking red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 21:15 my wife and I were walking our dogs.  She looked up (looking for a meteor from the Geminids) and saw a light.  She pointed it out to me and, as we were watching this &#34;meteor&#34; move very slowly across the sky from North to Southeast, it suddenly glowed very brightly and then dimmed slowly.  As it continued to slowly dim, I could make out a blinking red light.  For this to have traveled that distance in that short of a time, high enough for us to not be able to identify it, leads me to believe that it was at an extremely high altitude.  The only blinking light that I could see was a red one, no green or white as an airplane would have.  Neither one of us could come up with any idea as to what this was since aircraft have the additional wing lights, meteors don&#39;t have blinking lights, and satellites generally are in stationary orbit or are in equatorial orbits.  I spent eight years in the Navy in communications and I&#39;ve never seen a satellite that had an orbit travelling in this manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stopped the car and continued to view the object which would move slowly and then stop and then move again in a different direction.  I began to take pictures with my camera phone, when it came directly above me.  I leaned out of the car and listened and heard what i thought might be a slight whirring noise.  As the object moved to directly above me, I noticed that there were 4 lights on the bottom, and very intense. They were in the shape of a square, as if they were on the 4 points of a square.  That was the array of the lighting, although the lights appeared to be circular or cone shaped and were very bright.  I observed for a while, and took a few pictures with my phone although you can only see lights in the pictures because the camera isn&#39;t very good and it was dark.  I figured it was some sort of surveillance drone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It quietly and playfully moved around the perimeter of the parking lot and store with intervals of hovering. All of this was at very low altitude although it did change that as well. At onr point, it was not that much higher than the store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked round shaped to me with the violet-blue light outlining the roundness with 4 smaller circles on the the bottom of it. When it moved around, it tilted some making it look more like a slender disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure how long this had been going on before I arrived but people were standing in the parking lot looking up in amazement. One guy was filming it. It was around nine at night when I saw it and, just before 10 minutes had gone by, it all of the sudden tilted and took a sharp abrupt dive behind the store which would be a field. A few of us, myself included, looked behind the store and it was just dark. There was never at anytime a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What at first appeared to be a large commercial aircraft flew towards me, apparently on approach to a nearby airport, but as it passed overheard I noted a lack of engine noise and that the &#34;front landing&#34; light was an usually large distance away from the wing lights. The aircraft made a very low rumbling noise apparent as it passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were red and green strobes and white lights on the wings of the trailing aircraft, and the forward aircraft had a single white light that turned red as it traveled away. The rear aircraft lights alternated, I can remember which were strobing as it approach and which were as it departed, but they altered their strobe pattern as they passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights formed a triangular shape in the sky with the base approximately one 6th of the height. As the lights traveled away, the front one drifted out of line with the rear, making it apparent that there were two aircraft in very close formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Alternatively I could postulate a large cylindrically object with some sort of light tracking around the front of the exterior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after the aircraft had passed there, a light propeller driven aircraft traveled behind and perpendicular to the aircraft, immediately followed by two others much further but also perpendicular traveling in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft in question traveled north to south while the probably unrelated three transited south of my location from west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS for the observer, I was standing in my back yard and the night before had wished loudly that I could see a ufo. Have noted other unusual effects of my silent thoughts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dogs barked after the lights had passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not saying these weren&#39;t conventional aircraft, however if they were they were flying very close to together, fairly low and very very quiet. If a car had driven past at the time of the noise I never would have heard it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were both headed northeast. The helicopter sounded military not civilian (We live in a city that has has regular flyovers from police and military helicopters and the sound of the two are quite distinct) The bright lit object was silent. No sounds other than the helicopter. The pair continued on making a slight turn to the east and flew thru some clouds. the bright lit object disappeared completley while the helicopter was still visible. we then lost sight of the pair due to trees and the growing distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects seemed to be about 500-750 ft up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No jets were in the sky during this event which i found unusual due to John Wany airport being so close and the fact that jets are a regular sight in the skies above my home.

He described the object as having three bright lights in a triangular formation, and the craft made no noise.  It made a slow turn above our house.  He then saw and heard two jet fighters screaming after the object, flying above the craft, as if trying to locate it.  My father is in the Air Force, and has seen almost every military aircraft.  The interesting thing is, the jet fighters were not from Otis AFB (a few miles away) because all F-15 fighters were grounded around the country due to mechanical failures (including Otis jets).  The jets had to have been from further inland and pursuing it for some time.  I am writing this report for my father because he is applying for top secret clearance and does not want to be denied it as a &#34;quack.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

12/10/07 23:00|Loch Ness, Inverness (UK/Scotland)||Disk|3 hours|Object moving through sky and atmosphere with changing lights, moving in several directions|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60363.html|221|ndxe200712| Object moving through sky and atmosphere with changing lights, moving in several directions<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were on our honeymoon near Loch Ness in Scotland.  On Monday 10th December 2007 we went for a short walk at about 10.30pm, and noticed the lovely clear skies, and how bright the stars were and decided to use the binoculars we’d borrowed to sit and watch them for a while.  (We live in a city, so can’t see the stars very well at home)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We’d just started passing them between us, when my husband exclaimed that one star was very bright and twinkling.  At the time I thought nothing of it, as it was a clear, cold, winter night, and stars can appear to shimmer in the atmosphere.  We were looking over the loch as the ‘Little Bear’ constellation was becoming visible and rising over the hills.  There was no moon.  Weather was cold, clear and bright, no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On looking through the binoculars, he could see a white glowing body of the object, with flashing red, green and blue/purple lights around the edge.  Of course, we both thought at first that it was a helicopter, civilian or military plane (especially as we were in a remote location, we thought it could be the RAF testing a new/unknown craft) or even a satellite, caught up in the atmosphere, as it seemed a long way away (the colours were only visible as twinkles with the naked eye, but clearly with the binoculars)  We sat passing the binoculars between us for some time, watching in puzzlement as the object moved quickly around the sky, but always in the same patch of sky (south west of the ‘little bear’  constellation)  Several times (at least 3) the bright object seemed to disappear into the distance, as it became so faint, it was only possible to see it if not looking directly at it (as with a faint star) the first time this happened we thought it was travelling away from us, and that was that.  But it came back into focus, clearer this time, and appeared larger (though still a white glow) there were absolutely no clouds in the sky at the time; all other objects in the sky were clear at all times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This first phase happened over about an hour.  Then, as the stars gradually moved around the sky, the object appeared to stop moving of its own accord, and drift in the same direction, at this point we were wondering if it had been a satellite we were watching.  But then, the object starting moving rapidly against the direction of the stars, and could be seen to be streaming white almost like a vapour trail and seemed arrow shaped (possibly due to travelling through earth&#39;s atmosphere), previous to this it had appeared oval/disc shaped it continued doing this for some time--it was reminiscent of when a kite is being flown and the flyer yanks the string to pull it in or out of the wind flow--it looked as though it was jetting out of Earth’s atmosphere to the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually it stopped jetting in the opposite direction of the stars, as if it had got through the atmosphere and through the other side into outer space.  It appeared to be moving further into the distance, and now only glowed with a pulsing light, that changed from faint violet to greenish yellow in a clockwise motion, almost as though a beam of light was emanating from the object and changing colour as it did so.  The object then did not continue following the direction of the stars but remained in one position.  We continued watching for some time, and it remained, glowing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We first spotted the object at about 11.00 pm and finished watching at about 2am, as were very cold by that point.<n>

They saw 2 red lights descending towards the mountains. This seemed strange to them and as thay observed more closely they described realizing that it was a single very large (aporox 1/4mile perhaps longer in length) elogated object due to the fact that as it moved it blacked out the stars between the two red lights. These lights ocasionally faded or brightened with changes in motion of the entire craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They pulled over and got out of the car .. the object continued to move across the mountains occasionally descending behind and back up.  A loud noise was associated with the movement of the craft. One brother described the sound like a shotgun blast that lasted the whole time. The other brother described it as like the sound of an earthquake rumble/shock sound but louder. No vibrations or shockwaves were felt by either brothers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point the object stopped over the mountain top about 2 miles from their position and lit the mountainside with a very intese yellow light this lasted at least 15 seconds the light allowed them to see the mountainside in exceptional detail, sagebrush, trees, rocks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time another freind of theirs returning home to the same area pulled over beside them and observed the following.  The craft moved away acompanied by louder noise and up into the sky disapearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft never seemed to turn in relation to their position so that only the one aspect of the object was ever presented to their veiwing position. No protrusions were observed. The shape of any other sides were not evident. They have lived in the area for years and are used to military aircraft in the area, helicpoters, jets and munition explosions. This was FAR different from anything they had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning they observed two military jets lingering and flying around the area of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had overheard my three co-workers talking amongst themselves and began to ask about their sighting. At no time during our conversation did I feel the story to be made up or exagerated. They appeared genuinly astonished and awed by what they witnessed with no attempt to impress or gain noteriety. They are in their early twenties in age had not been drinking as they were just returning home from the end of their shift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have related this to your website as I have never heard a more detailed or unusual eyewitness account that I felt to be credible and honestly given. I certianly cannot account for the information provided with any manmade object. I hope I have related the information of the converstaions I had with them accurately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I called my niece and had her on the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up it looked like a bright yellow tinted haze at first. We continued to watch because the haze began to change a little, it expanded and got brighter. As we were watching we saw something fly quickly up beside it on the right. The object went up and over the top of the haze and disappeared. Then another appeared on the right side it was flying slow at first and then it shot off across the sky, we never took our eyes off of it. It went across our horizon and then it stopped and went back in the other direction. As it approached the haze another bright object flew up and disappeared below the haze, then the 2nd object just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next the bottom left corner of the haze looked as if it was funneling, just the corner of it. It was like nothing I’ve ever seen. We were in awe and yelling at each other “do you see that”. Then through the center if the funnel shot out a bright round object. It flew directly out then around to the right side, flew up and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The skies were clear and beautiful, not a cloud in site.  I’m not sure exactly what that haze was but there is no denying the 4 objects we saw.  To me, they didn’t appear to be in our atmosphere but above it although I’m not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole experience lasted about 25 minutes.  The haze didn’t completely fade for another 10 minutes then it was completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses were myself 32, my husband 31, my sister 28, her husband 30, my 2 daughters 7 &amp; 11, and my niece 16 who lives 3 miles away.<n>

Approximate magnitude 1 to 2 at initial sighting, approximate size ¾ degree across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through binoculars (10x50) &amp; telescope (6” F5 reflector) was shaped very much like a water fountain spraying straight up (or a mushroom cloud, pointed at the base). Through the telescope I noticed a point-source of light traveling with the cloud, near the tip, or base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This point-source varied up and down in magnitude slowly, averaging around 5th magnitude, but every so often (between 10 and 60 seconds or so) it would flare to perhaps –2 magnitude, instantaneously, as if sunlight were reflecting from a flat surface, as is observed with tumbling satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Movement was in a straight line. At initial sighting this was approximately 3/4 degree per minute. Object speed slowed as it progressed across the sky, indicating to me that it was traveling in a straight line, as opposed to orbiting Earth. The brightness of the cloud diminished as well, though more rapidly than the point-source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of the observation the cloud was no longer visible, only the point-source, which by this time had faded to average magnitude of 10 to 11, still flaring to magnitude 4 or so. Movement had slowed to about 120 arc seconds per 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To summarize, object was first sighted in Cassiopeia, approx Alt. 65 degrees, Az. 5 degrees (R.A. 0h10m x Dec. 55 deg.). After approximately one hour, final sighting was in Lynx at approx Alt. 40 degrees, Az. 60 (R.A. 6h40m x Dec. 55 deg.) Object traversed approx 55 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have sketched the view through the telescope, indicating the location of the point-source of light, the direction of travel, and the direction of North. I will e-mail the sketch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also I took several photos with a 35mm SLR, ranging from 30 to 60 seconds each on ISO 200 film. When I get it developed I will send those pictures. The film had been in the camera for a long time, hopefully the pictures will come out okay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD))<n>

The cloud had the appearance of being slightly leading the star point in the front facing west, but the cloud mostly trailed to the east as if the object were traveling due west.  As I am very familiar with my position on the ground, I am positive this is the direction aspect in which the object was traveling although it did not look as though it were moving as it must have been at such a height, so as movement was undetectible without careful constant observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also familiar with NASA launches and this did not originate nor was it anywhere near the direction of Cape Canaveral.

After it had taraveled some distance away I saw a second smaller light descend from the larger one. It disappeared below the tree line. The larger object then pulsated several times and disappeared.

I originally thought it was that comet that was visible a few weeks ago and passed it off as that, but my brother then told me over the phone that there was a light intermittently flashing with no apparent frequency or pattern.  After 10-15 minutes of watching I concluded that it was definitely not an airplane or satellite.  The object didn&#39;t appear to be moving in a straight direction and looked to me as if it was actually moving away from Earth.  I did see the flashing light (white) and the &#39;tail&#39; was shaped similar to a comma.  As you can tell by my lack of reference points in regards to constellations or stars, I&#39;m not an astronomer, however I am certain the object had to be some sort of rocket or a freak natural phenomena (but that doesn&#39;t explain the flashing light).

12/10/07 18:45|Smyrna|GA|Other|20 minutes, approx.|The fuzzy, comet-like object seen on December 10, 2007 across the East Coast was apparently a rocket stage from a classified satellite.|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60299.html|247|ndxe200712| ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fuzzy, comet-like object seen on December 10, 2007 across the East Coast was apparently a rocket stage from a classified satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Smyrna, Georgia, about 12 miles northwest of downtown Atlanta and approximately one mile from the southern end of Dobbins Air Reserve Base. At approximately 6:45 p.m. last night (December 10, 2007), I took my dog for his evening walk and looked up at the sky. I noticed slightly to the south of the zenith a fuzzy patch of light in the sky. It was maybe a quarter of the size of my pinky fingernail at arm&#39;s length. I watched it for a few moments, thinking it was a bright star blurred by a cloud, but the night was perfectly clear. I discerned a comet-like shape--a brighter triangular point with a fanned out, fuzzy &#34;tail.&#34;  As an amateur skygazer, I was amazed that I&#39;d not read about anything like this being visible and certainly had not seen anything like it on previous nights. I called my father at his house east of Atlanta at  6:48 p.m., but there was no answer. I went into the house to get my binoculars and came back outside to get a better view. Through the binoculars, the object definitely looked like a comet, and I could see that it was clearly moving against the background stars. I then called my sister&#39;s house in Loganville, Georgia (approximately 30 miles east of Atlanta), at 6:52 p.m. and my father answered the phone. I told him to go outside and look up and when he did, he said, &#34;Well I&#39;ll be damned! What&#39;s that?&#34; &#34;I think it&#39;s a comet,&#34; I told him. &#34;But it&#39;s moving too fast for a comet and it&#39;s not supposed to be there!&#34;  I chatted with my father and continued to observe the comet moving slowly northward close to the zenith. It seemed to get very slightly brighter. At about 7 p.m., through the binoculars I noticed a pinpoint flash of white light just to the right (north side) of the object (the flash was in the same spot as the one noted on the illustration on your website concerning this siting). I told my father, &#34;Wait, there&#39;s a flashing light...that&#39;s not a comet. I&#39;ll call you back.&#34;  I observed the flash several more times but was unable to determine if it was happening at regular intervals or not. It seemed to flash about once every 30 to 45 seconds at first. The patch of light continued to head north toward Cassiopeia, and its brightness was fading quickly. The last time I saw the flash of light next to the fuzzy light, I counted up to 120 seconds and did not see the flash again. It dimmed and I lost sight of it at roughly 7:05 to 7:10 p.m. before it reached the &#34;W&#34; of Cassiopeia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and called the Smyrna Police Department and described what I saw and asked if anyone else had reported it. No one had. I then called the local Fox affiliate, Fox 5, and asked their news desk if they had received reports of the light in the sky. The man on the phone said that they had calls reporting it from Clayton County (south of Atlanta) all the way up to Cleveland, Georgia (roughly 40 or 50 miles northeast of Atlanta). He had no explanation as to what it might be. I called Fox 5 back at 11 p.m. to see if they had learned anything, and there was no new information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning at work, I&#39;ve googled &#34;mysterious light georgia&#34; and numerous other applicable terms, but nothing came up on google or Fox 5 or the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (the city newspaper). I just spoke with a public affairs sergeant at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, and she had heard nothing of the unusual light in the sky. When I typed in &#34;ufo december 10 2007&#34; and the first link that came up was this website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At various times, I have seen satellites, the space shuttle, and the international space station moving across the sky in the evenings. They are always distinct, fast-moving points of light that generally dim and &#34;blink out&#34; once they enter the earth&#39;s shadow. The object last moved much slower than any aircraft (save a helicopter) or satellite. When I saw the flashing light and realized it was not a comet, I thought maybe it was a high-altitude balloon of some sort that had vented gas or propellant, but since this appears to be the same object seen by many people over several states, I have doubts that a weather or test balloon could have been high enough in or above the atmosphere to be viewed from such a wide area. I have no idea what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The times listed above are very close approximations from the call records in my cell phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that I have typed all this, I just heard back from an astronomer at the Fernbank Science Center&#39;s observatory here in Atlanta.

It was very high, looked almost like a comet it had a wide tail, it also had a white speck at what would seem the front. Although you think it would head in the direction the tail shows, it moved against itself. I also got my girlfriend (20) my friend (23) and his dad (55) to come look at it. I continued by myself to further view it with my binoculars thats when i realized it was traveling strange. It moved in directions it shouldn&#39;t have, I&#39;ve seen some things in the sky but this was by far the strangest, man-made or not. Hope its posted here what it was, if we ever figure out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD))<n>

It appeared to be a comet; I quickly slewed my telescope to the object, and viewed it at a magnification of 100X. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed, but much slower than a normal satellite when viewed through a telescope eyepiece field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object contained what appeared to be a head and a tail (very much like Haley’s comet looked years ago through a pair of binoculars), and its magnitude was so bright that it was dominant in the sky.  There was also a point of light that moved with the object at the same speed, approximately one tenth of a degree from the “head” of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tracked the object for approximately 45 minutes, the “tail” faded (almost appeared to dissipate over time), but the point of light near the haze remained in the eyepiece, it’s magnitude and position not changing over the period of time that it was tracked. The object passed very close to the star Schedar in the constellation Cassiopeia.  I stopped tracking the object as it passed through the constellation Cassiopeia at approximately 1935 hrs. The object continued to move in a NE direction at approximately 60 degrees above the northern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Telescope I was using to track the “object” was a Telescope Engineering Company (TEC) 200mm (8 inch) f/9 refractor, mounted on a Astro-Physics 1200gto computerized equatorial mount. The object was tracked by moving the Declination and Right ascension axis in a manual mode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD))<n>

It was brighter near the center then the outer edge.  The object appeared to be approximately 5-10 miles away. It didn&#39;t appear to be moving. I observed the light for only a few seconds then looked down to put my car in park and when I looked back up it was gone. I have never seen anything like this object before.

The time was between 18:10 and 18:40 .I was conscious of the time because I had to take my son to school for a function at 18:40. I looked up in the sky and saw what I first took to be a comet, but I did not think there were any comets around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then decided that it was just a star and distortion from my glasses lenses was causing me to see a tail. Normally if an object is distorted by my lenses I can look dead on at an object and the distortion will clear. In this case however, no matter what direction I looked at the object, the tail remained. I was in a hurry and just decided that because this thing definitely had a tail I guess that I had missed the fact on the news that there was comet visible in the night sky. I then justified this decision by thinking that I remembered hearing on the radio about a comet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked to me very similar Hale Bopp. I did not study it for more than a few minutes, knew it was out of place, then justified why and went about my business. It had enough impact on me to look for it again, when I went to unplug my Christmas lights, but I could not locate it. I didn’t think much of it until I heard Peter Davenport on Coast To Coast. Sorry I didn’t study the object closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD))<n>

In awe i watched as it seemed to dive an dip in excess of thousands of feet at a time. As a truck driver i have witnessed all sorts of man made aircraft and in all my years of being on the road this was the first time i ever witnessed such flux in movement side to side front to back. I traveled with this object for 30 minutes or so. and meanwhile other truck drivers on the CB were also making comments about it. it finaly shot off to the north at a HUGE rate of speed and was gone.

I had gotten off work at 17:00 and was headed to a family gym close to my home in Fair Oaks, CA. It was getting dark quickly and I could barely see the sun disappearing on the horizon in the west. I was traveling west on Fair Oaks Blvd which is the main street where my gym is located. I could see in the distance that there were unusual bright lights in the sky just a little to the left of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared to be anywhere between 1500-2000 feet in the sky. The most notable features were that the lights were really bright and the object was motionless. Now I was thinking to myself, this could be helicopter hovering with its search light, but then I realized there was no cone affect or motion of a search light. I’ve seen those enough to not be fooled. This wasn’t a star because this really bright light was too close for observation, but too far to actually see a true form of the object. It wasn’t the moon because the moon is usually in the east and the really bright lights were too small to mistake for the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached my gym I thought to myself to park as soon as possible and jump out and get a look at this sighting and to see if anyone else had seen it. At about 200 yards from the parking lot I took my last look at these really bright lights. The lights in the sky are still motionless and still not sure of the form of the object. I pulled into the parking lot and parked. I jumped out of my vehicle and looked up in the sky to see nothing. I looked west, south, east, and north. These lights were high enough that if they had moved in anyone direction I would be able to see for at least a half mile in any direction, but there was nothing, like there was never anything ever there at all. What could move that fast in 15-20 seconds? I’m very puzzled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t check any news reports or police reports because I’m still not sure. It’s bizarre because I’ve seen planes and helicopters move in the night sky. I can guarantee that if indeed it was a plane or helicopter I would have easily had a chance to see it move from the area as I got out of my vehicle.<n>

Popham beach fort was directly in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn’t really looking at the sky when all of a sudden my friend yelled &#34;look at those shooting stars!&#34;  I looked up and saw two lights traveling east so they were moving towards our left because we were looking south.  They were at about a 20 degree angle.  And at least a couple miles away but close enough so that I saw a jet trail on the top one.  I only saw them for about three seconds but I remember every detail about them.  They were moving at the same speed.  One was above the other about a quarter inch apart.  The one on top had a white light like most planes do and I remember noticing it had a trail just like a jet has.  The bottom one however was many times bigger, had no trail and was glowing bright orange.  It looked like a perfect circle and about the size of a BB while the one on top looked like a star.  They were moving almost horizontal, but most shooting stars come down at an angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost as soon as I saw them the bottom one steadily grew from dim orange to burning, bright, orange without changing shape at all.  Right as it passed over and behind a peninsula to our left it became so bright and right when it was out of view it lit up the sky around the area it was in and we saw what seemed like a bright flash or explosion above the trees, but not a quick flash just a steady flash.  As soon as it was gone we said, &#34;((deleted)), what was that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We debated for a while about what it was and we concluded that they could not have been both shooting stars because the one on top had a trail and the bottom one didn’t.  My friend had seen them traveling west to east for maybe ten seconds and said he didn’t pay much attention at first because he thought they were planes.  He said they were flying horizontally and as fast as planes far away, not as fast as shooting stars   It was like nothing we had ever seen before and it was so big for the distance it was at if it was a meteor it would have caused a tsunami or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a few ufo encounter reports about glowing amber orbs and saw drawings of what they described and it looked like the same exact thing but must have been larger because of how far away it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m dead serious about this I wouldn’t have spent the time reporting it if I wasn’t, believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Much to bright and fast to be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the car park at work. A silver light with a green hale appeared in the east, as if from nowhere. It stayed still for 5 or 6 secends. It then raced across the sky and out of sight in 2 secends. The light was small but very bright, out shining the stars. I have never seen enything so fast before.<n>

It was approximately about a mile away from where I was.  I saw white-yellow lights illuminating it (it was very bright).  The incident occurred in Hillcrest (Queens), New York.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom looked out her bedroom window and saw the object moving very fast and made a sharp turn and disappeared. This object moved quicker than usual planes do and was much brighter.  A few moments later we noticed an unusual number of planes in the area.  My mom also said that she saw what she thought at first was a star (because it was not moving) but then it began to move very quickly (more quickly then the planes we saw before). She is not sure if this was the same UFO or a different one.  Planes continued to move in that area for some time which is very unusual because we normally do not have much plane activity at that time (or with that many planes in a short period of time). I remember my mom saying how dangerous it must be for the planes since there were so many of them that the possibility of them colliding was high. (Although she never saw them together- just one right after another moving past our house)<n>

They were pulling into K&#39;s driveway and all of a sudden all of the streetlights on the block went out as well as the headlights and internal lights on C&#39;s car. The light flashed in the shape of a kerosene lamp flame. The light was below the clouds and fully visible to anyone in the vicinity. The light made a wide oval and at the vertex there was a perfectly horizontal stream of green light that faded to turquoise. A breeze passed through the car yet the heater was on full. A cut on C&#39;s hip was healed as well as the pain on the left side of her body. Or so it seemed. The pain was in actuality transferred to K&#39;s body. The pains were in exactly the same spots and same intensities as they were on C yet they were happening to K. K and C proceeded to pull into the driveway and then walk into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Dull, steady, faint light, close in magnitude to Polaris. At about 60 degs from southeast horizon, the light stopped, paused, circled and then started heading due west at an accelerated speed. Light eventually disappeared behind a building. Sky was clear, no clouds. Was just a single steady light. 2 other witnesses next to me saw it after I pointed it out to them when the light paused. They saw it circle and then head off at an accelerated speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were heading south on SE 174th just north of Powell when we saw flashes in the sky.  We pulled over to see if we could see what it was and, from our vantage point looking just west of south,  it appeared that there was a helicopter hovering over Powell at about 170th and that it was firing off a strobe of some sort.   The color of the flashes looked more like fire (yellow) than like illumination and I had the impression at first that they were circular as you would see looking at a  &#39;flashbulb&#39;.    We watched for three or four minutes trying to hear any sound of helicopter blades.   There was not any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the object still appeared to be helicopter sized but there not clear running lights and the flashing didn&#39;t recur right away.   At this point,  the object appeared to be drifting in a north-northwest direction and passed overhead and just to the west of us.   Still no sound.   Occasionally there was a flash of bright light again or two but not strobelike.   I called my brother who lives almost due west of us at about 90th and asked him to go out and look as the object was getting farther away still appearing to be slowly drifting on an air current---straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother called back and was looking with his binoculars but couldn&#39;t find anything.  The object was, at that point too far to identify in the lighthaze west of me.   I looked at my clock at that point and it was 10:27 so we&#39;d been watching for probably fifteen minutes.   A small plane on a somewhat parallel course in the opposite direction had come out of the northwest heading to the southeast about five minutes earlier and its engines were clearly identifiable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only scenario I could envision for this event was that a hot air balloon was drifting and was having fire problems with its propane system, but the shape of the object and the inconsistency of the flashes didn&#39;t fit and the fact that it was a December night also made it unlikely.<n>
12/8/07 21:12|Salem|OR|Light|7 seconds|Two Parallel Lights Moving At Very High Speed Along An Unusual Path|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60253.html|274|ndxe200712| Two Parallel Lights Moving At Very High Speed Along An Unusual Path<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear, cold evening in Salem, OR.  The temperature was about 36 degrees, perhaps two degrees above the dew point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were in our spa.  It is situated where two legs of our house (an “L” shape) join such that we have a clear view towards the north and east.  Some trees block a horizon view to the east, and the house blocks the view to the southwest.  There is considerable ambient light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2112 (PST) I noticed two lights moving from the northeast to the southwest.  They were moving parallel to each other, being apart about the same distance as two of the stars in the Big Dipper handle, and half as bright as Mars.  [I think it was Mars I was seeing in the northeast sky.]  I said to my wife, “Look at that!”  They passed right over the top of us, just after which my wife located them.  When they disappeared two seconds later, she said, “What was that?”  They moved fast and in straight lines.  About seven seconds elapsed between the times I first saw them above the trees until they disappeared behind my roof.  All I could see were lights, and the lights never varied until they were almost gone.  No noise was heard, although the damned low-speed spa pump was on at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too late to see satellites.  Had they been aircraft they would most certainly have been heard (a sonic boom, no doubt).  Since the light was either generated by the objects or reflected, in my mind the only “reasonable” explanation is they were birds.  However…  These two “birds” had to be low (considering their speed) and expert fliers (to perfectly maintain their wide spacing).  They must have had bright underbodies to reflect the light.  City light varies, hence reflection varies, but their brightness didn’t vary.  I sense they weren’t that low, hence the perception of significant speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object had a VERY long reddish-orange glowing contrail(re-entry trail?) that from ground level I would estimate was in the neighborhood of two(2) kilometers maximum length.  Object lost glowing trail after a short time but luminosity did not wane.  At first object was thought to be a meteor re-entry but upon continued observation a &#39;very&#39; faint blinking light could be seen (navigation light?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object continued course track for a short time and then quickly changed direction to a NW flight track.  Object emitted what I can only describe as a &#39;pearl colored, luminous, nebulous, atmospheric phenomenon&#39; of a rough diamond shape with a small glowing white center(It reminded me of a mach shockwave that can be seen when supersonic jets approach the sound barrier).  Object then abruptly accelerated at a VERY high rate of speed on NW flight track over the Pacific Ocean.  I can only speculate the rate of acceleration, but would estimate in neighborhood of mach20+.  Atmospheric phenomenon was observed to linger and hold its shape for approximately 20 seconds before slowly dissipating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event occurred in the following area:  34°30&#39;15.38&#34;N 119°29&#39;52.86&#34;W x 34°17&#39;38.56&#34;N 119°59&#39;41.32&#34;W<n>

It was already dark by this time, so I looked up into the sky, to view the stars. The night sky was clear, with no clouds, fog, or haze. Moments after looking up and admiring the stars, I noticed what I at first thought was a flight of geese, or birds of some sort that fly in a &#34;V&#34; formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object or formation was very faint against the dark sky, and thinking it was a flock of birds, I continued to watch and listen for their honking sound. Instead, I heard no sound at all. The object was moving from northeast, to southeast and I immediately noted that it was moving at a very high rate of speed, too fast for birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object passed directly overhead, its outline became more apparent, but was still very faint, and almost blended with the sky. As it passed between my position, and a group of stars, I was able to see that it was in fact a solid or at least, a contiguous object (not a flock of birds). It resembled the shape of a stealth bomber, or something like it. There were no visible lights on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another curious fact about this occurrence was that the object made no sound whatsoever. If it was a stealth bomber, I would have expected to hear jet engine noise, or some faint sound, but I heard nothing. The object appeared to be flying at an altitude of perhaps 5,000 feet above ground level, estimated by its relative size in the sky, and the rate at which it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time I first observed the object, it was at about a 60 degree angle overhead. It passed directly over my house, and I was able to see the faint outline for approximately 5-6 seconds, and then it completely faded as it moved southwest.<n>

The photo was intended to be a shot of the surf and cliff of Isla Caja de Muertos (aka Coffin Island). The island is located about five miles southeast of Ponce, Puerto Rico. The lat/long of the island is: 17º 53.48 North, 066º 31.13 West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the photos were downloaded from the camera to the computer, an unidentified flying object was found in the upper right portion of this picture, adjacent to the left side of the tall hill, Cerro Morillo, which is 170 feet tall, according to NOAA nautical chart #25685. I have included a link to an online version of this chart:  http://www.oceangrafix.com/o.g/Charts/PR_VI/NOAA-Nautical-Chart-Punta-Petrona-to-lsla-Caja-de-Muertos.html 	The UFO appears to be at about a 40-45 degree angle when compared to the horizon. It&#39;s also a different color from the rocks and if you zoom in on it, it appears to be reflecting sunlight along the &#34;top&#34; edge. It is impossible for me to gauge the object&#39;s size, but Cerro Morillo is roughly 400 feet away from the camera. It appears that the obect may be beyond the hill and since no one saw it &#34;in person&#34; we don&#39;t know if it is ascending or descending. Another option is that the UFO is not descending or ascending but rather, banking in flight. As it appears in the picture the UFO seems to be at an angle. If you use the nautical chart as a reference and if you align a ruler from the flat &#34;bottom&#34; of the UFO to the water in the picture, the angle suggests it may be oriented toward the deeper water offshore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any rate, this object was not consciously observed by anyone present that day. Incidentally, it is only 32 miles, as the crow flies, from Coffin Island to Lares, Puerto Rico, a UFO sighting hotspot and location of a proposed UFO runway to be built by the locals!<n>

UFOs! Holy Shit! then a flood of panic came over me and i began to worry, realizing that this wasn&#39;t something most people should see, nor believe in. but here i was, seeing it! i walked quickly back inside, unsure what to believe anymore. so i write to you.<n>

K and C proceeded to drive over to his house to witness the light for themselves. However, as they neared the trailer park where he lives they noticed a strange contrast in the night sky and its coloration. On the left side of the street the sky was purest black. On the right side the sky was orange with a white strip across the bottom and darker as we looked higher up. As we drove through the trailer park the sky on our right proceeded to grow more orange. The previous orange shade intensified. Driving down the streets of the trailer park any where the vehicle went the streetlights around it dimmed and continued to do so until we drove away. As we drove out of the trailer park the sky seemed to darken and the orange light gathered behind C&#39;s car. Driving down the main street back to K&#39;s house we were stopped by a train. A light that was previously white was now yellow and while K and C were waiting for the train to pass other colors started to appear mixed in with the yellow. C rolled her window down to see if it might have been the fog that was starting to roll in. It wasn&#39;t. She asked a car on the other side of her and the occupants of the vehicle said they did not see any light. K and C both saw the light. The train passed and we drove on. The fog had gathered to become slightly obscurant and thus we missed her street the first time around. We drove a few more feet to the roundabout and turned around. We turned onto the correct street and stopped for approximately 3 seconds to roll the window up. There was a shadow behind the car yet when K and C looked there was no one, and nothing. There was likewise nothing there as we pulled away. We continued along the street until pulling into the driveway and walking into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These objects, only seconds apart, lost altitude and elevation from 30degrees elevation, to 20degrees elevation, before rising again to about 30degrees and made for a steady course and altitude in a southern direction, and accelerated away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE.....Two other witnesses were present, and both describe the same event (report forms are being expedited, and information to be added here)  The woman then picked up a cheap pair of binoculars from no more than 1.5 mtrs from here window and focused on the objects, for a better view......<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the two objects moved south, it was noticed that two stationary objects were hovering, one above the other, at a reasonable altitude towards the southern end of the first 2 objects trajectory    Approximately 30 minutes later, two objects moving north were seen on the same flight path as earlier, but reversed.  When the objects returned to their point of origin in the sky, it is said they accelerated and gained altitude until they disappeared from view.  These objects are described as being of a triangular configuration, with a white/blue - green prism type colour effect, at each point, and a thin white line of light between each point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear of clouds, apart from some weather moving in from the horizons to the east and north, and the moon was not visible.  The sighting occurred in an area of sky not usually known for air traffic, by the witness, her family and some of the local residents, 2 of which have lived in the area for over 20 yrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness describes her state of mind as frightened, and then curious and moving more to a state of acceptance.  She has always been a believer that we are not alone in the universe, but has never before had a sighting of her own.  The witness is a full time carer, of her elderly mother, and a professional therapist.  As an avid artist she also has a good eye for detail, and her memory seems not to fail her in conversation.  The Witness also has a good knowledge and deep interest in the area of astronomy..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday the 8th/December2007, approx - 20.55hrs  In approximately the same position as the previous nights sighting started, a stationary object became visible, described as being three straight lines of light, hovering in a partly cloudy sky.  It is said that the lights seemed to give the impression that they were only part of a lager object, of an ovoid nature.  The same three witnesses then moved to the outside of the house, on the eastern side, for a better view   This object was visible for ten minutes, until clouds moved in and obstructed vision.  At this time it was noticed that there were approximately 12 other objects, slightly bigger than stars and bearing the same colours of the previous nights objects, peppered across the sky.  The colour of these objects was noted as not being normal for stars, even with the light pollution from the city.  There were some small fires burning around the state, high altitude smoke haze could have caused some alteration in the appearance (colour / aura etc.) of some brighter stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the usual contacts (air traffic control, police, councils etc) drew blank on alternate explanations.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We watched for a minute and saw the object on the right was actually two as if it seperated to make a total of 8 objects. After it separated it elevated without changing direction. After a couple of minutes they faded away. It was nearing sundown. While they were in the sky most of them stayed idle in the sky or moved slightly except for the one on the right that moved up quite a bit. There was no bright colors or anything coming from them. No explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were in the backseat of his car when I noticed a strange light come from outside.  I sat up and opened the door against my boyfriends wishes, he wanted to continue or little rendevous.  So I looked out and a bright light flashed in the sky again.  At first I thought it was an airplane, but it was such an odd shape and color.  It was diamond shaped with a pointed front in back, or so it looked and it emitted a silvery glow. It last for about 30 seconds and disappeared.<n>

The multi-colors popped out like they were piercing through a door crack at night, as though one edge was the object and one edge was space.  Sometimes slow and then piercingly fast multi-colored lights. Electric bright: lite and dark pink, lite and dark blue, lime green, dark red.  Two times; an exact white beam of light would appear straight down into the clouds, and around that beam was a weird whitish-blue glow like a flash light into the clouds. The light would slowly move from left to right, as though observing an area in the clouds and then the flash-light slowly faded off, but the bright white star and multi-colors remained constant. The clouds moved in after 30 minutes and blocked any further sight of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I observed in the far distance a dot, and noticed it was the only &#34;star&#34; in the black sky.  As I watched, it came toward me and seemed to grow larger.  Suddenly, an incredible long rectangular craft hung directly over my head.  The only color I could make out was a blaze of white lights entirely covering the front of the craft.  There were small red and blue/green lights on either end.  The craft made absolutely no sound, and was close enough that I could&#39;ve counted every light.  I felt no fear, but stood transfixed as I waited to see what was next.  As quickly as it appeared, it had vanished into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was awesome, and I can&#39;t get the image out of my head.  In retrospect, I find it a little disturbing, and wish to know more about other similar experiences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was in my second to last week of the fall semester when the sighting took place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of December 6, 2007 at almost 8:00PM on the dot I saw four circular craft flying in formation doing aerial maneuvers.  I was walking back to my apartment from campus to pick up supplies for a computer animation I was working on for finals.  Just as I got through the back parking lot I looked up at the roof and balcony of an apartment building that flanks us on the right side (I&#39;ve been watching the icicles grow on their side from all the snowfall).  When I did, I saw four low flying craft that were a dull silver and without lights flying well below the heavy cloud cover.  They were flying low enough that the lights from town were shining on the bottom but I was standing in such a way that there were no lights to cause glare so I could see them very clearly.  I could also see an under-carriage type object that was also circular and about half the diameter of the craft.  They were flying from the direction of the Edinboro Lake, which is about a mile away from where I made the sighting and heading for the river located behind my apartment building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were in a sort of triangular formation so at first I thought I was seeing the engines of a really low flying jet plane but it was dead silent and I couldn&#39;t see the wings attached to these &#39;engines&#39;.  Just as I was thinking this, the one on the far back right of the triangle formation did a swap with the one on the back left before they formed a more diamond shaped formation and I lost them behind the trees on the backside of the parking lot (I’m sending an email with a diagram and illustration of what they did and what I saw).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not sure if this is prudent or not, but the night before this sighting, the town power grid where the sighting happened lost electricity.  Even the campus I attend lost power for a few seconds before the generators kicked on, however the traffic lights and street lamps were out for about an hour or so afterwards.<n>

It was lit up all around in green flashing lights and one huge yellow light in the middle of it.  It took of extremely fast followed by another aircraft that looked exactly like it following this unidentifed flying object.  It was extrmely insane because they were both so huge and neither of them made a noise.  They were traveling extremely fast and went pretty far but the lights were so bright we could still see them.  They then shot into the air and the yellow light that wa sin the middle of it got tinier and tinier until it dissapered.<n>

We were out there for about an hour when we first got out in the deer stand there was a orange light in the distance almost like some one was walking through the woods with a flash light.  Everything was still there was no wind and then out of no where a light lit up the deer stand we were in and we could see everything like some one was standing behind us with a giant spot light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after about 10 seconds of looking around it stared flashing like a strobe and we looked up and saw a blue figure in the sky it had no definite shape it was just there and then out of no where it was gone but it didn&#39;t leave a streak or anything behind it.It was just gone.It was the clearest light I have ever seen in my life it lit up the whole sky and it didn&#39;t hurt my eyes.  I was motionless and I couldn&#39;t look away I waited for him to say something and finally he did.I was nautious  but at ease all at the same time I was terrified but I couldn&#39;t move I couldn&#39;t look away and I couldn&#39;t move fast.  I was just there and it was there and my friend and it was like there was nothing else  around we were just singled out by everything.  I am not saying it was a ufo and I am not saying that it wasn&#39;t.  I am saying that is an experience that I will never forget and I question now if there is something out there that we don&#39;t know about something smarter than us and leaves me feeling very unsettled and I hope to never see anything like that the rest of my life!<n>

I had just passed the Business 127 exit and noticed a formation of planes ahead that seemed to come out of no where. As I got closer to it, I slowed down and rolled my window down. The formation was also heading north just parallel to the Interstate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation of planes appeared to be flying very slow. Still heading north on US-127 and just past Broomfield Road, I went directly under it. It was not a formation of planes. It was a very large black triangle. I actually saw the shape and texture of it. It was about the size of a football field or bigger. It was approximately 400-600 feet off the ground. It made no sound that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had faint white lights on each corner as well as brighter red lights on each corner. The red light at the front of it was flashing as if a Strobe light in a weird sequence of blinks. Almost like Morse code.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got out of work in the morning, it was beginning to get light out. I remembered the exact location that I saw the object the previous night. Lo and behold, there was something in the sky at the exact location. This time it was much higher. It was barely moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hard to tell the shape of it. It had faint blue lights, and three very bright white lights. The middle white light was flashing just as the red light did the night before. It made no sound that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then ran into the hospital where I work and asked some of my coworkers who work the ER with me to step outside to see if they could tell me what it was I was looking at. They all joked and made fun of me till they went outside themselves and saw what was believed at first to be a star......however it changed colors from red, to orange, to blue then solid white.....it also just hovered and would hover from lett to right. One of the nurses I work with was frightened by the whole thing she ran back inside and got the nursing supervisor who at first was cracking jokes about it and then changed his tune when he spotted others similar to the one we had been watching there were 8 in total. We reported this to the local news........WWLP and the local Ware police to which they just laughed and did nothing about it........before the night was over all of the hospital staff was outside looking at this anomoly with no good explanation as to what it was we were observing.

It continued on that path until it was completely out of sight which only took a matter of 2-3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had no sound what so ever, nor did it seem to emit any kind of heat.

Instead I noticed that there was a &#34;star&#34; that seemed to be moving.  It would lurch in one direction and then another.  I’d say that the movement was at least as great as the diameter of the moon or perhaps greater.  I called my husband and he saw it too.  We steadied ourselves on a post outside of our porch and definitely could tell there was movement with respect to the post and eaves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my husband noticed that another &#34;star&#34; seemed to be moving and I witnessed this also.  We noticed that there were more than one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered if perhaps we were seeing the earth’s wobble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I emailed a friend in Los Angeles and she didn’t see any stars moving.<n>

I didnt think anything of it until that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light seemed to turn into two side by side lights with a small strip of different colored lights in the center.  It obviously was not an airplane as the two lights started to flicker simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object traveled south at a much slower speed than even an airplane, and made a flip/turn.  Thats when it was on its side, I guess, and you could clearly see what was now three white lights in the shape of a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, it basically stayed where it was, if moving, moving slowly, it then flew away much faster than it had previously been moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark outside, a clear night, nothing behind what we saw, just in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im guessing at around 1500-2000 feet.  It was much lower in the sky than an airplane.<n>

This morning looking to see what I had shot I came across the 2nd to the last photo had a strange object on it. I zoomed in and discover it looked like a disk. I know how to set my camera up visually and still had the setting stored from last night. Iam E-mailing the photo Th settings on the camera are as follows Canon Powershot A520  Manual mode, shooting with a tripod.

There was a slow moving triangular shaped object with a light in each corner that was a greenish color.  The craft was moving much slower than a plane and it was not hovering like a helicopter.  There were no flashing lights on the sides or under belly.  It is hard to know what the complete shape and dimensions would be because it was dark. The craft came towards us, passed over our vehicle ( there was no noise) and then continued on to the right.  We turned around a little father down to see if it was visible and had continued on the same path but it was gone<n>

12/4/07 17:00|Current|NV|Unknown|45 minutes|Amber light observed in rural Nevada very far away from military test range|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60574.html|315|ndxe200712| Amber light observed in rural Nevada very far away from military test range<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Police Officer with many years of experience in rural Nevada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On December 4, 2007 at approximately 19:00 hours I, along with another officer, observed a single bright amber light while driving southbound on state route 379 in Nye County Nevada.  The light pulsated and disappeared as the object generating the light moved quickly to the other side of a small hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark but the sky was clear and I am very familiar with the hills and mountain ranges in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued southbound on 379 for another 15 miles to US highway 6 without seeing a second sign of the object.  At the junction we decided to “black” the patrol unit out and look down the valley toward where we saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had a clear view of the small mountain range.  In the desert valley 15 miles is not too far to see clearly and mountain silhouette was recognizable even with the nightfall because of the star light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes of observing the mountain range the amber light again appeared.  It moved slowly at first then suddenly moved very vast along the range.  It reversed its direction and seemed to climb and descend at great speeds then occasionally stopping after accelerating to what seemed to be supersonic speeds. It would traverse literally in the blink of an eye an estimated distance of about 5 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said earlier I am very familiar with rural Nevada and I have had the opportunity on many occasions to observe supersonic aircraft flying overhead.  From these experiences I know that after seeing an aircraft accelerate to those speeds a “sonic boom” can be heard even at that distance.  We heard nothing aside from the usual sounds of the high desert.  Also I can think of nothing living or inanimate that would be able to survive the “G” forces associated with those maneuvers, though I must admit I do not have an aeronautical background.  This was just common sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the object for about ten minuets a second suddenly appeared.  It emitted the same amber light and flew in the same manner as the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were other vehicles traveling down that stretch of highway.  We observed something that leads us to believe that the objects were not without intelligence.  As the vehicles on the highway approached the mountain range the lights would either disappear or move to the other side of the mountains.  It appeared that these lights were avoiding the cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed this activity for about half an hour before we decided to continue driving.  We drove East bound on Highway 6 for another ten or fifteen miles when just on the East side of Current Summit at the Nye and White Pine County Line we observed two more sets of amber lights behaving in the same manner as the first set.  I do not know if these objects where merely the same as the ones we’d seen earlier or a different set altogether.  These objects hovered over the trees of the Humbolt National Forest at about fifteen feet.  They were only about two miles to the North of us we again “blacked out” and observed the lights which had to be aware of us at this point.  We observed for only a few minuets because one of the objects disappeared and the other seemed to be distracting us by hovering in plane view.  Since it is said that curiosity killed the cat my feline compatriot and I decided drive away as fast as was safe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot say that this was my first experience with these objects.  I grew up in this area and this experience marks the fifth time I had seen these lights.  I was 15 the first time and I had been traveling the same stretch of highway with my grandmother.  After we had seen the object and it disappeared my grandmother told me that she had been seeing the lights since the early nineteen thirties in the same area and that most people just didn’t talk about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say that I am very concerned about these objects.  I have tried to rationalize what I had seen before as military test aircraft.  However the area where I’ve seen these objects is about a hundred miles from the Tonapah military test range and I would assume that the US military would want to keep top secret craft within secure airspace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There have been reports of cattle mutilation in the area as well. I have to say that whatever these objects are they worry me.  I cannot fathom what their intentions might be; frankly that’s what scares me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were two, one was higher than the other one. I have photos, and if you zoom into the photo you can see the flying object is a disk shaped object. It was situated over the sky of medellin, Colombia (south America), my 3 friends were with me. One of the objects moved away across the sky keeping the same height, the other one was very much higher and moved upwards and away. They had the ability to keep in the same place, they did so for 5 minutes or so. The one that moved across the sky before stayed in one place and did so continuously. After the 5 minutes were over and eventually after four minutes was the other side of the city....what i will add that i think is an extremely important point is that the the flying objects were VERY close to aeroplanes that were flying into the airport, this is why i knew (in my opinion) that it was a UFO simply because if any other flying aircraft were that close the pilots of the strange crafts would be sacked as they were so close to the planes coming into land. There were no lights coming front he craft, well there might of been as it was in the day, but from what i could see no lights at all. Eventually after they went further away we got in a taxi and went back to our hostel (black sheep) Medellin, colombia.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/4/07 08:05|Tyler|TX|Unknown|10 minutes|light that looked like a star moved from below the moon to above the moon in ten minutes|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60173.html|317|ndxe200712| light that looked like a star moved from below the moon to above the moon in ten minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 04/20/07 at 8:05 p.m. Central time in Tyler, Texas, I arrived at a family member’s home from across town and reported the unusually beautiful moon and two bright stars (to me a twinkling light is a star, until it moves, of course) low in the western sky.  My family member said that at time there should at most only be one bright “star” in the West and it should be Venus.  This family member became curious and walked away from the building to get a clear view of what I was looking at. We were looking at partial moon several degrees above Venus and that there was another bright object, about one inch (at arms length), to the left and slightly below Venus.  After watching for a few seconds we realized that this object was moving slowly up and a little to the right in relation to Venus.  As the object moved it slowly became less bright and disappeared from sight in about ten minutes.  The total “distance” traversed during this time was about three inches (at arms length) up and to the right and then it disappeared almost directly above Venus but very slightly to the right.  On a clock it would appear to be at three minutes past the hour.  During this slow transit we realized that there were very tiny and very difficult to see flashes of light at a distance of about one quarter of an inch (at arms length) in all directions from the object.  These flashes seemed to both come from the object and come from outside the object.  My family member said that the apparent movement of the object would indicate that it was not inside of the atmosphere.  If the object was, it would have to be increasing in altitude but somehow reducing in reflectivity.  At that time of day (just after sunset) the object did not move far enough East to pass the solar terminator and lose its light source.  The object also did not seem to be moving fast enough to reach escape velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sight of the moon and two “stars” was so beautiful.  If I had not stopped to look at them, this sighting would never have happened.  My family member would not have come to look at it, too.  We would not have realized that one of the “stars” was moving and wasn’t a star at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My chant to everyone I know is to look up!  Cloudy or Clear! Day or Night!  Look up!<n>

In the sky, above the mountains I saw a very bright Blue light in the sky. The blue was unlike any color I have seen before. Very close to a neon blue. It was moving fast from the sky and it made a streak in the air for about 5 seconds. The light seemed to be almost fire like. It dissapeared behind the mountains toward the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky started to clear and I was outside on my balcony facing the ocean. I looked up and noticed two lights parallel with each other approximately 1/2 a mile offshore and around 400 feet in the air. They were moving very slowly but in sequence with each other. The next second they crossed each others path very quickly and then resumed there slow pace. At that point I was stunned and amazed at what I was seeing. The sudden precise movements that they made were not of man made technology in my mind. These things were completely silent. If I wouldn&#39;t have looked up just at that moment, I would have never known they were there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next second, the bottom one from what I can see just darted straight up to a higher elevation with that same precise movement as before. They continued at the slow speed together but further apart from each other. Then all of a sudden they both merged closer together very quickly. I just couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing. Then one more time they both made a sporadic different maneuver but at the same time and then they just kind of vanished. There were still a lot of clouds in the sky and they may have been just  being covered by the clouds from my sight. It was like they were patrolling the shoreline together. But it was very very cool and I am so glad to get it off my chest. I haven&#39;t called anyone to report it cause I like my freedom (haha) and I know what I saw. I can honestly say there is no doubt in my mind that something else other than ourselves is out there.<n>

We can&#39;t figure out the shapes on these things, but do know they are lined up like connect the dots with the 3 objects being the top of a triangle. I almost forgot that I took pictures outside and only the one object appears, but camera will not pick up the other two objects and batteries went dead after 4 pictures and these are new batteries, but within 5 minutes of returning back inside the house batteries worked fine! We started watching these abjects around 9:45 pm but it is now 11:10 pm and they are still visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was coming back home and noticed a bright orange star to the northeast. It was far away with other stars but I thought it curious and I wondered if there ere any other orange stars in the sky. I panned from the orange star in the sky to the left looking down my street. To my absolute astonishment there was a glowing orange ball approximately 100 yards above my neighbor’s home just sitting there idle. I thought to myself &#34;there is no way I&#39;m seeing this so I rubbed my eyes and did a double take but the object was still there. It was a glowing bright orange ball just hovering over our neighborhood. When I realized that it wasn’t a figment of my imagination I started running down the street dragging my dogs behind me. I have 2 bull dogs and one of them is older and doesn’t run very fast. After trying to drag her I finally just threw her leash away and left her in the street while I ran home. My father and daughter were both home and I yelled in the house “you’re not going to believe this but there is a UFO outside.” Both of them came into the back yard and witnessed it. While I was running home it moved slowly from above my neighbor’s house across the street to the east over our back yards.  We sat there looking at it in awe. It looked kind of like a party balloon as it was circular, but it was glowing orange. So bright in fact that you could see the light from it emanating off the neighboring rooftops. After it hovered over out back yard for about 5 minutes it then started moving south. I new I had to tell more people so I ran over to my neighbors, knocked on their door, the wife answered and I told her she had to come out side and see this UFO. It was starting to get further away moving slowly thought the sky but we both sat there and watched it move southward stopping periodically and hovering for 5 or 10 minutes and then continuing on to the south. This happened in Oceanside California near the intersection of Lake and Ridge. What was reall! y amazin g is that it just hovered over my neighbor’s house and then moved eastward. Stopped, hovered again and then moved southward stopping periodically and just hovering. There was no wind out and the light was so bright that it could not have been a balloon with a light inside or on fire because it was visible from at least a mile as it continued southward down Melrose Ave towards the city of Carlsbad. We did get 2 pictures of it and there has to be more people that saw it. It was not necessarily a craft but it was able to maneuver and shone so bright that as it passed the neighboring homes the rooftops glowed orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I happened to gaze at the sky then I seen something bright passing really close over me. I almost assumed it was a jet but then when I observed it more closely, it was more starry-like but more closer than ever. I didn&#39;t even hear no sound. That evening there were mostly cloudy skies but there was some clearing left over. As it went overhead, I continued to look at it until as it headed north, it changed to a reddish color then disappeared. I know that south of us is the airport but I knew right then and there that wasn&#39;t a airplane or a jet. I tried to tell my grandad what I seen and he laughed it off like I was joking. I told him I seen something weird but he told me I probably seen a plane. I dropped the subject instantly then decided to keep it to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I&#39;ve never believe in &#34;aliens&#34; or anything like that. However, I did see something in the sky this afternoon, which was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was putting Christmas lights up on my house today at around 2pm. I was on my ladder facing east when I noticed four silver dots in the sky. Initially I believed they were birds, as they were flying in an arrow type shape headed in a southerly direction. After about 20 seconds they doubled back and began to weave in different directions. They went up, down, sideways, made circles. This went on for about 1 minute, then they began to head south again, still weaving and bobbing. I have an American flag flying on a pole in front of my house, as the objects began to fly south again the flag obstructed my view. I jumped off my ladder and went around to get a better view, however they began to fly toward the sunlight and I lost them in the glare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangdst part about this is that they stayed completely in synch with each other the entire time. When the first dot would bob and weave the others followed the EXACT path. They were all the same size, shape, and color. It reminded me of a ribbon on a stick. When you shake the stick and move the ribbon in the air, it follows the same path, it was very strange how these did the same thing. It was one of the strangest moments of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was a plane, because there are public runways for planes to take off and land near where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I took a closer look, and I saw strange lights. there were about 7-10 lights. some were flickering dimmly. and some were remaned on. There were multied colors of the lights. they all changed. some went to red, to white, to blue. and then brown, orange. Pink, Yellow. (Very Wired.) The lights were forming the UFO&#39;s shape as a &#34;W&#34;. It was dark out, so I wasnt compleatelly sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying at a normal plane speed you would see in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then It stoped. Looked as if it went around in a 360 in one spot. and Flew off, at an amazing speed!

Very large. More people had to have seen it, the blacktop was busy. It looked as though it were pretty close to Manito. Never have seen anything like it before, very strange.

Suddenly a triangle shaped aircraft appeared over the mountains (more like big hills with houses) to our right.

When driving home from work in West Hollywood, I witnessed a small round object, that looked to be either a very dark red or black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving north on La Cienega at around Wilshire.  Two helicopters patrolled the area, and 1 plane descended slightly in it&#39;s flight path, possibly to avoid the object.  After remaining stationary for just about 30 seconds, it began to move again, towards downtown (to my right at the time).  While driving, I lost sight of the object behind trees and buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 20 minutes later, at about 4:45PM, I was heading into downtown LA towards the central library.  I was just exiting the 10 West onto the 110 North.  As I came around the curve, I saw the object again, exactly as before, in the skies above the city to the north, northeast of route 110 (a little ahead and to the left of the highway from my perspective.  I looked around at other vehicles and nobody seemed to notice it.  Behind me in a white/cream colored volkswagen station wagon, were a couple in their late 60&#39;s, early 70&#39;s.  They saw the object also, but exited at 9th St.  I continued on the 110 to the 4th street exit, and as I did so the object came much nearer to the roadway.  It was very large, massive is the word that I kept thinking.  The closer it got to me, it looked less and less round, and I could identify individual colors, including red and black.  The object was a structure, for certain, and was vaguely cube shaped.  There appeared to be some sort of boom, or large metal pole hanging down below the craft.  It did not look aerodynamic at all.  It kept a solid form, and did not waver, heading in a straight line.  It was was too big and way too stable to have been balloons blowing in the wind.  It floated overhead, and I lost sight of it as I took the 4th street exit.  I was back on the 110 heading south again 20 minutes later, and did not see the craft in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He was in his vehicle on a very rural wooded county road &amp; watched the object cross the road in front of him about 15 feet below tree top level, approximately 3 car lengths away. The object was golden in color &amp; pulsated without being brightly lit. The object was apparently silent. It maneuvered around &amp; between bare tree limbs &amp; trunks, then hesitated before darting quickly across the road. The observer was facing east &amp; the object was traveling north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after this sighting the observer’s sister heard &amp; saw three fighter jets flying extremely low, at treetop level, directly above the house which is very near the sighting. The jets came &amp; went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live about a 1 ½ miles north of these neighbors. My husband &amp; I both heard &amp; saw low flying fighter jets at about the same time (4 pm) on December 2, several days before we knew about the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In retrospect I recall looking out my windows or running out the front door at least twice in the week prior to this sighting because I’d also heard unusually low aircraft &amp; then saw fighter jets flying above our home on those occasions. Their direction was always north to south or back again. I remember being surprised that the aircraft were so loud &amp; were flying so slowly at this low altitude although they looked like jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is it possible this object was in the neighborhood for a few days?<n>

He did not write the report himself because he did&#39;t believe anyone would take him seriously. However since my husband &amp; I had also noticed the jets flying unusually low above our property at the same time, prior to our knowledge of the man&#39;s sighting, we decided to go ahead &amp; contact you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seen by our neighbor was very small, a golden oval disc. It moved through trees then crossed the road about 15 feet above &amp; in front of his truck. Jets followed. Our land is north of the witness in the direction the object &amp; the jets he saw were moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been fascinated by reports of very small unknown flying objects whether they are moving through backyards, or in this case, a rural wooded area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw you had updated your reports for December 2007 I also noticed there were very few for that month. My report does not appear. Since I did not save my word document I am trying to reconstruct the report from memory. I don&#39;t know if you had technical difficulties in December or if you simply didn&#39;t believe the report I submitted. However, to the best of my knowledge, it was truly seen by our neighbor.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was around 11:30pm because my son just got home from work and he too seen the lights. The craft was round and had red, green,The object would remain still and then move side to side and begin to vibrate very rapidly. Sometimes it would just stop vibrating.Sometimes it would move in a linear fashion when vibrating and we watched for a while and then my son went to bed. I live in a 2 story house I went to my room and watched for a bit longer and around 1:30am I seen a craft fly by my bedroom window I know that it was not a plane because you could not hear it and it was way to low maybe about 200 ft<n>

It was around 10:20 pm, and I observed them for approximately 5 minutes, until they disappeared.  They appeared “medium sized.”  I do not have an estimate of height, but I believe the sky was overcast, and they would have been below the level of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered if they might be spotlights, but at no time did I see any “leader” lights extending between and orbs and the ground.  I had an impression of sentience from them.  To me, the most interesting thing about these orbs has always been their way of moving around, which was instantaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting began by seeing one of the lights in the sky.  As I watched it, a second identical orb appeared next to it.  After a while, one of the orbs disappeared from where it was and instantly appeared in another part of the sky.  Then the second orb moved in the same manner to appear next to the first.  This process repeated to another part of the overhead sky.  After a while, first one of the lights disappeared, and then the second.  I consider this my one and only “UFO experience.”<n>

While on the interstate if was raining pretty hard. As we were traveling I noticed a odd light in the sky just above a mountain. I stared at the light for a good 5 or 6 minutes before coming to the pre-mature conclusions that it was the top of a blink tower. Then as we drove closer and closer I realized that it was really bright. To bright for a light tower. I asked my boyfriend what he thought it was and he said it was a light tower. I agreed and then a couple of minutes later I looked again and saw that it was definitly not a light tower. I saw there wasn&#39;t a poll grounding the lights. I started to get confused and focused harder on the lights. In doing so I realized that it was hovering. By this time we where very close and when my eyes focused I saw that it was a man made jet airliner. However, what was so odd about this was that it was not on top of a mountain it was right next the interstate bridge inside of a deep valley. Hovering there it seems to teeter. All the lights where on, I could see the windows to the plane. There was absolutly no markings on the plane accept for a blue stripe and a red stripe. I had already rolled the window down and in total shock I stuck my head out the window in order to try and beleive my eyes better, completely ignoring the pooring rain. The airliner wasn&#39;t more than 3 or 4 hundred off the ground and slightly tilted forward towards the ground. There wasnt any sound whatsoever. That was what blew my mind was the absence of sound. I know this isnt a UFO because I definitly identified what the flying object was I just cannot find an explanation for a hovering passenger jet. H<n>

12/1/07 17:00|Blue Springs|MO|Other||Being on a floating platform watching me from 25 feet away.|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96052.html|350|ndxe200712| Being on a floating platform watching me from 25 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 5pm, I took a couple bags of trash outside and around the back of our duplex to the trash containers.  I placed the bags in the containers and then lit a cigarette.  The day was very clear and I was facing away from the house.  Behind our house was a driveway, a small drainage ditch, several trees and a small business office about 100 yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt as though someone was watching me, as I was not fond of the neighbor in the other half of the duplex. I looked around and saw no one.  I continued to smoke until I detected movement from the corner of my eye up to my right and in the trees about 25 feet away.  I looked up to the right and saw `something` upright and floating for a very brief time, it seemed to move away from behind one branch and go behind another.  It was large though, but less than 6 feet with the device.  There was a translucent globe where a head should be.  I smelled this awful smell that was worse than the dirty diapers in the trash! It hung in my nostrils and my throat.  It was so foul that it was almost chocking.It was obscured by the branches and just disappeared!   I was paralyzed with fear as I attempted to process what I saw.  I dropped the cigarrette and ran indoors to the master bedroom and retrieved a  handgun.   I was so terrified and confused that I was unable to look out the window for a few mi! nutes.  I didn`t say anything for a few days as I doubted what I think I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only description I can think to explain it would be a being, though it certainly did not appear to be a man, with a device around it that enabled it to hover silently in an upright position.  This device was attached at the waist with some platform to stand on but it didn`t make sense to me.  It was not anything that I recognized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I served honorably in the Army and was required to master aircraft recognition as part of my air defense training. I had no idea what it was except that it was a being of some sort.  No eyes in the globe but `it` was watching me! I felt as though I was being watched or monitored.  I truly felt threatened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a family man and have several children that I am very protective of.  When I could no longer see it, I could smell a foul odor that was noticeably worse than the dirty diapers in the trash I was carrying.  I felt as though something was very wrong but couldn`t remember much of the details of it though I had frequent night terrors and horrible nightmares since.  I acknowledge that I have had a traumatic past and had been taking medication regularly prior to, during and after this event.  But I know I did see something, even if I mis-identified it, something was there.  It disturbed me so much that I missed Christmas with my family in 2007 and had recurrent panic attacks.  I began to do destructive things, totally out of character for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remained quiet about this event up until my wife told me something strange scared her very bad, right about the same time that I had my incident.  We do not go in depth about our experience to each other, though we are very close.  I find myself unable to describe this event clearly as it seems `backwards` or scrambled when I try to explain it.  I did lose track of an hour or so and my neck and my upper back muscles were locked in spasm, as if I had just got into a fight and stayed that way for hours, although I think it was all due to the adrenaline, my memory is blurry of the incident and it takes me awhile to piece it together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work in retail loss prevention, and have to watch people closely all day.  I notice little things and non-verbal behavior.  Sometimes when I have to apprehend someone for stealing, it entails a chase and or altercation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not remember any aircraft at that point but remember the house vibrating later that night from helicopters flying overhead.  We lived near an ammunitions plant and an Air Force base.  We moved away from Blue Springs in 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, and we find him to be both eloquent, and seemingly quite serious-minded.  He expressed concern over the cause of the incident, more detail of which seems to be coming back to him, in his memory of the event.  His wife also remembers portions of the occurrence, a fact that both of them just shared with one another.  PD))<n>

I estimate the object to have been at least ¼ of a mile away and about less than 1000 feet in the air. There is a Freeway located below in the path the object was moving. My guess is that this object was probably moving at about the same speed as the cars below which is 65 miles per hour. We looked at the object to where it looked like a small dot in the distance. The object then suddenly veered upwards and then we could no longer see it in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the object looked like some type of burned chrome or dull alloy. It resembled a US Stealth Bomber, but without the wings(side view) and the color. In the background, we saw a large airplane heading to Los Angeles International Airport. The airplane was heading east to west and the object north to south. It crossed directly in the planes path, except it was about a few hundred feet lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 34-year-old Freight Transportation Contractor and my son is a High School Student. We are both very skeptical of such things. I have to say that this was a rush for me. I just had to tell someone. I was going to phone the sheriffs department, but what would they think of a local business owner without any footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then a bright purplish streak though the air and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She lined up her camera and took a picture of the waves crashing on the shore with the high point of the island in the background.  At the time, neither she nor anyone else on the island, which may have numbered around 100 people saw anything unusual.  It was only when she got home and downloaded the pictures from her camera into her computer that she saw the UFO in the top right of the frame of the picture I have attached.  For the best clarity, it is best viewed on a Mac or other Apple product if possible, as PC screens seem to really pixelate the picture.<n>
12/1/07 12:00|Kailua|HI|Changing|22 days ongoing|Ongoing daily photography of UFO's invisible to naked eyes over Kaneohe, Hawaii .|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60459.html|355|ndxe200712| Ongoing daily photography of UFO&#39;s invisible to naked eyes over Kaneohe, Hawaii .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently engaged in a remarkable UFO experience. I live near the Kaneohe Marine Corps base located in Kaneohe, Hawaii, and I have been photographing UFO’s in the skies on a nearly daily basis since Dec 1, 2007. Today is Dec 22, and I have dozens of pictures of different shaped objects. Some are perfectly round, some are cylindrical, some are disk like, and one close up disk even appears to have antenna sticking out the top and bottom.  On occasion two objects appear in the sky at once, and the higher object is usually cylindrical.  In one image there are two white spheres an done black sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is remarkable is that there are no visible objects to my naked eye. They only appear when I download my pictures. I have excellent vision and have been extremely careful to watch the skies as I am taking the pictures to insure that they are not bugs or birds or other visible flying objects. It is so intriguing that they resemble other people pictures I have seen on the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began this project out of inquisitive fun. A friend and I went to an October 22 2007  Blue Angels show on base and he, being very well read about UFO’s, said we might get a picture of one if we took pictures of the skies around the show. I didn’t expect anything but a fun diversion, until one of his downloaded images contained a far off cylindrical object that I have since become very familiar with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to make a project out of seeing if I could get similar results, and have been quite shocked with the experience. Having shot pictures of the skies all around, I am only getting these objects in a very specific area, but at different altitudes.  They are essentially hovering above what is known as Kalaheo hillside, to the west of some pretty complex towers that I have been told are military radar equipment. Maybe these objects are military in nature, but even this is profound. From the H3 Kaneohe look out they are most often directly above, and from my house in Kailua, they are above the ridge. Based on their relativity to the common cumulus clouds, I would say they most often sit right below them, roughly 2000 feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently trying to convince others to join me in this project but have yet to have anyone join me in taking pictures or video. I think it’s remarkable that I can accurately predict capturing UFO’s on film. I would encourage anyone reading this to take pictures of this area and see what they get.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to add that early on in this project I had a very visceral dream that was very out the ordinary. I don’t know if its connected, but the entire dream was look down from very high in the sky at two air force planes refueling mid air. The whole dream was just my thoughts trying to orient the view, trying to figure out what I was looking at. Its very strange because I really have no interest in military things, and I was able to confirm the way the planes were aligned with a little research afterwards. .  Interestingly, there were no views looking down on the operation, like I was seeing, available. I had no references to how I was seeing this, no ship I was on, just a view. I don&#39;t know why or how I &#34;knew&#34; they were air force either. And in thinking about it, it really was a perfect way to “show me” something that I could understand, but not really create.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Background Female, 40 years old, Teacher and professional artist, no history of mental illness.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I head loud jet aircraft noise and it was odd to me as there is not much jet aircraft noise as it is a fairly remote area of Upstate New York.  I looked up into the sky and toward the west I noticed the contrails of three aircraft in a formation and could identify that they were military aircraft probably Airforce Fighters. the sound was rather loud and figures they were accelerating possibly using afterburners.  To the south of the aircraft I noticed a round shaped rather larger object. The three aircraft were making a turn to the west. The round object seemed to be reflecting the sunlight coming out of the east. The larger round shaped craft then dissapeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up in Southern California near Edwards Air Force Base and was familiar with the sound of military aircraft and fighter jets.  My father worked for NASA at Dryden Flight Research Center. There is not much aircraft noise is this area and thought it odd that there was a group of Fighters in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The larger round object seemed to fade as it turned slightly and dissapear from sight.  Jet aircraft contrails were still visible for a short time and were curved as the aircraft were making a high G force turn.  The Profile of the Jets seemed to disapear but the jet sound reduced in intensity possibly to moving away from the area, changing course or reducing throttle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident probably lasted 1 1/2 minutes. The weather was clear with no Clouds cold probably in the upper 20&#39;s with no wind.<n>

It was a spherical or circle of bright white light.  It flew right over my head at a steady slow speed at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet! There was absolutely NO NOISE! It came from the WNW and disappeared in the ESE direction.  Right before it disappeared over the tree line a reddish brown tube of light either flew right below it or it was shot out of the bottom of the UFO.  The tube shot out at a very high speed but it was lit up like a flourescent tube and it looked like there were 2 sections to the tube.  I could definetly see a black line in the middle of the tube.  Anyway the reason that I did not send this info before is because I didn&#39;t think anyone would believe me.  I haven&#39;t been to your site in months and today I saw the sighting in NY in July that is almost identical to what I saw.  I have seen other strange things before and I have never reported them but this one was very close and different from anything that I have ever seen. During this sighting tears flowed from my eyes and all I could say was &#34;OH MY GOD&#34; over and over again.  Unless our government has a craft that can float through the air without sound and be lit up like this was (and also shoot out that weird tube) I would have to say that this was not of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I do not smoke in my house, so i&#39;m outdoors quite a bit, and have gotten to know the sky very well. This object was clearly out of place. As I looked closer - it appeard there was a tiny bright sphere, several times brighter then any star on the sky - and just off to the right of it, a smaller point of light, similar to the average star. The object appeared to be hovering extremely high over the carson valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not think anything of this at first, but then i noticed what appeared to be a halo around the bright object. As i stood there for roughly 10 minutes or so - the object began to move upwards in the sky, as if to a higher elevation. It also began moving from side to side. I have never seen any aircraft move in any manner such as this, and certainly not one so high up. It seemed able to move in any direction at any time, regardless of current velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back into my house, and peeked out the window from time to time - and it was still there before i went to bed around 1:00am. Every time i looked, it appeared to be in a different area, but with no obvious pattern , or with any obvious progression in one direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen odd things like this in the past, but something about this was just different. The way this object moved and behaved is unlike anything i&#39;ve seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
