It seamed to follow me. After a short time i stoped to stare at the light. Suddenly it split in to two lights which split into five with one in the middle. I turened to a person also outside and asked &#34;do you see that?&#34;. They loked at me for a moment and then ran into his apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Approximately 6-8 women were gathered on the beach on Orcas Island to watch stars. Off to our left and in the sky, were two to three bright blue flashes.They appeared to be the same color as old flash cubes. Following that, I saw a light that I assumed to be a satellite until it started to zig zag right and left. Then it shot out a bright light with a small fiery tail to it.  It zig zagged down towards the earth and about 60 degrees above the horizon, it disappeared from view.  Then I heard a low hum as if an outboard motor were running out on the lake.  That lasted for about an hour and/or until we left the beach to return to the cabin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We are grateful to the witness, who is well known to us, for he submitting the report.  We have five other reports of this event from independent sources, who reported it to us shortly after it had occurred.  The incident apparently gave rise to electrical anomalies in at least one home in West Sound, on Orcas Island.  The source of that information we deem to be extremely reliable.  We believe the date to have been Saturday night, September 24, 1994, and we have amended the date above.  PD))<n>

Distance:  about 15 miles.  Length:  800-1500 yards.  The same blue light could be seen around the object and through the circle of lights, the blue light of the sunset.  All lights in the circle moved in unison and the circle of lights was not rotating.  I looked at the object through my 10x50 hunting binoculars.  The event occured at the end of an afternoon of elk hunting.  The object was visible clearly for about 40-60 seconds.  The object disappeared as if the lights were shut off, with no resulting afterimage, only the blue light of the sunset remaining.  There was no sound, no exhaust, no blinking lights.  Within five minutes after the sighting, six to seven military jets shot across the valley in the direction of the object sighted a few minutes before.<n>

When I saw the necklace (I call it the Nevada Necklace), it was about 16 miles across the valley above the mountains between Hoppi Basin and Gamble Canyon, in clear view.  I said, &#34;What is that?&#34; and picked up my binoculars immediately and looked at the object carefully.  It was moving slowly to the north.  After viewing the necklace for several seconds, the multi-colored lights of the object simply turned off or disappeared with no after image.  The object was too high above the mountain to have been able to descend to the mountain or behind it.  I asked my passenger if she had seen it.  She said &#34;Yes.&#34;  The other vehicle containing her husband and son was about three minutes behind us on the same road.  We waited for them.  When they arrived, they confirmed seeing the same object.   In about five minutes we were back in Montello and there were several fighter jets flying all over the valley at that time as it got dark.  I wrote up an incident report and sent it to MUFON but never heard back from them at all.<n>

One of us noticed what looked like a star that kept moving around the sky. It would move really fast to the left, then slowly move to the right, then move really fast another direction. At this point we knew it wasn&#39;t a plane or helicopter because it would move fast, then slow and move up, down, to the right or to the left. After about 10 or 15 minutes of watching this, it disappeared.<n>

I have had quite a few sightings well over 50, and of more than 5 types of craft. I saw my first while living in a heavily populated rural area, I lived in an apt. and spent a lot of time watching the skies at night (I smoked ciggs and have kids, ergo me go outside). Have you ever been fooled by your mind or senses? Like your in the dark and bump up against a rope but your mind and senses tell you it&#39;s a snake? Well that is basically what happened my first time. I was just about to go in, taking the last drag of my smoke I look up into the night sky, only to see six lights. Two were up front and the other four were behind these and to the side. My mind automatically jumps to the conclusion that it is a low flying passenger airliner, only that it is unusually low keeps my attention for the moment... it is moving very slow... and then I notice it has no tail... there is no noise... those aren&#39;t wings.. they&#39;re round...   This is when my earlier conclusion is blown away and I am able to clearly see three seperate disk shaped vehicles, they had a brassy looking metalic body with three round nubs at the extrimity of each disk with a much larger nub in the middle of the objects. I took this all in as I yelled for someone to come see this, then noticed I was the only person about, not even traffic was going by (I felt what I suppose some of the natives of SouthAmerica felt when first seeing planes, awe, happy, oh yeah and shock). They then performed (the only word that fits) a manuevor where the two in back cross over and under the first and take the lead making an X. At the same time they had started rotating so it made a wild effect while performing the move. They traveled on slowly for another moment and then accelerated at a mind blowing speed away, they glowed orange to yellow as they did this, which left a blurred lazy S in the sky, just for a moment but it was pretty kwel. Since then I have had very few close encounters with as much impact as that first, yet I have had one or two that are as interesting and that have left their impression, like seeing 3 triangular crafts that were very large with other objects flying about them (seen with wife and friend). Currently I am back to seeing at least one every two weeks or so, it falls off sometimes and other times it seems amazing that it isn&#39;t talked about all over the city.<n>

A cool clear night mid to low 50&#39;s (best of my recollection) no wind or clouds. I happened to be facing approx. South and taking the last swallow out of a can of soda (head back looking up). Out of the corner of my eye (right - from the West) a bright light caught my attention. As I turned my head to look, the light was getting bigger (Closer) and in 4 seconds (maybe 3) it covered at least 6-7 miles and flew directly overhead. Since I was close to the top of the highest point in that area it offered a perfect view... The object was (best guess) a 20-30ft sphere-like object, traveling at a LEVEL steady altitude approx. 800-1000ft AGL (my position) and at a bearing of 100 degrees (based on aviation maps). Coming from the Youngstown Ohio area (guess) traveling East. The center or main mass of the sphere-oval was glowing like &#39;white-lightening&#39; and seem to have a &#39;electric-blue&#39; corona around it.This object made NO noise, did not stop, change altitude, or bearing while under my observation. The object also seemed distorted (perception of great speed?) The most amazing thing is my wife (X) saw something move real fast out of the corner of her eye but no detail, and NO-ONE else saw it at all! Proof... YOU HAVE TO LOOK UP AT THE RIGHT SECOND! Twenty people didn&#39;t see a thing! (See submitted map PA UFO 94-95.gif)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was called outside by one of our kids who ran in and said there was a UFO outside. When I got outside I looked in the sky at approx 80 degrees (facing south directly across from Immaculate Conception Catholic Church). I saw a very large triangular object relatively low in the sky. I estimate it&#39;s distance from me to be between 1000-2000 ft. I would estimate it&#39;s location to be over the Hudson River in an area just south of Kingston Point (near area where Rondout Creek meets the hudson, approx.) I would estimate it&#39;s size to be between 50-100 yards. It was very large. It hovered completely silent. It had 5-6 lights (white). 1 in each corner of a triangle and 1 between each corner. It remained in that position motionless for approx. 5 minutes. During this time people from the neighborhood were gathering in the church parking lot looking at the object. Many motorists were also stopping their cars and getting out to look at the object. The object then rotated to the left slightly (silently) (the lead point of the triangle was initially pointing east)and moved slightly forward then rotated again left slightly towards the NE then stopped and then proceeded to move in a NE direction slowly (10 mph?). It&#39;s path appeared to take it directly over the Hudson River in a northerly direction. After it cleared the trees and went out of sight, everyone went on their way. No police were observed in the area. I saw no media coverage on the event. I would estimate there were between 20-30 witnesses in my area of Delaware Ave. alone. Sky conditions were clear. I could not make out any surface characteristics as the craft appeared very dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Approximate date.  PD))<n>

We had not been drinking or undre the influence of any narcotics when we all saw a crystiline like apparition coming towards us at a high rate of speed. I think it was traveling at a speed faster than 150mph. The apparition  traveled towards us and flew over our heads at least 100 feet  above the ledge. The wind current that hit us after was extremly strong and we were almost blown over. The shape and composition of the apparition was like no other I had seen. It reminded me of a swarm of fireflies with multi-colored tails. All of my friends agree to these details in full. None of us have any clue what it was.<n>

In Sept. ? of 1994 I drove into town to pick-up my daughter, age 6 yrs., and her friend, age 9 yrs. from school. It was 3:00 PM. We drove to &#34;Red Mule&#34; for ice-cream, then went straight to the friend of my daughter&#39;s home to await her mother, and my wife who were shopping in &#34;Batesville&#34; 35 miles distant. The girls played in the front yard and I remained in the truck. At approximatly 3:30 PM. A &#34;B2&#34; stealth bomber approached my vehicle at a right angle, and would fly directly over my truck. I hurriedly left the truck for an unobstructed view. This was a first and only phisical view of the B2. It was real low, real slow, real large, real black, and almost noiseless. Imagine my thrill as it lazily passed over me. I turned as it went over, and called the girls to look-up. They did, as they lined to my left. At this time,the B2 was maybe a hundred yards past. Then, the corner of my right eye picked-up the site of a &#34;silver/metalic disc hurtling down crossways, right to left at about 45 degrees. It looked as though it would contact the &#34;B2&#34;. In seemingly nothing-flat, the &#34;disc&#34; which appeared completely circular on its path downward suddenly flattened in a manuever and positioned itself directly over the canopy section (rearward probably of the windscreen)and at once was in perfect sinc with the direction, and knot-speed of the B2.My daughter&#39;s friend exclaimed loudly...AND WHAT IS THAT? I answered, DO YOU SEE THAT? She said YEA! as did my daughter. My mouth was dry, and my neck-hair bristled, or crawled. I was totally confused and riveted to this event. The &#34;disc&#34; in reality only hovered over the stealth for maybe 4 or 5 seconds and I strained to take it all in. The sky was 3D clear blue, and the sun was behind me, and to my left. The stealth was now directly moving straight away from us and suddenly there was a blinding yellowish/white fuzzy flash and the &#34;disc&#34; ! hurtled away at a withering rate of accelleration, and at a level on par with the &#34;B2&#34; and at a 20 to 30 degrees &#34;port&#34; angle to the &#34;B2&#34;s dead reckoning. Several more seconds elapsed before I thought to &#34;count&#34;. I then counted about 5 seconds and the &#34;disc was gone into and beyond the horizon. I switched my stare back to the stealth and to my amazement, it had not pursued,nor altered its heading, nor differentiated in its rate of velocity. As I have so stated; the &#34;disc&#34; was of a silver/metalic nature. I had it in my vision extremely clear. There were no portals of any kind. There were no discernable seams,nor rivits although at that distance of probably five hundred feet or more down the road; these features might&#39;nt be visible to the naked eye. There were no lights, nor markings that I could discern. In short, nothing but the superb showing of the silver/metalic skin, and the shape. It was circular, flat bottomed, with a curved, or arched topside and sloping gently towards the bottom edge, yet extending slightly past then curving tightly downward, and inward,and straightening to the bottom edge. End of story. Beginning of mystery. There is a MUFON chapter somewhere near Batesville, Ark. ? A lady doctor fields the calls. I contacted her after my daughter&#39;s friends mother took the MUFON contact number from a T.V. U.F.O. show several weeks after our encounter. I related this same account to her, and she advised me that this was a remarkable event that did not occur often. I no longer have her number. As we talked, she advised me that there would in several weeks time be an international mufon gathering in Silver Springs, Ark. I however did not attend, but maybe you have heard of it, or possibly attended. Let me know if you are able to confirm this with any other information. Thankyou. We have moved once again after 1994.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate. PD))<n>

I was out for the evening with a group of friends. We were warming our cars up outside of a restaurant we had spent a few hours at. I was standing outside of my car talking with some of them in another car through their windows. For some reason, I happened to look up and notice how clear the sky was. A few seconds later I either looked up again or something caught my attention. I saw this enormous &#34;thing&#34; that took up my entire peripheral vision. It seemed football fields in size. It was transparent except that you could somehow make out a cylindrical or cigar form (I couldn&#39;t really see the ends fully - the transparency sort of tapered off). It was rotating as it was moving across the sky (similar to a cement truck travelling down the road spinning the cement). It had (what appeared to be) stars attached to it that seemed to be evenly spaced apart, but not in any particular formation. The same size but maybe a little brighter than &#34;normal&#34; stars. You could tell they were attached to this &#34;thing&#34; because you could see them going around with the rotations of the anomaly as opposed to the typical stationary stars I could see through the object. One of my friends in the car I was standing outside of heard my exclamation and saw my expression and pulled himself out through his open window quickly to try to see what I was looking at.  He is an amateur astronomer and knows how quickly things can disappear. Without making a noise the anomaly made its way across the sky travelling quite quickly. The sighting lasted about 10-15 seconds until it was too far for us to view it any longer or disappeared. My friend and I were quite shaken after the event. He describes it as if the sky opened up. I describe it as if a piece of sky was cut out and was moving against the rest of the sky.  No alcohol was consumed that evening as many have curiously asked me.<n>

9/14/94 23:20|Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire (UK/England)||Triangle|20 secs|Triangular silent aerial vehicle, big, lights on each corner|8/10/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08415.html|26|ndxe199409| Triangular silent aerial vehicle, big, lights on each corner<n> <n><n> <n><n> You might be interested in this info below that I sent to UFOlogist Tim Matthews.  You asked if anyone else has seen triangular flying vehicles.  Well, my wife and I both saw one together.  It was September 1994.  We were travelling North on the A1 (a major North-South highway in the UK) a few miles south of our home.  As we passed near to RAF Alconbury, a USAF air base (fully operational at the time) at 23.00, this huge, silent, black triangular craft, with a red/purple light at the front tip and white lights at the other two corners, flew quite low and to our right.  It then seemed to invert and flew back the way it had come.  My wife then said that it appeared to hover.  The craft was silent and pretty big. I&#39;ve seen prop planes like Hercules transports, various fighters, U2s and helicopters take off from that base in daylight and at night and it WAS NOT one of these.  My guess is that it was a secret stealth recon plane, the replacement for the SR71 Blackbird, called Aurora or Firefly.  However, the technology is amazing.  It was low, slow, silent, and hovers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A while later (a few months), my wife was driving her mother along country lanes near our village and she nearly drove off the road, because she was startled by this huge black triangular craft that rose silently from behind a hill, flew over the car and was gone.  This was in daylight.  I showed them pictures of the stealth fighter and stealth bomber and both said it looked more like the bomber but it was not the same.  The stealth bomber has not been deployed outside the USA, but it is rumoured that these secret triangular craft are deployed in the UK and Germany as well as the USA and crewed by NATO pilots.  I&#39;ll say one thing, it was a magnificent sight and I won&#39;t forget that brief encounter.  I expect that in 20 years or so it will be on the Discovery Channel!  The Blackbird was retired in 1990 but was built in the mid 60&#39;s and was very advanced.  So, I wonder what amazing prototypes are being built now to outperform these triangular craft?<n>

No impact felt or heard. it was expected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Husband and I were by window when large fiery emerald green type globe with fiery yellow tail started to descend gradually across sky.  It appeared to be close and though it went behind trees, we expected to hear or feel impact or have a fire due to the dryness of our area and the fieryness of the object.  Neither hearing or feeling an impact occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I phoned the local sheriffs dept. to tell them there may be a fire in the vicinity due to the object colliding in the outskirts, they referred me to call NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then proceeded to call that #. Later I sent report to both NUFORC and Mufon and contacted the local paper.   All items mentioned were saved in my files and when I spoke to NUFORC recently it was suggested if I still had these items to resubmit my sighting on this net site and send in articles, which I have done on 9/27/99.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We did speak via telephone with this witness, on the date indicated, and we consider her to be exceptionally reliable.

I Top Secret (Cosmic) and Nuclear (PRP) clearances when I was on active duty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also had a two week interlude in Spain that occured when I was stationed in Rota, Cadiz, Spain that I will report when I am contacted and interviewed.  This experience I believe has led to the multitude of books that have emerged since 1975 because when I asked people not to report what I had seen, it appears that all of these individuals decided to go out and write their own books.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident that I want to report was witnessed by Momi Leilani (fictious name) and I.  The object that Momi and I observed looked very similar to a U.S. USN aircraft carrier in color, and appearance, except about 10 times larger.  And this craft was clearly hovering above the horizon and was about 1/4 mile from me in distance.  I could see the sheets of metal squares that were welded and riveted to the hull of the spaceship.  I could clearly see the rivets that appeared to be about 10 inches in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spaceship appeared almost instantaneaously and without any sound. It was airborne and about 10 degrees above the horizon.  Momi and I were seated on a picnic table about 50 feet from the beach. We were seated facing the beach.  I could see a rectangular port that was approximately 40 feet wide and 20 feet high taking into account the stature of the onboard Humans that I saw.  I could clearly see human people comprising of adults and children standing and observing us.  As soon as they realized that I could see them the spacecraft dissapeared ala Star Trek warp speed departure.  All we saw was the ship elongate and disapear towards Honolulu.  Again no sound and no wind movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, when I went to work in Honolulu, the Radio Talk Show Personality by the Name of Larry Price reported that he had also observed the Space Craft and asked over the air live if anyone had witnessed the spacecraft to contact him at the radio station.  I did not call in because I was still not accepting what I had observed.  I tried to rationalize what I had seen and at first believed that maybe the U.S. must surely have some sort of super Top Secret space craft that I was not aware of, but later I could not rationalize why the people onboard appeared to be alarmed when they realized that I could see them.  This is when I had to accept that this spacecraft was not a U.S. aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft could easliy transport about 100,000 personnel.  The immediate impression in my mind was that the people new me and were observing us to see how we were doing.  Or could it be that they were just taking a sightseeing tour of the Hawaiian Islands?<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was in the Navy I used to have to take polygraphs examinations in order to maintain my security clearances.  I used to have to take polygraphs from the various agencies.  There were circumstances when during the course of about 3 months I took polygraphs from the DIA, FBI, NIS, etc and ultimately interviewed by the CIA.  The polygraphs were always mainly having to do with National Security concerns.  It always alarmed me to have to take so many polygraphs, because it appeared like the intelligence agencies did not contact each other to confirm that I had already taken my required polygraph examinations.  It was like the agencies did not trust the results of the other agencies.<n>

I caught up to her as she was heading back to the small parking area. before we got there we saw a white jeep cherokee that we assumed was a park service vehicle there about the thing we saw. as we got closer we found the driver door opened and the vehcle running with it&#39;s headlights on. there was another couple by thier car and we asked about the jeep and they said someone must&#39;ve fallen off the bluff or something.  there was nothing in the paper about any accidents and there was never anything reported about that evening.  we have never forgotten that incident and we&#39;ve never seen anything similiar before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was totally still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then accelerated so quickly we could not follow it with our eyes.  It went up at a 45 degree angle and was going so fast it was hard to comprehend, after the initial acceleration we couldn&#39;t even see it anymore.  It did all of this without making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then called the airport and police to report it but they ignored us, after all we were 12 years old and our parents didn&#39;t even believe us.

9/1/94 11:00|Grants Pass|OR|Changing|12 hours|Thought of as a Dream for 20 Years, Recent Information Convinced me that Iv been Abducted by Aliens.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98357.html|33|ndxe199409| Thought of as a Dream for 20 Years, Recent Information Convinced me that Iv been Abducted by Aliens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was APPROX September of 1994, I had just gotten off work and I got home and laid down in my bed, I was relaxing like I often did and I laid on my back,  Just then I began to notice that I could see stars through the ceiling and the black of the space also became visible through the ceiling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just about then I looked down at my feet and realized I was outside floating just above the apex of the 2 story roof and just below my feet I could see the porch light.  Just as I am thinking, &#34;What the Hell!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see a shooting star that calms me and takes my mind off the reality of this all.  As this star gazed across the sky it looked like a big rectangle reading glass with three smaller round reading glasses inside it.  It had a tail and as it gazed across the light from the stars behind it would bend, following the contour of the reading glass they shined through.  As it gazed all the way tot he other side of the sky it began to move down Toward me!!  As it got close to me it flipped over and the very moment it flipped over I could not only see the color of the belly of the craft but it almost seemed like this paralyzing sound was coming from this belly.  The belly of the craft was very Round Orange Orb like a great big Orange and around the equator of it had Several Bright Red Orbs much smaller forming a ring around it.  It was so scary and it felt almost as if the Orange belly was where the sound was coming from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sound was very rapid and high Mid high pitch.  It sounded almost like a flute like &#34;Doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle!!&#34;  But the strange and scary thing about this sound was the absolute milli second that this craft aimed the belly of it at me, this sound hit me like a beam!!  This sound beam his me, and grabbed me like, I can not explain but it paralyzed me and held me for the craft to get right over the top of me.  As it hovered over me the sound pulled me into it.  As I rose up into the belly of this craft I KNEW What ever was inside it I did not want to see.  I did have the clarity to think that I did want to know what was next but I knew that It would be scary as hell so I called out for Jesus Christ.  Now I did this out of Natural reflex because I was raised Christian at this time in my life I was very Anti-Christian and believed Jesus Christ was a total Lie so it was strange I called out to him.   It was almost like using his name in Vane but in a way I was so scared I was asking for help too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened was amazing,  The moment I yelled, &#34;Jesus Christ, Save me!&#34;,  the craft Dissolved and I awoke in my bed Struggling very hard to gain control of my Body.  I literally felt like I had Ropes tied to my Elbows and my Knees pulling me back to sleep and that I was struggling very hard to overcome it.  My eyes where wide Open, I was wide Awake, But I literally felt Ropes tied to my elbows and Knees and eyelids Pulling me back to sleep and paralyzing my body back to sleep!!!  I was able to over come it and Over the next few months I noticed a circular Scar on my left palm.  Not a cut but a Scar much like a Burn.  It scared hell out of me because you know it made my Palm look like a pentagram.  So were talking a circle about the size of a coffee cup.  It was very strange because I never had a cut, It looked like I had put my palm on a pipe end and twisted it,  However like I said it never looked like a cut, If anything it would have been a Burn.  In fact you know if you Heat up a Pipe end and put it to my palm when it is red hot, it would burn a mark on my palm putting a circle around my palm print making it look like a pentagram.  The scar lasted about a few years and then vanished.  I went on and on in my mind to recall ever burning a scar into my palm and it just did not happen!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> So about 6 months after this event I was watching a Documentary on TV and a guy came up with an explanation for Alien Abduction he proposes that they are a result of sleep paralysis.  He says the Body falls asleep and the mind stays awake paralyzing the body completely.  This is so the body will not act out dreams!!  What really strike me was the renaissance paintings he showed of the Incubis they where little deamonds that would terrorise people in the night.  The Paintings from the renaissance paintings these little demonds where depicted holding onto Ropes which where tied to the Elbows and knees of the humans and these demonds would have a foot braced against the body pulling on these ropes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This freaking Shocked me that for hundreds of years other people felt the same exact thing like ropes tied to them pulling them asleep. I was convinced this was merely a dream!!  Till about twenty years later in 2012 I was watching the Debunking of David Icke and the guy talks of a experiment that took place involving over 400 test subjects they used some root from brazil which is a drug similar to LSD.  This drug was known to give similar effects and the test subjects experienced similar effects to the classic abduction.  Later this disturbed many of the subjects they needed psychological help over the next few months they tried many things and stumbled onto one that worked.  One called out the name, &#34;Jesus Christ!&#34;  By mistake or nature and they vanished instantly!!  He reported this and they started to perform tests.  They told one guy to call out to Christ, told another to call out to Buddha and so on.  But the ONLY one that causes the entities to vanish is the name Christ!!  In the end they end up telling everyone to use the name Christ and eve for &#34;Non believers&#34; the moment they say the word Christ the bad guys Vanish!!  This blew my mind because though I was not on drugs I had the exact same experience, Long before this research group and never having known about this research group.  To find that they even tried the names of other gods and only Christ worked was amazing!!  Then something else really started to make me wonder if this happened or if it was a dream.  My situation was that it felt like an out of body experience or a dream.  But I do not recall every going to sleep, the moment I realized I was looking at stars a situation with a UFO which I assumed is a dream took only a minute or two and then I woke up some 12 hours later.  So in that I have experienced missing time,  And sure enough I have a very strange mark on my hand as well. Now come to find out I have common grounds with this test subject that took place..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then another situation really startled the hell out of me.  A story I heard back in 1994 just after it happened and it was quite amazing but at the time I did not believe in UFOs so I assumed it was a Hoax.  But it was a case in South Africa where 62 Grade school kids saw two Silver Flying saucers during recess.  They also saw beings that spoke to them with ESP and delivered a Message..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I had not seen that since 1994 since I was a teen ager and I had forgotten it and in my mind had written it off as a hoax.  However with a fresh mind I had stumbled onto the report again on youtube,  But now with all the UFOlogy and Ancient Cultural and pyramid technology research under my belt I can listen to each detail with a keen ear!!  Right away I noticed this was an Amazing situation and could not possibly be a Hoax.  This Child Psychologist interviews these school kids and he knows what he is doing,  He is very careful NOT to lead them in his line of questioning.  I loved the brilliant way he questioned them because It left a lot of credibility with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For example he could have explained to the kids what ESP was and ask them if the Aliens talked to them with ESP.  But he did something that resulted in some solid data reporting because what he did was be so careful NOT to lead at all and allow the children to do the best job they can at explaining there Experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He asked exactly how the man talked to them and the one kid said &amp;quot;He said it to me with his Eyes&amp;quot; WOW..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway so realizing this was a very REAL Event.  It came to a girl that really frightened me with the reality in her eyes.  You can see the pure fear in her eyes and you KNOW this was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this girl says something that is really related to my experience.  Consider this,,  She is asked, &#34;What is the most scary part of your experience?&#34;,  and she says, &#34;Sound that came from the craft, sounded like a Flute.&#34;  Now this girl sees two flying saucers with Freaking Aliens come out to abduct them and the most scary thing is the sound of a flute?  Well, the most scary part of My experience was the sound that came from the craft, sounded like a flute!!  Why?  Because that sound grabbed me and paralyzed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the other strange Part.  The 62 school children Saw this experience in September of 1994!! So in September of 1994 BOTH my self and this girl from Africa see a UFO rather dream or real, we both see the similar experience!  Both my self and this girl Agree the most frightening part of the UFO Experience was &#34;The sound like a flute coming from the craft.&#34;   The event changed my life.  Because I went almost 20 years thinking it was just a dream but about 2 years ago when I saw this Debunking of David Ike and saw that others had screamed Christ to have these vanish, and when I realized the similarities that my experience has with the girl in South Africa.  And then I realize it was the Same Month and Year as My experience..<n> <n><n> <n><n> At which point it was hard to believe that it was not somewhat of a real experience..  So my recent travels to Yucatan travels I got really into researching UFOlogy, I learned to read Ancient Mayan Hieroglyphs, I am pretty much the third degree on Ruins on Mars, I talk with Wayne Herstel regularly.  I&#39;ve reviewed all of Richard Hoagland&#39;s work.  I&#39;m more than convinced that Humans have a very long history on Mars long before Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And I believe this somewhat inspired me. But it did not inspire me till after I learned about the other event in Africa with the 62 school children and the Debunking of David Ike. That blew my mind and changed my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today I realize that I have a history of out of body experience style dreams, dating back to when I was a very young child so it is very hard for me to feel like it was not a dream, because it had that dream feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I cant help but think of the Facts and NOW That I have gotten so deeply Involved in the current study of Ufology. I have come to realize the most current information is these Aliens are interdimensional beings and that is yet another amazing coincidence is that might possibly explain why the DREAM Abductions perhaps they are Abductions occuring to your soul!!  Or perhaps it was Real, I mean I did experience 12 Hours in about 4 Minutes and I did wake up with Scar on my hand that lasted few years, and I did have the similarities with the Research group and the 62 school children case..<n> <n><n> <n><n> So it is extremely dificult to know if it was real. It sure felt real as shit to me when my antichrist satin rock band ass was sreaming for Jesus Christ to help me!!  I heard you on C2Cam tonight and decided to tell my story.  I do not like to tell people because people have said some rude shit about it but it is possibly that you might know of some other reports so I figured Id tell every possibly detail just incase it matched with any other case..:)  Thank you very much!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

9/1/94 01:30|PottsVille|AR|Sphere|5 Min|A bright orange sphere hovering over interstate 40 turned white then vanished.|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47983.html|35|ndxe199409| A bright orange sphere hovering over interstate 40 turned white then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I were coming home from work at about 1:20 to 1:30 AM heading East on Highway 64 In Pottsville area near Interstate 40 when we noticed what looked like an orange glow of a large fire on or near the interstate in front and to the left of us.  We both commented about how it must be very large fire because of large glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we headed into Pottsville, we noticed the glow seemingly get larger.  Interstate 40 can be seen pretty clearly from highway 64.  The approximate mile markers on I-40 where my mother and I witnessed event would be between 87 and 88.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove East, we came to an area where the Interstate (I-40)can be seen clearly.  Both my mother and I witnessed what looked like a large ball or sphere of orange light, lift up and over the interstate.  This object was extremely bright.  I estimate it&#39;s distance from us at approximately 75 to 100 yards.  I estimate its diameter at about 10-12 feet because it was about the same size in height as the diesel trucks driving under the object.  There is no way the drivers of vehicles on I-40 could not have seen this object.  My mother was driving and I was in the passenger seat in awe of this sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She (my mother) slowed the car as we watched this &#34;thing&#34;. It lifted about 50 to 75 feet off of the ground and then changed color.  Now it was a blinding white color.  It was like looking at someone welding because it hurt to look at it directly.  We had to pull over because we could no longer see how to drive as we were temporarily blinded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we noticed it just blinked out.  As far as we could tell, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my mother to get on the interstate at exit 88 heading West to see if there were any burn marks or maybe a car accident in the area.  I could not pursuade her to do that.  There were no other cars on highway 64 at the time of this event that we know of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not sure of what we had just witnessed, so I asked my mom what she thought she saw.  She was shaken, but described everything exactly as I saw it.  We thought it may have been an car accident and subsequent explosion.  We had our windows down about halfway and we heard no blast.  Surely we would have heard something that big and bright no farther than we were from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This disturbed me so badly when we got home I reported it to the police.  They did not tell me anything at all, like if someone else had reported it or anything.  They just said they would check it out.  I do not know the exact date or even the month for sure now, as I rarely ever talked about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m pretty sure it was in early to mid Fall as it was still warm outside and it was Football season.  I remember that because I found out later that day while looking for news of what we saw, there was a story about a cheerleader dying in a bus accident when a diesel truck hit the school bus she was in and he kept going.  This however was not what we witnessed as this happened about five miles farther East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t seem to remember anything else pertinent to the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

9/1/94|Canton|OH|Unknown|not sure|Lost time|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59729.html|36|ndxe199409| Lost time<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 1:00 to 2:00 in the morning.  I was babysitting my two nephews and I also had my baby in a playpen  All were sounded asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not sleep that night.  So I was downstair and as I was going to walk up the stairs to go into my upstair bedroom. I saw out the window a bright light going off and on. It was over other homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it began to get closer this light or beam shining down on the ground. It continue to beam in a downward postion on and off.  As if it was in a searching moded.  I was very frighten by this light so I began to start to go upstair to tell my husband.  Than all the sudden, I felt two soft touch on both side of my waist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I woke up the next morning.  In a sitting position on my downstair couch.  I had no knowledge how I got there or I never remember going to the couch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day, I lost time.  I dont have any marks or burn on my body.  But, I know what I saw.  I also know that I cannot account for the rest of the night.  I would never have fell asleep on the couch in that postion.  I would have just went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone in ohio had a similar experience like this. I would love to hear from you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope your guys dont think am crazy.  But this really happen to me.  I wanted to report it because I never knew that this web site even existed.  Am glad that I have some place to tell my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n>
