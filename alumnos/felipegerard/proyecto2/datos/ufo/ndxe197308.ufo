There would have been at 30 or mor people there between various relatives and neighbors. I was off in the corner of the yard talking with my younger brother and one of my male cousins when I had this eerie feeling come over me. I looked around and didn&#39;t see anything, then I looked up and directly over my brother cousin and I was this flying saucer that looked just like the one on the tv show &#34;Lost In Space&#34;. I said to everyone there &#34;hey look everyone there&#39;s a flying saucer over us&#34;. Nobody seemed to care. They just went on socializing. Nobody panicked. I kept talking with my cousin and my brother in the corner of the yard constantly looking up to see what the craft was doing and seeing if it was still over us. I was facinated by this craft. While watching it it almost looked like a window opened up just like the way the window would open up on the tv show. It looked like the window glided from right to left. It continued hovering over us for quite a while. I have to admit that I was starting to get a little nervous. Then my mom an aunt and a neighbor decided to walk back home by going around the block so I decided to go with them. The saucer started to follow us. It stayed with my mom my aunt my neighbor and I till we got to our house 5 minutes away from the party. I went in my house and came out the back door to see if it was still there. It was . Hovering right over our house. So I went back in the house and came out the front door and looked to see if it was still there and it was. So I said to my mom and aunt that its still here. They still didn&#39;t care. I went in and out of my house about 4 times like this when the last time I came out in the back yard it took oo straight up in the air at the speed of light without making a sound. I remember asking my brother and cousin if they remembered seeing the saucer and they both said no. I asked my mom also years later if she remembered seeing the saucer and she also said no. ! I also saw a space craft that looked just like the &#34;Us Eneterprise&#34;. I was 15 years old and it was prabably the end of January early February. The temperature was about minus 10 to minus 20 below farenheight. I was delivering my papers as I had a paper route at night that started about 16:00 to 18:00. It was a real clear night. There was a full moon out as well as stars in all direction. I was probably 2/3s done of my route when I started up the highway out of South Lancaster heading west to do the 5 houses out that way. I remembered getting this weird feeling that something wasn&#39;t right. I couldn&#39;t put my finger on it at the time. Then I realized that I wasn&#39;t hearing any traffic. The traffic on the 401 carries quite far on a clear crisp night. As I started to cross the stell frame bridge over the Raisin River I kept looking all around me. Something wasn&#39;t right. Ilooked up into the sky and didn&#39;t see anything. I looked up and down the road. I looked to the north and didn&#39;t see anything. Then I looked south and seeming to be just above the tree tops gliding silently and on the edge of the St lawrence River is this huge crimsom red space ship exactly like the &#34;Us Enterprise&#34;. Now I have to say that I was trying to convince myself that I really wasn&#39;t seeing it but there it was bigger than a jumbo jet. I tried to get my papers delivered quickly to try and follow it but it was soon out of my sight. When I couldn&#39;t see it anymore the sounds of the traffic could be heard. Cars came up and down the road. Prior that incident there wasn&#39;t a car to be found other than the ones on the 401 to the north of me. Again I told my parents but like I suspected the usual reaction was your seeing things. I said yes I saw a huge space ship just like the &#34;Us Enterprise&#34;. I mean right down to the two potoons and huge light in the middle of the ship. I mean this was the spittin image only it was red. I was absolutly in awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to have her cousin, and perhaps others, submit reports, as well.  PD))<n>

My ex-husband came running inside where we had performed and were breaking up the set.  He yelled that there were 3 ufo&#39;s outside to run out.  I did and although they had been very close to the ground at the time he had seen then first...he said you could almost see in the windows!  Unfortunately,  when I got outside they were about the distance up in the air of an airplane.  The were very erratic in that they would zoom  very, very fast  and then hover.  There were lights around the crafts and the colors turned red, green and yellow.  I have never reported this but it is something one never forgets!  Because it was a gated community there were two security guards, several people walking around the area and those of us that were in the building doing and viewing the show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

An upright cone shaped, triangular craft was heard, with a very loud rocket type sound. It was heard by 1 child in a home, and viewed by 2 children playing outside.  The children stated it was &#34;Apollo&#34; coming down over the house.  The cone shaped craft was dented and had lights, it also had 3 landing legs with pods on the bottom.  The craft was descending over a home.  The sound emitted was very loud, and similar to a rocket engine blast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other child came outside, but the craft rose quickly and was only a small speck that disappeared in the clouds.  The craft was descibed as metalic with multi-colored lights along its cone shaped length.  There was no smell of rocket fuel or exhaust, and there was no alteration to the structure of the roof or vegetation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident took place in Poland Township, Ohio, which is 65 miles from NASA Cleveland and appx 4-5 hrs from Dayton, Wright Patterson AFB.  No visible smoke was left as the craft departed upwards into the clouds in a Southern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We noticed, hovering over the tree filled field across Highway 62 what looked like a long flat array of lights. They were flashing in a sequence: green, red, green, red, blue, green, red, white then they would sequence again. I couldn&#39;t tell if there were any windows or exactly what shape it was, it was high up, maybe 300 yards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it started moving slowly toward our house. It stopped directly overhead and seemed to lower quite a bit, maybe half the distance it had been was instantly..gone. It was now hovering about 150 yards over our house, and from the bottom we could see that it was round,still flashing the same light sequence and not making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it started moving again, toward the fields behind the backyard. It continued on, and dropped again over cow pond 1.  It hovered there a moment and continued on. It went past field 2 and dropped over cow pond 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> LAYOUT OF THE AREA:  Tree fied-two lane highway-our front yard-house-backyard-dog run-field1-cow pond 1-field 2-cow pond 2-field 3  My parents wouldn&#39;t let me or my niece go back there to follow it after dark, but the next morning at 06:30, we fed the dog and took him with us to check it out. Field 1 was completely normal, as was cow pond 1.  We wore our knee waders because the mud around the ponds was thick and pretty deep if you got within 3 feet of the water.  It was also, as usual, surrounded by frogs. It took us a while to get the dog out of the water and the mud, but we continued on.  Field 2 had strips of dry, flattened grass in it starting about halfway through it, but none of the strips connected.  At the edge of field 2 for about 5 to 10 feet, the grass was all flat and dry.  The dog wouldn&#39;t go anywhere near the flat grass or the pond that abutted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pond 2 was WEIRD.  The usual mud around the water still held the impressions of the cows that had last drank from the pond. The deep holes where they had pulled their legs out of the mud were completely dry. The mud had dried and cracked...it crumbled easily in our fingers when we picked it up, but on the ground it was solit and hard....sll the way to the water&#39;s edge which was down from about a diameter of about 40 feet to only about 10 feet. We circled the water three or four times, but as far as we could see there were no frogs or even bugs in, on or near cow pond two. We tossed chunks of the dirt into the water to try to stir anything, but nothing was there.  Less than a week before, the pond had been full of frogs and bugs and even crayfish. The only thing we got on our waders was dust. We went into field 3, but once we were past the 5-10 feet of flat, dry grass there were bugs and normal field flora and fauna...no frogs though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We returned home, dragging the german shepherd away from cow pond 1 again.  We told my parents what we had found. I wanted to report it, but my father wouldn&#39;t let me...I think partly because we were new in the area and partly for fear of ridicule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thgank you for letting me tell my story after all these years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

He pointed out three white points of light that did look like stars but slightly larger and they were in a triangle formation close together that appeared to be in a higher orbit than a regular 747 passenger jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to observe those three points of lights for about five minutes when suddenly, one of those crafts sped off with a streak behind it and disappeared in a second leaving the other two behind. Then two seconds later the second craft sped off in the same manner as the first into a completely different direction leaving the last one behind.  And two seconds later the last craft sped off in the same manner as the first two crafts into a completely different direction, and no sound whatsoever could be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

8/15/73 21:30|Hudson|KS|Triangle|20 minute's|Three redish\orange arrowhead shape craft.|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38177.html|7|ndxe197308| Three redish\orange arrowhead shape craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the summer of 1972-1973, I don&#39;t remeber for shure, I was 12 to 13 year&#39;s old that year and was living in the small town of Hudson, Ks. School had just started about a month ago, it was a Sunday evening sometime between 9 to 10 pm. Three freind&#39;s and myself where playing on some large sandpile&#39;s that the county had put beside the highway on the southeast corner of town getting ready to oil the blacktop. The four of us where trying to enjoy the last few minute&#39;s of our weekend before having to go back to school the next day, by playing a game of war by throwing small dirt clod&#39;s at eachother as we ran around and over the sandpile hiding and trying to get into a good position to throw a clod at someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was somewhere on the south end of the pile&#39;s, ((name #1 deleted)) and ((name #2)) where on the west side and ((name #3 deleted)) was on the east. We where all having a good time when suddenly Kyle stood up and pointed to the west and said what is that, (and got hit by sevral clod&#39;s) I stopped and looked to the west and noticed two redish\orange light&#39;s in the sky. Ed and Randy looked too and we all ran over the sandpile to the east side where Kyle was and all got down on our stomach&#39;s where we could just see over the top and watched the light&#39;s come closer. After a minute or two we got up and moved to the south side of the pile&#39;s and stood next to the highway to where we could get a better view of what we where seeing. As they came closer the two light&#39;s that we where watching took shape. The redish\orange round light&#39;s turned as they came closer to us a kind of arrowhead shape, but with rounded end instead of coming to a sharp point&#39;s. The closest shape I&#39;ve seen to the shape of these thing&#39;s are the shape of the starfleet insigna pin&#39;s on the uniform&#39;s of the crew of the old Star Trek tv show. As we where watching the two craft come closer Kyle again spotted another craft that was coming behind the other two and a little lower. It was quite clear by now that these where not just light&#39;s but some type of craft. All three craft where travling from west to east in a straight line and maybe some 500 or 600 feet up by my best guess. Just to the north are two big grain elevator&#39;s and flour mill where  Hudson Cream Flour is made  and our town is known for stand. And I would say that if these craft where traveling in line with the elevator&#39;s they would of had to move up in altitude or fly around them they where that low. The first craft was traveling in a line that would take it on a path some hundred feet north of us, the second craft was right behind and to the south of the first and the third craft was about a quarter mile behind the first two and maybe a hunderd feet lower but in line with the first two. As the first two got close to the w! estern edge of town the third craft that was behind the first two sped up and caught up to the first two to where it was some fifty feet and right in line behind the first one. As I said they where arrowhead shaped and a redish\orange in color, and they pulsated bright and then dimmer slowly, and you could see that the shape of them seemed to be a solid redish\orange but made of light, then extending outward&#39;s was a lighter dimmer corona of light ray&#39;s coming out from the more soild core. You could&#39;nt see a edge  or the hull of what would be a solid body to the craft, just light as if the where made of light only. There where no door&#39;s window&#39;s or seam&#39;s to the shape, nothing that you could see that would help you in being able to say what was the front back top bottom of them other than there overall shape and the direction of there flight, with the point narrow end pointed to the east in the direction of travel. The craft where some onehunderd feet long, fifty feet wide at the widest and some twentyfive feet tall, from my best guess. As they pasted over there was no sound at all from them, but you could kind of feel the pulsing in the center of your chest as they grew brighter and then dimmed. As the craft passed the last one being the lowest was so close that I could of thrown a dirtclod and hit it if I would of thought to. The night of the sighting was a calm clear summer eaving, the sun was just a dim  glow on the western horizon, the star&#39;s where out and no cloud&#39;s or wind at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the craft where first sighted by Kyle the first two where about a mile west of town and some twohunderd feet north of the highway that run&#39;s west\east threw the south end of town. After they passed over head we watched them travle east of town some two and a half to three mile&#39;s. The total lenght of time of the sighting was about twenty minute&#39;s or so. They flew very slowly, from watching plane&#39;s mainly crop duster&#39;s that flew over the feild&#39;s when I was a kid and later in life seeing hot air ballon&#39;s fly, I now know that I have never seen any type of craft that fly&#39;s move so slowly. Not plane&#39;s, hotair balloon&#39;s, or even toy ballon&#39;s move this slowly, maybe a helicopter in a slow foward hover could but not without making a lot of noise and generating a lot of wind. And when the craft got to the far east of there flight path they all three at the same time kind of turned there nose&#39;s northward and uppward to the northeast very slowly and just took off at a very hi rate of speed to where they just where gone in less than a second in a streak of light. And one strange thing about the way they moved as they made there turn, they did&#39;nt make a banking turn like a plane would dipping one wing and moving in a arc changing there direction of travel and position together to make the turn. These craft moved from some center point moving there nose&#39;s to the north and uppward to the northeast, but there direction of travel continued straight eastward it was most strange and unlike any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen make a turn while in flight. And just when the nose of the craft finnished the move to the northeast to change corse for a new direction of flight they just accelerated very fast in a streak of light until in less than a second they where lost in the star&#39;s in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all stood there for less than a minute and without saying anything to eachother just turned and went to our home&#39;s. The next day after school we all came together and walked with eachother not talking for a short time when Kyle said what was it we saw last night, and I remeber Ed replying, they said we wasn&#39;t suppost to talk about it. And we all seperated and went our own way to go home. And we never talked about it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not until year&#39;s later when I was in my early twenty&#39;s that I even remebered or thought about this sighting until after I reading a book on ufo&#39;s for something differnt to read. Before reading the book I never had any intrest in ufo&#39;s or anything that was outside the norm? And now year&#39;s later I wonder about what we saw that night and I wander even more about who Ed was talking about when he said they said that we wasn&#39;t suppost to talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this in this statement is the truth as best I am able to rember. And I belive that it was a real event that I shared with three freind&#39;s in a small Kansas town one summer eaving. What was it we saw and who they where that  Ed eluded to I have no ideal. But after much reading on the subject of ufo&#39;s and alien&#39;s and remebering other sighting&#39;s and thing&#39;s that happened to us a kid&#39;s I can&#39;t  help but to think that maybe they are here and sometime&#39;s visit small town&#39;s in Kansas for whatever reason..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

At the largest, it was about the size of my thumbnail at arm&#39;s length in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it until it went toward the eastern side of the lake where there was a full moon on the rise just over the tree tops.

Hovering above the golf course 200-250 feet west of our house was a HUGE disk shaped object.  It was actually shaped exactly like a car tire with no center hole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was dusk what we were watching was actually the black silhouette outlined in the brighter evening sky, rather than seeing the clear surface of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object spun slowly and moved back and forth in a straight line while traversing in a searching manner away from us.  It had already passed over our house and was moving away westward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched it became apparent there were round port holes all around it every 4-5 feet or so.  They appeared to be about 12-14 inches in diameter.  It seemed like every other one was red or yellowish-white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about 60 feet in diameter and about 6 feet thick and rotating slowly as it slowly came back east toward our back yard. Its height was no more than 120-140 feet off the ground (perhaps as low as 100 feet).  I remember thinking I could hit it with a rock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not wobble on its axis as a balloon might but was perfectly controlled like a wheel spinning on an axle.  It moved very slowly (perhaps 5 mph) and came right up to the SW corner of our yard where it paused (about 60 feet away and 100 feet high) before it slowly started reversing direction to head back across the golf course toward the south side of Green Acres Terrace Circle which was directly west across the golf course from our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it got over to the circle on Green Acres Terrace it reversed again and came back toward us but only came back until it was about 100 yards away this time.  When it reversed this time it went farther away and then came back toward us again but did not get as close as the previous time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my father, &#34;Dad, what is that?&#34; He said, &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; I knew what it was; a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my brother to go inside and get my Polaroid camera. He said, &#34;YOU go get it!&#34;  The object seemed to be almost swinging back and forth as it moved in a kind of searching pattern back and forth across the golf course moving further away with each pass until it was gone within 15-20 minutes.  It was rotating slowly the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/15/73 19:00|Phillipsburg|NJ|Disk|approx. 15 min.|unreported object hovered over river for approx. 15 min. and no one talks about it, no reports in the newspapers|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26913.html|10|ndxe197308| unreported object hovered over river for approx. 15 min. and no one talks about it, no reports in the newspapers<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been at a gas station when all of a sudden everything went dark, the gas pumps stopped working, and everyone in that area seemed to be drawn to the Delaware River bridge that separated N.J. from Pa. All the motorists on the bridge were out of their cars staring at this large round object hovering over the river between this free bridge and the toll bridge which are approx. 2 blocks apart.The engines of the cars seemed to have stopped running. This object seemed to have been gaining energy from the water, as the longer it hovered there just above the water, the more intense the lights were that seemed to surround it. I do not remember anyone saying anything or talking as we all were staring at this unknown item. I noticed that the traffic had stopped on the toll bridge as well, the motorists had exited their cars and were standing along the railing there trying to absorb what they were seeing. It&#39;s as though time had stood still, I am assuming that we were there for at least 15 minutes, when all of a sudden the lights grew very bright and it was gone, poof, raised itself right out from between the bridges and was gone. Afterward, I was like in a trance as I do believe the rest of the witnesses were, I don&#39;t remember anyone saying anything, just everyone getting into their cars and leaving as though nothing had happened. The gas jockey asked me what I thought it was, and I told him I was afraid to answer. I was 18 years old at the time and normally would have met friends, however, I drove straight home and told my mother what it was that I saw and how the people around me looked and acted like zombies, myself included, like I said, we were drawn to the rail of the bridge to just watch. There was never anything mentioned in the newspaper about this sighting, but I recently was talking about it to a fellow employee and she remembered driving down the highway that same time and year when she saw something strange ahead of her in the sky. She said it looked at first as though it were a cloud, but it mo! ved too fast and was gone in an instant. I cannot believe that no one else has reported this sighting, especially since there were so many people standing on the bridges staring at this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was working in my office around midnight and heard what I thought was a huge storm approaching.  Thunder, lightning, wind - - yet when I looked out all was quiet and the stars and moon visible.  I am usually terrified of thunderstorms, yet when this came near I felt a sort of excitement.  I went into the yard and the sky was totally black above me (as it had been in an earlier experience at noon some months before.  I stood in the yard with this blackness above and lightning flashing to earth in a circle around me.  The wind was terrific winding my cafton about me like the streamers on a maypole.  The sound was deafening, a steady roar.  The thought in my mind was of a movie I had seen years before where a mother had drawn a circle upon the floor and sat, with her son, huddled within it while something like this was happening.  I thought about drawing a circle in the grass, but did not.  I felt amazement at my feeling of joy when by all rights I should be scared out of my wits.  I stood there and raised my arms.  The next morning I awoke on the daybed in my office.   At breakfast I casually said to my husband &#34;That was some storm we had last night, was it not&#34;  He said that he had not heard anything. I was leaving for the week so did not ask anyone else about the storm. The following week when I returned home my husband wanted to talk about the storm, but I felt a strong need to deny that it happened.  He said that when he went over to town (2 miles away)that the people were asking him what had been going on at our home in the night.  That the whole town was shaking and people were rushing outside and from their location they could look across at our home where something huge was over our house.  (We are located on the second ridge with a deep valley between giving visibility.)   He also said that our neighbor up the hill from us had come wanting to know what had been happening.  She said that in the night their house had lifted from its foundation and shook like it was falling apart.  The children were all screaming over the roaring sound and the family fled outdoors convinced that the world was coming to an end.  It was an old rural area with but few houses.  For Sale signs went up quite promptly and the people moved away.  The bulldozers came in scraping off the signs of habitation and a new subdivision began.  I have often wished I could relocate some of these people to get a description of what they saw over our house from a distance.  In neither case did I see anything. In the earlier case at noon on a bright sunny day it suddenly became eerily dark with the wind and roaring.  That lasted about four seconds before everything clicked back to normal again.  The night experience was similar in that the moon and stars disappeared while the noise and wind continued.  I do not know how long that lasted.  My viewing of it was probably as long as a minute and a half.  That was the length of my memory or the happening.  Obviously to arouse a town of people plus my neighbors and get them out of their home in the middle of the night it must have lasted somewhat longer.<n>

Then a smaller UFO came slowly up to the bigger one,the light suddenly disconnected from the electric station and connected straight to the smaller craft. it seems to me perhaps the bigger one was was some how storing the the electric and using perhaps a laser beam to charge the smaller one.<n>

We were traveling west toward Regina, probably on Canada 1.  (Reason for vagueness noted below.) It was at night -- very dark.  I saw an illuminated cylindrical-shaped object -- the illumination was yellow in color.  There was a red light -- like a cherry -- but I forget if it was on top or on the bottom.  There seemed to be some rotation. The object was north of the highway and paralleled us for several minutes.  It was at a distance.  I forget how it disappeared.  There is no recollection of any missing time or any thing like that. I was in high school at the time.  I did not think I was seeing a UFO at the time.  It was August 1973, and I thought I was seeing Skylab.  (I couldn&#39;t explain why Skylab would seem to be paralleling our course, but I thought it might be an effect of the northern atmosphere.)  I no longer think this is the case -- I now doubt such details on Skylab would not be visible from the ground -- and I am certain I was not seeing northern lights.  I suppose it could have been an airport control tower at some distance, but only someone living in the area could tell me that. My recollection is a bit hazy on some details because I was in high school at the time and made not attempt to record any details because, as I mentioned, I did not think it significant at the time.  There were several of us traveling together in a van -- I know a few of us in the back discussed it while it was present in the sky, but I don&#39;t know how many people actually saw it.  I have since reconsidered my point of view and since the sighting was so vivid think it is worthing noting in your historical database.  For no reason other than curiosity would be interested in knowing if anyone else had a similar observation at that time and place; however, given how long ago this sighting was I doubt if I can supply any additional information.<n>

This thing was very large, at least a city block long from tip to tip and had dim white lights all around the edges. The color was gray/black and it blocked out the stars above as it passed over us at approximately tree top level and very slowly. There was no sound, nor was there any wind disturbance of any kind.  We kept asking each other &#34;do you see that???&#34; and I even pinched myself to make the point of conciousness on my part clear to myself. We did not notice it until it was almost directly above us as we sat in my &#39;63 chev convertable with the top down (facing north) and we watched as it slowly made its way west and disappeared into the distance. The strangest part I thought was the fact that none of us were frightened by this unusual event. This was in a place that we called &#34;space country&#34; because there was not much of anything but space out there in the early 70&#39;s. Dirt roads and wheat and corn fields with nobody out there but us usually. We would go out late at night and hotrod our cars along the dirt roads. The area is what is now Aurora, CO. Back then it was approximately 15 minutes east of the old Stapleton International Airport via I-70. Later, a few weeks? we were out there again and it was day time and we noticed a few radar domes nearby where the sighting took place and speculated that the craft was spying on the installation which we found out was Buckley Air National Guard Base rumoured to be a testing ground for experimental aircraft. The craft we saw as related here, in my opinion, was not made by humans. It far surpassed any of the stealth type aircraft that I have seen currently deployed by our USAF. It is something I will never forget and would have reported before but, did not know that there was anyplace TO report it until finding your website tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was 8 years old and watching Sonny and Cher on TV.  So, if researched, this could reveal more exactly the time of night and potential day of week. It was hot, so it was summer time, and I am guessing it was August.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in Victory Lakes, NJ, and the area was very woodsy, so no city lights or other homes nearby.   There was a lake across the street from the house.  My grandma first noticed an odd light outside and I followed her outside to the patio to see what she was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a VERY bright, whitish, oval shaped (on it’s side) light that was hovering in the sky, above the lake across the street.  It was somewhat high in the sky (a little above line of sight), and from where we were, if I put my fingers out in front of me to measure it, it looked as if it were about four inches across (so, about 1/5-1/8 the size of the moon?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object just hovered there. There was no sound from the object.  It then moved very slowly to the left, and stopped.  Then it moved slowly to the right, and stopped.  Then it came back to the “center” basically where we first saw it hover, and it paused again.  Suddenly, it literally shot upwards so fast that it disappeared.  That was the last we saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another interesting thing, but something I can’t confirm, is the next morning, my grandma was showing my parents a front page(?) story in the newspaper that a farmer in New Jersey claimed that a UFO landed on his property the same night we saw the UFO.  If I can recall properly, I seem to remember a photo of a farmer and in the background there was a big, round, burned out area where he claimed the UFO landed and that he had some type of encounter with aliens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I believe it was July or August.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening after the training day I and two or three other members of my crew were sitting on the bench outside of the firehouse just relaxing and shooting the breeze.  The bench faced west and we could see the hills of Heidelberg in the distance.  It wasn’t quite dusk yet but the sun was low enough that it didn’t affect our vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just across the street from our location was the installation post office, a low, flat, one-story with two large oak trees planted in front on either side of the entrance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So as I said, we were sitting on the bench gazing off to the west towards Heidelberg when I noticed an aircraft traveling north to south at an unusually high rate of speed.  To quantify that, what it looked like was a large aircraft with its landing lights on as it makes its final approach from about ten miles out.  The luminosity was enough to attract my attention but we could only distinguish the light.  And as it was traveling north to south we could tell that it was traveling much faster than any aircraft we had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were watching this &#34;light&#34; in amazement as it seared across the sky wondering what it could be.  Our view of it was obscured for a few seconds as it passed behind the foliage of the oak tree on the left.  It reappeared, and as it was halfway between the two trees it made a 90-degree turn straight up and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I heard on the TV news a few years ago that others saw it too, but they reported it, and the local newspaper printed a story about it, only I never reported my sighting nor did I see the story in the paper. But that story is in the news archives here. After all those years, I found out others DID see it. Are there any others on this site that saw what I am about to tell? If they did, they will know the city where it occured, and you can tell me by e-mail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a warm summer night in August (somewhere between the 3rd and 6th) 1973, when my 4 children and I were out in our yard watching the stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was so unusually clear. Soon two very perfect cumulus clouds moved into our view above us. Really perfect clouds, like a Disney drawing. There were many other clouds far away on the horizon. But these clouds were seperated by ample spaces of black, star splattered sky, and were very close to us. As we were observing this beautiful sight, a huge, perfectly round very huge sphere started slowly inching its way out of the top side of the cloud on our left. It had a green glow to it like a radium numbered watch. I thought it was the moon until my oldest child pointed out that the moon was to the west, and as I remember it was not a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before long there was lightening in those clouds. But it never went to the ground. After a while the lightening started going back and forth between those two clouds, across the star splattered space between the clouds, and all the while that sphere was slipping out of that cloud till it was almost completely out. Glowing steadly, not a flicker but that steady greenish glow. I thought it might be a weather balloon untill that very active lightening that was dancing from cloud to cloud, struck the sphere and red sparks flew out in all directions at the piont of contact. Then the sphere started retreating back into the cloud where it came from, and it took as much time to retreat as it took to emerge before; till it disappeared back into that cloud completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this took about 35 to 40 minutes to happen. But the strangest thing I can remember is that those clouds stopped moving in the sky untill the whole episode played out. Then the clouds moved on. I told my brother, who was in the Air Force at the time, and he made such fun of me, I never talked about it again. Have you ever heard of any sightings like this before? Will you e-mail me an answer? What did we see? My e-mail address: ((e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in August 1973 is approximate.  PD))<n>

We stop the car and stand there looking at a very large craft (maybe the length of 10 or 12 cars end to end). The color is flat gray. There are two spotlights on the underside of the craft toward the front. They are sweeping the ground back and forth with light. We see one porthole like window toward the front of the craft. From our vantage point on the ground we see nothing but bland ceiling. There is a light on inside the craft (the window is illuminated). In our youthful excitement the three of us start running through the underbrush to get under the craft. The fourth is in the car screaming.  Before we make it the craft vanishes.  There was no sound, no wind.  Just gone. No one believed us.

Don&#39;t know why theres not more about on this site it was a fantastic amount of sightings ,1000&#39;s ,daylight,underwater,ebes  sighted,.Anyway,we pulled over,walked to a lady and her husband asked what was going on ? &#34;LOOK&#34;!! We could see it thru the trees at a 45degree angle less than half a city block (1000 ft.) away,maybe 400 ft. off the ground . It glowed a beautiful yellow,gold giving off an aura the same color.It was an oval shape as we saw it from our position but I&#39;m sure we were looking at it from a side angle.It &#34;bobbed&#34; in the air like a paper plate would on water and just hung in the sky.To this day I&#34;m sure it was &#34;showing off&#34;. After 45 minutes it simply started moving away at the same angle till it was completely out of sight . Not very fast,just as if it was giving us plenty of viewing time.As we stood there I did a rough head count , at least 50,maybe 60 witnesses .I&#39;ve never heard any thing more of this specific sighting,would love to hear more on this site.<n>

Maybe 10 secs later I saw it again when bright balls appeared to float off of the UFO and down behind trees in a densely populated area of the city. It was moving too slow to be an airplane and WAS NOT A HEPICOPTER.  I am curious if you had similar reports from that time and city. I have told noone<n>

We witnessed a VERY fast brilliant object moving across the sky behind the lights of Portsmouth, NH and head out to sea (the Atlantic). Within two or three minutes after the sighting, we witnessed a flight of four F-15&#39;s take off from Pease AFB on full AB. They proceeded in the same direction of the object. Thinking this was significant, we made a note in the topside log and notified Pease AFB operations that we could confirm the sighting. The next morning the ship&#39;s XO called us in and told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to play games with the Air Force and were then ordered to ammend our logbook entry. We were used to seeing F-15&#39;s take off from Pease during day and night. The object was many times faster than an F-15. It also did not in any way fit the profile of an F-15&#39;s afterburners. All we saw was a point of light moving very fast out to sea. This incident has remained a question in my mind because of the reverberations it caused in the Navy and Air Force chains of command.<n>

Exiting my friends house in Morrow, GA this clear evening, (full moon).  We stood on the edge of her yard, I leaning against the car, preparing to go home near midnight, she facing me with back to house.  I happen to glance up and noticed this object hovering directly behind her house at tree top level.  It made no noise nor did it move initially.  I pointed it out to my air-head friend who glanced at it over her shoulder then remarked that it was probably a helicopter.  She kept gabbing thus I basically ignore it momentarily.  I remarked that if it were a helicopter then it wasn&#39;t making any noise.   She looked again, waved her arm and continued gabbling.  I kept glancing up at it over 4-5 mins time.  The next to the last time I looked up, it begin to very slowly rotate on its side.  As it did, I saw the rows of lights.  They did not appear to blink but remained on.  I told her to look again.  She commented, &#34;I don&#39;t know what it is and I don&#39;t care!&#34;  The next time I looked up it was gone!  Again, I asked her to look and explain what could have happened to it.  She gave no answer nor was she really interested.I would like to know if any other reports have been submitted regarding sightings in this area.  I recall reading an article in the Atlanta Journal during the 1970-73 time frame about ufo sightings in the state of GA.  Can you shed some light on this.  In my reading is seems like most sightings are not of triangular shapes.  Thank you for your help.  I will submit a drawing via mail.<n>

I never mentioned this to anyone then but at the time of the sighting I as an amateur/semi pro photogrpaher was just coming home with my camera, telephoto and tripod and took a roll of transparancy photos. The object was high in the sky, there were no clouds and the day was perfecly clear. The object was white and bright against the daylight sky, I don&#39;t know if it was illuminated or it was a reflection from the ocean&#39;s light. The air force did send a plane to look at this object as I saw the plane, the object was larger than the plane, the airforce denied sending a plane as I Recall, this was a long time ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in August 1973 is approximate.
