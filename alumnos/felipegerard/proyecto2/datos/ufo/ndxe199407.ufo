I quickly told my grand-dad to take a look but he said it must of been a plane (by this time it was behind the clouds). Now I’m 14 and i found out about the Belgium Flap. I specifically remember the Triangle shape and Ukraine is VERY close to Belgium.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I remember seeing 2 of the brightest lights on this object that seemed like huge headlights.  This object came straight toward my yard and made a pivot turn in the sky and headed toward downtown cumberland.  I remember the two bright headlights, many other lights and a bright blue strobing light that i think was ontop of the object.  I ran up my alley called bond st. following this object.  My children drew pictures that resembled airplanes with many lights on the bottom.  Their friend Ashley drew a pic of an oval object with 2 headlights with somekind of rope thing hanging off the backend of it.  I remember the sound of this thing reminded me of a jet engine but was not loud at all and if you were up the street you probably couldn&#39;t have heard it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stopped for a moment on Spencer Hill Road to drink some soda, eat some snacks, and listen to music on his car stereo. He had a Honda Civic with a sunroof and I took a minute to look up at the sky which was clear with only a few clouds. I noticed a set of 3 lights in a triangle pattern hovering about a half mile or so above his car. The lights were plain white lights which did not blink. The object emitted no sound at all. I guessed its size to be no larger than 200 feet but admittedly it is hard to gauge size at night with no reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my friend to look up and he saw the lights too. We thought it was maybe an airplane but it was not moving and was too quiet. It also was too big to be a helicopter and we would have heard it if it was. We even turned the car off and turned the music off to confirm it made no noise. We got creeped out by the situation and decided to drive down the road. As we started driving the object began to follow the direction of the car. I could now clearly see that it was an opaque equilateral triangular object and the stars within the triangle were obscured. We drove faster and faster and the object continued to follow in the direction of the car. We finally got to the outskirts of the city of Corning and the late night fog began to obscure the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were fully into the city we drove to my apartment. My friend was spooked out as well so he drove home. I was so terrified that I could not sleep and I kept looking up at the sky. Later that night there was a loud thunderstorm. We were scared by the encounter and we told a few friends who believed us. We spent the next week or so driving around late at night seeing if it would come back but it never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weeks later my girlfriend at the time(who I am now married to) says that there were military helicopters flying low over the city as if they were looking for something. I never told her about the UFO sighting until after she told me about the helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ----------------- Please do not include this final part of my message if you put this report on your website: I have grown up around aircraft and helicopters since I was young. I am now an Aviation Structural Mechanic for the U.S. Navy. I have seen literally thousands of foreign and domestic military and civilian aircraft at day and during night. I have seen military aircraft at night with just formation lights on. I have seen confidential and secret aircraft operating at night as well. I have also worked at several military installations in the desert. I can say that the object which my friend and I saw late that night was no military or civilian aircraft. I wrote down my experience a long time ago but never reported it until this day. This message I am writing now is basically a transcription of what I wrote a long time ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I told a friend about this sighting he said that there were triangle UFOs seen in Belgium. I looked up a photo of one of these UFOs and the one we saw is similar. The only difference is that the UFO we saw did not have a triangle in the middle. It only had triangle lights near the points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this UFO sighting for historical purposes. I hold a security clearance with the military and I do not want to have my name connected to anything which could hurt my clearance. I believe in UFOs and I believe that the job you are doing is worthy of merit. I do not have any other UFO sightings to report except this one. I am sorry it is not sensational, but I assure you it is truthful. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We turned down a road that reconnected with the river, leading into town. We were on a rise, overlooking the trees lining the river. We both noticed a strong light glowing from below the tree line. (near the river) Moving quickly down to the river, we saw a cigar shaped craft hovering just above the river, about 5-6 feet, without disturbing the water&#39;s surface in any way we could see, despite a strong shaking in the trees. The both of us froze-then blacked out. The next thing we remembered, we were walking back into town along the same road. The entire events of the past few moments-gone from our heads, not to be remembered until some 3 years later.<n>

I was in the living room when they returned to the house.  Both children came into the living room with a look of total “terror”.  My daughter ran down the hall to her bedroom and the boyfriend left immediately.  I ran to my daughter who was sobbing and saying, “it was so awful”.  After calming her for a few minutes, I asked what had scared her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She related she and her boyfriend were waiting for their ride after the movie and went for a walk near the lake.  There was another couple with them who had gone ahead and were sitting on a dock nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, she said, she “felt” something next to her and looked to see a very small object which was “flying” next to them.  She said it startled them and the object immediately flew from their sides and became very large, hovering, silently barely above the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said it had blue lights which were above it.  She said the total silence and speed of the object’s departure had terrified her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had her make a drawing to the best of her recollection about the object she saw.  She made several drawings, and she finally settled on a drawing that looked similar to a butterfly, basically two triangles with a central area much like a cigar.  I phoned a UFO center that evening and was told there had been many sightings that particular night from the Moses Lake area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few weeks later, there was a tv program about UFO sightings and one of the pictures looked almost identical to my daughter’s drawing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

My friend and I were swimming in my  parents pool at 10:30pm on a very warm July night . We had been swimming for about an hour.  I looked up and saw a large triangle craft fly aprox 3000 feet above us. It was very large in size 300 feet across. It has 5 rings on the bottom that glowed yellow. It had to be going mach 3+. Made no sound and did maneuvers that an airplane can&#39;t do. It went from right to left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that it was one of our own craft. The craft know as the TR3B.

Pre-Apologies for missing some of the details below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Side note: I am an amateur astronomer, a licensed pilot, former military airborne, and former airline employee (currently a college professor).  I have lived and worked around aircraft (and the night sky) for decades. This was nothing like I&#39;ve ever seen.  Here is the story:   A regular summer outing for me and my family is to climb up into the mountains northeast of Los Angeles for some quality time together with nature and each other.  We were camping at our usual spot (Serrano campground on the north shore of Big Bear Lake) in the San Bernardino mountains of Southern California.  One reason I enjoy this site so much is the altitude and clear skies make for some exceptional sky-watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After turning in to our tents and sleeping bags one night, everything was quite, when in the middle of the night, about 2am, my two dogs started whimpering.  Thinking they just needed &#39;relief&#39;, I grudgingly opened my tent and walked out into a clearing with them.  The dogs did not do their usual sniffing around and marking every bush, but instead were acting kind of strange.  They both were standing perfectly still and looking up to the same point in the sky, near the eastern horizon.  I was puzzled at their behavior and when I followed their gaze up toward the east to try and see what they were staring at -all I saw was a beautiful star-filled sky (no moon).  I spent a moment or two enjoying the Milky Way and the stars wondering what had my dogs so captivated and was about to head back to the tent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quite suddenly and unexpectedly a dark, triangular shaped object appeared from the east-northeast horizon and travelled at incredible speed from roughly east-northeast to west-southwest. It made not even the slightest sound - absolutely silent - both as it was approaching and as it was receding. It had no lights of any sort, certainly none of the typical aircraft lights I&#39;m very accustomed to (navigation lights, anti-collision strobes, landing lights, etc.). This object was completely blacked-out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also distinctly remember that it seemed to be wrapped in some sort of shimmering envelope - kind of like the wavy, transparent mirage you see above hot pavement in the desert.  What I thought especially perplexing was that this wavy envelope not only completely surrounded the aircraft – but equidistant was even IN FRONT of the craft - something that seemed highly illogical to me (as opposed to say what one might expect to see with sound waves or disturbed air behind the craft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no contrail/vapor trail, exhaust, or any other trace of its passing.  I saw no burners or engine nacelles, no indication of a propulsion mechanism of any kind.  Truthfully -I&#39;m not even sure of its exact shape - I only say triangular because in the few seconds I saw it that was the only shape that I related with at the time.  That and the slight distortion made by the refractive envelope around the craft made it indistinct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I was already standing at about 7,000&#39; elevation, I estimate the craft was flying at an altitude of approximately 15,000&#39; –about a mile or so above me and perhaps a few miles diagonally north of my position.  It seemed to be about the size of a typical commercial/military aircraft (not especially large), though my visual judgment may be substantially in error in this regard –after all it was a dark object on a dark background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that was most amazing to me about the entire experience was the incredible speed this craft exhibited.  This object went in a straight line from horizon to horizon in just a few seconds.  Almost as fast as I can swing my head from one side to the other.  Unlike any aircraft I’ve ever seen (and I’ve seen many) this thing zipped across the sky at meteoric velocity.  Further, I was dumbstruck at the complete lack of sound.  No engine noise, no sonic boom, nothing.  Not the slightest sound of any kind.  And this was in the dead of the night –up in the mountains – on a very calm, quiet evening.  Even when out with my telescope (I regularly use a Meade ETX125 outdoors) or binoculars, I frequently see even very high-flying aircraft – which always leave a faint sound signature as they pass.  This craft was not very high at all and made not a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was UFO.  But I rapidly changed my mind and am fairly confident (though I have no way of confirming this) that this was in fact some type of experimental or &#39;black project&#39; craft.  My reasons for this are as follows:  The sprawling Edwards AFB which is only about 50 miles to the northwest of my position (and China Lake not much further – and Groom Lake in Nevada not all that much further northeast, among others) – are all now all but notorious for their experimental aircraft testing.  My proximity and viewing angle that evening put me in prime time/place for making a sighting of one of these aircraft if in fact that is what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also – having been in the aircraft industry for so long, I was already aware of some of the experimental aircraft discussed in the literature, etc.  Lockheed Martin’s “Skunk Works” and Boeing’s “Phantom Works” are all nearby – they have to test these craft somewhere.  When I did some research I thought that the closest possible craft looked similar to the TR3B and similar triangular-shaped vehicles speculated to be in testing both then and now.  I cannot make a close-enough identification, however, as the craft I saw was highly distorted, and traveling at much too high of a speed to get a very good look at it.   It is possible, I admit – that I may be entirely mistaken and saw something else entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any case, as I stood there in my underwear shaking and stunned (it was also a chilly evening!), my mind raced to compare what I saw to anything in my experience and, well, you&#39;ve heard the rest. No running or nav lights of any sort, pitch black, surrounded by a weird shimmering envelope, absolutely silent, and by far the fastest moving object I&#39;ve ever seen - I can&#39;t imagine anything moving that quickly from horizon to horizon - and I&#39;ve seen a lot of airplanes - from strike fighters to commercial and a few odd ones at e.g., the EAA, etc. This was definitely different, and certainly NOT following a whole bunch of the &#39;rules&#39; I was used to regarding aircraft operations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So me and my 2 German Shepherds went back to bed in the tent, and the next morning, still shaken, I (hesitatingly) relayed the encounter to a few folks. The response was a collection of strange looks, doubts, sighing-giggles, and a bunch of &#34;sure-whatever”.  As may be typical with such observers, I felt such unsympathetic, near-ridicule from my friends and family was all the motivation I needed to keep silent and never mention it again.  All I could think of was how transparent such experiences are in revealing what others may think –and I instantly understood why pilots and other professionals are advised to never report or mention anything about such anomalies they may encounter.  Like most of them, I suppose, I thus kept silent about it after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What changed my mind?  I was up at Serrano campground recently and recalled the incident.  I was fumbling with a little AM portable radio and stumbled upon Peter Davenport speaking on Coast-to-coast radio show.  It seemed just a coincidence, but Mr. Davenport was imploring listeners to file a written report, with lots of emphasis on making a clear, detailed, written report on the UFO Center website.  I thought, “OK, Mr. Davenport – you’ll get my report”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, my apologies in advance for waiting nearly twenty years to pass this on to someone/somewhere.  And, like most aviation and academic professionals, I must admit I am instantly nervous for doing so.  Yet, I figure that if all of us always kept silent, then the truth would never be discovered, and that such silence would be of greater detriment to all of us than my silence a potential benefit to me alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you and good luck to you and your organization…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a tree planter going from Prince George to Fort Nelson (the 1st time) in July 1994. The time was between 11:00pm-12:00am. There were only two of us  in a cube truck, I was the passenger. There were no other cars on the highway and it was a very clear night, when suddenly the interior of the truck light up with flickering fire light, we thought the trucks cube with all our supplies was on fire. The light source was on the passenger side (my side) just out of the corner of my eye, but when I looked the light was gone. We both saw the light, but didn&#39;t know where it came from. We were a little taken aback. Five minutes later the light came back on the same side as before, but it was much dimmer and again when we looked back in the mirrors the light disappeared, but it was the same flickering light and there was no other traffic on the road with us. We arrived at our destination and told others our story. It turned out that the same light flashed two others in a different car, the same night, but in their story it was much brighter and scared them so bad that they pulled over and camped the rest of the night. Three weeks later after the contract was finished the crew was going back to Prince George along the same road, this time I was sitting behind the driver, it was about the same time as before, but in a different truck and again there was no other traffic on the road and it was a very clear night. Suddenly I got a savear head acke, it was instant and painful, like someone was going into my head and trying to comunicate. I tried to hear, but failed. I was going to give up trying when I heard in the back of my head &#34;he still can&#39;t hear us&#34;, with that I tried again to comunicate, but again could not make the connection. After about 15 minutes of trying I gave up and looked out the window to my right, past two of my crew. They were looking and talking towards the inside of the truck, so they didn&#39;t see what I saw. It was as large as a big marbell and bright white with a tail shooting out the back. Between the body and the tail was a gap about an inch wide. The spray was emmitting from the body and looked to be bubbling (large bubbles close to the boby and smaller ones at the end of the spray).From the spray shoot the tail which looked to be about five feet long. All the spray and the tail were orangy yellow in colour. The truck was going about ninty kms and when I looked at it, it slowed right down and flew behind the truck. The window it was flying beside was open a crack and when it slowed down and went behind the truck the noise from the wind coming through the window dropped by half, and my headacke went away instantly. I didn&#39;t say anything to my crew, I think I was in mild shock. Love to have it happen again. Next time I will stop the truck.<n>

I decide to go out for a little walk to stretch my legs at about 21:30 (9:30pm). As I was walking west on the enterance road I happened to look up and saw a ball of light come out from behind a building to my right. This ball of light was a very bright white and was approximately 1 mile to the northwest of me about 300 feet in the air, possibly a little higher. The ball of light was traveling from the north to the south at a speed I would estimate at about 200-250 miles per hour. As the ball of light was approaching the centre city area, it all of a sudden did what I think to be a 90 degree turn and go straight up into the air for about 200-300 feet. This ball of light hovered for a second in one position and then came back down to its previous position and proceeded back off to the north towards Scranton, PA. By the time I got to where I can look to the north, the ball of light was gone and never saw it again. What I found very surprising is that the ball of light took the same track out that it came in on. There was no noise with this ball of light. It was just a ball of white light, no other colors in with it. There was no streak or trail behind it. I am not aware of anything in the world that can do such a perfect maneuver without some variation off of its track. I would estimate the size of this object to be like extending your arm and holding a little rubber super ball or a quarter in the air. I asked around to other people I was working with that night, if they saw anything but they said no. I know I was not seeing things. Some people say maybe your mind was playing tricks on you but I don&#39;t think that is it. Like I said, it was pretty early in the evening about 2130 hrs. There had to be other witnesses to this.<n>

My wife and I and my infant daughter and 4 year-old son were leaving the Aventura Mall in Aventura, Florida, and were loading our packages in the car, when I looked up to see three dark, pewter-colored egg-shaped craft in a tight triangular formation pass silently overhead at a fairly slow pace -- it took them a minute to pass from directly overhead to behind the mall structure which was about a football field away.  I wouls estimate that they were less than 1000 feet in the air -- they were definitely below the cloud layer (the sky was partly cloudy).  The objects were silent as they passed over, like I said, pewter colored, but clearly outlined.  There was some surface light reflected off of the objects.  I called my wife, who did see them, but didn&#39;t have much to say.  She got into the car with my kids, and I watched them for the duration (about two or so minutes).<n>

We didn&#39;t notice it arrive but while we watched another joined it slowly from the west. They hung together in the sky about 200 feet apart, for about a minute- then the one on the right zoomed off to the east at about 100mph- it hesitated after a short while and then dissapeared into the horizon. The other then moved off to the west again at a similar rate. All this took place in total silence. A helicopter or plane would have made some noise. There were no roads on the hillside behind the objects so it couldn&#39;t have been reflections from car headlights. The movement away of the objects seemed to coincide with how long they were stared at. ie when we looked at them they moved and they rested when we looked elsewhere. The best way to describe the objects was like two bright light bulbs in a pitch black room. These were definitely NOT stars. I would like to add that before this I was a sceptic. I am a fairly sane university graduate aged 27 (22 at the time) and no, we had not been drinking! I give this report after watching a UFO TV program that jogged my memory- then I looked at some website where someone described almost the same thing in Seskatchewan, Canada a month later. The image is an illustration, as clear as I remember it. Why can&#39;t we be clutching a camera at times like this?!<n>

It was covering our field and part of the two fields nearby.  It was immense in side and made almost no noise.  I should preface that we had other weird UFO sightings in Caldwell but this is the only one where I actually saw something during the day.  I don&#39;t know why but both me and my dog ran towards it.  I have a fear of UFOs so this is very bizarre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I reached the fence and was under it, in a blink it was completely gone and an almost instant feeling of terror came over me and I ran back to the house and told my brothers.

I saw  no lights and no sound. I was tracking an  osprey with my binoculars when all of a sudden I saw in the clear blue sky a craft, partially hidden on the bottom in a mist or cloud layer.  It seemed to be oval  or round in shape and with the sun hitting it I could see what I can only describe as a skin of &#34;airplane windows&#34;, concave and convex, rectangle in shape,  that were all over  it,  all pure white except for the bright gold-orange of the sun hitting it on the West side and a light to darkish blue on the sides  of the &#34;windows&#34; that were in the shadow.  The entire thing had a dull sheen, like plastic.   I could not tell if it was incredibly large or small, but I assume since I could not see it with the naked eye it was small.  It did not appear to  be moving because I did not have to track it with my binoculars. I said &#34;what it that?&#34;  My young son was there and I took the binoculars away and looked at the sky but saw nothing, nor did my son.  I looked back into the binoculars and saw the craft again and it slowly disappeared behind the mist or cloud. I was about to hand the binoculars to my son when that happened.  All together I observed this for a total of one minute. To give an idea to its size looking through binoculars it would be the same size as a full moon looking through binoculars. I called the police to see if any one else had reported it.  They said no. This was a completely cloudless day overhead except for some low lying clouds over the New Jersey side of the ocean.  I first reported this sometime in late Aug. or Sept. 1994 to Center for UFO Studies, CUFOS and they took my information by phone and sent a form to fill out.   The form envelope was dated October 18, 19 94.  I chickened out about reporting it, and since have forgotten the exact date, although I know it! was Lat e July or early August.  I am an artist so I did a water color of what I saw, but I cannot show the &#34;beautiful glow&#34; this craft had.  The closest reported sighting like mine seems to be the Columbus Ohio spear on 6-15-1994.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Words to describe it are like it bobbed up and down and swayed like a staggering drunk)  ((oscillating??  PD)) and it made its way past the moon and just under it then in a flash it propelled itself upwards extremley fast and dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it was but never have I ever seen what I saw that night and not since have I. I only ever saw one that did this in the skies in Clyde but it was not a brilliant ball of light but rather a small white light that when it propelled upwards it looked like a tail of flames coming from it (a meteor perhaps?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father was visiting that summer and he saw it.  I remember when we moved to Clyde our neighbors said there were strange lights in the skies but whatever it was it sparks my interest in finding out what it may be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope you understand why I will not leave my real name. There is never any way to prove what my son and I saw that night but I asked him if he remembered and he said he does.  It&#39;s been a long time ago and we moved to PA now.

We both smoked cigarettes and i had decided to go outside to smoke this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on the second floor and it had a railing right outside of our front door and i leaned on the railing with my forearms and lit up my cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had taken a drag or two when i just happened to look up at the sky at my 2 o&#39;clock position and saw this enormous black triangled craft float overhead approximately 2000 feet up.  The craft moved at a slow and steady pace from right to left.  If it had been a plane it would have fallen out of the sky.The craft made no noise and was PERFECTLY triangular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled for my girlfriend Dana to come outside.  When she came out i pointed to the craft and asked her, &#34;what does that look like to you?&#34;.  She replied, &#34;Oh my god, look at that thing, it&#39;s huge!&#34;.  I was so shocked by what i was seeing that all i could think to do was run in, grab the wireless phone, and call 911.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the dispatcher came on the line i told her this, &#34;I can&#39;t believe what we&#39;re seeing, my girlfriend and i are looking at a huge black triangle floating over my apartment right now!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dispatcher, not apparently upset that i called, said, &#34;really?  You&#39;re looking at a UFO?&#34;.  Something to that effect.  I told her i was not kidding that my girlfriend was right there looking at it with me.  I also told her i wasn&#39;t on drugs or alcohol or anything like that.  I was just witnessing an unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She told me there were no other reports of the craft and that maybe i should try contacting Nellis Air Force Base.  She also was genuinely interested in what the craft looked like and what it was doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She never dispatched any cops or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and i then proceeded to watch the craft climb slowly up and away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft never made any sudden moves or turns or attempted to speed up until the very end of the sighting, it looked as if it was moving faster as it gained more altitude up and away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s my story.  It isn&#39;t the most exciting, but it was a real triangled craft &#34;plain as day&#34; and there is a 911 call out there with my voice reporting it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just can&#39;t remember the exact date.

I had insisted that we just walk in the dark and not put on the flashlights.   The lights were as described above. All of us saw them as one color, but none of us saw them the same color as any one else. I saw the most beautiful, clear orange color.  They stayed in that formation traveling from north to south above the Kittatinny Mountain range. One year later, I went up to Sunrise Mtn (same range) at 5 AM.  I have no idea why I awakened and went up there.  There were 2 young men who were frightened and saw the same lights, they tried to take them on their camcorder.  I explained to the boys that I did not feel they were harmful in the slightest.  Then went home and back to bed. Shortly after that when I was enjoying my field (on the top of a hill), I was watching 2 hawks circling overhead.  The clouds were formed in a funnel shape, the smallest point at the top, the hawks climbed higher and higher until they disappeared (which isn&#39;t logical) Then I felt myself being lifted off of the ground, grabbed onto the car to hold myself down.  Wish I was brave enough to have gone with it. A couple of years later, a mother and her two sons were coming to my house in the evening and saw them.  The mother and older son was happy and excited but the younger son was scared. It seems that I sense when they are around, such as last night even though the sky was overcast.  It seems a new comprehension comes to me when I sense they are around, I don&#39;t know what, I just know it is there. This is their formation: x      x       x x      x       x       x I am hoping that someone else has had such an experience and can share with me what they felt. I have overworked myself for the last 2 years, bone tired, ended up with asmatic bronchitis and slept for a week. Then, last night I sensed them again.  This morning my energy is back. Another thing is that I bought some fiber-optic beads in different colors in October.  The orange of those beads is the closest to the color that I saw that night. Such a pure orange. Another thought, it could just be co-incidence, is that my ability to channel healing and physic work improves after I sense or see them.  It could be psychological .... maybe you have an answer. Also, I haven&#39;t got the slightest idea how I ended up with your website. I should be cleaning the house.  I just finished an e-mail to Governor Whitman about work conditions and asking for an Early Retirement Package.  How did this come up???  And after so many years. Thanks for any information you can supply me.   ((name deleted))<n>

We noticed an yellow circle shaped object in the sky .  It appeared to be falling straight down then it stopped and remained still. Next it appeared to split into two objects for about 30 to 45 seconds. It then formed back into one object. It then proceeded to speed of. We got in the car and followed it. After about three minutes the object stopped for 30 seconds ( remained suspended in the sky with no movement) and then speed of at an amazing speed.

Before getting in my car I stopped to light a cigarette. While I was smoking, movement in the southeast part of the sky caught my attention. I knew it was not a bird, or any conventional aircraft by the way it was moving. Its movement was very erratic, shooting one way and then another, and without slowing was making very sharp turns. It had to be very distant from my position; I can only describe it as a small sphere of intense white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my friend and my brother outside to look at it. The morning was very clear, no clouds or overcast conditions. They saw the same thing as I did. We watched it for about 2 minutes when it was joined by another object of the same nature. The two objects looked to be chasing each other. After 1 minute of that, they headed off to the north/northeast. All of us followed them in my car for 3/4 of a mile (down to the corner gas station), and they were out of sight. All of this happened in the space of about 6 minutes. I have never seen anything like that again, and I doubt that I will again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a believer in alien abductions, crop circles, life after death or anything else usually described as paranormal. I am a firm atheist and believe in the power of science over any God. The basis for all science is mathematics however, and it is mathematicly possible for life to exist on another planet besides our own. I guess just because we do not have the science to find other populated planets does not mean that one of those planets has not found us.<n>

And just over a building,  about 4 stories high, I saw this object. It was  mettalic colored and it had flashing lights on the bottom of it. I can&#39;t quite recall the color of the lights, but I remember lights flashing. It was just hovering there for what seemed about 5-7 seconds. I froze, almost like I couldn&#39;t move even if I wanted to! Walking behind me, was a man in a 3 piece suit with a briefcase. So I turned and asked him &#34;did you just see that?&#34;  But he acted as if I wasn&#39;t even there. Like he didn&#39;t see me! By the time I turned around to see the UFO, it was gone. I mean GONE! As I mentioned earlier, there were no clouds in the sky at all that day. So where could it have gone in the half a second that I turned to talk to that man? And how could something that was just hovering, build up that kind of speed so quickly? I kept walking home, not taking my eyes off the sky. I remember being very frightened.  Like when you think you&#39;ve seen a ghost. When I walked in the door, my cousin said I was very pale. The 1st thing she and her husband said was &#34;you look like you&#39;ve seen a ghost!&#34; I don&#39;t drink or do drugs! So I know that I saw something that day! I just can&#39;t understand why that man didn&#39;t it, or ME at that!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

In the summer of 1994, there were several nights in which I alone, and once with friends saw. There was even one broad daylight sighting. One night we were heading back to our cabins at about 9:30 pm. There was never any planes around. We saw this round object hovering above the other side of the lake. Sometimes there would be a dark orange light on it for more than a minute, and then it would disappear while still being able to see the outline of the craft moving. Several nights later close to 22:00, we were at this building called the rec hall where we&#39;d hand out. I went outside alone for some air. On the right side of the building on the grass there was this dark orange light in the shape of a large rectangle shining on the grass. At first I thought it was a light shining through the window. I walked nearby it and it would&#39;ve been impossible for a rectangle that big to be shining through a window that small and covered with wired mesh. I then looked around and didn&#39;t see anything until I looked up into the sky and saw this round object with the same coloured light on it as that of the rectangle on the grass. I then ran back inside being affraid of being abducted.<n> <n><n> Towards the end of the summer myself and another counsellor and a couple of kids saw in broad daylight, a round silver metallic object with no sharp edges and no sound flying over the baseball field ( near the rechall). They were in shock, as was I. I saw this same object, with the same coloured light over several other nights while I was there. I saw the same thing a few times the summer before in 1993 at the same camp. I have always been a strong believer in UFO&#39;s and other planet life. I also strongly believe the government is in fact holding some sort of UFO technology and maybe life somewhere. Probably not at AREA 51 because it too well known. I truly believe there is a big conspiracy to keep aliens/UFO&#39;s quiet. All the way from Rosewell to the year 2002. I saw once on tv about UFO&#39;s, they showed the drawing of a craft that was describe by a WW2 pilot they saw, to the US Stealth Bomber. The shape and size was very similar. They also believe the Stealth Bomber came from UFO technology. Brief summary, I&#39;m not stupid, I know what I&#39;ve seen, and I know what&#39;s out there.

I was walking down the middle of the street with a friend at around 2:00 am.  Suddenly a light shined done on us from behind.  It was like a spotlight shining from a helicopter, only there was no noise that is associated with a helicopter.  We both turned around at the same time and saw a light hovering just above the tree line roughly 300 yards away from us.  When we turned the light seemed to instantly reduce in intensity, like it wasn’t a spotlight anymore, but just a light.  The object then zipped the left and upward, right and up, left and up and then back to the right and upward at a 45 degree angle and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Flying low to the ground. Had 3 white lights underneath. No noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend of mine left my house at approx. 11:10 pm heading west on Herndon Ave.  It being a clear night, he looked out his windshield to see the stars. There weren&#39;t any. It was then that he noticed a large isosceles triangle shape directly above him. The object was about as big as a football field and had completely blocked out his view of the stars.  There were 3 white lights on the underside, one at each corner. The rest of it was dark.  It was flying (or floating) very close to the ground, approx. 100 ft. above him.  He said it seemed close enough to hit with a rock.  He pulled his car off to the right shoulder of the road and turned off the engine and radio.  He leaned out the window and looked up to watch the object.  There was no noise.  He couldn&#39;t see how thick the craft was. It hovered silently for a few seconds, slowly rotated to its right, then proceeded to slowly move towards the southwest.  Suddenly, it shot upwards and away at an angle with lightning speed going in the same direction.  He noticed a sulfer-like smell in the air after it left. There were no cars on that section of the  road at the time of his sighting.  He immediately drove back to my house and banged on my bedroom window.  Thinking he had forgotten his keys or had car trouble, I rushed to open the front door.  He looked me right in the eyes and said, &#34;I just saw a UFO!&#34;  He was visibly very shaken up.  I went out outside into my driveway with him and he explained what he&#39;d seen.  I looked in the direction of his sighting but could see nothing.  A few weeks later, we were watching an episode of &#34;Unsolved Mysteries&#34; that dealt with the UFOs sighted in Belgium.  They showed a picture of a large triangular craft with 3 lights on the underside, and he told me that was something like what he&#39;d seen, but without the red light in the center.  We decided not to report the sighting until now because he was too shaken up by it at that time. I&#39;ve known him for quite a long time and I have no reason not to believe him.<n>

I had been doing pretty well fishing, when I noticed a white light on the other side of the lake. I figuered it must have been another fisherman&#39;s lantern. The light appered to be moving slowly as though someone was walking with the lantern. All of a sudden I saw two bright red lights from the area where the lantern was. At first I thought who ever had the lantern was getting into their vehicle and leaving. It seemed strange (too big for a car or truck)so by this time I was entranced on the lights. They slowly moved up the side of the mountain and as it moved up it turned sidways and there it was, a cold black triangle shaped craft, the lights had become three light fading from red to amber almost pinkish. I watched the craft, which was probably 100 feet long in comparison with the background which is very familiar to me, move back down the side of the mountain and began hovering over the lake. It moved silently around skimming over the top of the lake. All of a sudden the red lights went dark and they were replaced by one very bright white light. At this time I heard the sound of something spinning, it made a wobbling sound that would speed up and slow down. This went on for sometime. I was very afraid of this thing, my hair was standing on end, there seemed to be a electrical or magnetic feild in the area, so I walked back up toward camp. I watched it for about ten more minutes, then all at once the lights and spinning sound was dead dark silence. I have had other experiances from that area if you guys are interested. This thing was for real.<n>

He was working on his bicycle and had to go out to the barn for a tool. He came back a couple minutes later and said I should come out and &#39;check out these lights&#39;. I went out and was astonished by the brilliance of these blinking lights visible in the northern sky in a gap between a bunch of fir trees. (My house was about 7 miles north of town.) I went to get a pair of binoculars and my jaw truly dropped to the ground: I saw a disc-shaped object, like the lid of a sauce pan, metallic or silvery-grey in color. The lights (red and blueish-green) were not blinking after all, but were circling the edge of the disc. They seemed to blink when looking with the naked eye only because the lights disappeared behind the object - which was itself not bright enough to be visible to the naked eye - and reappeared as they circled again to the front. My ex and I took turns watching through the binoculars. He made the comment that it looked like &#34;a wheel within a wheel&#34;. The object bobbed like a cork in a standing wave of water but stayed in roughly same spot the entire time we watched it (well over an hour)! Through the binoculars, it appeared to be about the size of a pencil eraser at arm&#39;s length; with the naked eye it was somewhat larger than the size of a bright star or planet. I guessed it was about 2 or 3 miles away. It looked like it was hovering over an area called Prater Mountain - or, possibly, Blue Lake at the foot of Prater. (Two weeks later we heard that a neighbor saw a ufo around the same time, also near Prater.) After a while, my ex went to bed but I watched it until it disappeared. It didn&#39;t zip away, like so many ufos are reported to do; it seemed to gradually get smaller until it resembled a star. (However, I was scanning the sky from time to time, so it might have vamoosed when I was looking elsewhere.) I saw it again (or something similar) the next night: I was keeping my eye on a &#34;bright star&#34; off in the North when suddenly it zoomed straight towards me.! I was ready to run back to the house and hide under the bed! It stopped farther away, however - I would guess a distance of 8 miles or so (through the binoculars it looked like blinking red and blue lights rotating in a tight circle, and the object itself was not discernable). My sister and brother-in-law had arrived on a visit from California earlier that day. I woke them up and when my sister saw it she remarked that &#34;it&#39;s definitely something, all right - I wonder if the government is experimenting with new aircraft.&#34; This should have been the ultimate confirmation for me, as my sister is a die-hard skeptic! (though I don&#39;t think the government can make something that behaves as that thing did...) As the days went by, I began to convince myself that what we saw could have been some sort of atmospheric disturbance. But then, we heard of someone else in the neighborhood who saw it, and a few weeks later, mufon or some other organization posted flyers asking people to let them know if they had seen something during that period. And finally, around Feb or Mar of the following year, there was a video on some tv show supposedly showing a ufo down along the Spokane River between Coeur d&#39;Alene and Post Falls. I didn&#39;t see it but heard the video was taken during the spring of &#39;94, just a few weeks before our sighting. My conclusion: either the guv, mufon, and other nameless entities/individuals were conspiring together to inflame my latent paranoia(!), or... we really SAW something extraordinary! (I have not reported this sighting to any organization or agency until now.)<n>

Large rectangular (not cigar) stationary in sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am only reporting this as over the years I have never heard.mention of any other rectangular shapes being reported and have puzzled ever since as to what I saw and why no one else has mentioned rectangular.  It was angular and definitely not the cigar shape that was the only other similar shape known to me back then apart from the disc which seemed to be the only other reported therefore I didn&#39;t know to whom to report it other than family and friends over the years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the front passenger seat of car...my husband was driving.  It was early morning summer day clear skies...not a cloud or haze in sight.  We were on a section of dual carriageway...other road users also...in a rural area but commuting stretch of road.  I either sensed or saw something just outside my vision to my left and turned and looked out the window straight out and up to a very large dark metal looking object...massive and stationary in the sky.  I looked at it clearly ... thoughts through my mind that it was clearly something big, unusual and not moving surrounded by blue sky and not joined to the ground in any way...this sounds strange but I was almost looking for it to be joined to something on the ground as a way of explaining how it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my husband quite desperately to look but it was not visible to him driving and was til high for him to see from his seat...I kept eye contact with it for a good minute and it remained stationary and I had to turn my head to continue to see it.  We passed behind light trees and I could still see it&#39;s broken shape and mass.  My husband took the first road on the left which brought us behind the line of trees and when I looked behind them it had completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the size of a passenger plane...I drew it after the event and I would guess it was only 100 to 180 feet above the ground...a green slightly sloped field.  It had darker markings on both ends but was definitely angular and rectangle...possible 10 times as long as the height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time my husband and I discussed how I had no reference to gauge the size snit was just stuck in the blue sky with no other structures around it but I could gauge how close it was and it&#39;s size as I could see markings and the edges were crisp and it was solid and close enough for me to know it was nothing that I would ever expect to see....it was nothing that I could explain with any physics known to man unless it weighed absolutely nothing and somehow didn&#39;t move in a breeze!  I really just wondered if you had any either reports of this size and shape and particularly as I saw it in daylight and stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do think I am trustworthy witness...not taken to flights of fancy.  I was in the army previously and now work as a paramedic just more interested to know if anyone has reported the same.<n>

It was moving at a slow speed and appeared to have descended from a hight of approx 500ft to approx 50ft.  There wasn&#39;t any noise from the environment, wind, or the flying structure.  It continued to move at about 3-5 mph without any dipping, tilting, banking, or pitching of any kind.  The closest it came to us was about 150 meters as we were perpendicular to its movement. Then we left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While leaving a friend&#39;s house in Emporia, my wife, two kids, and I headed back to Topeka, via Interstate 35.  I was driving.  We were heading in a North-Northeasterly direction and it was approximately 02:30 hrs and the sky was clear (possible small clouds but stars were visible). While my kids were sleeping, I noticed a bright light in the sky to my 12:30-1:00 position as a pilot would verse.  Initially, it looked like an airplane with landing lights on that gave the appearance of being approximately five miles away and an altitude of about 1,500 feet.  So, I didn&#39;t pay it much attention. Later, maybe 5-10 minutes, I noticed the light was still in the same position, yet a little closer.  There now appeared to be two lights rather than one.  Now, it looked more like a stationary obstacle; perhaps the light to a communications or broadcasting tower.  Later still, maybe 3 minutes, I continue to drive at a speed of about 65 mph.  Humerously, the two lights now appeared to be a car&#39;s headlights.  A car was slowly flying towards us at about 200 feet.  At this point I gave the lights my wife&#39;s attention.  It was now approx &lt; 2 miles away and still appeared to be 150-200 feet off the ground.  As we got closer, I slowed down and eventually stopped the car on the shoulder.  There were no other cars in sight on the highway.  At this time the lights were about 1 mile out and closing towards us.  Its altitude appeared to be 100 feet.  I aske my wife if she had any idea what it was.  She guessed an airplane.  I recalled some friends earlier stating that a blimp had been in Emporia that day; the<n>

I&#39;m reporting it now because I really would like to know if anyone else has seen anything like this in Goshen before or since.  Would love to compare notes.  Anyway... here&#39;s the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 11:30 at night on a clear starry night in late summer.  My girlfriend at the time and I were driving down ST. RT. 28 heading out of Goshen towards Blanchester.  Just to give you a better image of where we were, Goshen is farmland and out past the town it becomes a long stretch of road with forest and fields pretty much everywhere you look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend was asleep in the passenger seat when I noticed a very bright row of white lights in the sky ahead and off to my left.  These lights were bright enough and just about the right height that I at first passed them off as stadium lights until I remembered that we had already passed the high school about 10 minutes before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not being familiar with the area I woke up my girlfriend and pointed to the lights to see if she knew what it was.  She, like myself, was clueless.  Both of us kept our eyes glued to these lights as we drove further down the road.  At the distance we first noticed it... we didn’t notice any deviation in the brightness of the lights or any movement from the object until we got closer.  At that point we could see a sort of oscillating effect to the lights that made it look as if they were rotating around the object.  When we noticed this, honestly I began to get a bit excited.  I had always heard about UFO&#39;s but had never seen one and the thought of seeing one was a rush.  But even then I wasn’t planning on tracking this thing down... I was interested but not THAT interested.  That is until I was getting really close to my turn off and realized that my route would take me right by the field this thing was in.  So it looked like we were going to get a closer look at this thing after all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a left onto Shiloh road... I think that&#39;s the name of the road.  However after turning left the object was on my right hand side about a football field away and few hundred feet in the air (guessing on the distances).  Just after turning off we saw a little gravel driveway near a broken down barn that went a short distance into the field.  Both our curiosities were really peaked at this time so we pulled in, shut the car and radio off and watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw was amazing, the object was so dark that all we saw was the lights that ran around its perimeter, we couldn’t make out a shape yet, but watching its maneuvers was enough.  It would sit horizontal with its lights seemingly rotating around it, extremely bright but not so much you could look at it.  Then, its lights would dim down and stop “rotating”, it would shift from horizontal to a roughly 30 degree angle and shoot straight up in the sky and back down again in a matter of seconds but in a different spot within the field.  It would then settle fully horizontal and its lights would return to how we first saw them.  At no time did this craft seem to notice or care we were there, there were times when it would move that it would come close enough that we could hear a pulsating humming sound coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All in all, we stayed and watched this for about 1/2 an hour and never did either one of us have a sense of fear, we felt totally safe (whether we were or weren’t).  While we sat there though, we noticed several other object at varying distances all pulling the same kind of maneuvers, bringing the total to about 8 UFO&#39;s in that area.  We really got the impression that they were searching for something or practicing maneuvers? Who knows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally we decided to leave before we pushed our luck.  On the drive home my girlfriend noticed that one of the objects was moving in our general direction.  Not so much following as we had a good idea that the direction it was going would take it really close to her home.  Her Dad happened to have a good set of binoculars so when we got there we ran back outside with them and took a look up as it went by.  What we saw was a dark triangle with 4 lights, 3 in the corners and one larger one in the center each having a yellowish/white light underneath.  In fact the picture of the Triangular UFOs from Belgium look almost identical to what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So there&#39;s my story, I would love to hear from anyone that might have seen anything similar.  Granted this was 10 years ago, but I&#39;m betting that if anyone else saw this it would have stuck in your mind as much as it has mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I wrote him earlier this year asking what he recalled about the incident… b/c I have been coming across more tv specials regarding ufo and crop circle phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photo was taken from the spot where we camped.  I had been walking/hunting this area for many years and knew miles of territory around this from many angles.  I’ve camped here and close by many times.  I’ve never had any previous encounter and have not had any since…. But what my son and I saw that night was truly different than anything we’ve heard, read or seen on tv.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night had a half moon on the opposite side of the sky, which gave some cast on the outlines of the hills even though it was dark – meaning no city lights were affecting us…. It was about 9pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The exact date is not in my recollection but is recorded in my original notes of 12 yrs ago, however it was late June/early July of 1994, we were near Ink-O-Pah California, close to Table Mtn.  I was 42, my son was 16.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were finished with dinner and were shooting fireworks, rifles, pistols and shotguns… I had gone to the back of my Chevy Blazer to get something when my son said he saw a fire in the distance and thought someone was coming towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned and saw a light in the distance where there should only be sky… it looked like a large campfire and it looked to be way out in the distance and the light was flickering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a hill about 1/8 mi from us on the right, with another hill about 1/8 mi more on the left, these forming a V.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ‘campfire’ was off center … while we looked at it another fire come on to the right but the same level, then after 15 sec another come on off-center of them but lower – no symmetry…. They did not start small and become larger, they were big fires immediately and all 3 the same size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out my 12x power binoculars and looked at them…. They were not campfires, instead they were large rectangular windows with yellow light coming from them, the heat of the desert was plainly distorting in the foreground [which gave them the ‘campfire’ look in the distance] but these windows were just beyond the furthest hill [approx ¼ mi].<n> <n><n> <n><n> We only had a few minutes at these 3 when one went out, then another, then 4 came on – leaving 3 on one plane and 2 on a lower plane, again no symmetry.  In my binoculars there was enough light from the 5 windows that I clearly saw a horizontal deck under the lower 2 lights … the openings looked to be about 3’ x 12’ and the deck about 5’ wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 1 min I gave the binoculars to my son and got my rifle out which also had a 12x power scope.  Just then the lights began to go off, then 20 seconds later come on … in different patterns 3/2, 2/2, 2/3, ½, etc, etc for the next 10+ minutes as we watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We felt no fear, just curiously watching as the lights went on and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they went to all 5 on…. and one by one went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figure the distance the lights spanned was about 100 yds, left to right, while the lights looked like they were between the peaks, they were behind them a distance that I can only guess at , at least 1/8 mile if not more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited to see what happened next … After approx 2 min a tall white light looking like a pole lit up on the closest hill on the right.  There is a smaller peak formed by large boulder with another boulder below on to it’s left which nearly outlined the downhill slope of the hill in the background…. The light was on top of the lower boulder, it’s light illuminating both boulders and yet shedding light on the hill in the background too …. It looked to be 8’ or 10’ tall with quite a glow around it, there was no form other than a long tall pole of a light, I would guess 6” wide in comparison/proportion to the height of the pole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple minutes looking at it, it went out.  After about 1 minute it came back on in the same spot and 10 seconds after that a red pole light popped on, to it’s right and lower down the rocks … it looked to be approx 6’ – 8’ tall.  It’s glow was bright and we could see the rocks around it, but it was a bright red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights went on and off only a couple of times over about a 4-5 min period, then went off – white being the last one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked intently to see if they or something was moving towards us or coming closer to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approx 2 min several of the ‘campfire’ lights came on again, stayed for about 2 min, then all went out at the same time.  We watched and waited and then began to make ourselves busy while talking about everything….  nothing ever happened the rest of that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed up till about 11pm, then went to sleep in the bed of the Blazer with the tail gate open.  Neither of us had any awakenings, encounters, aliens, kidnappings or nothing … we woke up fine and have never had any dreams or nightmares or anything beyond our mental recollections of what we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next Day: We walked to the closest hill and searched all over for any signs of marks, prints, burns, disturbances … and found nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then walked down to the base of the hill in the background, finding nothing we went back to the Blazer, drove to the other side where I knew of a dirt road coming close to the hill, then walked up to the top of the hill, again searching for any signs of something or someone having been there.  I looked for any fake rocks too, as in the movies they use foam rocks.  We looked for anything moveable, any place that a pole might come out of the ground that could have lights on it, we used our imagination to try to find anything… but there were only animal marks, prints, etc – just natural traffic in the dirt.  I returned the next weekend with my camera for the picture I’ll attach or send along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Myself and a friend were traveling on Easthampton Rd. headed from Northampton towards Easthampton. My friend noticed a low flying aircraft off to the right side of the car, it was coming down fast and moved right over the top of us. I slowed down and pulled off to the side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire hood and windshield of my car lit up like someone was shining a spotlight on the front of the vehicle from above.  My first thought was a helicopter, but there was no sound. The light moved forward fallowed by two more spotlights on either side of my car.  The lights moved ahead of us slowly in a triangular formation. A red flashing light became visible under what appeared to be a flat triangular craft with three white spotlights pointing down, one from each corner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft continued to move forward slowly we were not able to hear any sound and I was convinced it was some kind of glider preparing to land on the road.  I let it get about 100 yards ahead of us and then decided to fallow it.  I sped up to about 50 MPH and caught up to the craft a short distance up the road.  I fallowed behind the craft for about a half mile until it stopped and hovered about 80 ft off the ground behind Valley Sport Center on Northampton St. in Easthampton. I pulled into the buildings parking lot and my friend and I both stepped out of the car to observe the craft as it hovered there silently.  The sun had set just below the treeline as this all began a few minutes earlier.  There was a slight haze in the air.  With a few minutes of diminishing daylight left I could see the craft reasonably well. It was a flat black triangle with rounded edges and corners and a non-reflective surface.  It appeared to be slightly wider than the road we had just fallowed it d! own, maybe 75 ft. wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we observed the craft hovering a short distance in front of us, I remember thinking it was just close enough that I might have been able to hit it if I threw a rock.  I kept a spotlight on the front seat of my vehicle which I used for my job.  I reached into the car, plugged the spotlight into my cigarette lighter and shined the tightly focused light beam off to the right side of the craft.  The light beam was visible in the slightly dim hazy sky for a short distance beyond the craft.  I then guided the light slowly towards the craft in an attempt to illuminate it.  The light failed to contact the surface of the craft, appearing to simply fade out prematurely as it got anywhere close.  I guided the light back to the right and it reached a little beyond the distance of the craft again.  I shut the spotlight off for a moment then pointed it directly at the craft and flashed it two times a few seconds apart.  The craft responded by returning two similar flashes directly at us which blinded both of us for a few moments.  As our sight was recovering from the bright flashes, the craft began to move slowly towards O&#39;Neil St.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We again fallowed the craft which stopped and hovered over a wooded area between O&#39;Neil St. and Lovefield St.  We pulled over on O&#39;Neil St. and stepped out of the car to observe the craft again.  After what seemed to be about three minutes the craft shot like a bolt of lightning across the sky to our right and disappeared through what appeared to be some kind of a circular hole in the sky.  The craft left a silvery streak in it&#39;s path and the hole it disappeared through faded away quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stood by the car for a few moments trying to make sense of what we just experienced we heard some low flying jets approaching from behind us.  Within seconds two A-10 Warthogs screamed overhead at a very low altitude.  The Warthogs passed directly over the position where the UFO had just been hovering and fallowed in the same direction as the UFO had gone until they were out of sight.  About the time the Warthogs were headed out of sight we observed two other fighter jets flying at high altitude east of our position.  At that point in time I estimate that about two minutes had passed since the UFO departed from the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back in the car and I noticed the time was about 7:44 PM.  We quickly returned to my home a few miles away.  A little while after we got back to my home I called the Easthampton police department to see if anyone else had reported seeing the strange aircraft.  The officer I spoke to was politely dismissive of the incident and said they had received dozens of phone calls about a UFO and that it was just the planet Venus which was easy to see in the sky that night.  Fighter jets continued to patrol the sky in the area for a couple hours after the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the course of that weekend there were thousands of UFO reports across New England. These sightings were widely reported in local media for a short time after the incident.  I don&#39;t recall any reports from national media about the story.  For the most part the local authorities and the media made a mockery of the entire situation and blamed it on the usual flares and swamp gas.  The story was quickly swept under the rug and I&#39;ve heard no mention of it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continue to experience phenomena related to this incident but do not wish to release that information publicly at this time.<n>

You see I live in Canton Ohio and in 1994 I&#39;m driving East on Highway 30 around 4:00 pm, the same way I drove every day. I happen to pay close attention to the road and surroundings while driving. I notice something round and very shiny so much so that from a distance there looked like rivets (you know like in steel girders) I felt weirded out because my mind told me that wasn&#39;t possible, nothing we make is round that’s capable of flight! Also that there was a tractor supply just beyond or below what I was looking at so, I brushed it off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then in August 2007 I was sitting with some friends (felt like kicking myself because I had no camera) there high in the sky I noticed something moving across the sky no flight trail and of the same description as before. What was really odd was imagine how much tome it takes for an Airplane to course across the sky this thing moved steadily and then disappeared behind the clouds. From ground level it appeared to be the size of a marble but when I saw the one in 1994 it was closer and seemed as big as a house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If there’s anyone else who may have seen the same thing in this area please let me know that way I won’t feel as though I&#39;ve lost my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for taking the time to read this your time has been appreciated<n>

We were sleeping on my ceiling one clear summer night with my dad. He had gone to sleep. We were talking and watching stars and satalites. One of us pointed one out, when suddenly it began to turn rapidly. Then it would suddenly turn directions, very smoothly and very rapidly, far quicker than any known craft. Then we noticed another, and then another. At first we thought it was some sort of battle beween the craft, but the craft just seemed to be playing. They would pair off, then regroup. They could turn any direction they wanted, they could stop on a dime, and change color. At some point we woke up my dad, who is usually a light sleeper. He seemed TIRED. He looked up, said something, I forget what,  and then he just went back to sleep. We kept watching these little lights play in the sky for a long time, close to an hour. There were between 4 and 5 five them. We could tell they were very far away, much much higher than any plane Ive seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I told them that I was afraid to go to 2nd grade when in fact I was scared of what I had just seen out my window.  My bed was right next a large, nearly full wall window that faced our backyard in the room that I shared with my older sister.  My parents sat on the floor and my sister was in her bed and I was in mine. I remember being bored, per usual, and staring out the window when this...pyramid I suppose floated casually past the window.  It wasn&#39;t like any of the pyramid&#39;s I&#39;ve looked up online.  I guess those are like black triangles with lights on their corners?  This was covered in little metallic/chrome-ish rectangles that were either silver or lighting up different colors.  I remember pinks and yellows and blues so nearly primary colors, but you could tell they were still metallic silver underneath.  It was weird and seemed to lazily float past.  It didn&#39;t seem to be propelled by anything and didn&#39;t seem to be in any sort of hurry. Ok and I get it, I was little could have just been my mind messing with me and I can&#39;t remember if it was four sided (feel like it was) or three because I only saw it in profile and in my memory it looks like it floated right between my house and the gazebo on our deck which is only about 25 feet or so, so there are clearly some missing pieces.  Also I remember it was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that has finally brought this up in my mind again after 15 years is that my brother is a sophomore in college now and lives in my house here and we were talking about random weird stuff that happened in our old house (which was a lot...I don’t know if that relates either) when he told me that when he&#39;d been in about 2nd grade he&#39;d been woken up two nights in a row by multi colored lights outside his window on the 2nd story but facing the street not the yard. He said he didn&#39;t see any object making them the 1st night because it&#39;d been so bright but that the 2nd he&#39;d seen a pyramid type object. I&#39;d never told anyone about what I&#39;d seen and neither had he till we had this conversation.  Now we just want to know if there’s anyone else who possibly has seen something like this because after looking it up forever and all over the internet I can’t find anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a summer night and my gut feeling is it was July. I was camping out with approx. 5 friends in a friend’s sheep pasture near his house.

Two of them had snuck a couple of beers from the house and drank them but were not intoxicated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a perfectly clear night out and around midnight or 1am someone noticed the stars were moving. We all looked up and in increasing numbers there were lights zipping through the sky, at what appeared to be a distance outside of our atmosphere, they were small and the size of stars. As in the report I read on your site, our initial reaction was that it was a massive battle in space. The lights changed direction on a dime, curved and moved incredibly fast, changed color as well as disappeared and reappeared. Unlike the report on your site, I remember retaining the impression that this was some sort of battle and remember bursts of light similar to explosions and they were doing what appeared to be dog fighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Growing up in a rural community I’ve spent many a night watching meteor showers and shooting stars and can vouch that this was neither of these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights slowly disappeared similar to how they had started until it was completely gone. I believe the whole thing lasted 5-10 minutes maybe longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The report I am referring to which is similar is:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred : 7/1/1994 12:00 (Entered as : 07/01/94 12:00pm)<n> <n><n> Reported: 5/13/2003 11:05:44 PM 23:05<n> <n><n> Posted: 5/27/2003<n> <n><n> Location: Ben Lomond, CA<n> <n><n> Shape: Light Duration:45min<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Lights|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55933.html|57|ndxe199407| Mistaken for the moon, the light gave birth to others and &#34;danced&#34; in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a beautiful July evening as my husband and I returned from a night out (No alcohol was involved). We pulled our car up to the curb ourside our home.  The weather had been clear until this time when clouds began to roll in from the southeast.  Then as he parked the car I became enthralled at the full moon overhead, hidden behind the clouds, and I began starring at it intently.  All, the while I&#39;m watching the moon I&#39;m thinking how big, bright, and beautiful it is. Also, where did these clouds come from?  Then it suddenly occured to me that the &#34;real&#34; moon was located in that exact spot probably 5 hours prior - &#34;how could this be the moon?&#34;, I think to myself, as I&#39;m standing on the sidewalk musing to myself.  No sooner did this thought materialize when the object (as if it heard my thoughts)jetted off to the west then stopped.  It was no longer overhead but slightly west of my location at this time. The &#34;clouds&#34; are emitting a light rain.  Now the &#34;moon&#34; appears to give birth to other lights of the same color, size and intensity.  These new lights (ever changing numbers - up to 22 or so) then began a &#34;dance&#34; of sorts.  They arranged themselves in 2 crescent shape lines of 5 or so, mirroring each other, with 6 or so others flanking their sides.  Then they would &#34;scramble&#34; and rearrange themselves in a similar fashion - just slightly different than the last - then scramble again. They appeared as children - playing in the rain.   This went on for 30 minutes or so.  All the while I am watching this I&#39;m strangely calm which is not my nature really.  I wanted very badly to run in the house for the camera but was afraid I&#39;d miss the opportunity of a lifetime for want of proof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my first ever time to report this publicly and I only do so now because I&#39;ve recently been haunted by the fact that that damned light actually &#34;read&#34; my mind!  I dont like that thought and everytime I look at a full moon I&#39;m afraid they&#39;re back to suck my mind.  I keep a careful watch on where the moon is whenever I&#39;m ouside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a simple housewife - I am not a scientist nor do I have a college degree.  My background is that of waitress and picture framer.  My husband is a truck driver/mechanic.  I&#39;m not prone to fabricating stories for attention.  In fact you&#39;ll notice I didnt even report this right away nor did I even discuss it with my husband til recent years.  That fact is still puzzling to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
