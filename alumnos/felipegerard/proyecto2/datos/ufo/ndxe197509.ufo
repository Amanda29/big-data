First &#34;aircraft&#34; would stop and hover at will, then take off at incredible speed in opposite direction of two approaching chase aircraft, in a &#34;teasing&#34; manner.  For a few years, assumed the whole thing was &#34;Uncle Sam&#39;s&#34; new toy from now closed Loring AFB, but recently heard someone else relate a similar experience, and realize it could be something different...The two chase aircraft appear to have been jets that needed large area of sky to turn around, while the first one had characteristics of a helicopter, but faster than the jets...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were below the canal road skinning out two deer.  It was about a four mile drive from our house up the valley and along the canal road to this spot.  It was getting dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the guys were skinning out the two does, my cousin, sister, and I were hanging out near the car.  I noticed a car coming down the winding canal road.  I called to the guys that a car was coming.  We watched as the two car head lights came closer.  The lights came to the last curve just before where our car and pickup were pulled down onto our land off the canal bank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights did not go around the curve, but gradually rose into the air and continued to pass overhead.  I don&#39;t know how far past us or how high it went, but in just a short time the lights faded out and were gone.  We realized that we hadn&#39;t even heard any motor or engine running.  It was silent.  It may have been too dark, because we didn&#39;t see a vehicle or airplane body.  All we saw were the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple days later, the game warden came and fined my brother for shooting does during buck season and took the meat.  I don&#39;t know how they found out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were at the north end of our property.  The lights came along the canal from the south going north.  We were standing facing east watching the guys taking care of the deer.  We turned to look south to watch for cars.  The lights left the canal road and were heading east when they faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father had lived on this farm for 25 years.  My brothers, sister, and I had lived there since we were born.  My cousin had been living with us for about a month.  There were 3 brothers, 3 sisters, and my mom who were not with us at the sighting.<n>

We where going to the High School football game in Roscommon. My wife and I noticed this very bright light hovering just over the tree line. The sun had just set and it was still somewhat light to the west.  I pulled over to the side of the road and got out of the car, I started walking toward the object my wife (Marie) was yelling at me to get back in the car but I kept walking toward the tree line. I watched the object for a long time it just hovered over the trees about 300 yards away. There was a bright light shinning down to the ground right under the object. Without notice it moved to my right about 100 yards and stopped. It moved faster than my eye could catch it, it than shot stright up about 1000 ft and stopped, again faster than anything I had ever seen before. It than shot striaht up and disapeared into the stars, obsolutely unbelievable. I was taking Aviation Tech courses at the Kirtland Community College in Roscommon and had spent 4 years in the Navy as an aircraft Mech. I knew there was nothing like it on this planet.  We stopped in Roscommon at the first gas station and there were 2 other cars, around the curve in the road, that witnessed the same thing we did.  I now wish we had exchanged names.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this whole time the object never made a sound. But my wife sure did. The following morning I called the Oscoda Air Force base and reported the sighting, they stated they had no ops in the area and that others had called on the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Object was red, with no visible lighting or running lights, discernable &#34;deck&#34; lights, or other indications of being a multi-leveled &#34;craft.&#34; Its shape was that of two plates, one atop the other; wide in the center and tapering to ends; which appeared to be a consistant trait in its construction (angle/position to/of object did not change appearence). At first it approached low  (-300&#39;) and silently from SW (?-directions aren&#39;t my thing!). While manuevering, there was no apparent change in the objects relationship to the observer (it was as though It was &#34;facing&#34; us even as it changed direction... perhaps- likely, the effect of no identifiable markings from which to ascertain its true orientation. Though there were no &#34;visible&#34; indications of an aura or haze that I readily remember- it seemed pretty clear too Me!... I reckon&#39; one may have existed: that would explain the lack of definition and inability to denote any change in orientation during course changes/manuevers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were at the bend of Lighthouse Road near Fort Mott Road, facing field (lighthouse to left)away from developement. It was coming  (slight angle to right- 1 or 2 degrees relative, travelling left and closing, toward Zero relative)  directly towards us and those with me were quite concerned. I at the time was 14 and quite curious, and got out of the car (a VW) to &#34;see it!&#34;. I was pulled into the car and in the excitement (panic) to get away, my cousin nearly ran off the road and into a ditch. I observed the object as it gradually turned 180 degrees from us (to the right and away from our original observation point) and headed to the actual park area (app. relative bearing from original ob. point: 045). It then proceeded (North?) from park area and while over the dike began to accelerate (acceleration was smooth and rapid- in a &#34;up-river&#34; direction towards Wilmington, DE... North?). Then it was gone! Not a streak as seen in (say) a rapidly moving light... just a clean, crisp light which increased in speed and disappeared. Note: The object did not diminish in mass or change shape indicating a turning/arching motion, nor did it fade or in any respect give the impression of a light being turned off! Never did I hear noise, nor did it behave in a manner consistant with any aircraft of my knowledge, before or after the event. Other than to say it appeared considerably close, I can only speculate on its size, distance, and altitude [2 inches- 1/2 the spread of one&#39;s fingers if taking bow readings on a ship (Ex: four points off the Starboard bow), at a distance of approximately 1000 yds., and altitude of app. 200 feet. Closest approximate distance was 150 yds. I would estimate the object itself to have been the length of a medium-sized house: 40 feet? ]... this account is from memory, and except for it being &#34;somehow strange and out of place,&#34; I didn&#39;t think to correlate the incident with known landmarks for size, altitude, or distance. Quite honestly, I was 14 and fearless... more interested in determining what! it was than how big, high, or where, it was! The conditions of incident: Clear evening. Stars bright. Farmland, swamp, and open ground, which I was relatively familiar with, and no unusual activity of any kind. (Note: Aircraft activity was light, visible, and easily recognizable as aircraft, though distant; Delaware side of Delaware River- refinery and Wilmington area, with some air traffic in the vicinity of the Nuclear Power Plant).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Events prior to incident/event: My sister and two friends had come home obviously distressed- literally crying because they saw a UFO. My cousin and I, for laughs and kicks decided to go back with them so they could &#34;show us&#34;... they were after a lapse of app. a 1/2 hour, still distressed. Niether of us were expecting anything- we thought they were stoned to be quite honest! Anyhow, what occured is pretty much that as stated herein, and to, the best of my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then I&#39;ve been in the Navy, at Sea, and have seen various types of Aircraft under varying conditions. None of which would fit into the category of unidentifiable or unexplainable! I was a FT (Fire Control Technician-Missiles). I am somewhat imaginative and creative, but not predisposed to irrational thought or fantasy; however, to this day I cannot explain what that object was! It continues to defy any attempt at my rationalizing what it may have been! It truely was uncharacteristic of any aircraft or aerial phenomenon of which I am familiar. A friend that lived in that area said she too saw wierd things, but I mention that in passing! Interesting Note: None of the other four People involved- my sister and cousin specifically, will discuss this incident/event; which really aggrevated me for some time! They acknowledge its occurence, but will not discuss it... which is behavior I find rather strange in and of itself! NUFORC: As stated, this account is from memory and occured some 27 years ago! This is the first I&#39;ve bothered to report it since it was so long ago and without willing witnesses or supportive evidence seemingly a waste of time. But, why not? It&#39;s an incident that too this day, baffles me! I will answer any questions (via E-mail) you may care to ask; though certainly being this far removed from the present, it is of no consequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was driving west on I-78 after coming off of I-287 south.  I am guessing that it was in September because it was dark and yet it was warm enough for me to have the car windows open.  As I came around a curve in the interstate I could see over the median a black object with a number of spotlights shining down onto the median.  As I got closer I could see that it was triangular in shape but with the (back?) side sort of dented in (chevron?) The vehicle was very angular and not curved in any way.  It spanned the median, so it was about fifty feet in diameter, and I would say about the same in length.  There were about five or six of the spotlights that shone straight down in almost a pinpoint of light - definitely not floods but spots.  It was matte black, and it was hovering, and was absolutely silent.  I saw at least one other car coming the other direction on the interstate but it was impossible to tell if they saw it also. The object stayed there as long as I could see it in my rearview mirror.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 19 at the time and was on my way home from work.  I had been away to university for one year and had decided not to go back, and went to work full time.  I had worked overtime for two hours which was typical for that time.  I did not stop because I was a)fearful that the occupants might see me and b)even more afraid that my father would be angry if I arrived home later than I said I would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The object was cylindrical with a height to length ratio resembling 3 steel barrels end to end but twice the size.  Object was totally quiet, moving too slow to actually be capable of flight, and had no aerodynamics to support flight at all such as wings or other control surfaces.  I even checked overhead for a helicopter or anything else that could be transporting the item.  Both ends of the item were blunt.  I believe some sparking was evident at the rear with a trace of smoke, but not like a jet or rocket as we know it.  Color was gray to metalic with a few blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my car so I could follow the item until it disappeared behind a hill on the Northwest side of Tehran&#39;s city limit.  The interesting thing is that the item passed 90 degrees over the Eastern end of Tehran&#39;s Mehrabad Airport main runway traveling due North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Arriving at work at the airport I checked with military and commercial personnel to see what was going on thinking someone else had to see it considering the location.  Apparently no one else had seen it and no reports were filed.  I never spent too much time thinking about it after that until 3 years ago when I saw the 1976 reports and thought someone had the dates wrong.  The smaller object in that report was similar to what I had seen a year earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For info, at that time I was a USAF Master Sergeant working at the MAC terminal located on the Eastern aircraft parking ramp at Mehrabad.  I was the ranking NCO and was a jet aircraft mechanic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Anyway...I&#39;ll be brief in describing what I saw. I was about eight years old at the time. My father, mother, a coworker, and I were standing around my father&#39;s truck. My mother noticed an object traveling at a high altitude moving from east to west. She pointed it out to the rest of us because we normally didn&#39;t see many planes flying out in that area. However, confusion set in when the object stopped in mid-flight and held its postion for what seemed like two or three minutes. Then, without warning, it shot straight-up and disappeared from view. As that occured...several obvious military jets appeared on the horizon (east and west) and converged on that point where the object left from and circled around. The military jets then left as quickly as they came. The sense that we all got was that the jets were chasing this object, whatever it was. The next day, my mother called the nearest airforce base (I believe it was Luke). They basically told her that they didn&#39;t have any aircraft in the area. I saw two other objects during my stay near Prescott...please refer to cigar shaped and fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was, however, fairly large. Maybe as big as a small house....anyway...It crossed my field-of-view and flew to my extreme left-hand view. I lost sight of it through the trees.

He worked for a major airplane manufacturer in washington, and was over visiting.  we saw a bright light approach from east.  It was trailing fire behind it.  As it came closer it turned north and accelerated out of sight.  We went in the house to tell others, and I heard on a radio (that had police channels) a report a policeman was making to a ufo center in omak or okanoggen ( I don&#39;t remember now).  he described the thing we had seen, and reported seeing it hover over a farm near Ritzville,scaring the animals and shining lights over the buildings.  the time he reported for the event was just minutes before we had seen the object, and the distance between ritzville and our house was close to 100 miles, so the object was really moving.  We tried to report the event to our local police.  The kept asking if we had seen a burning airplane.  My uncle told them that it was not any kind of plane he knew of, and it wasn&#39;t burning, it just had a tail of flame shooting out the back.  They never really got it.  The next day the paper had a story of a meteor that had &#34;lit up the night sky&#34;.  I never new meteors could change direction or accelerate.

I have not related this story to anyone else because, just telling my brothers about it, received so much skepticism that i allowed myself to just &#39;forget&#39; that it ever happened. I am now 28 years old, have a BS in Computer Engineering, and am a partner in a Computer Engineering Consulting firm. I feel that any public knowledge of what i am about to relate could be damaging to my credibility, and wish to keep this account anonymous as far as the public is concerned. But, i also feel i must finally relate this account to an authoritative source whom may be able to quell my concerns. In retrospect, I finally identified the time lapse that took place. This concerns me more than anything, taking into account my current state of mind. I feel that this encounter, as long ago as it was, may have changed my life significantly without even recognizing it, until now. It was late summer, 1975. My parents used to let one of my three brothers and i stay up an hour later than the rest once a week. We were all within a few years in age. That night, I was not the one, and was sent to bed at seven-thirty. It was just before twilight. The sun sets later this time of year (of course). The way the bed faced, i could see outside through two large(4&#39;x5&#39;) triple pane windows. I was almost asleep when something drew my attention outside. I opened my eyes to see what appeared to be a very large yellow-orange disk hovering above the trees. It was hard to say how far away it was. I stared at it. It made no noise, but again I was inside the house. The disk had two, relatively speaking, small bumps or turrets on the top and bottom. The sunset was beginning to turn the sky a pale red, pink color. The next thing i remember, it was pitch black outside. The disk degraded to a small round white light. At the time, i described it to my classmates as a &#39;headlight&#39; (as in a car headlight). The headlight zipped away at tremendous speed, and was out of sight within seconds. What i have written here constitutes the majority of the actual experience. If this information is helpful and/or in line with current theory and phenomena, and you feel that additional information would help, i will leave my contact information. In addition to what i have written here, I feel that i have much more to add, but do not wish to waste your time with something that can only be invalid from an informed perspective. I have not disclosed this information to any other source. If i do not receive a reply i will assume that your judgement of the facts is such that this account could only be false, or merely &#39;all in my mind&#39; as my brothers would say. I thank you for your time.<n>

Wide band around center w/ rows of lights flashing different colors, many small lights. Smoke color windows. Could see figures moving inside.  Approx. 15&#39; up over Bank parking lot.  Stayed and moved little then shot off so fast it almost just dissappeared.  I was a young kid w/ my brother my dad(an ex Army Paratrooper Korea 11th. Airborne)my sister.  Many people working and banking at the bank and driving by.200 calls to report to police.  We were told it was a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went to the bank my dad sister brother and myself. I was young.  The date could be a year or more off due to this fact.  Size could also be affected due to my age.  As we waited at the drive thru tellers window there was a car in front of us in line, It just sort of came over us and just was there sitting there over us in the sky about 15&#39;-20&#39; above the lot.  It was a silver saucer shaped and I would guess (NOW) about 10&#39; - 15&#39; in diameter.  I remember the lights around the center band.  My brother remembers the way it was crafted of metal (he said kind of riveted together in sheets.  My sister I don&#39;t even remember her being with us.  My dad (He passed away in Aug. 1977 when I was 14 years old.) told my mom when we got home a few minutes later (all excited) what we had seen and reported it to the police,that he had seen shapes of figures moving around inside.  The people in the lot outside ,we all got out of our cars.  People inside of the bank came outside or were climbing further up into the tellers window to get a better view.  This thing was silent but seemed to have a kind of a feeling to it that you just were made aware that it was there. Is this a vibration?  I don&#39;t know what you would explain this as.  It stayed there over top of us then moved lightly to either side then just went away so fast that you just really didn&#39;t see it leave although you never took your eyes off of it except maybe to see how the other people around you were reacting to this event that was taking place.  I hope someone else has discussed this event so I can get an adults point of view on it.  After that day we (my family) never talked about it again.  This fact bothers me to this day (i&#39;m 36 years old now) almost as much as the sighting itself.  There was an article published in the Vineland Times Journal (now the Daily Journal)<n>

My energy was especially intense so it seemed like the mountain top was a good place to go to campout, meditate and relax. The weather was beautiful and there was not a cloud in the sky. A handful of early arrivals and people who lived there gathered on the porch of the main house by the trees. We played music and sang as the sun set and the stars began to appear. Then something happened that was the most unusual thing that I have ever seen. A phenomenal bright light appeared over the tree tops between the garden and the house.  Amazed and curious, I walked out from under the porch and trees to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Look at that light!&#34; I exclaimed to the others as they began to notice it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was awesome!  We found ourselves looking at a huge, round, pure, white light as big as a mansion, hovering over the retreat.  One of the men who lived there grew afraid and went into his house.  I was feeling so euphoric that nothing could have frightened me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rest of us watched silently or whispered comments to each other.  There were no other sounds; no breeze; nothing but the white light against a dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made it a point to remember this moment in every detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first the light was very close, just above the tree tops, but gradually it began to expand and move up and across the horizon toward the west.  I could see was no spacecraft. It was just ‘light’ which began to fade in brilliance as it expanded.  Gradually the ‘light’ individuated.  Where once was a solid ‘light’, millions of individual ‘lights’ became distinct. They covered a full quarter of the sky. The lights got farther and farther away until they faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aside from a few comments by the others who were watching, there were no other sounds. Neither the sound of a breeze blowing across the sky nor the rustling of leaves could be heard, for there was no wind. I saw no clouds in the sky and the moon was not yet up. I was now so dark out I had to use my flashlight in order to find my way to my sleeping bag.  I would like to hear from the others who saw it with me. ((name and e-address deleted))<n>

They stopped and got out of the vehicle and observed said craft for at least 15 minutes.  The craft was emitted a low-pitched hum with a reverberating tone to it.  There were no lights on the object.  The object then began to emit a louder humming tone and began to tilt from a horizontal position to a vertical position.  Then the object lifted up and out of sight in a very rapid fashion.  There was no wind, no heat, no radiation burns, no known magnetic effects, no effect on the vehicle or any other objects around the vicinity.  The two brothers were excited but frightened by the experience.  They returned home and  woke up everyone to inform them of what they had just experienced.  They have subsequently re-told this story in identical fashion for years and have never had any other comparable experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I saw a starlike object stationary for 2 minutes which then moved slowly to the right.The object then stopped in mid flight for about a minute. It did this two more times before flying out of sight behind the trees. My friend and I both saw the object while in my car.The object could be seen very well.With fifty other cars at the movie it&#39;s foolish to think we were the only ones to see it. It flew right above the screen. The object was a single point of light.<n>
9/1/75 22:00|Valencia|CA|Oval|15 minutes|In Valencia, Ca. the craft I was watching, was watching me.|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53449.html|21|ndxe197509| In Valencia, Ca. the craft I was watching, was watching me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is now known as the Santa Clarita Valley use to have a lot of farm land and rolling hills covered in Oaks in 1975. I am not sure about the exact date; but in the housing tract known as Old Orchard One, in Valencia, California, I had been waiting up for my Mother to come home from a late night Bible Study Group. I fell asleep on our exceptionally large sofa. I woke up sometime around 10pm; my Mother had covered me with a comfy blanket and was asleep on the other end of the sofa. I got up from the sofa and went down the hall to the bathroom. I then walked to the kitchen getting myself a glass of water from the sink. Instead of going to my room, I went back to the living room, pulled the covers over me, and curled up on the sofa; I glanced out our large dinning room windows, noticed the street light, and turned towards the wall. Eyes wide open; I remembered cleaning leaves from the neighbor’s lawn, and tidying up the garage that summer for spending cash. &#34;There was no street light there.?!&#34; I rolled over and saw a large oval shaped, what looked liked a silver metal color, craft. It had head lights, like those on a big rig, I could see detail, and the lights appeared to be spaced, going all the way around the outer rim of the craft. The lights changed colors; blue, red, green, white. It made no sound that I could hear. It sat about three feet above the neighbor’s roof, and covered the entire roof. The neighbor is aprox. one home over and across a street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself, “no one is going to believe this.” I even questioned in my mind, would people even believe my Mother. I knew, my Father being of a logical nature, people would be more likely to believe him. My instinct was to wake my Father, but he was in the back bedroom, down the hall. I slowly moved the covers down and slowly sat up, the craft moved up in the air slightly, so I slowly laid back down, the craft coming  down to its original position. I sat there a moment, starring at the craft and wondering, I repeated the same action, again the craft followed by movements moving upward and returning as I laid back down. Okay, I thought, the craft appears to be mimicking my movement; “this thing is watching me.” I kept watching the craft and thinking what to do, I did not want to be the only witness. I slowly sat up a third time and again, simultaneously, the craft moved up higher into the air, so I laid back down, the craft returning to a hovering position over the roof. I decided to wake my Mother gently; I kicked her foot several times with mine, until she stirred. My Mother, now slightly awake, responded. I asked her in a whisper, &#34;Mom don&#39;t move, just listen. Are your awake?&#34; My Mother replied, &#34;Yes.&#34; I told my Mother to very slowly roll over and look out the dining room window, but not to make any sudden movements. Well, she rolled over slowly just fine, the scream that followed and the jumping up and running towards the dinning room window wasn&#39;t part of the plan. The craft went straight up into the air, dimmed, went bright, then, I know this sounds strange, but the craft made itself look like a star. Dad came running but didn&#39;t understand why our knees were shaking looking at a star. We called the Sheriff and tried to explain, but it sounded so strange, we just decided to hang up. We watched what looked like a star move with the rest of the stars until dawn. Several nights thereafter, at around 10pm, in the sky, in the same general area, a light would come in dim at first, go extremely brig! ht, and then appear to be just another star. We decided to keep the curtains closed after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The morning after the incident, I stood in our yard, and looked at the spot where the craft had been and said out loud, &#34;tell my baby I Love them.&#34;  I have no explanation why I said that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I am not a UFO hunter, never will be, don&#39;t want people bothering me, but for the record, so others know, our children had “close encounters.” We don’t discuss the matter much, we just know these incidents did happen. We live our life with all the joy God gave us, and realize what can you do? You can’t change it, you can’t really talk about it, and you don’t want anyone to know, so “it” just happened,  and we’re okay, we don’t live in fear and still enjoy looking at a beautiful night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

From the backyard you could see the stadium in the distance, it was dark out but a very clear sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone went out to watch the blimp over the stadium, after awhile everyone except me a my younger sister went back inside, we went around to the front of the house which faces east.  There are tv towers on the same hill my granparents live on, to the south we saw a group of lights slowly approaching, at first I thought it was the blimp but as it got closer I could tell that it wasnt. The body itself blended into the night sky, but it had what best looked like passenger windows on an airplane, but they were slowly revolving around the side of the object with a soft flourescent like light emitting from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Without a sound it very slowly hovered around a tv tower that was no more than a 1/4 mile away, it had dropped down about 20 feet lower than the top of the tower, moved around it and then stopped for a second and then headed back in the direction it came moving very slow and quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had dismissed it thinking I was too young to know what I was looking at and as I got older I dismissed it thinking i hadnt seen it at all but merely dreamt it, then at a recent family gathering my sister asked me if I remembered seeing the ufo when were kids, which I had figured that since she was four years younger than me, there would be no way she would remember it, but she described the experience exactly as I had remembered. The object seemed to be about 30 feet long and the way the lights moved around it suggested it was saucer shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
