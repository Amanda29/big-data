Afterwards the light just disappeared ( from our position looking like it went &#39;really fast&#39; in the opposite direction we were looking)  We both waited and watched for another 15 minutes in case it was an aircraft, and it would just appear again not far from were it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perfectly clear night, no clouds.

We stopped the car at a clear, treeless point on the highway. It appeared to be about 40 or 50 feet off the ground and resembled a long line of spilt mercury. It at first appeared to be about the length and diameter on a Dc-10 sized jet with no wings or tail, then it got longer and appeared to separate into 2 objects (one shorter than the other). It instantaneously disappeared when a third friend in the back seat (who couldnt see anything on the horizon at all) raised his camera to snap the area. It was there then it was gone, I didnt blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

We arrived at Teotihuacan around 1:00 in the afternoon.  Nothing unusual happened that day.  We climbed the Pyramid of the Sun, took some photos, and took a taxi back to Mexico City. Six months ago, I purchased a scanner to add some photographs to my web site.  As I was looking for pictures to scan in from my photo album, I noticed something unusual in one of the pictures.  There appeared to be some sort of speck in the sky above the Pyramid of the Sun. Under magnification, the speck appears to be some sort of disk-shaped object. The photograph was taken using a Ricoh KR-5 Super II 35 mm camera and a 35-70 zoom lens.  The film was T-MAX 400 ASA.<n>

Earlier my husband saw a large meteo to the the south of our house. About 45 minutes later I was looking up and saw what seemed to be a transparent vessel that had a few windows that were lit up. The vessel did not have any sound. It was flying just above the power lights. It was very low and was about three houses down from our home. We could only see one side of the ufo and appeared to be rectangle. It was very hard to see but could tell there was something there. The lights in the windows were white. It was flying south to north. At one point when I was turning off the hot tub to see if we could here any sound my husband saw a bright light shoot out from the front of the ufo for just a split second.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very hard to see because it was transparent for only the lights you could see in the windows of the vessel. My husband told me to turn off the hot tub. There wasn&#39;t any sound. From where we were sitting it looked like it was rectangle but it was very low and we could only see one side. It was flying directly over power lines coming from the south and going north.  My husband had gotten in the hot tub 5 minutes before me.  When I came out my husband said that I had just missed the neatest meteo. It was about 45 minutes later that we both saw the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Eadh &#34;wing&#34; of the &#34;V&#34; consisted of approximately 10 objects, each about the size of a small star.  Each side of the &#34;V&#34; was swept about 10 degrees behind the straight line oriented perpendicular to the line of flight of the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation had a very high angular velocity, and the observers estimate was that they were moving at a very high speed.  He stated that they looked like a formation of jet fighters, but there was no sound.  The formation was moving faster than a formation of fighters would have been moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observer watched them pass through approximately 15 degrees of arc, moving from west to east--toward the lights of Houston to the east of his position--when they disappeared from his sight because of the brightness of the ambient light.<n>

It was 15 degrees to the draver&#39;s right, and 30 degrees above the horizontal, and it was hovering totally motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object clearly appeared to be rotating, and it occasionally would reflect sunlight, as if it had a flat side on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observer pulled off the highway and stopped.  As he was watching it, the object instantly just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The caller was trained in the military in photo analysis, and perhaps other specialties.  He was very precise in his description, using very unambiguous terms, and the proper use of angles, rather than distances. Also, he served in the UN forces in 1979 with the Peace Keeping Mission, arising out of the Camp David Accords.<n>

Our living room faced north and the west wall of the living room was almost completely glass.  One night (either Mar 22 or 29) we were watching TV (Yes, The X Files - I was afraid to put that in, but it was the truth) on the couch next to the west wall and my husband calmly points to the window and says, &#34;What is that?&#34;  I looked and about 40 ft directly above our backyard was a horseshoe shaped object, just sitting in the air, with several flashing colored lights on its underside.  The object had a rounded edge above the lights all the way around the part we could see, and from there it more or less stair-stepped up to a conical structure with the point cut off.  We immediately shut off the TV to listen to it, but it made no sound.  It seemed as though it was staring at us (the lights in our living room were very low so we could easily see outside).  Suddenly it started to slowly rise (still making no sound)until it was about 150 ft above our house and then it moved so fast it basically disappeared shooting across the sky in a northeasterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date in March 1996 are approximate.

I think it may be a secret government program to manufacture flying sausers since Lockheed Martin makes secret things for the government like the Apache heliocopter and integrated GPS for cruise missles has a major plant about 5 miles west of here and very often tests its planes over Apalachin. The disk was mostly white and had some black on the bottom. The disk came out of the west (maybe from Lockheed, which is to the west), and flew extremaly slowly to the northeast. There were no clouds that day in the early spring, so it could not be a cloud. During this sighting, I felt notably warmer and some snow melted. It left no trails and made no sound. I do not think there were any people near<n>

One woman, who was looking at the object with some form of magnification, stated that it looked like it had &#34;seven panels&#34; on the bottom of it.  The caller stated that it looked like it had two headlights on it, with a bar running down the middle, perhaps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one is confusing!!

I had gotten lost earlier in the day and ended up on Highway 90 moving up the West Texas coast.  I was way off course...and stopped at the intersection of Highway 90, which became Texas Highway 54, and I-10.  I stopped to get coffee before making the decision of staying on the main highway or the short-cut.  I encountered three people outside the cafe who suggested I not take Texas Route 54.  I decided to take this route since it would cut many hours off of my journey...so I could get to the slopes the next day. The road was isolated...I saw no traffic or animals...it was flat...and teh sky was incredibly clear...I noticed to the left in the sky, that one of the &#34;stars&#34; was moving...it seemed to flit back and forth in the sky...I thought I was imagining things...but I had made myself agree not to stop on the road, let alone at night for no reason...since I am female and traveling alone.  I then felt heat on my face, from the object in the sky.  In the distance on this flat road I could see head lights...it was a sort of reassuring thing that I was not alone...the head lights did not seem to get any closer...I realize there are optical illusions on flat roads...I&#39;ve lived in Texas too long.  Then the lights became very, very bright, blinding.  I did not know what to do...if I moved to the left...a car could be oncoming...and if I went to the right I would be in a ditch...so I slowed down...and the very large wave of bright, white light engulfed me and the car...my body had an electrical discharge...I just kept driving straight...it last a few minutes (I think) and then to my left I saw the trailer of an 18 wheeler which was so close it made my car shake.  I took my cat with me who had been sleeping in the back of the car...after all this happened I noticed him sitting in the front...unaffected...awake...just looking at me...then went back to sleep for the rest of our journey.  I was terrified....because of the light, because of almost making the decision to change lanes and so close to being crushed by this truck. I did not report this because...well, I told a few people...and they thought I was crazy...I have been in psyhotherapy of some years as it was...no crazy per say...but many issues...so I decided not to set myself up for ridicule.   Since this time in 1996, I have resolved much of the stuff in my life...and now I want to know more about what happened to me on the desert road...if there any other similar reports...anything at all... P.S. My car was not new...but it never ran better than it did that night...it was as if the tires were not even on the ground...sort of floating.<n>

3/15/96 01:30|Cotati|CA|Sphere|approx. 2 minutes|Small, clear orb that floated up the hood of our car and up the window without changing shape or being affected by engine heat.|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79651.html|38|ndxe199603| Small, clear orb that floated up the hood of our car and up the window without changing shape or being affected by engine heat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happening took place in 1996, in a small town called Cotati, which is located in Sonoma County, California. It is a small, very liberal and Utopian township that is very close to Sonoma State University, the university I graduated from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just finished playing a gig what was then called the Inn of the Beginning, and my friend Mark was giving me a ride home.  It was pretty late, at least 1am I&#39;d say; very few cars on the road, no businesses open except a few bars beginning to close down. We got into Mark&#39;s Honda Civic and began to head down Main Street, toward the Highway 101 on ramp toward Santa Rosa.  I specifically remember that we were right by the gas station that is across the street from Backdoor Records (for those of you who might be familiar with Cotati).  I remember seeing just one car on the road, and it was pulling out from the gas station and onto the road, about 200 feet in front of us.  It was a big, old American car, something like a Chevy Nova, early 1970s model.  In other words, nothing special about the car, and I did happen to get a very good look at it. I have a fairly visual memory and can usually remember physical details of images I see very well.  Anyway, the relevance of the car is ju! st to show that it was the only car on the road and it didn&#39;t look like any kind of government vehicle. Of course, that means nothing right? hahaha   Onward with the story.  Not more than a few seconds later at best guess, everything seemed to just stop.  I saw an orb, perfectly circular in shape. I will now separate each of the details of what I saw, so that nothing gets lost: -  It appeared to be about 12-14 inches wide, or I guess had a circumference of about 20-30 inches or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very similar in color and design to that of a giant soap bubble.  If you have ever messed around with one of those big giant soap bubble toys, you know what I mean.  It even had what looked like the oily pinkish color displays that a soap bubble typically has. [see the top for a picture of what I am thinking] -  Unlike a soap bubble though, this thing did not move in the air like blob, slowly morphing its shape as a result of the shifting wind and heat.  This thing was absolutely solidly round, perfectly round. It did not change shape at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There did not appear to be anything inside of it, like some kind of motor, or anything else you can imagine. It was basically see through I think, but yet we were not looking through it.  I&#39;ll explain that in a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is what actually took place, once Mark and I saw the bubble. To lay out the basics of the event, it is important to say that Mark and I did not compare notes on what we saw until after we saw it. In other words, we did not say to one another &#34;are you seeing what I&#39;m seeing?&#34; We didn&#39;t talk to each other until after the entire event was over. And here&#39;s how the event took place from my personal perspective, and what I later found out to be essentially the same experience had by Mark:  Just when I started to look at the bubble - or whatever the hell is was - and actually take notice of its characteristics on a more precise level, time seemed to stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it sounds weird, but it was like I lost all sense of time, motion, location, etc. ALL I COULD DO WAS STARE AT THE IMAGE. That said, it was not like I felt as though I was being forced to stare at the image. Instead, it was like I had no desire to do anything but stare at the image, making no judgments or even taking the initiative to think to myself what it might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stared intently at the image, it very slowly and what seemed to be deliberately, began to move up the hood of the car. It moved as straight as an arrow and even kept what appeared to be an exact distance away from the metal of the hood, hovering no more than 2 inches off the metal! At this point, I was still not making any judgments about the object, nor wondering about it or anything. All I did was watch it, very calmly, following its slow movement with my eyes more intently than I remember ever watching anything else in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb continued to move up the hood of the car, coming closer to the windshield. When it reached the top of the hood, where the windshield meets the metal, it simply changed course and moved up the windshield in exactly the same manner it moved up the hood. That is, it moved right up the middle of the windshield, literally bisecting its width, and still at about 1-2 inches above the glass. It moved at the same speed and trajectory over the glass as it did over the metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as with the rest of the time the orb was in site, I simply watched intently with my eyes. Suddenly, the orb was gone, or at least it had gone up the window, past the view of our eyes. I remember looking out the back window to see if it was going to come down the window in the same way it came up the front window, but it was nowhere in site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, here&#39;s where it all gets a little freaky.  When I realized that the orb was no longer in site, I looked over at Mark and then to the road.  The car was simply cruising at the minimum speed, at whatever speed it moves when you put it in DRIVE and don&#39;t press the accelerator.  Mark&#39;s foot was off the pedal even.  There were still no cars on the road, and nothing around us had seemed to change. The car in front of us, the Nova or whatever it was, had gone. So obviously we were cruising long enough for that car to get on the freeway via the ramp that was now about 100 feet in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked over at Mark and said something to the effect of, &#34;Did you see that thing?&#34;   We began to compare notes.  Both of us saw exactly the same thing, moving in exactly the same way. Here&#39;s the crazy part:  BOTH OF US LOST TOTAL SENSE OF TIME. NEITHER OF US HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY MINUTES HAD GONE BY WHILE WE WATCHED THIS THING MOVE ALONG THE CAR. We looked at the clock, and we both estimated that at least four or five minutes, maybe as many as 9 minutes had passed.  Point is, we were totally unaware of time, place and movement while that thing was in our sights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I did some quick research on the web and found the Satellite came down on March 12 1996 at 11:05pm EST. As I recall, I saw the UFO at about 5.30pm UK time and I think the satellite had come down around midday but I didn&#39;t know this at the time of the sighting. I was walking home from the bus stop after college, it was dark but the street lights were still an orange colour as they were still warming up. I glanced up at the moon and a light to the right of it caught my eye, it was the same colour orange as the street lights but was bigger and at about twice their height. I stopped and stared at it, trying to figure out if it was a light on a crane or something but as well as being illuminated it also seemed to have a spherical metallic surface and I started to think maybe it was a helium balloon. Then it started to move, it floated up with a slight arc (not straight up) and seemed to be swallowed up by darkness. I lost sight of it and continued walking, still looking up in case I could see it again. I then noticed some small misty white lights above me, as I looked at them I suddenly realised that they were arranged around the sides of a huge black shape which was blocking out the stars. I&#39;m about 95% sure that it was triangular, it definitely had straight edges and there were 5 lights as I remember. The object pretty much filled my whole field of vision which combined with the fact that it was a black object against a black sky made it hard to be 100% sure about the number of sides. There was also a rectangle of light in the center but it was like light reflecting off a flat raised section rather than a light source, the long edges of the rectangle were sharp and the short ones were more diffuse. The object passed directly over me from right to left, rotating very slowly. It was completely silent, and I&#39;d estimate it was flying or rather floating at roughly treetop level. Altitude and size are pretty hard to judge from below but I would estimate it was about the size of a house and the orange sphere was about the size of a beach ball or maybe a bit bigger. The triangle(?) slowly gained altitude and I lost sight of it as it passed over the houses to my left. I kept looking for it as I continued home but all I saw were the lights from normal air traffic which wer! e at a m uch higher altitude than the object I had seen. I kept an eye on the local press for a few weeks afterwards but I am not aware that anyone else saw this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

To this day, I still do not know what they were.  I had not seen anymore since I had seen the last one.  I would love to know what the three bright dots in the sky were if they were actually alien UFOs or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 9, 1996, my parents went out and I was home alone.  I went out to have a cigarette at 9:05pm.  As usual, I looked up in the sky and saw something very peculiar. I saw a glowing orange dot between Canis Major and Orion Constellations.  At first, I did not know what it was so I thought it was a star.  I saw it move southward so I thought it was a planet, but it was moving fast to be a planet.  So, I had thought it was either a US military plane or a UFO (which it was in the literal sense of the word).  After a few seconds, it just vanished.  I had always wondered what it could have been. I told my parents about it and they laughed at me about it. I told few of my friends about it and one or two believed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A year and a half later so it was summertime, a friend and I went to my parentsâ€™ house to visit my parents.  We decided to go out to have a cigarette.  We came to an opening in the fence that led to the pathway and the train since my parents lived by the train station.   When we got to the opening in the fence, I saw the glowing orange dot in the sky again and told my friend to look.  We both saw it and it was moving east, instead of south. Like the first one, it also vanished.  We were very puzzled and wondered what it could be. I told him that I had seen the same thing a year and a half ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On December 26, 1999, my parents and I went to my fatherâ€™s best friendâ€™s house in Minnesota. I went out for a cigarette and as usual, I looked up into the sky.  This time, I saw a very bright white dot in the sky.  I knew that it could not have been Venus or Jupiter because it was too bright to be a planet.  I was wondering what it could have been. I had heard that you could see the Russian space station from the ground.<n>

Thats what made me come out side to see what was going on .The really wierd thing about it was that it made not a sound as it moved over our hay fields very slowly and blocked the lights from lake los angeles as it moved towards the east . We are between lockheed in Lancaster, ca. and a secret base on the east end of palmdale blvd. No one seems to know what goes on at that base so Im not sure what or where it came from. I told my father inlaw about it the next day and he didnt seem to be suprised about it. He was retired from lockeed and had worked on the sr71&#39;s. He believed me and so i was relieved because i had begun to think i had dreamed it but I know for sure I saw what I saw. It spooked me so bad i couldnt sleep after that.<n>

Very &#34;HOT DAY &#34; in SanDiego.My cottage was very hot when i went inside. I opened the doors&amp; windows, turnedon couple of fans,then went outside to wait until the place cooled off. I was standing inthe yard, (HIGH ON A HILLSIDE OVER-LOOKING THE VALLEY ) I first noticed a &#34;RED &#34;light way -off in the distance , Looking toward MEXICO. I kept looking at the BRITE LIGHT ,wondering if this was one of the &#34;HUGHIES &#34;the millatery had warned were to pass over our valley, soon.(This was on the NEWS) As the light came closer, only a few miles away now, &#39;IT&#39; seemed to be &#34;HUGE&#34;, VERY BRITE, and &#34;NO SOUND &#34; at all.?? I kept watching, it kept coming. I had watched it for about FIFTEEN minutes, now.WHEN it came into the VALLEY, IT seemed to be &#34;FLOATING &#34; COULDNT SEE ANY SHAPE IT WAS SO TERRIBLEY BRITE    . I watched in amazement. HUGE-NO SOUND-SO BRIGHT that it HURT my eyes to look at it. IT was still barely  light outside. The SUN wasin the process of going down.  I was so CONFUSED at WHAT THIS COULD POSSIBLEY BE .  IT was just barely over the tree tops , &amp; telephone Poles now. It went directly over the SIX LANE HIWY. below my place. Went on over the HILL to my left, that is where the BARONA INDIAN RESERVATION is.THE NEXT DAY , I MEASURED THE HWY &gt;WHERE IT WENT OVER. THE AREA WAS APROX. 100 ft .wide.  I HAD NO PHONE,  I had no film in my camera, my car had been borrowed, neighbors all gone out. WHAT TO DO ?   I did nothing. I felt like I shouldnt say anything , at work the next day. I have been rediculed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from the same source in Washington State.

This is when I started to call her back and I checked my watch real quick, out of habit to see how long she had been outside and I noticed it was seven o&#39;clock exactly. I then turned my eyes quickly towards the sky and I noticed a strange light formation moving strangley in the sky, as if weaving back and forth. The object held my attention I could not take my eyes away from it. It was what appeared to me after a few seconds I blinked and I wavered a bit as if dizzy. I then shook my head and looked down to see my dog watiting for me at the bottom of the stairs as if she had been there the whole time. When I turned to go into the house I checked my watch and the time now showed it was now nine o&#39;clock. I had been outside for three hours, and it only appeared to me as if it had been only 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
