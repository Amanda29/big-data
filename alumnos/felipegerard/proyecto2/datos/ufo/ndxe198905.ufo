Here&#39;s one I had years ago and didn&#39;t know where to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking at night in our small rural town, I was stargazing as I walked and noticed a bright gold light approaching from the south. At first I thought it was a star, but quickly remembered that there are no stars like that in the southern sky and planets are never as low in the sky where I first spotted it. It gave the appearance of Jupiter, all gold and glowing steadily. I think the reason I didn&#39;t think of it as an &#34;moving object&#34; at first was because it was approaching so slowly. Then I noticed the movement against a tree limb. I watched until the light started to elongate, this was due to it&#39;s coming nearer, I don&#39;t believe it changed shape. When it got close enough, I could see that it was a rectangular shape. For some reason I think it decended as it neared the town... My mouth dropped open when I could distinguish two dark, backlit shapes in the &#34;window&#34;. They were human-looking in size and were visible from the waist up. Since the gold light was so strong behind them, I could see no features. Just the shape of heads and shoulders. They were side by side, not quite touching. There was absolutely no noise. There was also no other shape discernable that I can recall. It is strange that I can remember no other details or the exact time I saw this or really how long it lasted. I only remember watching the approach and looking up and being in awe. When the &#34;craft&#34; was almost out of my sight range to the north, I shook my head to clear it, and ran to a nearby gas station to see if anyone else had witnessed what I had. They were closed. I couldn&#39;t find anyone, anywhere! I felt like I was alone in town... I ran back home, which was close and found binoculars but the light, by this time, only looked like a slowly dimming gold dot, in the binoculars. I remember telling my family about this and my Dad told me that he had seen almost the identical thing in Eugene, Oregon, back in the early 70&#39;s, only the window that was lit up on the craft he saw was bluish. I will have him report his sighting. Interesting that they are so similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We first thought it was a helicopter, but it stayed in one spot. We watched it, and it seemed to be watching us. Someone knocked on our door,  I turned to door, turned back to object. Then it suddenly moved quickly to right, then sharply turned to left and disappeared out over ocean. It seems that SanDiego, and especially, Point Loma was very active at that time. Some of my tennants were walking the next evening, and said a bright light was following,and they said that they ran back to apartment , and it stopped at the door when they entered the building.  They did not know of our experience the afternoon before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The center of the craft was dark and blended in with the night.  The craft was outlined with white lights. There was no sound at all coming from the craft. This night was particularly dark and calm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone in the house saw the craft and was too afraid to approach it, so we all watched from the window. A member of the family called the police dept.. During the wait for police, the craft remained still and lit (approx. 75 yards away from the house).  The fire dept. showed up as well as the police in around 20 minutes.  Both the fire and police dept. got out of their vehicles and approached the craft but they only got to the fence when the craft disappeared leaving a ring of fire in a perfect circle that remained in a circle and did not spread in or out of the lines.  The police and fire dept. gave us no explantion,left without questioning anyone and we heard no reports on the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day the burnt circle in the field remained.  The farmer who owned the land questioned my family about the mysterious circle.  We gave him our explanation and he did not believe us. After it was all over the circle remained as a chilling reminder of that night and for everyone to see that passed by on the road. We have never reported this to anyone other than family or friends for fear of disbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The house that we lived in at this time was a very old house, about 100 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to this event, many other mysterious things happened here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Family included; me, 8 years old, My Mother, Father, Grandmother, and Uncle.  We were all witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object made absolutely no sound, it had 5 white lights underneath in a V shape, it moved extreemly slowly. Two other witnesses were present, a teacher and another student. We were all just standing there staring at this thing as it slowly slipped behind Mt. Algo. The thing that seemed most strange to us was that it was HUGE and yet made no sound!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to have the witness have the other witnesses submit reports, as well.

5/15/89 22:00|Ridgecrest|CA|Fireball|10 seconds|Fireball object SouthWest of Ridgecrest, CA, drops below hills and disappears.|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24201.html|5|ndxe198905| Fireball object SouthWest of Ridgecrest, CA, drops below hills and disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened approximately 10 years ago, so my details on the exact time and date are a bit sketchy.  It was sometime around 10 pm in the spring/summer time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were driving west on Downs Blvd (he was driving, I was in passenger seat), moving into the Ridgecrest Heights area (which is very dark at night at this time).  Sky was cloudy and had been sprinkling earlier, clouds approximately 3000 to 4000 feet.  There were no aircraft that were discernable in the sky below the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time, we both suddenly noticed a bright, fireball-like object that appeared to come down from the cloud level and drop below the level of the hills to the SouthWest of town.  It&#39;s color was a deep reddish-orange.  It seemed to drop much slower than an object on fire would fall.  The object lit up the clouds and hills below it as it dropped, and once below the hills disappeared.  Due to the distance (approximately 5 miles from where we were driving) I was not completely certain, but it appeared to NOT be trailing smoke at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend turned to me and asked &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  I confirmed that I had.  We both discussed it for a few more minutes, initially thinking perhaps it was an aircraft from nearby China Lake Naval Weapons Center that had gone down... but rejected this thought later as there was no flash or explosion or otherwise once the object fell below the hills, nor was there any sound of explosion at all (we would have heard it from the distance we were at I am certain).  The color of the object also bothered me, as the fire on most burning aircraft is much lighter... yellowish orange.  As I worked on the China Lake site for a Government contractor at the time, I assumed that it would be common knowledge of a plane went down from either China Lake or Edwards Air Force Base... however, no one I talked to had heard of the incident, and no aircraft was reported to have gone down at that time.  Not sure what the object was... and had forgotten about it until I found this site.  Initially I dismissed it as some strange anomaly, but after reading more and more of the sightings posted here, I have become fairly convinced that my friend and I witnessed some sort of craft that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A quick note on the hills in question - These hills are largely rolling hills West of town and have little real height.  Ridgecrest sits in the bottom of the China Lake valley, so seeing beyond the hills is impossible when in the town itself.  However, due to their small height, any large explosion or other like flash would easily be seen above / behind these hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background info - I am currently a 33 year old male who grew up in Ridgecrest (living now in WA State).  I am a Computer / Network Systems Analyst.  I grew up in Ridgecrest, and was always fascinated by aircraft.  As a result of living near China Lake and Edwards AFB, I was able to determine the silhouete of just about any US aircraft at close and distant ranges.  Working on site at China Lake I also was privy to viewing testing of missiles, bombs,  and other such weapons, which accustomed me to seeing burning aircraft in flight and falling debris from such tests.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I wasnt really involved in the conversation and happened to look up. WHen I did I immediatly saw 3 lights in the shape of a triangle moving very fast but didnt make any noise nor did it have any blinking lights. I yelled &#34;What is that!!!&#34;. At nearly the same time my friend Mark saw it and we both started running after it while pointing up in the sky saying &#34; look! look!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some how our other two friends never saw it but I never forgot it. I was 12 years old then and I&#39;m 29 now and have just seen a show on UFO&#39;s that included sightings just like mine. I never believed in the ability of a ET to travel the incredible distance to Earth due to the mind boggeling amount of energy needed and time. But after careful research and my own sighting of a UFO I guess I can no longer rule it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also hoping that maybe someone else in Northern VA may have seen the same thing. If so POST IT!!!! I want to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was a student at Arizona State University and was driving home to Omaha after the Spring semester.  It was dusk (almost dark) as I went Eastbound on I-40.  I do not think I had crossed into New Mexico yet; I was not near any town at the time of the sighting.  I was driving a 1987 Pontiac Fiero (with the fuel-injected 6 cyl.) on cruise control at about 70 mph.  There were no other cars nearby.  Out of the corner of my right eye I caught sight of an airborne craft slowly overtaking me just off to the right side of the interstate.  The area where I was driving was quite flat.  I could not immediately identify the craft, but it had a rotating beacon underneath and a few other lights on it.  It was no more than 500 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was &#34;this must be a cropduster following the highway to go home.&#34;  I kept switching my gaze between the craft and the road, trying to identify the craft.  I am quite good at identifying aircraft in the sky.  With each look, however, I became more intrigued because nothing looked right.  I could not make out position lights at the wing tips, and the rotating beacon (which cast light on the underside of the craft) was multile colors, including blue and white.  I could not make out the edges of the bottom side of the craft, though I got the impression it was bascially circular.  The lit portion of the underbelly appeared grey.  The craft was about the size of a modern-day jet fighter perhaps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now very intrigued I sped up and caught closed the distance between me and the craft some.  My plan was to stop quickly, shut off my engine, hop out of the car, and listen for engine noise.  A radial engine, for example, sounds much different than a horizontally-opposed engine.  By the time I got out of my car the craft had proceeded away to a distance of less than 1/4 mile.  If it were a conventionally-powered aircraft of that size I could certainly have heard it.  The winds were calm on the ground.  I heard nothing.  Now I was very, very intrigued.  I jumped back in the car and gave chase along I-40.  I got up to about 100 mph and the craft appeared to be pacing me, not allowing me to approach it.  At that point I decided it was stupid to be going so fast and not paying attention to the road, so I began to slow down.  At that point the craft accelerated away and climbed.  The rate of acceleration was incredibly high.  The craft disappeared among the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The exact day is a best-guess.  Also, the year is not certain -- it could have been spring of 1988, 1989, or 1990.  However, I think it was 1989.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My immediate thought was that it was a helicopter because I knew of no other aircraft that could hover in one spot like it was doing. Suddenly it began to move. It traveled down at an angle towards the left then it abruptly stoped again. It hovered for a moment then, as if making a &#34;V&#34; shape, it moved upwards to the left, stoped and hovered once more. I then got up from my bed, scared, to retrieve my father who was sleeping down the hall. Half way to his bed room I stopped and thought he would think I was crazy, so I went back to see if it was my imagination. It was still there hovering when I went to the window, I watched it for a few more seconds before it sped to the right, out of view. I am 33 now and it is something I don&#39;t talk about often, but I will never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was asleep in the camper of my father&#39;s simi-truck. Him and my mother were inside a truck stop visiting with some of their friends. They left me in the truck because I was asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up and I wasn&#39;t in the truck any longer. I couldn&#39;t see the &#34;aliens&#34; very well. They were like a darker light amongst bright light. Everything was white. I couldn&#39;t see the rest of my body, and I remember being very cold. My right foot began to hurt on the left side. And then I was back in the truck. I climbed out of the camper, out of the truck, and into the parking lot. I looked up for some reason or another, and I saw three pinkish-red lights. They would zigzag around, and then stop in triangle shape, and then zigzag around again. Then they suddenly disappeared, and I ran into the truckstop and told my parents what happened. They dismissed it as a dream, but recall me telling them about it. I was only four, after all, and I didn&#39;t know what aliens or UFO&#39;s were. But I believe I have been abducted multiple times since them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of 1999 I had a surgery on my right foot, because it hurt all the time and the doctors&#39; x-ray showed something in it. They removed something out of my foot, as they called it, an extra bone, that shouldn&#39;t have been there. I think that the &#34;aliens&#34; put it there that first time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was late and I walked off the main highway on a paved road that ran perpendicular.  I had walked about half a mile.  It was pitch black that night only dim starlight but suddenly it got darker and that caused me to look up.  Above me was a huge triangle.  It was much longer along the back side than it was to the tip.  It&#39;s size to me was the most impressive,  I can only guess but it was very close to me and seemed to be at least a mile wide at the base of the triangle, which was the back of it and the longest part.  It had a dim,circular light at the tip and also on the right and left sides of the base of it.  No other lights and not a sound could I hear from the thing.  It was moving at first, it seemed, about 10-15 miles an hour at about 100ft in hight.  Then as it passed me it began to increase in speed, at first gradually, then seemed to accelorate beyond possiblity and was gone. Never a sound and the amazing thing was I was never scared at all which seems to me very odd.  Oh yea the thing was aparently black but I&#39;m not sure I could of seen a color it was so dark.  The lights had an off white or even yellow tent to them.  They were very dim.<n>

Thinking it was a very bright star, I continued to monitor it as I drove. Soon it separated into 3 distinct lights, &amp; I realized it was approaching. As it got closer I saw there were 3 lights, one at each corner of an aircraft. I stopped my truck in the middle of the road, &amp; got out to watch. The craft flew directly overhead, was maybe 40 feet across, and made no sound of note. It seemed to be just above the tops of the trees, &amp; I was puzzled that there would be no discernible engine noise. I don&#39;t recall being able to distinguish the surface of the craft, just seeing the three lights, &amp; the triangular shape as it passed overhead. I assumed it was something headed to the Little Rock Air Force Base, though as I said, it was so quiet, &amp; so low to the ground, that I was in awe. Unfortunately I never made note of this occurence, so I don&#39;t know the date. I assume it would be in the winter months, as the road is in a very wooded area, &amp; I remember seeing lots of clear space, as I do here when the trees are bare. The road, Dyer Street,  runs South of Malvern for about 4 miles... I stopped about 3 miles from Main Street to watch. I only can guess the year being between 1988 &amp; 1990 because I was driving the truck I owned at that time. I report this now because I have since heard of similar type craft being observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

It was moving due east directly over Sheppard AFB.  I live six blocks from the Sheppard Missle Road North entrance gate. There was no noise, no trail, or other characteristics.

My female friend  and I (male)(we were both students at the Univ. of Arizona at the time, living off campus), hopped on my motorcycle, a 1985 Honda 500cc Interceptor, and began pursuit, heading toward Phoenix on Interstate 10. I was riding in excess of 90 mph. They were out of site for several minutes, but became visible again once we cleared some hills south of Marana, AZ.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were 2 or three miles away toward the west..we took an offramp..Tangerine Rd..maybe..and continued high speed pursuit. They had decreased their altitude to about 100 feet above ground..i got within a quarter mile..they were dark gray..matte finish..no visible protrusions, holes, or lights..just plain gray cubes...traveling together..but moving independently,,bobbing up and down. They increased their speed to match ours apparently..never letting us get closer than about 1/4 mile. They settled over a rise in the road..and in the 12 to 15 seconds it took us to reach the rise they were no where in sight. I reported it to David Monthan AFB...after playing phone tag for 30 minutes,,mostly on hold, they told me that the giant cubes we saw were marker ribbons dropped by the Air Force.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Laurel Street in Richmond, Virginia, I observed the following.   (I recall it being in the mid-spring, and I remember it being a Tuesday, however as it has been so many years I may be off by up to one year.  i.e. I lived at that address for one whole year.)  As I walked due south on Laurel Street from Carey Street towards my home I noticed a slightly shiny object hovering over the pyramid in Hollywood cemetery.  The pyramid is about 90 feet tall; therefore I estimated the object to be hovering at about 120 feet.  Since I knew I was only 3 blocks from the pyramid I estimated the object to be about 20-30 feet long and about 8-10 feet tall.  The width of the object was not easily estimable but the cigar shape it appeared to have indicated it may have been about 10 feet wide at most.  It hovered silently.  A cigar shaped object with no lights or windows visible and a finish that looked similar to “brushed steel”, with a slight grain or texture to the entire craft.  It seemed to have a pointed end and a slightly rounder end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stopped and stared, it began to move south in a straight path with no altitude change, towards the river which was less than a mile away, and near my home.  I walked at the same pace as it moved while it continued the south, slowly and silently.  Then it stopped and appeared to open a window or peephole on the side facing me.  (It was on my right)  It picked up speed, as if changing from one gear to the next instantly.  I began running to keep up with it and proceeded to seemingly keep up for two or three blocks, so it was still only going a few miles per hour.  Then in an instant, right before it was over the riverbank, it made an angled right turn which turned it about 20-30 degrees to the right (west) and about the same angle in increased elevation while accelerating as a rate I would estimate to be thousands of miles per hour.  Poof!  Gone in a second or less.  I would often describe the angle and acceleration as “impossible”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion I would like to add that I made a few calls to the weather services, NASA, and other agencies in and around Virginia and Washington, D.C. attempting to find out more or report the incident and ran into a brick wall.  More than once I was told to “just drop it”.  At times I assumed it was some military test flight, but in the twenty years since it happened, nothing like it has been produced by our military so I have begun to rethink it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would describe myself at the time as a college student attending Virginia Commonwealth University.  The campus is only a few blocks from the location of the sighting.  I was about 23 years old.  Again, I may have the date off by as many as twelve months as I lived on Laurel Street from September of 1988-June 1989.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I studied communications, computer science and philosophy.  I have never before or since experienced anything like what I observed that day when I was walking home from class.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Object abruptly stopped over south end of speedway at approx 20-30,000 ft altitude and hovered for about 1 minute in an oscillating wobbling motion. It was almost as if whoever was in the craft stopped to see what was going on at this big event. Brought this to attention to friends sitting next to me and they saw it and could not explain it. Saw object through binaculars but still could not see any markings or features. Motion of this sort, the abrubt stop after streaking in from the west, would undoubtably kill a human being because of the abrupt force of the stop. After about a one minute hover, object streaked back to the west at just as fast as it came in and to the same direction it came and vanished. It was a clear day with just a few high clouds off to the north and west, so there was no obstruction. Event lasted less than 2 minutes. Object appeared silver as it approached, but when it was overhead, being high noon, it just looked black.<n>

A few weeks later when she developed the pictures a black craft appeared in two of the photos. It only appeared in the negative and the developed photo. She had seen nothing but the view of the sky and mounains nor heard or felt anything unusual when she took the photos. The object is a triangular shape with the corners &#34;removed&#34;; exactly the shape of the UFO reported by someone on this same website from the U.K.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [See in NUFORC database:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred : 3/12/1996 17:30 (Entered as : 03/12/96 17:30)<n> <n><n> Reported: 8/31/2001 05:33 Posted: 3/4/2003<n> <n><n> Location: Clacton-On-Sea, ]<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object is in a clear, blue sky approximately as high as a plane flying relatively low and about 20 miles away from downtown Sedona. An enlargement of the photo from the negative seemingly show two sides in motion - that is, a bit blurred, with one ( of the three sides) having a more defined line. I will send a copy of the enlarged photo as well as the smaller snapshot as soon as possible.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Looked as far away as other stars. Disappeared behind tall mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was nightime, so my friend was night fishing &amp; I was stargazing. That&#39;s when I noticed an entire constellation was moving. The speed was fast enough to catch my attention, but I was thinking what a great disguise. No one would have seen them if they had only taken a quick look at the sky. They appeared as any other stars, and far away. I regret I don&#39;t know names of constellations well enough to say where they were located.<n>

We ended up cooking out to watch the beautiful lights move and change.  It was on the news that people were witnessing this event but the reporters, police, etc. could not determine what is was nor did they follow up with other reports.  It was a documented situation throughout the city. My brother had a personal experience on this night while driving on the highway.  He and his friend personally witnessed an aircraft of some sort near the airport, hovering over their car.  Anyway, I just wanted to report this so that you could follow up perhaps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Now, the Cedar Rapids Airport was about 10 miles to the East, and at first I wanted to believe it was a plane, but it was silent. We were so scared we jumped into a bush as it passed overhead. It continued on across the field about a half a mile then made a 45 degree turn into the woods. We didn&#39;t see it again, but when we got inside and told his parents they mentioned seeing strange lights before also.<n>

Moved quickly to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving from Sacramento to Hanford with my brother, we noticed a bright light in the sky, not moving, with many planes flying around the object.  The lights were red and blue.  This is over an area close to the Lemoore Naval Air Station and I grew up in the area.  This is a very restricted area for aircraft so it made no sense to us why so many planes were in the sky at the time. We could see the object from as far away as Santa Nella.  As we continued sout on I-5, the object disappeared then reappeared off to the west over the Coastal Mountain Range.  All the planes which were flying around the object moved to the west towards the unknown light/object.  It was so startling that we pulled off to the side of the road, so did about 5 or so other cars.  The object eventually disppeared.  This thing moved faster than anything I am familiar with or know about and there were too many planes flying in a restricted area. I know others saw this. The year was 1988-1990. I was in college at UC Davis comng home to visit with parents.  I can&#39;t remember the exact year/date.<n>
