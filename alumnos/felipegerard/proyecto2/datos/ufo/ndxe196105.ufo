While we were marching, we all just stopped as we saw three bright lights approach us over water (04:00 hours am).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights seemed to come in close to us, and glow brighter as they approached.  All of a sudden, they grew smaller, and flew off in three different directions at great speed.  I THEN continued taking the troops to the mess hall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While there, one after the other marines who were with me, approached me and said (summary) &#34;you must tell the drill instructor what we saw.&#34;  I had no hope of surviving the day IF i told the drill instructor what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But when we arrived back at the barracks, I went to the drill instructors door, knocked, and he came out. After all the usual harrassment, he told me to step into his office.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I told the drill instructor what happened, he did the unexpected, and closed the door and talked to me like a human.  He invited all of the other troops who were with me into his office (after calling the other drill instructors into his office).  The other boots went in one-by-one, and also came out unscathed. &lt;&gt; IF YOU KNOW Parris Island,... that is saying something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, I was called into the drill instructors office again, and there were two men in suits and sunglasses there.  They asked me the same type of questions, and dismissed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never heard of anything after that, but searched for years (project bluebook, etc...).. for the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FOOTNOTE: I was promoted to PFC on Parris Island. I am sure it was not because I was the BEST marine in my platoon (platoon 311, 3rd battalion).<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone knows anything, they should feel free to contact me at ((e-address deleted.

5/4/61 01:00|South Pacific Island||Unknown|01:00 to 03:00|Peculiar object seen on military radar over the South Pacific.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73370.html|2|ndxe196105| My dad was called into the radar shack on a secret island in the south pacific early in the morning, around 03:00. the radar operator stated the object was hovering about 200 miles out from the base. my dad was the security chief of the base, as well as the fire chief of the base.  Am reluctant to disclose anything vital for security reasons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He asked the radar operator if their was any military operations around from naval vessels to which the reply was NO.  He then asked if any helicoptors could be out their as well, once again NO.  While watching the 300 mile screen the object moved to a position above the island in 2 to 3 rotations of the radar, indicating incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then hovered above the island for a few minutes at a high altitude. my dad then asked where the nearest airbase was, which he already knew but had to ask, which was Honolulu Hawaii. honolulu was over 2500 miles away.  while ascertaining what to do the object took off at incredible speed and did the impossable.  the object while leaving at speeds estimated at over 12,000 miles per hour did a 90 degree turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this because my dad is old and would never report it. in just 2 rotations of the radar the object was gone off screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Btw my dad held a top lvl 20 security clearance so i am reluctant to go into too much details even though it was a long time ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I personally eyewitnessed the forced downing of a UFO in between the 2 islands of Kauai and Nejiau Hawaii on about 7-1-1972 or 1973.  their is more but dont know how much space is available.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date in September 1993 is approximate.

5/1/61 22:00|Auburn|WA|Cigar|5 min|Grandmother saw a cigar shaped craft which she said was as long as the valley is wide.|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12225.html|3|ndxe196105| Grandmother saw a cigar shaped craft which she said was as long as the valley is wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Grandmother has been dead for a year, and I thought I would report a sighting that she had in the early sixties.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Her house sits on a hill overlooking the Puyallup Valley and the valley between Sumner and Auburn.  I was just a small child at the time (6 or 7).  I was asleep and she did not wake me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft that she saw was sunset pink with portholes all around the centerline of the craft.  She said that there was some type of fire at one end (ship was in and out of the clouds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The valley is about 1 1/2 mile wide at that point, and she seemed to feel that it was the length of the width of the valley.  That seemed pretty big to me, maybe it was close than she thought it was.  She seemed to think that it was over the city of Auburn itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said she watched it for about five minutes and then it shot away to the northeast.  If this is the case, it flew in close proximity to the ATC northwest control center in Auburn.  Maybe there is a record of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and she had also seen ufo&#39;s in the daylight in the same general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD<n>
