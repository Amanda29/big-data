Right before i was to enter the room something made me to stop and look straight up, in the blue of the sky ,i could make out a round object blended into the blue of the sky..the object had  some dots the were in a circle in the center. I was like in trance looking at this object ..when the teacher told me to come in. i didn&#39;t think anything of it till i got home...and looked staight up before i entered the house and the object was still there 3 hours later....It was not the moon or a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
