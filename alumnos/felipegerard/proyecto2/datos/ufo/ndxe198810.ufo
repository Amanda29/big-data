She was 22 and I was 31. Around five in the morning. The sky was clear. No clouds except only one small dark cloud in the center of the sky. Then appear 3 lights in our vision focus (I mean behind buildings)... from west to east, with erratic movement. They were not airplanes. No sound. Very fast pace and erratic up and down movements. Two of the lights were rounded and the third light was like a cigarette. The three light were yellow. The rare thing was the three went behind the only cloud in the sky and then disappeared. I mean, the lights did not go out from that cloud. We stand there for about 3o more minutes to see if the lights go out but the lights never go out from that cloud in the center of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The sky was clear and I had enjoyed beautiful meteor showers all evening while listening to a Utah-Hawaii football game earlier. I was pulling a slight grade and moving rather slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, what appeared as a meteor appeared straight in front of me but this one was coming straight at me instead of moving across the sky!  The object was moving at a high rate of speed, leaving a bright green trail in the sky behind it.  My first thought came out loud, very loud “Holy s**t this thing is gonna hit me!!”  My first instinct was to get into the breakdown lane and stop.  The object however, stopped directly in front of me.  I would guess the distance at approximately 1 mile, more on this later.  Being night, it was very hard to “guess” the distance, but the object was quite large and shaped exactly like tops that I had as a kid, the kind you wrapped string around and tossed out to spin.  I immediately looked at my watch and clock, set at PST and checked where the moon was – behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my headlights off and sat and watched the object through my windshield for a full 11 minutes.  It did not wobble or move about but sat stock still and emit an orange colored light similar to some street lights you see.  There was no definite outline, just a top shaped dark color inside the light.  At the widest part, just below the tapered top was a darker line. Windows perhaps?  After watching the object for a few minutes, I flashed my marker lights a few times.  After another couple of minutes I flashed my headlights three times.  Not getting any response I just sat and stared, I know any one there should have seen my lights, as I was the only vehicle on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember getting the impression that the object seemed to glower, maybe from a slight pulsation of the light.  My windows were down, and I shut my motor off.  There was just dead silence, not even night sounds of animals or anything else – very eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly a very bright white light shot out of the bottom tip of “top” and shone straight down steadily and the object just slowly sank out of sight.  I was alone again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After sitting for a few more minutes trying to digest what I had just seen, I fired my rig back up, turned my lights on.  Right in front of me was a view area sign.  I pulled up to the view area and went in, turned my rig around so I could see where the object had been.  I shut ‘er down again and took a look around.  There were a couple of other rigs and a few motor homes there but everyone was asleep.  I sat and had a pipe and a cup of coffee, waiting to see if it would come back up.  After an hour of walking around and stretching, I decided to go to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next morning I took a walk around the area.  There were deep, ragged canyons all over the place.  I took off for Green River again.  Approximately 1 mile up the road was a bridge over a very, very deep canyon/river.  This canyon ran directly toward the area where I saw the object sink down, so I am assuming this is where my “top” went down.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Over my left shoulder I saw a bright ball of pulsating light located at a low altitude. At first it was stationary. The pulsating light lit up the entire night sky.  There was a car in front of me but neither of us stopped.  The object then moved away in a westward direction at enormous speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rate of movement of the object and the enormous intensity of the pulsating light seemed far greater than that capable by humans.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Standing by my car I looked directly above me as something caught my eye. A gigantic &#34;something&#34; was moving very slowly ( a person on a bicycle could have kept pace with it, or the traffic on nearby I-90 was moving at three times the speed)), heading due west toward the city of Spokane (my location was east of the city by approximately 10 miles in what is known as the Spokane valley). This is the best way to describe the object: take a very sharp, narrow &#34; V &#39;, lay it on its side so the apex points westward...and making up the &#39;V&#39; formation were about 25 to 30 perfectly round, whitish disks. The disks were not bright but appeared as any white object would, in the sky at night, reflecting the glow of Interstate 90 and a busy shopping area. It is difficult for me to judge distance according to feet, but if you held your arms above your head and spread them a yard (36&#34;)apart, that was the length of the &#39;V&#39;. As I observed the object at a distance of about 1/4 of a mile away, about 15 minutes later (described below)it appeared to be as high up as a 30 to 50 story building. There was absolutely never any noise, the object was moving much slower than, say, cars on nearby I-90, there were no lights observed at anytime. The craft was paralelling I-90 with apparently no need to let other flying objects (airplanes---there is a small airport nearby, not the Spokane International Airport) know it was there (flashing lights ect)?? I was, to say the least, dumb-struck, but remained still as I watched it slowly moving westward. At one point a man and his son walked to their vehicle across the parking lot, never looking up or noticing anything because there was no noise. I wish to this day I had spoken up and asked the man to look up. How can something that large move so slowly and not make any noise?? Anyway, the really strange aspect of the object was its BEHAVIOR. Several of the disks appear! ed to be slightly &#39;fluttering&#39;, as leaves on a Tamarac tree would flutter in a breeze. The other disks did not. As I continued watching, the &#39;fluttering&#39; of some os the disks suddenly stopped and the top string of disks began to lengthen as the bottom string began to get shorter. I stared at the apex of the &#39;V&#39; formation to see if I could observe each disk from the bottom string &#34;round the corner of the apex&#34;, so to speak, and that was what was so weird. Each disk from the bottom just grew less in number as the top string grew longer in number, but I couldn&#39;t actually see the disks moving to and around the apex. The top string of disks was just growing in length but at no time did any disks appear to disappear, nor did they appear to flash on or off. I hope this isn&#39;t confusing. I find it difficult to explain this. I remained standing by my car for several more minutes and before I left I was able to see the actual object, I&#39;d say, a good 1/4 of a mile away towards the west, as it was headed toward the city of Spokane. I was able to see the shape of the object because the city lights/sky glow from Spokane, further west and ahead of the object, provided contrast. What I saw shocked me. If you take two large plates and set one on top of the other so the rims meet, that&#39;s what I observed, but it was at least three times larger than the &#39;V&#39; formation (which was apparently attached under it?)The entire mass was solid black. One more thing, which I think is worth noting; I finally got in my car and returned some rental movies to a business about a mile away and went about my evening. I felt stunned and said nothing to anyone. Three days later I suddenly felt scared over MY behavior, as I could not understand why I didn&#39;t at least follow the object(which would have been so like me to do). I had never witnessed anything like this and why had I been so cavalier about the whole thing.... It was as if I suddenly &#39;woke up&#39; to the realization of what I had witnessed and my very unusual subdued reaction.

It did not look like it lights on it. It flew back and forth, in and out of the clouds in a very rapid motion. At times, it seemed to stop and hover in a certain spot as if it were surveying a particular part of the sky. Then after a few seconds, it would zoom back and forth between the clouds again. This date was my first sighting. I am still seeing this unidentifiable object. I saw it again this morning in the same location. However, the time that I saw it this morning was much later than previous times. It was about 1 AM this morning. This is definitely not an airplane search light, flashlight, taser or anything of that nature. I fully well know the difference. I watch the skies often, and I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before. I do find the experience quite exciting.<n>

We always used to cut behind the old Kmart that went out of business to get home, when my buddy says to wait up that he needs to stop and tie his shoe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we stopped and he went over to the loading ramp and started to tie his shoes and I just stared up at the night sky looking northward I could see the local TV stations antenna tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still looking out that way I caught out of my peripheral vision a streaking pastel green shooting star.  But as I focused in I could make out an out line it was football shaped and the object pulsed red, green, and blue (all pastel in color) up and down the length of the object in controlled rhythm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling west to east as I yell over to my best friend to look up. We were only able to see it for a few moments as it was traveling at an awesome rate of speed, as it dipped below the trees and house line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were dumbfounded by what we saw. I went home and immediately drew a picture of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But that was not the end of my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to school the next day to my electrical trades class and low and behold the was my teacher drawing on the white board the exact object I had seen the night before.  But not only was there the same drawing I had but in a story board fashion there were other drawings of it hovering with the same pulsing red, blue and green pastel lights, but another one next to it that included a star shaped little ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I showed my teacher my picture and we talked about what each of us had seen.  He saw everything I saw but from his house he could see the object level off hover for a bit, then spit out the object that looked like a floating star.  He then went on to say the floating ball moved around the other object then he said it kinda exploded into about 20 to 30 tiny objects that speed off into as many directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the main original object sped off at an even faster speed straight up into the night&#39;s sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still have the picture I drew that night and that night is as fresh in my mind now as it was happening so many years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget the pulsating pastel red, green, and blue football shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the exception of us three till now I never thought anyone else had seen this object till read the gentleman from Odessa recount of what he had seen that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

Can&#39;t remember the exact year, but it had to be between 1987 and 1989.  Three of us were driving around the Woodland area of Mansfield, OH on a very clear night, just happy to be out of the house and hanging out.  For well over an hour, we could all clearly see a brilliant blue/white light in the sky.  It appeared to be a bright star, or perhaps a planet. It was fairly high in the sky, not near the horizon at all. Again, after seeing it for more than an hour in the same exact spot we thought it could only be a celestial object.  However, after a while we were driving down a road and saw it through the windshield...and suddenly it shot off to the north/northeast at incredible speed.  It went so fast that it left a blue/white streak halfway across the sky before it disappeared. At first we thought it was a meteor, but upon reflection realized it could not be--what meteors are blue/white and stay in the same spot for nearly 2 hours before they move?  Much later, a few years after graduating from college, I saw one of the friends again and they remembered the strange events as clearly as I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It looked like the &#34;tilt-a-whirl&#34;.  We were a mile or so from where it was.  It turned from almost vertical to horizonital.  Then it rose straight up several hundred feet in the air and took off eastly and went out of sight over the horizon in a flash.  In West Texas the horizon is miles and miles. I asked my wife if she had seen it and she said yes.  About half an hour later we were home and noticed two helicopters heading in the direction of the craft.  I watched the news and nothing was said or mentioned.  Did not know where to report it or who to.<n>

The sky was clear with no clouds or moon.  Out of the corner of my left eye I saw motion in the sky.  It was a boomerang (chevron?) shape with no running lights or sound, moving at &#34;walking speed&#34; silently from N to S.  It seemed a similar shade of dark as the sky, blotting out the stars as it passed, and since there were no lights it gave only the slightest hint of some kind of detail in the center.  It covered a good portion of the sky, (I&#39;ll use the ever popular &#34;Size of a football field&#34; description). The people with me marveled at it a few moments but seemed to pay it no further attention. I intended to run in and call the FAA control center in Longmont where it seemed to be headed but was locked in place watching it till it faded in the distance to the south.  I was met with the usual ridicule from family and friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

(Official explanations unacceptable)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a sighting about ten years ago and I never had the resources to check out what I had seen until I got on the net. Which brings me to the point as to why I am writing you. The official comments that were made about the sighting were unacceptable and I believe, would be to anyone who actually saw this object. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t pinpoint the exact date, which is a problem. However, there are other details that may help identify this sighting. That way, someone may be able to help me find more realistic explanations as to what I saw that  night. Below is an account of the events as I remember them. It was Oct. of 1988 (unsure of these dates) about eight o&#39;clock or a little later, when I was going to visit a friend, who lives in a rural part of Missouri. I pulled into his driveway, got out of the car and went to the door and knocked. My friend was not at home. I got ready to get back into the car and leave, when I noticed several  lights in the western sky. They were moving toward me at a slow but steady speed. I moved away from the car and into a field adjacent to my friend&#39;s house. I could not make out what it was. There was no discernible silhouette, just several lights coming my way. The object then got directly over head and seem to take up the entire night sky. I then noticed that the lights (There were at least three lights maybe more, I don&#39;t really recall.) seem to be attached to one large object. The lights seem to be facing toward the object instead of facing outward as you would expect. When I looked at the object, I got the impression that this is what a blimp would look like if it had been flying at night with the lights turned toward it. The object seem to be just above my head, about two hundred feet or so, I&#39;m just guessing. There was dead silence, I heard nothing that would explain its propulsion except the wind. Even though the object moved slowly, I think it would have moved even slower if governed by the wind alone. I  continued to watch the object until it disappeared in the eastern sky. This may have been a total of five to ten minutes. It never once slowed down or veered from a straight course and seem to stay the same distance from the ground the entire time. I got into the car trying to sort out what I had seen, debating on if  I should tell anyone else. I went to eat a late dinner and then decided I would go and tell another friend of mine about the experience. I got to his house right at ten o&#39;clock. The local news was just coming on. Just before I had the chance to tell him about my experience, the first line of the news cast said  &#34;If you saw it, you weren&#39;t the only one.&#34; They continued to say reports had come in by the hundreds and that it had been seen in at least seven different states that night. An investigation was under way. The next morning there was a small news segment about  scientists thinking it may have been a gaseous cloud that had ignited in the upper atmosphere but it was still being investigated. On the following day the official report stated, it was a Russian Rocket that was reentering the earth&#39;s atmosphere. I have problems with all the above explanations. For instance, Anything burning I believe would at least flicker. This was not consistent with what I had seen. The lights never blinked or seem to diminish in any way. It maintained a slow but direct course and stayed the same distance from the ground the entire time. I have never seen a falling star or meteors do anything like that. If they had said it was a low flying blimp, I would have believed this before any of the other explanations. That is, before I heard it had been reported in seven different states that night.  But after hearing this, I began to wonder if there may have been more than one object roaming the skies that night.  What I am looking for is any other credible explanations as to what this may have been. If you have any info on the sighting I am referring to or can lead me to others that may be able to help me. Please feel free to forward this letter or e-mail me. I would very much appreciate it.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw this there was not many posts for this type of siting and I let it go except for one post I made to some Purdue researcher that I never heard back from.  However, this is what happened. I was coming back from the computer lab at UMO and noticed a light over the trees as I passed in front of the gym.  Anyway it struck me as odd and I pulled into the parking lot on the ball fields side and looked at it. I realized that it was on my way home about over by the dairy farm.  So, I got back in my car and went like I was going to the dairy farm and while on the way I could occassionally see the glow of the light ( bright white ). As I got closer I saw the source of the light was hovering over the edge of the field.  As I turned into the road that went to the farm I almost immediately pulled over and stopped and got out of the car.  I looked at the clock and it was nearly 8 pm. I looked up at the craft and some things that struck me were the following: it sat as still as if it were on a stand somewhere between 300-1000 feet in the air.  It did not appear to be that big (about the size of a small school bus but wider. ) It appeared to be pretty flat and shaped like a shortened home plate (more delta shaped than rectangular). As I stood there I could no longer see the source of the light because I was a little under it and behind it (the light source on the object) .  I could see the glow of it though.  The next thing that struck me was the sound it made.  It was very quiet but it sounded kind of like a jet engine with the volume turned way down.  No other lights or sound was evident.  The night was still as could be. I watched it for perhaps 5 minutes and at that point it headed towards Route 2 going to Bangor.  As it got close to Brewer I lost site of it because the road was under construction and I could not get into town quick enough to get across the bridge. It never went very fast.  It was still for at least 10 minutes in the beginning and then I followed it for another 5-7 minutes as it followed the river.<n>

Would really like an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We came out of a local restaurant durning school holidays. I usually waited outside when my husband paid the bill. My son and i saw a large white dot like a large star fly swiftly from one side of our vision to the other. We thought it was probably a shooting star but it had no tail. I went into the restaurant to tell my husband and when we came out it was gone. We walked back to our car, about 50 or so metres away down a side turning and looking up we saw a large black circle with light yellow lights and as far as i can remember now some white ones too. The shape was black and looked like a few houses high completely over us. My husband who is not a believer in anything extra-ordinary said run to get into the car. We all ran. We had the news on that night and several others. There was nothing about it. I was a little histerical. The car started ok. We were ok. Nobody else saw it. I always assumed a prank of some sort, but how they did it i will never know. There was a rubber tyre on the tree which looked so small in comparison. My hubby wont speak about it now. My son was 14. there was an aircraft in the distance to my right accross the road and looked much higher but i never really thought about that until now. I have just gone on the internet and am not too sure about how safe my details are, and it is old hat. I will contact again in the name beneath should i feel safer later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, witness is anonymous.

This is a feeling that is shared by millions of human beings around the world, including myself, who have not placed a &#39;belief in UFOs&#39; on a wish and a prayer or some peculiar fuzzy lights bouncing around the skies; but on heart stopping, nerve stunning, in-your-face, up-close and personal &#39;I am HERE, I am BIG and you are very, very small&#39; close encounters with these things. And I&#39;m madder&#39;n hell that this continues to go on every day without any advisement or counsel from our so called &#39;by the people for the people&#39; governments whose biggest fear next to real democracy is that we&#39;ll find out in fact they do not nor ever had a clue about what these things are or where they come from. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS when these things appear, do we greet them with a smile and a handshake or do we run like hell away from them! I think our governments know at least as much to describe the various objects, tell us what their present state of affairs is concerning UFOs, and what is the nature of the contact environment for human interaction with each type; so we can at least act neighborly without placing ourselves in harms way or if these things are dangerous and out to git us we can pop off a few rounds when they get into our cross hairs. I think it&#39;s time humanity had its own &#39;million man march&#39; on capitols around the world to force the truth out from between those bright shiny perfectly lying teeth of politicians responsible for holding back the truth. This is a new millenia and it&#39;s time for a new world order allright but not the stilted, contrived childs building block type promoted by patrician &#39;we know better than you&#39; demagogues. Their silly secret society, michiavellian intrigue ways of running things are as outdated as the buggy whips that remained in the last century, and as unnatural and bizarre as the pathetic face-hip-boob lifts obsessed by celebrities today. There are many, many things that press for answers and change in our society, that require a different focus for human behaviour away from competition and greed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today let&#39;s start with our new neighbors; who the hell are they and where do they come from? Are they here to eat us or eat with us? SORRY FOLKS, I just had to get all that off my chest. I&#39;ve been saving it up since my first encounter in 1971 and its built up over the years with three unforgettable episodes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> #1) - October 7, 1971,1 am. While travelling east on a country road towards Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, on a clear moonless night; my wife and I noticed a peculiar glowing object hovering just above the tree line to our left about 1000 feet away. I remarked what an interesting effect the moon had reflecting off the top of a silo that way. It looked like a flying saucer, (chuckle) As we proceeded along the road at a leisurely 40 miles per hour, I continued to glance back over my shoulder to watch the changes occur, expecting it to change shape and get smaller as we moved away from it. However when my observations discovered that not only was it holding its horizontal, elliptical shape but getting larger and brighter, I immediately and frantically searched for the moon, craning my neck this way and that. Not finding it, I asked my wife to search for the moon and she discovered also, no moon! I then asked her to look over her left shoulder, and tell me what she saw across the field. She confirmed there was a horizontal, elliptical object, nearly as bright as moon light, getting bigger and closer; I pulled over and stopped the car. By now my wife was frightened and refused to get out of the car, clinging to the door knob out of fear. I wanted to settle this and conclude it was the movement caused by driving that was responsible for what I expected was an illusion. Up to then my only knowledge of flying saucers was in the realm of Buck Rogers, science fiction and stories of peculiar incidents and artifacts from the history of humankind, never putting much credence in the few current reports I had read, I didn&#39;t really know what to think, the jury was still out. So I got out of the car and stood very still, bracing myself against the automobile to be sure of my bearing. Well this thing kept moving very slowly from an  ENE direction, still skirting the tops of the forest across the field from us, but not yet coming directly towards us. By now its scale had gone from a dime size at arms length when we first saw it about five minutes earlier to a nickle size. Its steady movement and even moonglow illumination convinced me this neede closer inspection, and that it probably was a flying saucer. Looking back at my wife I said I was going for a closer look to which she groaned her displeasure. I blythely and quite naively raced across the road towards a point in the field about five hundred feet away to intersect its direction of travel, this involved risking an encounter with a barnyard dog because we happened to be next to a farm house to our north east. I made it across the yard without incidence, over a fence then into the field which I discovered was fallow with just short scrub and weeds. As I was running towards my point of intersection in the field ahead, I kept my eyes on the prize and noticed it had altered its course and was coming towards me more directly. Our paths crossed quicker than I had anticipated and was caught up a bit in surprise. Now looking due north, with my head canted back so sharply as to cause me to stop suddenly with the realisation this thing is REALLY close and REALLY big and I should stop now. Art arms length, if you were to hold a yardstick horizontally in your hand it would give you some idea of the scale. My best guess was one hundred feet off the ground and it was dead still. I stood there hollering up to it, &#39;Come on down here and talk to me!&#39; It just sat there and glowed. I saw no one, no details, no sounds. Just two saucers inverted together glowing brighter than a full moon. Out of the corner of my eye I caught the glint of headlights from an approaching car so I ran back across the field and onto the road to flag it down. They stopped, I pointed to the UFO telling them to look there! At that moment it went from roughly four inches across at arms length , to a pin point and vanished in one second. My wife and I reported it to the night officer in charge at the old OPP station on King street near Rockway Gardens in Kitchener that night. He made a written record of our report, also checking with the local airport for possible fly ins or radar evidence. Nothing. Since then I have encountered a born again christian and a business man both men of character beyond reproach, confiding to me  encounters very similar mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> #2) - November 15,1987, 2 am. While returning home from work on a crisp, clear moonless night, I was travelling east on hwy 50 just north of Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. I had passed the airport on my left which was closed for the evening and was alone in my vehicle with no traffic on coming or following. Making my way to Buckingham I passed the several overpasses encountered on this highway and was approaching the last one before my turn off which is about six miles east of the aforementioned airport. As I approached the last overpass I noticed a bright red light just ahead and to my left off the road about 100 feet and 100 feet off the ground. The size, colour and brilliance resembling the kind of warning light you see on top of hydro towers. I thought this was peculiar because the hydro tower that was near by was not located there, so I conjectured to myself it must be a late arrival flying in to Gatineau airport. But it was closed and this is way to far away for a flight to be in a landing pattern so I slowed down expecting the plane to make a hard landing in the field.Eventually I pulled to the side of the road just west of the overpass, stopped and got out of my car.The field extending north from the highway is fairly level and consists of weeds and scrub for about 1500 -2000 feet until it reaches the bottom of a rise in the terrain that goes up suddenly about 100 - 150 feet. So looking north is fairly black with no illumination or dwelling in my line of sight until the horizon which is higher up than where I&#39;m standing. Then the night sky explodes with stars and the milky way from the horizon up. The red light is in a fixed position in the darkness below the horizon and I&#39;m marveling at how an aircraft can remain stationery for so long. I look around for possible wind sources to make this happen but the air is still, And I haven&#39;t yet been able to make out any kind of outline to put a fix on the aircrafts shape. So I walk across the double highway, down the ditch and up to the fence.This gives me a lower but closer perspective, all the while looking at this thing to see if I can make its shape. When I reach the fence I begin to think this might be some new stealth vehicle the military is trying out because I don&#39;t hear a sound and still can&#39;t make out its outline.My eyes becoming more accustomed to the inky darkness I find a hard edge that leads up into the night sky and then to my utter shock begin to see the staggering size of this thing! I stumble back from the realisation that the inky darkness was part of a craft that was triangular in shape blotting out most of the bluff in the background, the horizon and part of the night sky. What I mistook at first to be just a lack of stars in that particular section of the sky was an enormous triangular shape that reached from above and just ahead of me to just below the horizon. The point forward seeming to be to my left bearing the red light under its tip.It was all I could do to see its shape. No one, no details and no sound. You could almost describe it as an absence of light. Having never heard of flying triangles as possible UFOs I didn&#39;t speak of this until 2001 when I read my very first report about them. I was very excited by the facts and descriptions regarding the triangles reported and discovering I wasn&#39;t alone in sighting a triangle. When I drove away from the object that night, I contented myself with the explanation that I had witnessed a military exercise for forty five minutes and always referred to it as such, never suspecting a possible UFO context. It was still there when I got up and left thinking what a mammoth airplane. Truly football field size as they say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> #3) -This final event involved my entire family of seven including myself and our elderly neighbor and his wife. It occurred on the night before the first Phoenix, Arizona flurry of multiple UFOs appeared. Those identical lights appeared here around 10 pm looking east over Waupoos Island towards Kingston, Ontario, Canada. They remained in the sky over Lake Ontario for several hours, were brighter than stars, orange/gold in colour, creating geometric patterns and remaining basically stationary. We went next door upon discovering the lights to watch them unobstucted from my neighbours deck. As some would vanish others would appear maintaining roughly 9 to 12 at any one time in the sky.It was an awesome display that none of us will ever forget and I&#39;m still puzzled why no one else in our area reported seeing them. We didn&#39;t hear about the Phoenix lights until several days later when my son saw a report on mainstream news. One difference with our sighting though was the object that simultaneously flashed red and white lights, like a cop cars, to our immediate right looking south half way across the bay seemingly just sitting on the water while the orange light show was happening high in the sky towards the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

We were sitting in the living room of the home where I lived in Ballard, waiting for friends to come home.  I seem to recall that they had gone to a movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just minutes before they arrive back at the house, both I and my friend were shocked to hear some type of aerial object STREAK overhead, moving generally, we agreed, from southeast to northwest.  It was the (angular) velocity of the object, and the THOROUGHLY BIZARRE nature of the sound, that captured our attention immediately, and left us both stunned, and staring at one another in disbelief.  My friend, who admitted to me immediately after the incident that she had never believed in the possibility of UFO’s, turned to me and stated that THAT object was a UFO!!  Her eyes were as big as tea cups as she said it, as she turned in my direction in a state of obvious shock and disbelief!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound that emanated from the object, in the opinion of both of us, consisted of two distinct, distinguishable sounds.  One sound was a very high-pitched whining, buzzing, or perhaps even screeching tone, not too dissimilar from the sound of a high-speed hydraulic pump, running at very high speed.  Another close equivalent to the high-pitched sound is the distinct &#34;buzzing&#34; sound that the human ear can detect from either a Boeing 747, or a DC-10, as it passes overhead at a high power setting.  To my ear, the sound I am trying to describe here has a slightly &#34;metallic&#34; quality to it, combined with the peculiar &#34;buzzing&#34; sound one might expect to hear from a bee hive, or from a large swarm of bees in flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other sound was a very low-pitched, &#34;deep&#34; rumbling sound.  In mirth, I often equate it to the bubbling sound one would hear from a very large cauldron at a slow boil with four missionaries being boiled down into a thick gravy.  Rather like a rapid &#34;blub, blub, blub.&#34;  I cannot emphasize enough with words how thoroughly bizarre, and unearthly, this sound was, and how it immediately commanded our attention.  We heard it, I estimate, for not more than TWO SECONDS, as it streaked overhead at what seemed to me to be almost directly above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, the velocity of the source of the sound.  The object was moving at a stunning angular velocity overhead.  I estimate that the object making the sound passed through from 140 to 160 degrees of arc, again from southeast to northwest, in less than two seconds!!  This object could not have been any kind of terrestrial aircraft that I am aware of!  Given that there was absolutely no trace of the sound that would have been generated by a propeller, or from either the main- or tail-rotor of a helicopter, I conclude that the object could not have been either a fixed-wing or rotor-wing aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As to my credentials, I have held a commercial pilot rating for over a quarter century (Flight Instructor for 10 years), and I have been around aircraft all my life.  My father worked in the airline industry for many decades, and I lived for a portion of my life with a family in the U. S. Air Force.  I know what aircraft sound like, and I know what they are capable of doing.  I cannot imagine that the object I heard on this particular Monday night could have been either built, or flown, by humans.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by Peter B.

I&#39;ll just put them all on this one posting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First Sighting:  The happened way back when I was in highschool, about 1988.  The location from which we made the sighting was in the mountains above Boulder, Colorado, in the parking lot of the Bald Mountain hiking area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was parking with a girl I was dating at the time.  It was about 10pm.  We decided to stand up in the back of my car and put our heads out of the sunroof to look at the stars.  It was a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking northward, we just stargazed for a few minutes.  I then noticed three stars that seemed to be in a perfect equalateral formation, about 75 degrees above the horizon, fairly close together (if you hold your hand out at arm&#39;s length, they would be about the distance apart of 1&#34; between thumb and forefinger).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just looked at them for about 30 seconds, and mentioned them to my companion.  She looked at them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they started to move in apparently random directions, each one in a straight line, only a few degrees, and then they&#39;d stop.  Then they&#39;d move again for a few seconds, and then stop.  Then they all started moving about &#34;1-o&#39;clock&#34; from their position, still in a clear triangle formation, but not equalateral.  They accelerated in that direction, and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were stunned!  We both saw the whole thing.  We were both totally sober, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A year or so later, I saw a very similar thing, this time with two other sober witnesses, from the top of Flagstaff Mountain in Boulder, at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, about 1991, I again made a similar sighting, this time with another two sober witnesses, while walking in North Boulder park at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Geosynchronous-orbit satellites do NOT look like what I saw.  Neither do faster-moving satellites that move counter to the rotation of the earth.  Stars do NOT start moving and then stop and then move in different directions and then disappear.  I know that some people would say that what I saw were &#34;military planes&#34;, but that&#39;s not true.  They were VERY distant and looked just like stars.  Military planes do NOT move like what I saw.  I know that it&#39;s hard to determine distance at night (or even in the daytime) of objects you see, but I have a good spacial sense and I know what I saw.  These were NOT normal astral events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting is VERY similar to one seen from Twin Peaks in San Francisco that I saw in the database, but can&#39;t find now!  Anyway, there are numerous cases similar to this one in the database.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It&#39;s not what I saw, it&#39;s what I didn&#39;t see that was/is the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter and I went to a local store, one evening.  It was comfortable, temperaturewise, this sky was clear, the stars, bright.  I could hear what sounded like the wind blowing, but there was no sensation of wind.  I looked at trees in the vicinity, and there was no movement, just the sound of blowing wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up at the stars, and there was a definite area with no visible stars, just pure &#34;blackness&#34;, and this area was moving.  Definitely not cloud cover, just total lack of light, also, no &#34;running&#34; lights.  I watched briefly, then went into the store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Didn&#39;t tell any one inside what I had seen, basically, becuase I didn&#39;t believe or want to believe that I had seen something.

Suddenly I saw a shadow move in front of the little dipper and thought it was a flock of ducks or geese or something. Well I kept looking up at the sky and suddenly out of nowhere moving slowly from the northwest to the southeast right above us was a large black triangular shaped object blotting out the stars as it moved silently along. It eventually disappeared from view in the souteastern night sky.

As the &#34;star&#34; moved across the sky it seemed to get closer. We thought it was a helicopter. As it grew closer we could see that it was semi-circular in profile and had windows with silhoulettes of figures in the windows. It stayed motionless for around 7 to 8 minutes and was about 300 yards away from us. I would say that the size of the craft in relation to the size of the figures was around 400 feet across. After a period of time I motioned for the craft to come closer but it shook from side to side three times as if to say &#34;no&#34;. It stayed where it was for approx 30 secs after this and then flew from its position towards the horizon and disappeared within 5 or 6 seconds. I would like to add here that I am a professional person - a qualified nurse - and while I believe in &#34;other&#34; lifeforms am not given to flights of fancy or attention-seeking behaviour.<n>

As the thunder continued to rumble at consistent interavels I decided to look out on the back porch to check for a possible thunderstorm approaching.  Instead, I saw in the distance a bright off-white dome of light rise beyond the trees, which seemingly shed no light on surrounding objects in spite of it&#39;s brightness.  After a few seconds the bubble-like dome of light slowly descended back into the horizon of trees.  This light did not seem to be an object, but it appeared to be some type of energy concentration.  I stared mezmerized in the direction of the light for minutes when it then ascended back into view more quickly.  This time when it dropped out of view again a rapidly spinning object with blue and off-white lights quickly came up into the sky just above the trees.  It appeared to wobble a bit, but it was spinning very fast.  It only was in view for a few moments before it flew off into the sky and out of sight faster than anything I could comprehend.  The object seemed to come up from an area known as Dean&#39;s Hollow, which was located about a mile from where I was, but I can&#39;t say for sure if it did or not.  However, I saw what I saw.  The whole experience lasted about 10 minutes, and it absolutely terrified me.  I was only 10 years old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(When I saw it, it has been on the way up, not just started rising)  The rising is straight up. When it came up to about 500km in a few seconds, it suddenly took an abrupt turning of about 120 degrees, and it became an oval shape, and the dust couln&#39;t been seen.
