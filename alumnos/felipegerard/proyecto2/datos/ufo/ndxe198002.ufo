Craft that looked like a football with a gridwork pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I remember, it .was the next morning, and my birthday cake was sitting out the next morning..definately not a typical birthday<n>
2/17/80 19:10|Canton|NY|Light|20 seconds|Two unblinking lights travel in line across the sky in Canton, NY|2/18/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96352.html|2|ndxe198002| Two unblinking lights travel in line across the sky in Canton, NY<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took the dog out and was watching the sky.  I saw two bright white lights in the sky.  The sky was clear and stars clearly visible as well as the moon.  The lights were slightly larger and brighter than surrounding stars.   They were not blinking so were not an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, they could not have been satellites because they were spaced very far apart (holding hand fully outstretched two points of light about 2 inches apart) and most importantly their movements were in sync with each other as one followed the first in a direct path/trajectory and speed (as if two lights on front and back of very long object).  They were traveling SW I believe and were very bright when I first noticed them.  They continued downward toward the horizon and became dimmer as they did so.  This was slow enough for me to consider what I was watching, then run inside and have my wife come out to see just before they disappeared.  Unfortunately she could not find them in the sky/didn’t know! what she was looking for.  I could not make out an object linking the lights but highly doubt that they were meteors or any conventional aircraft.  I could not tell the distance but was very confused, as they seemed almost as stars moving slowly across the sky.  They travelled very close to Orion’s belt and in a similar line.  They were the distance between the lights was also comparable to the length on the three stars which make up Orion’s belt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a separate occasion about 2 ¼ yrs. ago, I saw three enormous (full moon) sized orange lights in the night sky driving down rt.11 @7:00PM.  The sky was overcast and there was a full moon behind the clouds. These lights were in front of the clouds and in a perfect line above the horizon toward the south. I was shocked when I saw them and watched them blink out one at a time. The event lasted about 15 seconds. The lights were the same color as a streetlight and had the same type of glow around them.  Appeared as bright and large as a street light from a distance of 75-100 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I travel this stretch of road between canton and Potsdam everyday and there are no buildings or anything to explain where I saw them.  I have also found many other reports of orange lights in the area, which is a large reason that I wanted to report this sighting.  I don&#39;t want to give away too much about my identity so I will just say that I am a faculty member at one of the local universities.<n>

My older brother came to pick me up and take me home.  It was late evening.  It was dark, cold outside.  It was off Bolsa Road off Hwy 25 on old McConnell Road where this occured.  Observation:  2 large orange glowing objects kept spinning (high rate of speed) side to side of one another.  They were somewhat Oval/Egg shape.  I recall that they spun almost oblong looking in other words not perfectly round.  My brother asked me if I was seeing what he was seeing.  He had stopped the Car on the one way road near our mailbox that was near the Apricot/Walnut orchard trees.  I told him yes, what do you think it is ?  He said I believe they are UFO&#39;s and then he told me he was scared.  I did not take my eyes off the orange objects.  I was more frozen then anything out of fear of what we were seeing.  About that time I recall thinking to myself I wonder if anyone else is seeing what we are seeing.  All I saw on the right side in the distance of Hwy 25. was one car going by.  We were all alone on this one way road (McConnell).  About that time my brother asked me what we should do?  I said I don&#39;t know.  He said should we call the cops or should we just go home and tell our mom.  I wanted to keep looking at the objects.  But he started to get more scared of what we were seeing.  So we went home and my brother told my mom who was in the Kitchen when we returned home.  To this day that brother is a Director of Engineers in Silicon Valley.  I brought it up to him about three years ago and he was uncomfortable about the subject and was in denial (to himself) of the subject.  It was as if he wanted it to all go away and NEVER be brought up again.  So I never talk about it to him out of respect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I saw an aircraft almost directly above me.  I thought, &#34;what a funny plane....wow it&#39;s not moving...oh yeah,  weather baloon...but it&#39;s metallic....and it was cylindrical like a soft-drink can;  it had two shark-like fins on each side,  it was silver;  yet not shiny;  like pewter or air brushed smoothe.  There were no signs of engines,  no caligraphy,  just pure silver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was high helicopter or small plane height.  It is hard to estimate how large it was,  but to be so close as to discern that there were no windows,  no engines,  no markings...it was pretty close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What convinced me that it was a special event--it took off warp-speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the beginning of Star Trek, when the Enterprise takes off warp-speed?   Well,  that&#34;s what&#34;s this thing did!  I saw it dissapear into a pinpoint and go out of sight in 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went running up the beach to my brother and friends and said,:guys I have just truly seen a UFO.&#34;   They asked me why didn&#34;t I tell them...and I said that it just took off before I could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel pretty special.   And I&#39;m wondering if other people have seen the same cylydrical shape--coke can with shark fins?  Most of all   Why are they here<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I cried aloud, and at the same time pointed with my right hand, &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;. We both saw An Egg shaped amber or silver, object about 1/3 size of full moon, covered with small waves compairable to fish scales and sourounded by an emerald green ring, also with little &#34;waves&#34; on the inside of the ring with the front of the egg protruding through the &#34;ring&#34; and a bright white, unbroken, &#34;stilleto tail&#34; attached to and trailing behind the object. It traveled in an arc as a falling missile,dissapering out of site without any noise or expected flash or even a report in the press despite my enquiry the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/2/80 20:30|Georgetown|DE|Triangle|20 minutes|UFO at Vo-Tech Center comes calling again|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45504.html|7|ndxe198002| UFO at Vo-Tech Center comes calling again<n> <n><n> <n><n> While on patrol making my exterior checks at the Vo-Tech Center where I worked as a security guard I noticed a craft flying over the center moving north very slowly.  I knew the Georgetown Airport was closeby but this was no ordinary aircraft.  I recall it was triangular, silent and appeared to hover over the back of the school.  It emitted a white and red light over and over again.  I put my spotlight on it and other lights would appear.  I observed and exchanged lights with it on and off for about 20 minutes, as if we were communicating somehow.  At this time the object broke apart or separated and landed behind the school.  I then called the Delaware State Police and reported the incident.  They combed the area by car and helicopter, but nothing was found.  My decription was confirmed by the pastor of the Millsboro St. Mark&#39;s church who was en route to a friend&#39;s home in Georgetown with his wife.  He kidded his wife that it might be a UFO.  This sighting was followed by numerous other UFO reports in Smyrna, Milford, Slaughter Beach and Felton Delaware and the drew the attention of a National Enquirer reporter.  Officials said the sighting was probably caused by unusual atmospheric conditions, but I know that I had a special encounter that I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
