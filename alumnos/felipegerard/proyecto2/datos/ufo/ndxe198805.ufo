He had a one passenger ultralight airplane stored out there.  He wanted to show me how he would ride up into the low hanging stratus clouds and take cloud pictures.  Even though it was hard to keep craning my neck all that time,  I kept my eyes on him most of the time as he slowly climbed to altitude, maybe 3000 ft.  Very hard to estimate.  Suddenly, with no warning, a small cigar-shaped craft emerged from a cloud just above and behind him, and going at the same slow velocity but in a slightly different direction, about 10 degrees rightward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do have vision better than 20/20.  I saw this craft for only about 1.5 seconds, before it went back into another cloud, but I was able to see a lot in that short time.  This craft was not much longer than the ultralight, yet had 3 or 4 portholes along the side of it that I saw, and even at that distance I seem to remember seeing somebody or something looking down at me on the ground.  (It was at about 65 degrees angular altitude at the time.)  The color of the craft was unremarkable, probably grayish in color.  I thought the craft appeared to be a bit too small for humans to be able to use it comfortably.   Also I detected no noise from it, could only hear my brother&#39;s ultralight motor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was hoping my brother might have seen it so when he landed the ultralight, I asked him obliquely, had he seen anything strange when he was up there.  He said he hadn&#39;t, and so I didn&#39;t pursue it.  That craft couldn&#39;t have been more than 40 or 50 feet above and behind him, yet he was not aware of it.  If he had, he would probably have been scared out of his wits.   Since then I&#39;ve had the notion that we humans are under surveillance all the time without even knowing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

5/17/88 19:45|Chicago|IL|Chevron|15 minutes|V shaped tubular object .|4/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35935.html|3|ndxe198805| V shaped tubular object .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been involved with amatuer astronomy for 40 years, and am a member of the Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers. Having observed the sky for that length of time, I am fully aware of those objects and natural phenomenon that are often misreported as UFOs by observers who are unfamiliar with the sky...ie objects such as Venus, Iridium flares, sundogs, balloons, meteors etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On several occasions over those 40 years I have observed objects in the sky that I could not identify. A few years back, while observing the First Quarter moon in a 90mm refractor, I noticed a tiny object subtending about 5 arc sec transit the moon from E to W in about 30 seconds. The object was dark and well defined as oval shaped. As the object moved it was clearly seen to be changing shape slightly. My guess is that the object was probably a high altitude research balloon that was partially deflated, being pushed along by the jetstream. I mention this observation to illustrate that I am not the type of observer that is quick to label any unknown object a &#34;UFO&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, there is one observation that I made on May 17 of 1988 from my backyard on Chicago&#39;s NW side, that I would definately classify as a &#34;UFO&#34;. At the time I was scanning the western sky with 10x50 binoculars, attempting to locate the planet Mercury, in preparation to an observing run using my 8 inch Newtonian. While scanning in the lower Western sky, a small dark boomerang shaped object came into the field of view of the binocs. The arms of the V were inverted toward the horizon and the object was seen to yaw slightly. I immediately thought the object was a kite that some kid a few blocks away was flying, and didn&#39;t pay any attention to it, and continued scanning for the illusive planet. After a few minutes I located the planet, and prepared to swing the telescope toward it when I noticed that the &#34;kite&#34; had moved to a considerably higher elevation above the western horizon, and could in fact be clearly seen to be moving without optical aid. The V shape was still clearly visable in the binoculars, but not with naked eye. At this time I became curious about what the object could be, so I and went indoors to retreive a 60mm altazimuth refractor, since the 8 inch equatorial Newtonian would be to clumsy and difficult to use for tracking a moving object. I was able to aquire the object in the field of the scope at 28x and 78x. Let me just say that it wasn&#39;t a kite or any object I have ever seen or can explain. It had a tubular cross section almost worm-like in appearance. It was an odd flat blackish color that I can only describe as ash-like. I could also percieve faint reddish linaments encircling the body like the segmented sections of a worms body. The object filled about 1/4th of the field of view of the telescope eyepiece at 78x or an actual angular size of about 8.5 minutes of arc. The object continued climbing to a higher elevation until it passed overhead in a southeastern direction. While the object was climbing in the sky it passed about 1 1/2 degrees above the planet Venus, which was hig! h in the west. I lost sight of the object in the darkening dusk sky after about 15 minutes of observation. When last seen it was still headed in a SE direction about 25 degrees from zenith. When the object was overhead it took about 2 1/2 seconds to cross the 78x field of view of the stationary telescope, or a rate of movement for the object of about 14 minutes of arc per second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition to myself, my son and sister in law witnessed the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am probably going out on a limb even mentioning this observation, as I realize the subject of &#34;UFOs&#34; leaves one open to ridicule because of the fair number of wackos that get all the attention in the media. Hence credible witnesses to unexplained phenomenon tend to keep it to themselves. According to the debunkers ,few amatuer astonomers report UFO&#39;s because they know what they are seeing. This may be true. Most UFO reports are explainable as known objects that are misidentified by inexperienced observers. By definition this is not a ufo but an identifiable object.The small number of really baffling cases are often times reported by trained observers. These are the cases that should be scientifically investigated, rather than merely lumped in with &#34;Cosmic Nonsence&#34; by the debunkers. Amatuer astronomers DO see UFO,s, and I know I am not alone in this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Made no sound &amp; had mercurial lights that changed color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself, brother, &amp; stepfather seen a huge triangular shaped &amp;quot;craft&amp;quot; right after dark while out for a walk in the country where we live.  At first there were no lights. It was black and approx. 1000ft in the air. We had set down on a hillside to look at the first stars, and we noticed the craft because it was darker than the sky.  This was 300-500 from point to point and formed a perfect right triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of minutes, 3 lights appeared, one at each point.  The lights changed colors, and appeared liquid, like mercury.  The craft eventually started rotating slowly.  We watched it for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it just VANISHED right before our eyes.  It never made a sound.  It gave us the &#34;feeling&#34; that whoever, or whatever, occupied it, was aware we were watching it. V ery strange.  A friend also saw a similar craft several months later in the same county.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/15/88 15:00|Edgewood|MD|Sphere|45 seconds|Edgewood, MD boy sees a chrome sphere move laterally across sky and change directions near the Edgewood Arsenal Army base.|1/3/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15742.html|5|ndxe198805| Edgewood, MD boy sees a chrome sphere move laterally across sky and change directions near the Edgewood Arsenal Army base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just gotten home from school when I threw down my backpack and did my usual thing as a kid by running outside to play kickball.  I lived a stone&#39;s throw from the Edgewood Arsenal in Edgewood, Maryland so I was familiar with their routine paratrooper drops and helicopter activity around that area.  It was a sunny, beautiful day with bright blue skies and cottonball-like, low cumulus clouds.  I was standing on my front porch about to run over to play with friends when a bright reflective-like flash caught my attention.  I looked (east?) over the railroad tracks and saw a chrome-colored ball just sitting in the air.  I would guesstimate that it was approximatly 500-750 feet above ground.  I remember freezing in complete silence as I immediately knew that I was observing something peculiar.  I would best describe it as a ball bearing that was highly reflective, probably 30 to 40 feet in diameter.  I remember standing as still as I possibly could, because even as a kid I must admit that I was intrigued by UFOs.  I remember thinking, &#34;oh my God, just be still and watch it and don&#39;t blink your eyes!!&#34; My parents were not home as my mother got back from work usually and hour after me, so I couldn&#39;t call for anyone.  I&#39;m sure that if someone else had been outside nearby I would have called for them to look at it with me, but strangely nobody was outside in earshot.  The object stayed completely still for approximately 30 seconds.  I remember thinking maybe it was a balloon or a Radiosonde, because I had found one of those in a nearby patch of woods years prior. I remember feeling almost paralyzed with an anxiety-like fear.  I knew I was seeing something I wasn&#39;t supposed to.  It&#39;s almost as if my body reacted to it also.  After remaining still, the object began to move laterally, from right to left.  It was almost like it was being pulled sideways on a string.  That made me even more scared because balloons usually drift up, ya know?  As it was moving to the left, it stopped,(like putting on the brakes)an! d slowly moved back to the right, and then I had this weird feeling that it knew I was watching it beacuse it changed direction again and disappeared behind a thick cloud.  I kept watching and the strangest thing happened.  I continued staring at the cloud in hopes of seeing it come out the other side, but it seemed to poke out barely from the right edge of the cloud, almost as if it were peeking to see if I was still there watching. I got the feeling that it knew I was there. (Weird!) I continued watching to see if it would come back out but it never did. The whole episode was probably less than a minute in duration. The object never moved up or down, just perfectly sideways. I never told my parents because they wouldn&#39;t have believed me anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a clear day and the sun was up.  No clouds, very clear and crisp day.  Upon putting my bag down I noticed what could best be described as a glowing red ball in the sky.  It was about half the size of a full moon.  I watched it for about 30 seconds and it was completely still with no sound.  I ran through all the possibilities in my head of what it could be, and can say with confidence it was not an plane, helicopter, planet, balloon, or secret military aircraft unless they have started making perfectly round glowing red ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, after about 45-60 seconds it starts moving left slow at first then faster.  It also becomes &#34;flatter&#34; as it moves.  I started walking up the street to keep it in my line of sight, and after about a quarter mile I ran back to the bus stop to catch it on the other side of some tall trees.  It was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was about 15 years ago, and I have never seen anything in the sky since that I could not explain.  I remember this event like it was yesterday.  I still cannot account for what it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

In the sky it was about the size of half a dime, and it was a very deep orange colour.  It came from the East and flew directly over head of us.  We realized it was a U.F.O when the object made two perfect 90 degree turns right after eachother.  Again it was completely silent.  It continued to fly straight to the west and dissapeared in the horizon<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
