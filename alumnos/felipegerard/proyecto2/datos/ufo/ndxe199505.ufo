To her side, and behind her was a bulletin board with the words: &#34;800 unknowns tracked last year&#34;, or words very close to that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve tried to contact KWGN in Denver, but to no avail. I don&#39;t know if they knew the camera was on that bulletin board or not, but, for just a few seconds (maybe 20 to 30) were the words that haunt me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NORAD tracks ALL debris, aircraft, spacecraft, spacejunk, anything that flys or is in orbit around the planet. For those words to be where they were, is paramount to saying the AIR FORCE admits they can NOT identify at least 800 bogies in a year. That says a LOT. Although it is not proof positive of &#34;FLYING SAUCERS&#34;, it is a far cry from the hardline statements that UFO&#39;s are &#34;swamp gas, clouds, meteors, or imagination&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope maybe you could dig deeper and find out if they still have the tape of that special on Cheyenne Mountain. It aired in May of 1995 as I recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I do not remember what day this happened, but 26 May &#39;95 (as in the report above) seems very plausible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of  &#39;95 I was awakened (about 1 AM) by the window next to my bed vibrating by a deep note (sounded like some type of engine, but at a very low frequency).  I opened the window to stop the vibration, and looked out south towards Avon Rd. and Livernois Ave. in Rochester Hills, MI and saw a giant triangle UFO.  My house was right next to two &#39;busy&#39; streets, at least 10 cars a minute during the night, during this I did not see one car the whole time the UFO was in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At each one of the corners, there was a colored ball, greenish, set into the craft.  It looked like a propulsion system, it seemed like something (a liquid) was flowing within the pods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know how big it was, I had nothing to compare it to, somewhere between 250 m  and 1500 km long, and three-quarters again as wide, and the depth was about one-third of the width, like an isosceles triangle, or an arrowhead.  Traveled very slowly E to W.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed blocky, like it was back engineered alien technology.  It didn&#39;t have the sleekness that is usually attributed to UFOs, though I am not an expert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within one month of this sighting (I didn&#39;t put two and two together for several years) I found a bump on the back of my neck.  Went to the doctor to check it out, he had no idea what it was.  He brought in other colleges to check it out, they were clueless as well.  The told me that it seemed harmless but that I should go see another doctor, which I never did.  It is still there, 13 years later, hasn&#39;t cause me any harm that I know of, but it does seem to be shrinking in size (or maybe I just grew).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate.

It seemed odd to me somehow so I watched it but continued to walk.  I would describe it as a silver metallic, teardrop-shaped object.  It stood out very plainly against the backdrop of a dark storm cloud that was coming in from the northwest.  (I might not never have seen it, if not for that.)  Anyway, even though it seemed to be moving just a bit too fast to be an aircraft, I really didn&#39;t think too much of it right away.  I just assumed that&#39;s what it actually was because I live so close to the military base.  I continued to watch it for several seconds, when suddenly it just came to a full stop in mid air!  I was stunned!  Needless to say, I stopped walking and just stood there and watched it.  It then started to move very erratically, changing speeds and directions seemingly at random.  It would occasionally stop and then start moving again.  The way it “danced” and “wiggled”, it made me think of a drop of mercury.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 30 seconds at most before it finally stopped in mid air one final time and then shot up straight into the sky like a slingshot and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that the main gate of Eglin Air Force Base is barely 2 miles north of the town I live in (Shalimar, Florida) and this object appeared to me to be in the skies just to the west of the base&#39;s main gate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

A cigar shaped bright neon green craft with a long neon red emission at the rear dropped down through the clouds moving south right above the river as if to verify its course and just as quickly disappeared back up through the clouds. We slowly turned to look at each other. Each of us almost afraid to admit to each other what we had just seen. There was no noise and it moved very fast. The colors literally glowed like neon does.

Lucas and noticed a very large round silver white object.  At first I quickly thought the moon was EXTREMLY close to the earth.  Then I realized it was not the moon.  The object seemed to glow but did not put out any light.  I kept looking around for someone else and no one was around, anywhere.  It was a very calm night.  As I approached Faithion P. Lucas and turned right I was head to head with the object.  I was afarid so I stopped my car.  I didn&#39;t want to go past the object.  I didn&#39;t move at all.  The object was very large approx. 5 yards across and perfectly round.  It was about 5 yards off the ground. I was about 15 yards away from the object so I got a VERY close look at the sphere.  Suddenly, the object took off in an upward arch south and disappeared into space without making a sound.  It moved at the speed of light!  I was stunned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentioned this incident to a few co-workers and one told me a local news channel had several calls concerning a UFO in the Mesquite area and reported it was a (I love this part) weather balloon.  Last time I checked weather balloons did not move at the speed of light!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It is situated on the top of a large hill in the center of the city. I walked out the back entrance and was enjoying the weather-clear blue skies and 70 degree warmth-when I noticed what I thought was a stunt kite due to the shape of the object.  I watched it for a few minutes wondering where the individual was who was flying the kite when it tipped over, and became a sliver of black, perpendicular to the ground.  It appeared to circle around the city but was very hard to follow because it was so thin.  I got to my car and tried to drive to where I had last seen it so I could get a view from underneath but I was never able to do so. When I first saw the object it was angling up into the sky.  After it reached a height far above the rooftops, it tipped over.  It was probably as big as my thumbnail with my arm extended.  I couldn&#39;t hear a sound and kept thinking that I should hear *something*.<n>

At this point, the two balls of light merged into one, and approached the cliffs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first yellow, glowing, ball was seen heading north from the Mexico border, leaving a bright trail behind. I looked around, from a bench on the cliffs, to see if anybody on the cliffs or the pier below, saw the bright ball approach. Now looking north, I saw another yellow glowing ball, between myself and the pier, making a steep decent, then leveling out momemtarily, then rapidly decending behind a house, and down into cliffs below. I am certain that the second ball of light hit landfall. The first glowing ball was now hovering 1/2 mile out over the ocean directly in front of me. The second ball rose up into view again, hovered, then slowly flew out to join the first yellow ball. The strange thing about these glowing balls, was that they seemed to stay the same size no matter if they approached or flew off. The two yellow balls became one while hovering directly in front of the bench I was on. Next, the now larger singular ball of yellow light towards me, up the cliff, stopping 4 feet away, and about 6 feet in the air.<n>

All of a sudden it changed course to south to north. I was facing east. I saw in front of a diamond shaped object. It was emitting beames of light that changed color. the object from my house to it was about 3 miles. The object moved slowly(comparred to other storys i&#39;ve heard about) and the jet was following closlely behind it. It has been about 2.5 minutes since first seen. All of a sudden it made a large bang and a flash of light and disappered.<n>

My first thought, Helicopter, but no sound was heard, from anything, when I think about it.approx (3) white smaller lights traveling with it. I&#39;m starting to wonder if we were looking at something that , maybe..droped us off?I know how that sounds. This is gut feeling purely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, this is all in retrospect, accuacy would require meeting with ex-girlfriend due to my lack of memory regarding anything prior to that sight.Sholl Canyon Park, top of Glenoaks Blvd, in Glendale, CA. A park is there where we would go to spend time  together, ie, the view..a couple thing. I recall being in the middle of the street with her, walking uphill, it seems we both recognized it at the same time.  Three points of lights (all red) forming a triangle shape.  We were walking up hill maybe eastbound  facing the mountains, Mt Wilson to be more accurate.  What got our attention was my saying, &#34;shsss, I can&#39;t hear anything&#34;  Approx; (3) other white lights were in it&#39;s immediate vacinity. I say approx, because the Burbank Glendale skies are always lit up considering the Burbanks airport. My closest comparison would be this description. I though maybe it was three different helicopters flying in a triangle formation.  Being that the lights were lower that the top of Mt wilson, that tells me it was very close ( a few miles if that) Only no blinking lights that usually gives us a human identification. I don&#39;t know if yo!u could see through the center   because it was the same color as the backround mountains, which is black. Anyway we both stood like dazed children, lost in the middle of the street. And watched it move slowly north untill it looked like it vanish behind Burbanks city lights. not once did we here anything we could associate with what we know is in our skies.  And for some reason I dismissed it and labled it three helicopters., because if it wasn&#39;t three different light sources generating that triangular or greater than sign &#34; &lt; &#34;  tilt that about 90 degrees, so that the bottom light is where the rear propeller would be a single craft. If it wasn&#39;t 3 choppers, then it was truly massive in my eyes. No sound what so ever, no wind no traffic, no nothing but us talking and saying &#34;look at that!&#34; &#34;what is that&#34;? &#34;shhh, let me listen&#34; In retrospect, I wonder, is it a valid possibility, ...ok, hear it go..that we were looking at something that dropped us off?..I&#39;m not mental or at lea!st no ones labled me that, yet. I say this because, we simply did not have the excitement that I feel now. It&#39;s like remembering a faint dream, or just residue of a dream. I need to speak to my ex-girlfriend, (Sandie) I know she remembers it. She said &#34;it my first  sighting&#34;<n>

My last tour was on the USNS Kane, a US Navy Research Vessel charted by NAVOCEANO and under command of the Military Sealift Command.  These ships were managed and crewed by a subsidary of Dyn Services (front company for CIA or NSA) and this subsidary of Dyn Services is Dyn Marine Services, who I was employed by.  My position was AB Unlimited, or a helmsman for the land people.  A simple search on the above mentioned corporations will reveal the obvious connection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ships mission was submarine defense warfare related, whether it was hydrographic surveys (mapping of ocean floor), or the launching and towing of many various types of sleds, bullets, and other &#34;secret&#34; equipment.  First, the winches on board were equipped with miles of high tech optical embedded cable that was connected to the various devises so we actually launched and retrieved to the deepest depths, I know of several occasions while we were on ops we would have equipment in 13000 feet of water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ship was divided in two areas of personnel, the crew, approx. 35 including deck and engine dept., and around 30 scientists who were employed by NAVO, the US Navys Oceanographic Office.  There was a big division between these two, the crew and the scientists.  Man, were they ever tight- lipped...and their labs and quarters took up 2/3 of the ship, and all the labs were secure, no entry what so ever to the crew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I served as primary crane operator, and the scientists became partial to me launching with the crane and operation of winches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1995 I served 336 days aboard the Kane-  The night of the sighting we were in the Indian Ocean, and were pulling this rather large sled, whatever it did- when an unusual circumstance arose.  The Senior Navo Scientist came to the bridge.  Remember the division factor...and I was on the port bridge wing, my watch partner AB was on the wheel (actually in the bridge, as we were on gyro) and the Second Mate had the watch.  When the Senior came to the bridge he was actually being social, and he came out to the port wing to converse with me.  Cool, I thought, this is unusual...and as we were speaking, I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming up from the depths was what appeared to be a small point of light, and was quickly becoming larger as it arose from the depths. When I said &#34;LOOK&#34; and every one on the bridge was watching the Senior did a most curious thing.  He ran for the squwak box (here I have to add a note, as the scientists had their own &#34;conn&#34; or bridge, if you will, down below they were capable of steering and controlling course of the ship, however the command to turn or change course would always be relayed to us on the real bridge via this squawk box) and he said to his cohorts, and I quote his words &#34;Gentleman, we have INTERESTING NATURAL PHENOMENA off the port bow,&#34; with heavy emphasis on the words I itailisized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As he ran back out to the port wing the object, which was round and I would guess 75 feet in diameter, was at this time I estimate was about 100 feet below our ship...it was so bright- the color of a green glow stick...and I also have to add that the seas were glass, dead calm.  Seeing was easy.  At this moment, How do I put it?  The object went back down in the opposite direction it came from- at a very steep angle and whoa...it was haulin***, with a blur... it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was it coincidental we stayed in this area for three days, going back and forth, around and around?  I am convinced of alien presence in our oceans.  For I SAW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is my hope that maybe one day we will know the TRUTH- our government knows, that&#39;s for sure.  Any NAVO Scientists lurking here?  Maybe we all will hear from one who is willing the speak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be curious of any similiar expierences.  I have seen pyro plankton, bio luminesence, glow jelly fish, etc.  What we saw was a craft of some unknown type, and not any of these natural sources stated above.<n>

I really don&#39;t know the exact date, but I know it was in May of 95&#39;. We saw three sphere like lights come over a hill from the north. The first one we saw was yellow. When it first came into my view it was about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile away. It looked to be about the size of a car. After about 30 seconds it disappeard from our view by going over a hill to our north-east. About 10 seconds later the second light appeared. This one was much larger (about the size of a medium size house)and was glowing bright red. It took the same exact path that the first one did. About ten seconds after that, the third on appeared over the same hill and took the same exact route. This one was the exact size and color as the first one. They were all moving very slow. Too slow to be planes. No sound either, so they couldn&#39;t have been helicopters. Plus there were no blinking lights. Only a glowing sphere. We could not make out any shape either, just light. I do remember that it was a thursday though, because the following thursday I had a different friend with me and I got to see one more. This time I was about 300 yards further up the road, in my yard. There is a hill about 50 yards behind my old house(north) that is about 80-100 feet high and very steep. The light that I saw that night was coming over that hill. It appeared to be the same exact size and color as the yellow ones that I had seen a week before. Just as soon as I pointed and yelled to my friend, &#34;Look! I told you I wasn&#39;t lying!&#34;, the object seemed to spin 180 degrees and disappear from our sight back over the hill. Sorry no pictures. To tell you the truth, I didn&#39;t even think of it. I don&#39;t think I could have gotten to a camera fast enough. Plus I might have missed something!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from same source.  We will attempt to have the other witnesses submit reports, as well.  PD))<n>

I&#39;ve never said much to many people, I know some would never understand what I saw that early am.  It was like suddenly a bright light was visible, by the time I comprehended what I was seeing, it like got huge, like something was going to I don&#39;t know it happened so quickly, I like jumped in a ducking position, out of quick reaction, and gone, not a sound, not any evidence of what we had just seen, nothing.  I don&#39;t think anyone ever really explored the area for anything out of the ordinary either. I&#39;ve experienced many different really weird things that I have seen, all in the same radius within 5 miles of each other.  One night my truck had broken down, it was late, more like early am, I was parked on a downgrade, being afraid of the dark, and knowing of all the wildlife I had seen in the rual area I was in, I was afraid to walk to get help, I just sat in my truck waiting for a vehicle to come by, I looked out my rear view mirror, I saw a bright, like glowing round circle, it was like bouncing in the air, like there was no gravity, I watched it for awhile in my mirror, I physically turned around to see it out of the mirror, it was there without the mirror, it just bounced around, it would suddenly move sideways real fast but would keep like moving up, and down like floating.  I saw the same glowing light once before that, I looked out the window in the early am, or late evening, and saw the same bright light, but much smaller bouncing around like near the ground , I think it was like a few months within the time frame, a few of us were standing on some stairs outside, like in the late afternoon, it was still light outside, we saw what we thought was a plane crash in mid air, I don&#39;t remember seeing anything before hand, but suddenly there was like an explosion of something in the sky it didn&#39;t seem too far, because it was sooo visible it looked like 2 planes had crashed in mid air, and suddenly parts of debris scattered, and were falling downward, I was like soo shocked to have witness this unusual thing, we thought for sure it had been a horrible plane crash, it looked to severe, we thought for sure we would read or hear about the incodent in the paper, or news, I looked for days, I never heard, or read of any such sighting ever.  I still to this day wonder what in the world these weird things I experienced were.  I would also like to know if there is anyone else out there anywhere, that may have seen anything similar to what I have expressed<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was 17 my brother was 18 and had just graduated from high school.  We had recently moved from the bigger city of Normal, IL to a small country town called Mackinaw about 20 miles away.  We still had friends in Normal so we would often go hang out in there on weekends.  One Friday night that spring after playing cards and handing out with friends (no drugs or alcohol were consumed) my brother and I took off for home about midnight or so.  Being that we lived out of town, we had to go through a stretch of what I would call country roads to get home.  My brother was driving and as we were just on the outskirts of Normal, I started looking at the sky.  It was a very clear night and a lot of stars were visible.  As I looked up I noticed a light that looked like an airplane light blinking however it was moving around in a very odd manner.  It looked like it was dancing around the sky.  It looked like it ! was jumping from spot to spot instead of flying in a strait line like an airplane.  As I watched this light, all of a sudden I saw a red ball of light shoot out from it strait into the sky.  I started freaking out and told my brother to stop the car so he could see this light.  He did and we sat and watched this light continue to dance around in the sky.  We got kind of freaked out and started driving again towards home.  At this point we were still about 20 miles from home.  As we drove on about another two miles, we came to a stop sign.  There was a large grain elevator just accross from the stop sign to our right.  As we passed the grain elevator, we looked up and saw a large Triangle UFO hovering about 100 feet over our head.  It looked to be rotating on some kind of axis and it had lighs that looked to be circling around it.  It made no noise whatsoever.  We screamed and I yelled at my brother to get the hell moving.  The rest of the way home, this UFO hovered over our! car at about a distance of 100 feet.  All I could think of is! that we were going to be abducted by aleins at any minute.  It was such a nerve racking ride home as my brother did what he could to drive while I just watched this UFO following us.  As we made our final approach to the subdivising we had just moved to, the UFO just kept going until it was out of our view.  This encounter lasted almost 25 minutes and I still wonder what it was that I saw that night.  I can only think of theree explanations: 1. Our government is hundereds of years more advanced than they let us know about. 2. Another country is hundreds of years more advanced than we are. or 3. We are being visited by alien beings.  Those are absoluetley the only explanations possible for what I saw that night.  This was not a helicopter or a plane.  I wish I could meet more people that have had an experience like this and to share more details of our experience that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Dark, floating, soundless UFO floats across sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 3AM, about 4 yrs ago, when I was 21, I was delivering papers in Lake Forest, Illinois.  I was 1 block north of Fort Sheridan.  The sky was dimly illuminated by surrounding streetlights, etc...  I looked up, and over treetops a dark, lightless, soundless, UFO floated.  It was so low I probably could of hit it with a rock, easily.  I was excited, and decided to follow it.  I noticed it wasn&#39;t the shape of flying craft normally seen.  It was a solid shape, like rectangle, triangle, square, but I was more excited to follow it, so I didn&#39;t focus on exact shape.  It wasn&#39;t enormous, but not real small neither.  I did notice it seemed to have bumps and ridges on the bottom.  I have a sunroof, so when it flew over my car I could see it.  I chased it, but soon gave up because I couldn&#39;t maneuver the small suburban roads well enough to follow it&#39;s flight path.  It floated in a straight path, not seeming to gain altitude (very low).  It floated slowly.  I lost it in the darkness.  My assumption was it either flew directly over Fort Sheridan, or it took off from Fort Sheridan.  (Fort Sheridan, as to my knowledge, is a closed military base).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

We generally do not include information or reports about dreams, but this witness identifies himself, and his report appears to us to be a serious-minded, carefully prepared statement of what he and his wife seem to remember.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Broad daylight sighting of enormous craft outside of Scottsdale Arizona May 13, 1995 around 2:00pm by husband and wife for about 20 min<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke this morning 4/10/01 with a vivid yet hazy recollection of an event that happened back in 1995.  The memory itself is strong and undeniable yet when I try to concentrate on the event, I can recall it only as through a veil of mist.  On the day in question, however, the weather was perfectly clear.  A beasutiful blue desert sky.  I cannot begin to remember what first caught my attention, but I do recall the gist of the conversation I had with my wife.  &#34;Is that what I think it is?&#34;  &#34;I can&#39;t beleive it could be anything else&#34; &#34;It&#39;s so huge&#34; for about twenty minutes we observed a huge silvery grey craft.  I first remembered it as being Large and round but throughout the day I remember the round craft as being one type along with two others that joined the much larger craft which I now seem to remember as being somewhat angular.  As for its&#39; shape, I cannot find the words to describe how immense it was.  It moved fairly slowly for the time we observed it.  I do not recall how it came to leave our sight. As for the other objects I beleive I saw, there were some large round ones, and two types of smaller ones.  Had I seen the smaller ones by themselves, I do not beleive I would have described them as small but in relations ship to the large craft, they seemed somewhat diminutive.  I am overwhelmed by my memory of the large craft.  My wife remembers the large craft as being oval. This does not fit my recollection.  Nor does she recall any other smaller craft.  What puzzles me most, I think, is that we did not talk about this event for any length of time after it happened.  It seemed so, &#34;Matter of fact&#34; It seems to me that an event such as this would have been &#34;life changing&#34; but strangely enough this has not been the case.  I spent some time this evening searching the web to see if anyone else witnessed what we saw on or around the same period of time with no luck.  Perhaps it was some foggy dream of my own creation I say to myself, yet when I asked my wife if she recalled anything, she quickly was able to verify a similar sequence of events.  Our details do not seem to coincide, but the overwhelming memory of the event, for me, precludes any immediate need for corraboration(sp?)  I am not now, nor have recently been under the influence of any medication alcohol or illness.  I do not now nor do I have any family history of any mental illness.  I am not given to flights of fantasy yet do not generally take the role of unreasonable sceptic.<n>

The area the sitghing took place in was sparsely populated at the time so there was only 3 sources of light polution in the night sky in line of site of the craft which helped me make a guess at the size of the craft, it was enormous. My house was a few blocks off a main f.m. highway and i45, the fm highway ran east to west and i45 north to south from my position. From the spot i was standing observing the craft i45 was 2 miles east and the closest edge of the craft was close to the end ot the road i lived on which dead ended 2 blocks east of where i was stranding. Between the end of the road and i45 were maybe 20 houses and several acres of woods and pastures. There were a few scattered clouds in the sky and no moon but the light from i45 and the mall could be seen clearly reflecting off near the center of the craft. Id say the craft was less than 1000 feet up and it moved very slowly. There was some traffic on the near highway but over the slight road noise i could hear an audible hum. After making note of the scale of the craft i knew it had to have been something on the order of 4 or more miles long near to far end though i couldnt see the far end, the center of the craft was just slightly above the treeline/horizon with the rest of its outline disappearing below the treeline. The craft had a number of lights on its leading edge and at least 2 on its trailing all of the same hue of red and a constant light no flashing as an aircrafts marker lights would. Against the night sky it was pitch black save where the lights of the highway and the mall reflected off its underside. I would have written it off as a collection of planes flying in formation if it werent for a few things that dont add up. It was clearly a solid object. Jet black against the dark blue of the night sky, stars visible over the light polution disappear! ed as the craft flew between them and me line of sight. It flew too slow to be any regular aircraft save for maybe a blimp but it was far too big to be a blimp of any known make. The thing that convinced me it was a solid single craft was the scattered clouds described earlier. In the 2 hours i watched it passed through 1 of the errant clouds and parted it some going over the top and some underneath. I went inside to get a drink and a sketch pad to draw out what we were seeing and when i got back outside it was gone. It had taken the craft 2 hours or so to move roughly 3 miles but in less than a minute it had gone completely out of sight without making any noise. To this day it remains the single largest thing i&#39;ve ever seen. if requested i can scan the sketches i made of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Aware of us observing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Noticed a &#34;star&#34; split apart and began watching it join and split several times.  Then noticed several lights  moving thru the sky seeming to chase each other and following the exact turns of the one in front of it.  Moving at a high rate of speed and then slowing to almost hover.  My friend and I watched this for about 40 min and decided to go away from the city lights to get a better view of them. Each smaller light eventually returned to the larger one and it seemed to &#34;catch&#34; it.  The larger obgect matched the speed and trajectory of the smaller object as it merged for just a moment and then returned to its previous position. And then it got weird, I had noticed that they left a slight trail on the retina like a flashbulb dot but just a trace so you could see the lines of their movement.  I began playing this game with them where I&#39;d look into an empty portion of sky and one would fly right into the spot I was looking at, stop and then began zipping around again.  I did this maybe 10 times before it really began to freak me out as it seemed they knew what I was looking at. My friend had noticed the same thing and said they were &#34;writing in the sky&#34;  I was about 25yds. from the truck and My friend yelled there was one in the trees about 100yds. behind me - I looked and dismissed it as a ballfield light.  Then he cracked &#34;well then why is it moving?&#34; and as I looked back it was rising above the trees and had lit them up from the side I was on, so I ran like hell screaming start the truck over and over.  It cast my shadow on the ground as I ran.  Looking back it was moving over the field without a sound casting very bright beams of slightly bluish light. Made it to the truck, dived in the back and screamed hit it. It went srtaight up and disappeared.  This event still freaks me out. More or less went right home, locked up the house and didin&#39;t sleep until daybreak.  Feel very fortunate it backed off, hope to never see another event.<n>

I remember there was a thunderstorm in the distance and I was watching the lightning strikes as they hit the ground....   there were low, (cumulous) puffy, cotton ball clouds in the area.    I can&#39;t really tell how congested the sky was, because the only light was from cars, the city and highway lights reflecting off the wet pavement...    Suddenly a yellow orange orb travelled from one cloud to another.... it was too fast to look for distinguising features,but it was too slow to be a so called &#34;lighting ball&#34; and didn&#39;t resemble any aircraft.   It was very bright, and it appeared in one area of the sky, as a orange light in fog, emerged from the cloud and then did the reverse when it reached another part of the sky which was about 200 to 300 meters away (aprox)    Mabey it was dipping in and out of the cloud, however in the low light, my depth perception was very unreliable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Even though the scene of those people carrying through the forest wasn&#39;t spectacular it was unbelivable. what makes me thinking about this up to this days is that this mechanical sound (hoover like) was in the air for around an hour. even when arriving in emmelshausen. no spectacular things happening but an experience i will not forget as hardly anybody will have expirienced this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> enjoy  ((name deleted))  i just think it&#39;s not only about ufo&#39;s but also about different beeings and states which are pretty far away from mindstates we know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I automatically assumed that it was a airplane flying low at night and the perspective was throwing off the actual height. So my sister stopped to get the mail at the bottom of our 150 ft driveway. I stared and then noticed the light was not moving. Just as a mentioned this to my mother and sister the light began to zip smoothly towards us. My sister did not pull up the driveway, but my mother began to panic and said to get up the driveway. My heart began to race since this light as now apparently only 2 feet above the treeline! As we pulled in the garage I looked overhead and saw the light skirt over the tops of the trees and then we were in the garage. As I ran inside to look out the windows, the object had left and that was the end of the excitement. To date my mother doesn&#39;t talk about it because she doesn&#39;t want people to think she is crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We usually take the main road up to Conifer, CO, but we decided to take the side road (Turkey Creek Canyon Road) this time. We were travelling about 30 mph when I noticed a glowing light up by the ONLY street light on that road. Just as I noticed the light it moved VERY QUICKLY towards the windshield (I thought it was going to hit us) then travelled with us for about 2 seconds when the driver suddenly hit the brakes and swerved out of the way at which time it QUICKLY flew off to our left through a clearing and over the ridge out of sight. The driver and I got out of the car and his date remained in the car crying and very scared. When we returned to the car we gathered our senses and I demanded that we each write down what we saw (as to avoid convincing each other of our encounter). When we compared what we saw, we all came to the same conclusion that we had seen a UFO. It was a translucent image about the size of an SUV. It had, what appeared to be a fan propeller, but it moved rather quickly for it ot be powered by a propeller. We could tell it had a very bright light because when it took off to our left it lit up the trees around it before darting down the ridge about 60-100 yards away.<n>

Without a word being spoken, both of us immediately ran backwards frrom the water&#39;s edge. I looked over at my fearless brother and he had a 25 caliber pistol pulled, aimed at the water (he was a manager of a rest. and carried alot of money so he carried a gun).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of us just looked at each other and asked what the heck was that, though not in such nice terms.

But to the best of my knowledge, it was an early summer night, probably April-June of 1995, I was on my way to a store, on the back roads of Sun Prairie.  I was at stop sign with a road to the left, HWY C, and my road continuing straight to HWY 151.  I saw an object hovering towards me, off to my left, very slowly with no sound.  As it got closer, it almost seemed to hover above the telephone lines, how high, I&#39;m not sure.  It had a cross-like appearance, I can only say this because of the 4 directional lights I saw in a cross shape, it was too dark to see an actual outline of the object itself.  I also believe there to be a circular red light on the bottom - center of the object.  To my immediate left was a corn field.  After observing the object for a short time, perhaps a minute or two, I turned left and slowly started to leave, as I began moving, the object did as well.  It moved off in a NW direction, I believe, away from me and into the cornfield, apparently getting higher as it went.  Before I knew it, it was gone.  I didn&#39;t see any fast take off or anything of the sort it just sort of..  slowly disappeared into the night.  I had never seen nor heard of anything even remotely close to this, until stumbling upon this site.  I had this form filled out once, and backed out of submitting it, and continued browsing.. I found another sighting, in Puerto Rico, if I remember correctly, that was frighteningly similar.. so frightening in fact, I&#39;ve yet slept tonight. :P  In any case, that really pushed me to go ahead and submit this.. &#39;sighting.&#39;  I&#39;m also going to e-mail a very rough computer graphic I made of the, again, rough shape I believe I saw.  I made this a year or so after the incident, since my knowledge of computers at the time was extremely limited.  Again, this is a very rough drawing, but I believe it conveys the basic message.<n>
5/1/95 18:00|Killawog|NY|Light|5 min.|I saw three balls of light. Two yellow and one red on one occation.

Two yellow and one red on one occation. One yellow ball exactly one week later@around the same time of day<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were accually two events that occured in one week. I am not sure of the exact month, but I remember it being warm enough to go with out a coat. Both sightings happend on a Thursday and both occured at around dusk. I was in high school at the time. On the first sighting two of my friends and myself were standing on Owen Hill Rd. near the four corners of the small town of Killawog, looking south. From up over a hill to the south, maybe a mile and a half in distance, I saw a bright yellow light. I pointed it out to my two friends and as you can imagine, the three of us were mystified. I could not tell whether or not it was just a ball of light or if it was a light attached to something. The light was too bright for me to clearly see if there was a shape behind it. It was flying somewhat towards us. Mainly north-west, us being to the north. It passed over a hill to the west, out of our view. It was in our view for about 30-45 sec. Within 10 sec. of the first yellow light leaving our sight, a second ball of light came of the hill to the south from the same location as the yellow one. This one was much different. It was bright red and at least 3 times as large as the yellow one. It flew in the same exact path that the first one did, and disapeared from our view over to same location on the hill to the west. The third and final ball of light came exactly as the previous 2 had gone. the third ball was the exact same size and color as the first one. My friends and I waited where we were for about a half an hour. Partly to see if there were anymore, but mainly to listen for engine sounds. We heard none. The balls of light were definatly not traveling fast enoughto break the sound barrier. At first we all thought that they were helecopters, but we quickly relized that if they were we would have heard them. The next encounter I had was exactly a week later at roughly the same time. This time I had a different friend with me. I had told him about it and he just laughed at me. That night (dusk) we were in the ! yard of a residence a few hundred yards from where my other two friends and I had been a week prior. There is a hill that is fairly tall and has a very steep incline roughly 50 yards behind this residence. I again was to first to see it. It was coming over the hill behind the house to the south. From the south to the north. I quickly pointed it out to my friend saying &#34; See!I told I wasn&#39;t lying!&#34; As soon as my friend turned to look it appeared that the craft had turned 180&#39; heading back in the direction it had come from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date is approximate.
