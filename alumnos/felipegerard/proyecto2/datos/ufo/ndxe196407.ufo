My parents were already in bed and  the lights in the house were out.  I looked out our bathroom window and it was a very quiet summer evening with a clear night sky.  As I looked east, I saw a blinking white light moving in the sky, like a small plane flying at a normal altitude.  However, the light was blinking rapidly, unlike any small plane would have, and I remember that it was absolutely silent.  It looked to be perhaps a mile or so away, and on a very still evening, I was surprised that there was no sound of an engine or plane or anything.  It did not move erratically, but it also did not move as any other aircraft I had seen in that it seemed to have its own path and eventually disappeared in the direction it had come.  Why this experience has remained in my mind all these years is that the next day, or perhaps even the day after that, I noticed in our newspaper, The Worcester Telegram, a very small article in one of the back pages, reporting that an object had been spotted, fitting the description and spotted around the same time period as I had witnessed what I did, and it was reported in the article as an &#34;unidentified object&#34; in the sky over &#34;East Mountain Street&#34; - which was the direction I was looking from our home on XX Brattle Street, Holden.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

7/25/64 13:00|Roscoe|MN|Disk|6 minutes|July 25, 1964, saucer/disk seen so close on a beautiful summer day.|3/6/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/117/S117428.html|2|ndxe196407| July 25,1964 Saucer/disk seen so close on a beautiful summer day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday, July 25th, 1964, at 12:00 Noon, How can I ever forget this day.  It was a beautiful calm day.  Being I just shortly got my Driving permit at age 15, My Father told me to use the Family Car a 1956 Pontiac to drive home a employee of his.  He lived Below the Hill in Roscoe, Minnesota, 56371.  Just minutes away from his Business.  I drove, with passenger Dads car, North from Roscoe about a mile for a joy ride first.  This town is build on a wash out with a hill on both sides about a mile apart.  This will brings you at a creek that runs under the road.  The conversation was we were talking About being on our High School Base ball Team when School Starts in September,  That&#39;s when I saw the silver disk.  It was so visible and close against the blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started yelling at the passenger. Look at that Silver Saucer!!  I then braked hard and pulled the car to the side of the road near the creek and parked.  I kept the engine running and shifted in neutral.  We both observed a Disk/ Saucer to the North of where we were parked about a half mile away.  We observed the Silver Saucer/Disk at first hovering about 250 Feet Above a farm to the N.W.  It made no sound, No lights or windows could be seen.  It then moved to the next farm a half mile away to the east and Hovering over it for about a minute.  It then crossed the road to the East, really got a good look at it being so close.  It hovered over a pasture.  Each time it stopped it Wobbling like it was having a hard time controlling it self.  It then moved over the pasture area slowly, stopped and Hovered and then started an upward diagonal assent.  The acceleration then speeded up to and incredible 3 second to the cloud level and Vanished.   We were terrified at the speed not knowing what this was, where it went and if it was coming back to flank us.  I turned the car around south and headed back to Roscoe as fast as dads 389 Pontiac car would go.  I drove back to his Business both of us running in telling what we just experienced.  Dad and several customers then armed themselves, went out side and saw nothing.  Several other sighting were reported that month in that county and area.  Later that fall 1964, a U.S Air force Radar team was dispatched to Regal, Minnesota Just 18 Miles Away.  The Radar team was set up with 4 railroad Cars with Radar Equipment and living Quarters.  Some of these Air force personal during their off duty time would patronize my dad&#39;s night club business on Saturday night with their Air Force uniforms on.  I had to work those nights.  Seeing the uniform, I ask what their were up to in Regal, Minnesota.  They responded it was Top Secret.  After 6 months or so I got to Know one of the Air force personal Quite well as their deployment was coming to an end.  He told me that the reason they were dispatched was because of all the UFO sighting seen on radar in our area.  He said, the mission was that an Early warning detection system was deployed if the soviet Union launched a missile, that&#39;s what they told the Paynesville press but we were looking for UFO&#39;s mostly because this is a hot spot he stated.  I told him what I saw on July 25, 1964, and he said, that why were are here, so many sightings were reported.<n>

However from between the two lights there flew about 8 or more white sparks in a squiggle-type form, extending out what appeared to be 50 to 100 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my aunt who was in the front passenger seat, to look out her window over her right shoulder and tell me what she saw in the sky.  She spotted it and said &#34;What the heck is that?&#34; We both watched this display for a couple minutes, commenting to each other on what we saw, and wondering what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My uncle was all curious but could not stop the car as there was considerable traffic and no shoulder on which to park.   We discounted any commercial display or advertising -- although its altitude appeared to be less than 2000 feet, and it surely was not some small plane or helicopter.  After a few minutes we had gotten so far from it we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years ago I came upon a paper-back book being sold on a super-market revolving display and showing pictures and drawings of various sightings, in which was a diagram of exactly what we saw and the date it appeared -- but the darn book was $23 bucks and I didn&#39;t feel it was worth buying.  But I&#39;ve kicked myself many times for not buying it.  My uncle and aunt are gone -- but my memory of that sighting will never leave me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Something woke me up.  I looked up and saw a large thing up in the sky.  It was just hanging there and moving slowly over the house.  I just watched it for about 2 or 3 minutes until I got bored watching it.  It was rather retanglar in shape and there were lights all over it but I do not remember seeing anything definite in form.  I don&#39;t remember the shape very well because it was so many years ago.  I didn&#39;t tell anyone because I didn&#39;t want to be picked on.  I was only 14 or 15 years old.<n>

It&#39;s an old report and I&#39;ll try to be succinct.  What I&#39;m really trying to find out is if you hypnotize because I feel I&#39;m missing something, but maybe I&#39;m wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 7 months pregnant and got up to take a water pill.  I noticed it was very light outside my kitchen window.  I thought there must be a full moon.  As I sat my glass down on the counter the room began shaking.  I had been in aftershocks before when I lived in California and I thought I had experienced a small quake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started back to bed but then I heard the noise.  It was a humming like telephone wires, but more insistent.  I checked the oven and the refrigerator but couldn&#39;t find the noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never mind.  This is going to take all day and I already tried to send you a report on e-mail that didn&#39;t go through so I&#39;ve already written this once and don&#39;t want to do it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suffice it to say I watched this craft for some time, even walked over to the fence, but it has a strange ending.  I went back to bed and didn&#39;t remember seeing it until months later when I went to my surprise baby shower.  My friend had just read a book on flying saucers and when she said the words &#34;flying saucer&#34; I blurted out my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t think I had missing time but perhaps I may be wrong and since I&#39;m not getting any younger I thought I&#39;d talk to someone and see if it was worth pursing from a scientific angle for information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I think it was mid, to late summer, the weather was still warm.  I ran home terrified, and told my Mother, but she hadn&#39;t seen it.  I asked others for some time after that, but could find no other witnesses.  I finally gave up hope of discovering the truth of the matter, and no collision, fire, nor other disturbance was made publicly known, even weeks later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a huge, burning basketball, with bright orange flames trailing lazily behind for about two, or three times its diameter.  I thought I could hear the flames, similar to the sound a flag makes when stirred by a gentle breeze, but I didn&#39;t hear an impact of any sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the ball field north of Wilson Memorial High School, (the old army hospital) it described a gentle arc earthward beginning east northeast, seemingly it would have crashed roughly northeast of my position, I thought at the time, Harrisonburg, Va. (22801).<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years ago I saw a show on Discovery, or The History Channel, about a small New England town, that had been locked down, (around 1959) and the National Guard called in, over an object that crashed in the woods there.  It was said to be an object about the size of a VW, glowing hot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if that was what I saw, if so, then I would have been Five years old!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  The source of the report may be alluding to the event that occurred on December 09, 1965, in which an &#34;acorn&#34; shaped object landed in a copse of woods near the town of Kecksburg, PA.  PD))<n>

I was at that age a model rocket, math, and science enthusiast.  As an adult I graduated with an engineering degree.  On this special day, it was clear and sunny.  It was in the month of July.  The sky was blue with few clouds and maybe 90 F.  The winds were clam.  I first noticed it coming from the North floating towards the South or South Southeast.  Its speed seemed slow but did travel in a straight line of flight.  The object shape was clearly a rectangle.  Note, it was only a two dimensional object - no thickness.  You could not see through it.  Its color appeared as if it were a solid black - no color changes.  It floated along as if it were a plastic sheet one would hold by hand along the short side in front of a strong fan watching the greater length of plastic flutter very very slowly yet perpendicular to the fan face.  It remained level and with no sound, always keeping the same altitude, same speed, and same direction.  I followed it for nearly 20 minutes and was finally unable to continue.  It just continued southward, in the same direction, same altitude, same speed, unabated.  To ascertain a speed relative to ground, I estimate a segment distance of travel of 500 feet.  During that distance it traveled that distance in about 1 minute.  To estimate the size of the UFO, I would compare it to holding in my out stretched something 1.5&#34;x3.0&#34; in size in my hand.  As far as I know I was the only one to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Comment: Over the years I often wondered if it were nothing more than a plastic sheet floating along.  But anyone experienced in kite flying would know that any flat plastic sheet would not stay aloft parallel to the earth indefinitely as this object.  I felt when watching it as if it were a hole in the sky.  Almost as if I and the homes were being observed.  I was never frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above.  PD))<n>

Sitting next to me was my girlfriend, and in the passenger seat was her mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Her mother said &#34;look at the saucers!&#34;  The distance between the highway and the Bitterroot Mountains to the West was approximately a mile and a half.  The three red-orange ovals, which were lit from within like japanese lanterns, were between us and the mountains.  I would guess their distance at about one half mile from the higway we were traveling on. I would estimate their size to be 150 0r 200 feet in length.  The trio paced us at seventy miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just North of Hamilton is a deep canyou into the Bitteroots.  The trio turned as one aircraft and entered the canyon, displaying their thickened saucer shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above incident is only one of several events seen by residents of Missoula and the bitterroot valley during the Summer of 1964.  Check the Sunday supplement  of the Missoulian, the local paper.  It contained a report about a family that saw saucers landing nightly in the pastures around their ranchouse in Rattlesnake canyon North of Missoula.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the witness have his friend submit a report of her recollection of the event, as well.

Myself and a co-worker was taking our lunch break when i noticed this silver looking object coming towards us i thought at first it was a weather baloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object hovered approximately 500ft above us it was a silver (metallic) in colour it also had a dome.  We yelled for help but no one heard us..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally the object started moving north from our location at a high rate of speed i have never seen anything move as fast as this object moved..<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this sighting was not over we no longer settled down and we saw the UFO again this time it was flying above the cockpit of a airliner i don&#39;t think the pilot even new this object was above him.  The UFO followed the airliner to about the same location where it left the first time and it was gone at a high rate of speed..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really believe we were making contact with this UFO through our electro magnetic transmissions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would take a polygraph test to prove what i witnessed that day...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Its only other characteristic was that it appeared to be slowly revolving horizontally. An awkward estimation of its size would be 500 feet across. It did not emit any sound at any time during the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 seconds it slowly moved with increasing speed back over the Lake, stopped and hovered there for a few seconds, then darted very very quickly further over the Lake and out of sight over the horizon. Although I slowed slightly as I viewed this event in amazement, the traffic on the highway was brisk and prevented me from stopping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness who was riding beside me in the car also saw this event, but thought better of reporting it as she was and still is of he character of not drawing any sort of attention to herself, and after 42 years of marriage continues to be in denial regarding this event stating she does not remember it as she fears that people will laugh at her.

Soon after arriving we noticed a light moving across the sky.  We watched and commented how it must be an airplane, but we thought it should somehow have different lighting.  It was a steady white light not unlike a star, except it did not &#34;twinkle&#34; like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we followed the light across the sky we fully expected it to disappear below the horizon.  It did not.  The light circled around behind us and then disappeared below the horizon.  The area behind us was flat for several hundred feet and then rose ten to twenty feet or so.  While still watching where the light had disappeared, the light reappeared, still behind us relatively in the same area it disappeared.  It might have been several yards to the right in the clockwise circle it had started to make.  The light circled around us in a clockwise fashion very slowly for many minutes, sometimes disappearing below the horizon/rise behind us, always coming back up circling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point after reappearing from the horizon/rise behind us, the light dipped into a grove of trees to the left of the driver’s side of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  Up until then I was under the impression the light was either up with the stars or at least up there somewhere with jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trees were about a hundred yards away.  We could see the light going through the trees!  It came out, circled, disappeared behind us, and went into the trees a dozen times or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last experience occurred when the light had again disappeared below the horizon/rise behind us.  We were looking for it to reappear when it flashed at our back window.  The object/light seemed to take up only half or less of the back window.  (1960 Corvair, 4 Dr)  It was there for only a second.  The light did not hurt my eyes.  There was never any sound associated with the event.

7/1/64 20:00|Omaha|NE|Disk|10 minutes|At dusk, we saw a saucer-shaped object that hovered silently for 5 minutes, then darted out of sight|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42180.html|16|ndxe196407| At dusk, we saw a saucer-shaped object that hovered silently for 5 minutes, then darted out of sight<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO&#39;s were in the news.  I was about 8.  My dad (a policeman) was driving us (Mom, my 12 year old brother, me, and a family friend) home from Merritt beach.  We stopped the car to drop off our friend on 42nd and I street, across from the old Shortstop Cafe.  It was dusk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I looked up and saw a saucer-shaped object with a dome on top, about 100 feet in diameter, lights around the edges. It was probably 200 feet above the maple tree in our friend&#39;s yard.  My brother told my dad, who proceeded to yell to everyone in the neighborhood.  This was in the early 60&#39;s before air conditioning was prevalent, so many people had the solid exterior doors open and heard him through their screen doors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of the neighborhood reacted to my dad&#39;s yelling about seeing a flying saucer by coming out and seeing for themselves.  It made no sound.  All we heard was the rustling of the leaves in the tree, and the oh-my-god&#39;s of the people.  It hovered quietly for seemed like an eternity - probably 5 minutes or so.  It then dashed southeast probably a half-mile or so within a couple of seconds max, then zig-zagged out of view.  Dad had a camera in the glove compartment of the car, but chose not to take pictures of the UFO, in fears that the police force would not look favorably on it (I guess there had been reports that had been refuted and reputations consequently questioned).<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one can convince me that I did not see a UFO that evening.  It was not an airplane,  helicopter or weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/1/64 12:00|Laurel Springs|NJ|Other|5 minutes ?|Large glowing rock, covered the sky, very low, just above the trees, appeared/dissappeared silently, darkened the sky.|9/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31901.html|17|ndxe196407| Large glowing rock, covered the sky, very low, just above the trees, appeared/dissappeared silently, darkened the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> while playing in the yard, out of no where the sky was gone and when we looked up there was a glowing rock just hanging in the sky, very low, it covered the whole sky, we each ran for cover in different areas of the yard.  I remember everything got still and quiet, no sound anywhere, then it was gone, when we started playing together that day it was around lunch time after this sighting it was almost 6pm. I remember running all the way home (1/2 mile) and wondering why dinner was on the table.Although no one in my family had seen it, my dad tried to call the police to see what it was i had seen, they said it was probably a meteor. I know meteors do not hang in the air and cover the whole sky making it dark except for the glow of the rock itself. Myself and two friends later (years) agreed on what we saw, and also say that they have never discussed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to have the other two witnesses submit a report, as well, if possible.  PD))<n>
