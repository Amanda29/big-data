3/29/64 21:00|Cherry Valley|CA|Circle|20 min.|Little girl wakes up to lights and sees UFO.|7/4/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82078.html|2|ndxe196403| Little girl wakes up to lights and sees UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in Cherry Valley, California, when my family lived on a farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 3 or 4 years old and sleeping in my bedroom, by myself, when I woke up, I saw bright lights through the north-facing window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up from the bed and I walked over to the window.  I then saw a round spaceship with multi-color lights.  The lights were flashing and rotating.  The colors were blue, yellow, red and green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched in awe as the lights continued to flash and move and the spaceship rotated.  It was floating above the ground.  I can’t recall hearing any sounds.  I also saw a figure in white—they appeared to be wearing a type of space suit.  The figure came down from the craft on a platform and walked around near the craft.  The suit which the person wore seemed like a bee keeper’s outfit, with a sort of flat mask.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while, I crawled back into bed but I remember having a hard time trying to get back to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t mention this to anyone until just recently (2011).  I haven’t been back to that area, but I have had one other UFO experience which happened in northern CA, but I that’ll be reported for another location and year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

3/1/64 20:00|Bristow|OK||1 min|Childhood vision of a gray.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84874.html|3|ndxe196403| Childhood vision of a gray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For what it’s worth this is one of my first real vivid memories.  I was approximately 3 ½ years old.  The year was 1964 and lived in an unusual shaped (barn style) two story house on the edge of town but still populated area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents were upstairs in bedroom, I was downstairs and glanced towards a window on the side of the house and observed the head and shoulders of a gray looking in.  Didn’t know what a gray was supposed to look like until much later.  Not saying abduction at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Vividly recall staring from about five or six feet away at the creature and a powerful almost telepathic memory of me over and over silently projecting, &#34;What are you?”&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don’t recall any received reply or acknowledgment, just a large almond, dark eyed stare from a short, small, thin necked creature. My minds memory recalls depth to the image, unlike cardboard cutout or a mask.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute or a little less, I fled up the stairs and tried to tell my parents I had seen &#34;something&#34; outside the window.  I received the &#34;it’s alright&#34; talk and hugs and have had that memory all my life.<n>
