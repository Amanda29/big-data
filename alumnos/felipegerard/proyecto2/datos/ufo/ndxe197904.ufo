4/15/79 22:50|North Brunswick (over)|NJ|Circle|1 hour|HUGE circular object which hovered over the North Brunswick, NJ intersection of Route 1 and Route 130 in the late 1970's or early 1980|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17367.html|2|ndxe197904| ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Minor spelling changes, made at request of witness.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> HUGE circular object which hovered over the North Brunswick, NJ intersection of Route 1 and Route 130 in the late 1970&#39;s or early 1980<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving  home from Woodbridge New Jersey going south on Route 1.  From a distance away I could see something up ahead that I had never seen before.  I traveled that road every day. That particular day I stayed later for a meeting.  As I came upon the circle which connects Route 1 and Route 130 in North Bruswick, there was a HUGH circular craft hovering over the circle. It was HUGH, the size of a city block.  It made no sound, just hovered.  It had colorful lights on the bottom.  I pulled alongside the highway near what use to be the NJ Boys Scouts Headquarter and just sat and gawked at it.  Many people had parked along the highway to observe.  I left before it did.  I wanted to rush home to bring back a family member to see it but no one believed me when I told them about it.  I never went back.  Since that date I make it a point of watching the Discovery channel or History channel or whatever show has to do with UFO&#39;s in the hope that I&#39;ll see a story about that incident but I never have. It is now 2001 and I still think about that event.  It was a beautiful sight which did not frighten me.  I would like to read reports in this database from other people that saw what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM #1))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cleary, I was having an  off day.  In my report, please correct HUGH to HUGE and in the description of the craft, you might want to replace the CIRCLE description with the word DISK.  I thought more about it last night and the word DISK better describes  the craft.  Thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM #2))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((QUERY BY NUFORC REGARDING DATE OF SIGHTING))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Ms. ((name deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for the wonderful report.  I suspect the incident may have gained some publicity in local papers, but that is only a guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a celebrated case in which a strange craft allegedly fired a &#34;beam of light&#34; and shattered a window in a building in Bergen County (??), NJ, but I do not remember the date.  It allegedly occurred in a building that was located somewhere near where Meadow Lands Sports Stadium currently sits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, if you can ever &#34;reconstruct&#34; the date of your sighting, please let us know.  We know from experience that people often can come within a week or month, if they sit and think about what they were doing at the time, why they were driving, what car they had or what clothing they were wearing, etc..  In addition, fuel receipts, cancelled checks, credit card entries, etc., are all very helpful in this respect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for taking the time to share the sighting with our Center!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the sake of argument, use tHe 4/79 date.  I would like to see my report entered into the database just because it  may spark the interest of one of the other people that  was also parked along the highway.  That person may end up having a more accurate fix on the exact date.  Believe me I have tried to reconstruct that day in my mind for what seems like an eternity.  I know the date is a vital link.  Normally, I have a good memory but for some reason that exact date escapes me.  I presume you have already read the report I submitted.  Isn&#39;t that why you just contacted me?     I know this is really going to top off the cake but the closest picture I have ever come across which resembles what I saw is one fleeting moment of a spaceship in the movie &#34;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&#34;  Not the aircraft where they communicate back and forth with sounds but earlier in the picture. If I could get a picture of the craft used in that movie, I could pinpoint exactly what I saw looked like.  The one in the movie didn&#39;t stay on the screen for long but when I saw it, I almost jumped out of my skin.  Even to this day, it is the only picture I&#39;ve ever seen that most closely remsembles what I saw.  ((name deleted))<n>
4/15/79 21:00|Lexington|NC|Triangle|5 t0 8 minutes|Night siting of a black trangle|4/27/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28538.html|3|ndxe197904| Night siting of a black trangle<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date I have given for the actual siting is approximate simply because it was so long ago, but the time is accurate. It was early sping and I remember this because the trees were just starting to bud and the nights were finally begining to warm up. My cousin and I were doing what we usually did at 15 on a weekend night by riding our bikes to the next street off of Main street to sit by the railroad tracks to watch the frieght trains go by. It was a cloudless night with no wind. We were sitting on a concrete foundation connected to a warehouse just off the road about 60 or 70 feet from the railroad crossing watching cars slowly go across the double rail lines. We were hoping for a slow moving train to come by so we could throw rocks at the rail cars and see the sparks fly. That happened a time or two and we found ourselves sitting there as it got later looking at the sky. We were talking and I noticed in the sothwest a blinking out of stars as I gazed at the sky. I didn&#39;t think anything about it at first because I was looking at the sky through a tree in the distance. I just thought the limbs of the tree might be moving because of a slight breeze that I could not feel from where I was sitting. A few more minutes passed as I watched the &#34;blinking out&#34; continue above the tree. Then I realized something was strange and I asked my cousin if he could see it. I had to point in the direction and he saw what I was talking about. We just watched as it approached about 30 degrees above the horizon and that was when we realized it was a moving solid object. It had no lights at all and actually was darker than the moonless sky. I remember saying to my cousin at that point, &#34;what is that&#34;? He said &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;. It was almost overhead by now and was being underlit to some extent by the lights on Main street. It was a perfect triangle and looked to be fairly low in altitude. Maybe 600 to 800 hundred feet and about about 3 inches between the forefinger and thumb at arms lenght.  I ran out to the rai! lroad tracks to get a look at it as it passed over the two story warehouse and I lost it in the city lights. At that point I don&#39;t remember us saying a word but we both jumped on our bikes and sped to my parent&#39;s house about a 1/4 mile away where my cousin spent the night. There was no noise and the speed of the object was constant, very slow and linear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I heard this tremendous roaring noise outside, went to the window to see what it was. Outside in the open field I saw this very large rectangular shaped object. It was almost as big as a football field. The noise sounded like a lot of generators and it was loud. There were lights all around the outside. At least on the side I saw. It hovered for a few moments and then the front end lifted up and it was gone. I was only about 100 feet from it. My husband was in the bathroom at the time. I called to him to come and see. By the time we got outside it was gone. It was broad daylight so I know what I saw. I have never told anyone else beside my husband but I did draw a picture for him. I did not have time to take a picture. Sorry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

My husband had the alarm for that time to get ready for work, no telling how long it was out there.  We saw how bright the moon was, we layed there for a couple of minutes all of a sudden it moved in a certain pattern, we watched for about fifteen minutes, he said he had to go to work, so I watched, then, three objects came out of the left top and flew down , then the big moon object moved the same pattern as the first time and it left like a blink of eye. It stayed up there a long time in between all this. there is a lot more to this, so much happened at the time and after I strongly feel like more happened, I can&#39;t believe that no one has reported this as I have checked alot of stories in that time and nowhere is this mentioned I can&#39;t for the world think we were the only ones that seen this event!  This has bothered me for a long time, I am 59 now and I feel some one out there knows something  a black helicopter was our residence and I knew they knew and it worried us then. If you know anything PLEASE let me know, it will bring me some kind of relief. Thank you for your time and excuse my typing my grand daughter is teaching me how to use this computor. I heard Peter Davenport on coast ot coast and figured it was my last chance to talk to someone about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It shone a little brighter than the other stars, which is what caught my attention.  After staring a little longer I noticed that it had no flashing lights… odd. I was trying to identify it as a plane because I’d just seen one in the opposite direction and it appeared bright enough, possibly too bright though.  Also, it appeared to be travelling a little slower than a normal plane would, couldn&#39;t hear anything either. It was travelling very slowly east.  But what really caught my attention, after a good 2-3 minutes watching it, was the fact that it just shot upwards!  Directly up into the sky, in a flash!   Couldn’t see it anywhere after that, never reappeared. I’ve haven’t seen anything move in the sky like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The Craft appeared to be moving very slow and had just cleared the top of the Water Tower. Weather conditions were overcast with heavy low lying cloud cover, the craft was V shaped (Chevron shaped and large) with no fuselage, there where no engines on the craft wings, and there was no sound that I could hear (bear in mind I was driving and was in my car at the time), with glare from the traffic and lights on Pawtucket avenue and the low lying cloud cover the craft was very easy to see and particulary the bottom of the craft very clear to observe, there was no landing gear on the bottom of the craft, actually the bottom of the craft was very smooth, very smooth indeed.  The bottom of the craft appeared to be a mixture of light/dull amber coloured almost blending/reflecting white light from the street lights and traffic.  No vehicles stopped on the road at that juncture.  Quite surprised that no vehicles stopped. I Continued to travel down the road (Dover Ave) in a Southerly direction, the speed that I was travelling in my vehicle was close to 40MPH (my apologies for breaking the posted 25MPH speed), at any rate the craft continued heading south in the direction of Riverside, had serval stop signs that I had to stop at, unfortunently by the time I reached the Wampanoaug Trail road the craft continued south and had to halt my vehicle at yet another stop sign and by the time traffic cleared so that I enter into traffic, had lost sight of the craft and didn&#39;t spot it afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As I walked along the center of town I was nearing the railway station on my left and the railway hotel on my right. the hotel had a large tower to it . It was a beautifull morning only a few wispy clouds high up. I happened to gaze at the top of the tower and was suprised to to a small ultra white perfect triangle shape in the blue sky. i thought at first it was a cloud but then relised that the edges were too perfect and straight to be a cloud. if i were to have lifted a 10 pence piece up at arms length I would say the objects three outer points would have extended beyound the coins  covering . Then suddenly from the triangle appeared three disk of the same colour each snakeing out from the central object in different directions and then stopping short. the three then swirled about one seaming to hover over the local army ordanance stores behind the railway station and then returning to the main triangle . as it aproached the main object the other two swooped towards it and merged with it and then all disk vanished. The triangle was now moving and heading off at an even pace towards Grangemouth . Grangemouth has the largest ICI plant in the country. I followed it as far as I could and then i enterd the factory and told a few mates but by the time we got back out to view it it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen another sighting since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

I was standing aft lookout when I noticed a round set of lights behind the ship just under the water. The lights were red, green and white split equally at 120 degrees each with a total width of around 6 feet. We were towing a device at the time designed to detect nuclear submarines at long distances.(This device never heard whatever this was).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light moved from just behind us at around 20 yards to the right then the left and then back as if to be surveying the towed cable that was running behind us. At the time my initial response was that I was not believing what I was seeing. After watching this for about 20 minutes I reported it to the bridge. No sooner had I reported it than it disappeared(almost as if it were listening to me). The report to the bridge brought down the Captain, the chief engineer and the operations officer but the light was long gone by the time they got their and they most likely wrote it off as another young sailor smoking dope on the fantail and seeing things. I never said anything about it after that night but it was definetly unidentified. It is interesting to note that this was in the Bermuda Triangle where so many other strange encounters have occured .<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I was a young seaman age 19. I was a fully qualifed lookout with 6 months experience at sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is very possible that even more data is available from the official ships log. I can give all the relevant info if someone wants to call and followup on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quite an erie event in my life especially for one who has always believed there were others out there somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Girls were in panic and starded to scream. as we were not that far from our beach house the other people started to come out. The thing was hughe big and bright. And it decended and i got a marvelous encounter. Then it moved toward the house and suddenly changed position and whent fast up an diagonal towards a hill and disapeard. Incredible!!!

I saw it for only about 1 minute. (i later rememberd) i was taken up to the ship via some sort of transport device. the inhabitants were human looking. I was givin a non invasive medical exam. i remember laughing. i was then lead to a huge room where many children were. i was hooked up to a machine that lookied kinda like a large virtual reality machine. it came on and there were pictures, diagrams, equations, and many other things flashing at a high rate of speed. i have been able to recover some important info. like how the two and only two types of space vehicles work. there is alot more info. it only becomes available when something trigers it. i believe there is a process of education occuring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of alleged incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

The road was not lit in that area, and my friend had an old car,and was driving carefully,concentrating on the road. I saw some lights to my right, and looked out the window. At that time I didn&#39;t &#34;believe&#34; in UFO&#39;s. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing. It was something so enormous, as large as a very long city block, or maybe larger. Much longer than high. It had lights around the edge, red and yellow. I remember tilting my head sideways and trying to tell myself &#34;it&#39;s a radio tower that fell down&#34;, but it wasn&#39;t. While all this is going on in my head, my thoughts raced to form the right type question to ask my friend. I didn&#39;t want to tell him what I thought I saw, I wanted to hear him say what HE saw. So I said &#34;Frank, do you see anything over there?&#34; He looked out the window and said &#34;Holy shit, it&#39;s a flying saucer, we&#39;re getting the hell out of here!&#34; And that old Plymouth Valiant was floored and still, it took time to pass this object. It was on Rt 23 near a tall water managment or processing building of some type. It was hovering over the ground,just where there was a depression in the ground.It was so weird to see something this big and strange off the ground without a noise. Of course in 1979, people didn&#39;t talk about this stuff too much. I didn&#39;t know about missing time then, and don&#39;t think there was any missing time in retrospect, but I can&#39;t be sure. I know that this is an old sighting, but I think it was special because we were so close to the object, it was not far from the edge of the road.<n>

I remember being scared out of my mind and driving like a maniac to reach my home about 5 miles away.  Being only 16 at the time and unaware of the silent helicopters that have red lights that the military had, of course I thought it was an alien spaceship.  I was to scared and drivng about 100 miles an hour to ever look up.  Maybe the military personal were spying inside my car thinking what a hot chick...lol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is sorta funny now but now knowing some of the military craft info now...it explains the event to a certain degree.  The lights did leave my car and I never knew where they went, as of course I didn&#39;t look to see in fear I was going to have a wreck, just as the dudes operating the craft probally thought themselves and laid off of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t a month later that I was on a date and we both saw 3 triangle shapes with white glowing lights just sitting still in the sky in a circle pattern about 2 miles from where the red light stuff happened, same road acually.  I know that were at at stand still because I compared them to the stars in the sky to see which way they were moving.  I wanted to follow them. but they were not going anywhere.  We just drove off on our way to eat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven&#39;t seen anything else in my life, not that I have been looking for it!  I have found myself here and there stare into the sky looking for something strange, but not enough I guess.   I couldn&#39;t of been the only person to experience this crap.  Now with the Stealth fighter unveiled, that expains that sighting also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went years thinking that I had experienced a true UFO sighting(s), I am relieved now that I know facts that explain them away.  Unless a creature actually comes up to me, I will not be scared of these sightings anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being in a military state we all must understand that certain crafts have to exist and be tested in secret.  I am not saying that aliens do not exist, but to go along with most scientists, to reach Earth would be a far reach!  I do understand people&#39;s fears about the unknown, I suffered myself, for years!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea why these crafts were in our area of NC...about 3 hours from the coast, but guessing it was just for a test run....huh?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

4/1/79 21:00|Berkeley|CA|Rectangle|30 minutes|Rectangler in shape, lights all the way around it, no noise, darted up and down, left to right stopping very fast, maze like decoration|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17949.html|17|ndxe197904| Rectangler in shape, lights all the way around it, no noise, darted up and down, left to right stopping very fast, maze like decoration<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted this object (bright light) from looking out of a two story house window, just star gazing. I realized it was flying over downtown Berkley, by the college. What aroused my curiosity was that it would dart up and down, right to left very fast and just suddenly stop. I got a friend of mine to take a look and he also thought this was very strange. We drove to downtown towards the college, didn&#39;t see anything. Took a right turn on a side street and I spotted it flying over buildings (I was not driving) like it was trying to race with us for about 40 seconds. All of a sudden it was gone, so I told my friend to pull over and park. We walked to the next street over which is Telegraph. Their were a few people standing at a bus stop. My friend asked them if they saw the object. They gave us a look like we were crazy. We jogged down the street and back, didn&#39;t see anything and decided to give up. On our way back to the car between Telegraph and the street we parked on, I was on one side of the srteet and my friend on the other side. I looked up and hovering over me and the building I was walking by (I could only see half of the object) was the object. It was rectangler, had lights all around it, but only the corner ones were on. It was dark gray in color, there was a maze like decoration that covered all of the bottom of it. Absolutely no noise at all. I had my 8 month old son with me and got very afraid and ran to the car, it followed to the main street. That was last I saw of it. When we got back to the house we called the Police only to be laughed at. We called news stations only to be laughed at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
4/1/79 17:00|Salinas|CA|Disk|1 minute|Disc shaped saucer craft seen about 100 feet away|9/24/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31630.html|18|ndxe197904| Disc shaped saucer craft seen about 100 feet away<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot recall the exact month or day but the year was 1979.  I have never made public this information, this is the first time.  I was only 6 years old when I saw this object.  It must have been a weekend at about 5:30 p.m. and I had with two of my older brothers from some activities.  I headed up the third story floor of where we we&#39;re staying at the Travelers Motel in Salinas, CA.  I headed out the balcony just to catch some air and I happened to look up.  As I looked up, about no more than 100 feet from me I saw a hovering disc craft that must of been about 30 feet in diameter.  It had some lights at the bottom.  Here is the interesting part: it said something about &#34;FORD&#34; the car dealership sort of like a blimp;  I had just passed by the FORD Dealership about 30 minutes and they were having a sale.  Anyways it was producing a humming sound sort of like a refrigerator.  This object was heading due west and it was traveling at about 20 miles an hour.  The saucer was metallic greyish and i got to observe it for about 1 minute till it dissapeared out in the distance but never the less had maintained its constant speed and direction of travel.  I have not investigated this matter any further but I thinking that I will be checkin the local library regarding any newspaper excepts on microfilm for any reports during that particular year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
