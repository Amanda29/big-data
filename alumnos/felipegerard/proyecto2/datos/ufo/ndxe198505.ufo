5/30/85 00:00|Middletown|NY|Rectangle|approx 2-3 minutes|Rectangular object, 3 contiguous sections; the outer 2 sections a dark green, the inner a brighter lighter green.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27907.html|1|ndxe198505| Rectangular object, 3 contiguous sections; the outer 2 sections a dark green, the inner a brighter lighter green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was around midnight. My boyfriend and I snuck onto the college green at OCCC. No one else was in view. The sky was completely clear; no cloud cover, moderate light pollution. We were watching satellites move across the sky and looking for shooting stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He asked me &#34;What is that?&#34; and pointed up, in an westerly direction I believe. I saw in the sky a small rectangular shape. I&#39;m not sure of the exact size, as it appeared to be pretty high in the sky; If I extended my arm fully, I could easily cover my view of it with my thumb. It was approximately a 4 to 1 length to width ratio in size. It appeared to be in 3 even, connected sections: the outer 2 sections were a darkish green, the center section was a brighter, lighter green. It moved slowly across the sky; it took about 2-3 minutes to move about the length of my hand if my arm were extended, before disappearing. It did not change direction, and moved across the sky with one of the long edges leading as opposed to a narrow end. There was no sound accompanying the movement that I or my boyfriend could discern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has always been a very strong memory for me, as I had (and have) never seen anything resembling it, both in terms of real aircraft, as well as fictional UFOs from stories and movies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It moved at a steady pase,maybe 70mph.I thought that this was strange but went back to the pavillion.It was getting late and my sisters and I were going home from the church cookout.We did not have anything to drink.I got in the back and my sisters in front.As we talked I leaned over the front so I could here themwhen I noticed an object in the sky moving to the ground.It was spherical in shape and had a silver color,very smooth.It looked like it was going to land,I pointed to it and my sisters then noticed.As we got closer,about 100yards it slowly moved up in the sky and stopped.It was then about 80 feet in the sky and hovering.My sisters at this time are screaming.I told Diane to stop the car and that I was getting out when they grabbed my and said no way.At this point we are stopped and it is still hovering above us to the right.To get a better look without getting out I leaned back in the seat and looked straight up through the back glass.I got a real good look as the object was moving over us very slowly.It was real close,could have hit it with a rock.It had white,red,blue and a mix of colors underneath,and the lights were firing after each other in a certain pattern.It had designs underneath and I noticed then it was not round but had some slight corners.The object moved over the car and started to go higher,NO SOUND.The craft made no sound at all,it was 80feet above us and climbing and their was no sound! at all, other than screams from my sisters.It slowly made its way up towards a ridge and climbed over it and out of sight.This thing was in no hurry,and it seemed as if it didn&#39;t want to leave the area we first saw it.Anyway thats it,thanks for listening.Backgrounds of witnesses:Both of my sisters are nurses and I am a store manager now.Lets put it this way I haven&#39;t brought this subject up in 15 years to them.We just don&#39;t talk about it.I have been wanting to get this off my chest for some time now.Thank you.<n>

It was as big as the building, and in the front of the building where I was standing, it hung out over the roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was three sets of lights, one white, two blue, all of which were constantly in motion revolving around the thickest part of the UFO.  There was no sound, nor air disturbance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all saw it and watched it for about 2 minutes.  Nothing happed, it just hovered there.  Then you could feel an energy in the air, but nothing more, and the craft shot straight up and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, there was no sound or displaced wind, nothing, it was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was traveling due West on 54 South Street and 80th West.  I was traveling due East. It was about 60 feet above ground, not twice as high as the power poles.  It was traveling about 300mph. I saw it for about 8 to 10 seconds, in which time it traveled about 2 miles.  It passed parallel to me traveling in the opposite direction, about 75 feet North of me, to my left.  I was East bound at about 50mph. At the closest point, we were about 100 feet away. It was traveling at a fixed altitude.  As it past me and crossed 84th West Street the ground raises up into the Ochure Mountains, it moved up and down as the ground rose and fell towards the foot hills.  I could see it coming for about a half mile, as it approached, I lost sight of it for about one second as it dropped below the horizon as the road in front of me (about 1/4 mile away) dropped off the hill side.  It came back up into sight as the road leveled out in front of me and then past us. I turned my head and watched it &#34;contouring&#34; with the land elevation change until it was too far away to see, about a mile or so.  Oddly, my wife (we were driving to work and were almost there, we worked at the Hercules rocket motor plant and Hercules Graphite fiber plant in Magna) didn&#39;t say a single word.  After about 5 seconds I asked her &#34;did you just see something you&#39;d have a hard time explaining to someone?&#34;  She said &#34;you mean the big mirrored glass ball that just flew past us?&#34;.   I said &#34;good, then I&#39;m not crazy!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other cars on the road, no one around, it&#39;s now built up around there, in those days it was an industrial plant out in the dry farms.  It was just a few minutes before sunrise.  I&#39;ve seen ball lightening ..and this was not ball lightening.

It had very bright lights emanating from it all around the sides and at least one shining down from the bottom of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked over to my dog and she was looking up at it and was mesmerized, but not barking, which she would normally do at loud big things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back up at the object, which was about 40 to 50 feet above us, and it suddenly moved sideways for about 200 feet, then went up into space at an incredible speed that within 30 seconds, it was up so high it looked like a star.  I had never seen anything move that fast ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father was an air force pilot, so I am familiar with planes and jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For days afterward, my dog just lay around listless, and I felt strange as well, extreme fatigue yet a blissful mental state.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

But down in the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had a close encounter of the first kind was at age 15 on July 1, 1985. My family and I were at Wiseman&#39;s view near Brown Mountain Lights. All of my family members eccept my dad and I were at the view site. My dad and I went to the parking lot to get a few things and suddening a brilliantly bright light came in sight along with train whistle sounds. The light was white or sort of yellowish like the moon. The light reach from the top of the trees to the bottom at the ground. The one light came in from the right at the edge of the trees and went through the woods to the edge of the woods on the left side of the parking lot. After the light disappeared my dad and I ran back to the over look and started asking questions. There were scientists there along with others besides my family. We asked everyone if they had heard any train whistles or seen any unusual lights that were very large, no one had heard or seen anything. One of the scientists did tell us that the closest train there was had to be 40-50 miles away. In the woods when we walked down as we first got to wiseman&#39;s view had no evidence of any train tracks any where. We did see other lights at a distance that night but, not like this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of four, seemingly serious-minded, reports from same witness.

I just want to get it off my chest and find out if such a phenomenom is possible.  I was sitting on a bench with a friend of mind in his mother&#39;s backyard.  It was night time and we were talking about jobs.  I looked up into the night sky which was clear but had a few clouds.  Within a matter of seconds, a solid ball of light come out of no where, from right to left, as if from an invisible door.  It stopped and just hovered for about 5 seconds then it returned back from left to right into that invisible door persay.  I think about it every other chance I get.  Especially when I see perculiar documentaries on tv.  I do not need to have correct gramma because I know what I saw and I do believe whenever I see facts that such a thing is possible, I will feel at ease.  Thank you for listening.

I was getting ready to go to a cub scout meeting. As soon as I stepped out my back door, I noticed a bright sphere-shaped object hovering (not even really hovering, it was just perfectly still) maybe 500 feet or less over the corn field near my house. The sphere was about 1500 - 2000 feet in total away from me (in a straight line.) I was totally shocked. I had never seen anything like it. Even at 10 years old I knew it was not an airplane or a helicopter. It made no noise whatsoever. I was overcome with the feeling that the object was &#34;staring&#34; straight at me. I can&#39;t explain this, it&#39;s just something I knew was happening. I also had the sense that I couldn&#39;t look away. It was a very, very peaceful feeling, I felt very happy, more so than the moments before I stepped out the door. It was as though the object was telling me &#34;it&#39;s ok, don&#39;t worry&#34;. Very strange but that is the overwhelming feeling I had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere wasn&#39;t very big. Maybe about 50 - 75 feet across. It was emitting light, but the light didn&#39;t really light up the night. There were no beams of light coming off it, but still it was as though it was shining a flashlight straight at my eyes. The light was white, all white. This lasted maybe 20 seconds and as I said was a very joyful feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly, the light shot off across the sky at an extremely high rate of speed. It didn&#39;t have to speed up. It reached the full speed I saw it traveling at instantly. It travelled east toward Grand Island and in the distance it arched upward slightly and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll never forget this as long as I live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

The living room faced the balcony that overlooked the tennis courts. All of the sudden the balcony and part of the living room floor turned bright orange. I thought that was strange, as I opened the balcony door I heard people yelling (I could not remember what they were saying). Everyone was looking at the sky. As I looked up all I can see was that the sky was being covered by something light orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked at it I really did not understand what it was. I looked at the people on the tennis courts and some of them were running inside the building while a few stayed there point up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember looking up and down several times. It covered the whole horizon. I could not see where it ended. It must have been a few 100 ft above me. About 20 seconds into the experience, it started to move straight up at a great speed with no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say another 10 seconds later I noticed the outline of what seemed to be a circle with an outer ring and a glowing orange/red center. It moved straight up at a great speed. My eyes started to water because I could not stay focus on the object. Soon afterwards I noticed two more similiar objects one on each side for a total of three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was moving up it started to move toward the direction of the east, toward the ocean. It finally disapeard, and when I realized what I just saw I looked around me and my friend the owner of the apartment was standing next to me rubbing her eyes with tears. Why eyes were also watered, with a little discomfort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The people below on the tennis courts yelled at us asking if we saw it. We told them we did. We asked them were did it come from, and they said it just rolled over the building and everything turned orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have told this experience to all my friends throuht out the years. No one believes me, but I know what I saw was real. I don&#39;t see my friend any more, but many years later we met by accident, and the first thing she asked me if I remember that day when we saw the orange glow. I told her yes, it is something that I have never forgoten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Cessna sized....the plane was all white with with a a very large propeller in the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane made almost no sound, and was incredibly low to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the left hand side from underneath a pod with a long antenna came from behind.  It was mounted under the wind.  Clynder probably about 8-10 feet long with a 3-4 foot antenna out the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound fo the twapping sound which was faint would be about once every 7/10ths of second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The angle of the hill had the plane going North to South and downhill.  It was almost gliding.  There were no markings on the plane at all.  Zero....nothing on the tail or under wings.  I had a viewing angle from side...then I quickly ran to see it going away  I have basically assumed this was a sample of Military spy craft...as Lockheed has a development above the University.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If flying at night...and or painted black.....this craft could fly overhead of people or areas with very very little notice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure I saw this.....and lean towards earthly device...but would be classified.  It was like a glider with a huge propeller.  The body was more substantial than a glider...more like Cessana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you need more info....I would be fine with calling back after you email.  This was not anything that would fly from a normal airport....unless I missed hearing about a virtually silent plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed the YO-3A, a silent aircraft designed for use in Viet Nam.

Trajectory: Level gradually climbing to vertice. Velocity: Est.mach 2 or greater. Weather: Clear/No clouds. Audio: None. Color: White. Direction: ENW. Trail: None. My mother and I were sitting outsid when we both notices the objest approaching from the east. It traveled to about our mid view then gradually climed as if piloted to vertical continuing streight up into infinty before we lost eye contact. The absence of clous that day allowed us a continuous view of the object. The light did not decelerate upon achievig vertical but seeed to accelrate oncagain as if piloted. I estimate considering the size and velocity of the object that it was between 12 and 14000 feet. With this considered I estimate the object to have been fairly small somewhere around 25ft. in diameter. The episode captivated us for quite some time and I emediately began to put the sighting through close scruitiny. Although I never found an answer of which I was satisfied. I had just seperated from the Air Force having spent five years as an aircraft mechanic. I worked F-4E and F-15E fighter jets and knew how high performance aircraft behaved when in flight. I knew that even during an FCF ( Functional Check Flight ) post maintenance flight a jet with no external tanks or pylons, in afterburner could not perform such absolute verticle accelerated maneuvers. Afterburners are visible as yellow light until over 33 thousand feet. This objects velocity to height ratio proved it to be near the ground in an atitudinal sense so there should have been at least turbulence related sound accompanied by vapor or if hot,residual particulate smoke. It was most clearly defined as a mirror reflection being shot against the sky. I had explored the possibilities of it having been a meteor with just the right entry angle to deflect it back out into space. This didn&#39;t hold water due to the physical anomolies associated with the sightng. If it were a meteor there would have been sound and vapor if not a sonic boom. Although gradual the upwrd arc to verticle was, in the grand scale of the atmosphere, quite short and erratic. At this velocity an aircraft would have surely have been destroyed due to overgee. Clearly this wa! s a uniq ue sighting that challenges the physical world as we know it. Since then I have had a newfound respect for those who believe. I look up much more often.<n>
