As I stepped out the front door, I heard a sound like an unmuffled outboard engine to my left (South).I saw nothing, so I stepped down to the sidewalk for a better view. There were no vehicles on the street. The sound was coming toward me rapidly, and then I realized it was above the surface. I was under large trees, so I went to the middle of the street where I could see straight up. A disc of dull metallic color came into view. It was travelling right up the street at approximately 100 MPH. There was a 1000 foot overcast and it was about 200 feet below that. I estimated it to be 40 feet in diameter. I could see no propellor, control surfaces or landing gear. As it was passing overhead, the noise got so loud that I put my hands over my ears, but it did not help at all! I can now compare the noise to an unending stream of fifty-caliber rounds passing close by. At the time, I was fourteen years old and had just started flying lessons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have met the individual who submitted this report, and we deem him to be an exceptionally credible witness.  He is a former fighter (F-86) and bomber (B-25) pilot, and a former military officer, who has been assigned to the Pentagon.  Our impression is that it would be extremely difficult to find a more reliable, credible, and convincing witness.  This is one of several sightings the same individual has had, and those reports will appear in our database, as well, at a later date.  PD))<n>
