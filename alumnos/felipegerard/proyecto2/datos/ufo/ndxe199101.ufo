Sounds funny but not. I was immediately terrified and hid under my covers all the time seeing it happen and sweating profusely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dogs were Rotweiller in nature, stood on hind feet only, carried lazer rifles with back packs and ran in, pointed the gun nozzles at my face...quiet....then they retreated back out of my front door to my suite. When i knew i could uncover myself, i did so and was paralized with fear for quite sometime and as you can see....it was and is very serious business to me still today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report describes self as having a responsible position in business.  PD))<n>

When we got back to base we never said anyting for very goog reason we did not want to be grounded and have to be debreifed for hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did check with fight ops and they said there no fixed wing aircraft at all with in 10 miles from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So there you have it have fun<n>

It was around 10:00 p.m.  on a cold January night and I decided I would have one last cigarette before I went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside.  My apartment is the first unit off the street.  While smoking, I looked up into the night sky.  The clouds parted and I saw two objects in the sky.  The  first was  a huge object with lots of widows with green lights coming out of the windows.  The lights were blinking on and off as if it was a code.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object was the same shape as the first, only smaller.  It also had blinking green lights.  To me it looked like they were communicating to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt happy and excited that I was witnessing this event.  I did not think I was seen or that these objects knew anyone was watching.  I did not speak of this event to anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently I went to my doctor for sinus problems.  He ordered an x-ray.  X-ray showed a &#34;screw&#34; shaped  item in the top of my head.  I have never had surgery on any kind on my head.  My doctor sent me to see a surgeon.  Surgeon stated he could not remove this item because the procedure would be to painful and he would not do it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason, I started thinking about the UFOs I saw all those years ago.  I have had some flashes of memory.  I remember being very close to the ship and feeling very frightened.  I believe I was abducted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident in January 1991 is approximate.  PD))<n>

Hovering , moving fast and seemingly just flying around ...read on<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of my oldest friends and I were headed up a what was at that time a country road with a cow farm and corn fields.  There was a bright light in the sky straight in front of us but at least a mile and a half away.  As we approached it was apperent that the object was hovering over the treeline on the side of the road.  We stopped and I stuck my head out the window and heard a low pulsating humm and saw an array of lights that was in the pattern of a small green center x and four white lights going away from the points of the x and four red circular lights at the end of those.  It hovered for maybe five seconds and gradually increased speed and proceeded west.  We chased it about ten miles and noticed lots of activity in the air. We intersected the path of another craft. This one had no lights but it was noisy with traffic so I couldn&#39;t hear if it had the same humm.  We immediately wanted to go pick up another friend of ours(to bad he didn&#39;t have a video camera) to prove to ourselves we are seeing what were seeing.  After picking him up we went to the golf course because it&#39;s dark and quiet.  We observed at the hight at least twenty craft all at about seemingly the same altitude and heard not one airplane engine. It lasted from 10pm to 330am.  This night was one of those unusually dark nights , no moon , no clouds just dark and cold.  We were living within fifteen or so miles from fort dix/maguire air force base so we have heard military aircraft.  The other interesting thing is the first encounter was within two miles of an aegis radar station among the cow farm and corn stalks. Right on the corner it looked like the top of a battleship so if you are from the area you would know where i&#39;m talking about.  The other odd thing was it was the day of the deadline for the first gulf war and we had heard all the military had to offer leaving from the base. I actually called the police when I got home and asked if anyone had reported seeing lights in the sky and he kind of snickered and said n! o.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

It was a bright white in color with colored lights underneath. The spot where it was hovering was over an old railroad bridge.There is no access for vehicles other than a dirt bike. I could make out windows on the object also. It never moved except the colored lights underneath it flashed. There were two adults in the car at the time. The driver refused to stop or look at the object.I think for fear. Both adults in the car were normal middle class workers. The driver had an expierance in the desert in Navada in 1982. That same evening many people witnessed the same object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Resolution Northwest Territories.  My snowmachine experienced mechanical difficulties which resulted in us being forced to walk approx 12 miles back to a highway where we had left our vehicle and snowmobile trailer.  The weather at the time was quite mild for January minus 10 and there was light snow falling.  My snowmachine had broke down at approx 11:00 a.m.  We walked for several hours until about 5: p.m. at which time we stopped for a lunch break.  We made a small fire to warm up and boil some water for tea.  We were in the center of a small clearing roughly 300 ft in diameter and sitting under a large spruce tree.  We had been there for approx. fifteen minutes when we began to hear a low humming sound approaching from the east.  The sound grew steadily louder and the hum turned to a very low throbbing sound-like a huge engine running at idle.  The whole area was charged with an electric tingling.  We looked up but did not see anything of any substance.  After about one minute the object seemed to be hovering directly above our location.  We still did not see anything. Suddenly there was an intense flash of light like a million flashbulbs going off at once.  There was a pause and then another intense flash of light approx 5 seconds after the first and finally a third flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the noise began to move west in the direction that we whad been travelling.  The low heavy throbbing sound continued and finally faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We packed up our belongings and continued our walk back to the highway.  At no time did we observe anything, just the incredibly deep throbbing sound and the three flashes of light. We arrived back at the highway at 23:00 and returned to Ft. Resolution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a private pilot with several hundred hours of flight time. I also have approx 12,000 hrs of time in various types of helicopters and fixed wing aircraft as a professional firefighter.  I am familiar with all the types of aircraft that are flown in the NWT and have never experienced flight characteristics that this object exhibited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with this witness, and he seems to us to be quite credible.  We have requested a report from the second witness.  PD))<n>

I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it until I realized it had been about a minute and it hadn&#39;t gone away. I could hear my house&#39;s aluminum windows vibrating. I opened a window and there was a flying saucer/UFO. Whatever it was, it was flying low (100 ft AGL)and slow less than 200 ft in front of me. It was shaped like a hat (Zorro&#39;s hat). It had yellow lights on the side, and about 6 or 8 on the bottom making a square shape. An incredible fear overcame me and I had to close my window within a few seconds of seeing it. I woke my father up, I was shaking uncontrolably (in spurts). No one else saw it my neighborhood. My father tried to convince me that what I saw wasn&#39;t real, but that night I could hear other noises (mechanical noises) coming from the forrest behind my house. I became obsesses with UFO&#39;s for many years after that, hoping to have another close encounter, but nothing as convincing as that night. This is a very true story. To this day, when I think about it, I still have no logical explanation for what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 11 or 12 at the time of this encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I saw a black triangle flying really low and making absolutely no noise and had no lights turned on. It was going at a slow speed heading north towards Memphis, TN.

I became stunt for few seconds then i turned about and grab my cousin&#39;s arm who was standing directly infront of me and told him to look at that direction and then i found the thing disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i never got to tell anyone because i thought no one here would believe me. i live in brunei and this place is a small country so maybe there&#39;s lesser chance for me to meet someone who have seen similar things. i was surprise to find this website where i can share with everyone who probably would have the encounter the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even today i never got to tell much people here because im worried they will think im NUTs :0  from my memory, i remember that the object was not the typical saucer look which we always get on TV/indepandent day/internet/discovery channel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was something different. it was very high-tech and unique. it is nothing like what i&#39;ve ever seen in any movies. There were many details on the body of the craft as if it looks like pipes / wiring attached to the body. from the distance where i was standing, i consider the object small. probably measuring about 4 to 5 feet lenght x  4 feet width x 3 to 5 feet thickness. no lights were seen. i can see that object with available lights because i was close enough from that subject as the house had some lightings around the surrounding of the garden to lite up some part of the roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The stangest thing i canot figure out how it can do was; the object was actually floating on top of the roof (probably less then a feet away from the roof), the roof were soft and old and it should have made noise. even rain drops falling onto the roof would make noise but from my distant i hear nothing from the object and the roof (the corner part) was not even rattling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> after that incident i&#39;ve always wish to see it another time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i told some of my friends i wish to see them again. i consider myself very lucky to see it that close because from documentary, discovery channels, books, internet sites, videos...all those who said they have seen are from a very great distant and they can&#39;t really judge how it look like. most of them say its like a saucer. but for me, it can look like anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
