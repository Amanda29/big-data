After driving a short distance we encountered an object moving over the road ahead of us. The object had double lights all the way around it wich faced down toward the road. The lights went around it in a rectangular shape. I remember telling my son that is a U.F.O. looking at the object as we drove the object moved to the left slightly past the road. Suddenly the object disappeared as if it were never there. It was as if someone just suddenly turned off a light switch and it was gone. We did not see the object go anywhere, it was just gone. When we got to the store we had just left wich should have taken approximately a half an hour to go to the blind and drop the feed off and return to the store, we found that the store was already closed. I got on the pay phone immediately and called my mothers house and asked her what time it was, it was 23:30 hours. Therefore it would have taken us two hours to drive approximately 3 miles drop off the deer feed and return to the store. I figure we lost approximately one and one half hours that we cannot account for since it should have only taken approximately one half hour to drop the feed and return to the store.<n>
9/30/96 18:00|Central Butte (Canada)|SK|Circle|2 minutes|Looked like a birthday cake with very bright white flashing lights, stationary in sky above until it quickly moved on.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32513.html|2|ndxe199609| Looked like a birthday cake with very bright white flashing lights, stationary in sky above until it quickly moved on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father&#39;s neighbour and I were out baling hay in the late evening. Sky was black. He had a bigger baler, and could go faster then I could. When he would catch up to me, I would pull out and let him pass, because there wouldn&#39;t of been enough room for the two balers to be side by side, and still be neat in the field. I had pulled out made my circle so I could pull in to the hay row again when he passed.  His tractor and mine had cabs on them.  While I was waiting, I noticed these bright lights in the sky, and I instantly thought it was a very low flying plane in distress. Although it is a no plane area - my father&#39;s ranch is about 70 miles away from any aircraft station.  Right away, looking out the window of the cab I could see that it was not flying, but rather stationary, and these lights were so white bright, and flashing like birthday candles.  I thought that it must be of the reflection of lights of his tractor and baler causing tricks on the glass of my tractor cab.  (Before I forget, this was the year I believe that there were several sightings of unidentified objects in Saskatchewan) I poked my head out of my tractor cab to see what was above me, and believe me this was not a reflection of his lights. It was not exactly right over me, but to the south of the tractor.   There was nothing between me and the object in the sky. My hair stood on end, I wanted to jump off my tractor, to try and get on his to be with somebody.  This is the strange thing about it, it took off to the east and left this string of light, then it stopped, and went south, with this string of light it left, it stopped again, and then went west with again this string of light and disappeared over the valley hills.  This string disappeared shortly after it appeared when it travelled.  Both tractors were running of course, so there was no sound that I heard.  It was a very large object - now this is just a guess - I would say it was a little less then the size of a two ton truck.  It is difficult because the lights were flashing so bright, that it was difficult to see and it was round. His tractor had already past so it wasn&#39;t his lights shining in my eyes.  I have tried to figure out what it could of been and I can&#39;t think of what else it would be. I am a rational person, with a history degree, and am known as very matter of fact, and get to the point person. I seen what I seen.  I have meant to report it for years, but didn&#39;t know where, thought I better while I still remembered it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was watching from my kitchen door.  I remember it being late at night and a total lunar eclipse.  So I used that information to estimate the date of the sighting since I knew it was between 1996 and 1999, a total eclipse, late at night, on a night when we didn&#39;t have to work the next day and I came up with 9/27/96.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I remember watching the eclipse completely cover the moon, when suddenly I saw a chain of small, round, white lights snake around the right side of the moon, like pearls on a string.  Right away I asked my friend, who was in her house a couple miles away, if she saw them too, but she did not.  I only saw them for a few seconds.  I couldn&#39;t tell how far away they were since I was staring at the moon, and I had no other frame of reference.<n>
9/26/96 20:00|Breckenridge|TX|Changing|1-2 seconds|constantly changing nebulous-shaped object flying disturbingly fast at the moment of a full lunar eclipse|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45862.html|7|ndxe199609| constantly changing nebulous-shaped object flying disturbingly fast at the moment of a full lunar eclipse<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been looking for cases similar to this and didn&#39;t have any luck until I found your reporting site due to reading an AP article.  Your site has several listings that are very close to this and it is interesting that no one seems to have a clue what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following description was originally posted on my own website (www.danafrostick.com) about 4 years after the event occurance and was updated as noted on 3/22/2002:  ufo in breckenridge, texas?<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of a full lunar eclipse in the autumn of 1996, my future husband and I were stopped at a small roadside motel for a rest in our Southwestern journey. We enjoyed dinner and went to our room. We had been able to watch the progress of the lunar eclipse as we ate our food and we were anxious to get the binoculars out to watch its culmination from the parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The parking lot was adequately lit for security, but it didn&#39;t diminish the light from the full moon as it gradually went a bloody brownish color. The motel itself was the only establishment on the road for at least a mile or so. There was nothing on either side of the hotel or the other side of the highway except desert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were leaning against our rental convertible, passing the binoculars back and forth as the moment of full eclipse approached. Only the thinnist sliver of reflected light was left showing as we both appreciated this natural phenomenom above the roof of the adjoining motel rooms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, motion just below the moon caught my eye. I turned my head to the right to follow it and briefly saw the object as it flew off at a disturbing speed. What I saw doesn&#39;t sound like anything I&#39;ve ever heard described before. Likewise, my husbands&#39;s description is unique, but only shares a few similarities with what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both saw something, because, I turned and looked at him and he said, &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  My description:  The first view I had was only a glimpse of motion. When I turned my head I saw for just an instant what can only be described as a net of dim stars. It was a loosely structured object with a network of greyish &#34;lines&#34; which were actually various series of points. This grid structure was moving in all directions at once in an undulating fashion. It reminded me of watching a fisherman&#39;s net being tossed around in the waves, or an amoeba floating around on a speciman slide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even though it didn&#39;t seem to have a method of propulsion, it was flying too fast for my eyes to follow it as it crossed the highway and headed out into the desert night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband&#39;s description:  He only got one glimpse of it as it passed underneath the moon. He saw what he called a gigantic skeletal bird, flapping its wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, this doesn&#39;t sound like it could be the same object I saw. But, it is similar in that large sections of the object were moving, and that there was not much mass to the object, but a lot of empty space in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Skeptics answer:  This was obviously a flock of birds flying low over the hotel. Even though I&#39;ve never seen birds fly so fast that I couldn&#39;t keep up with them visually for at least 3 or 4 seconds. And, there was absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it must have been some piece of debris flying in the wind. Even though it was a still and completely cloudless night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Written: 9/25/00   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Updated: 3/2/2002 I was watching a show on TV last month, called &#34;You&#39;ve Got To See It To Believe It,&#34; and I saw this really weird piece about something people are calling rods. It really freaked me out because it reminded me of the description that Richard gave of this incident. I went online and sluthed out a website about the rods called www.roswellrods.com and showed it to him when he came home. He told me that the rods looked like the object he saw that night in Breckenridge. They really do look real, but I can&#39;t convince myself that they actually exist. I&#39;m thinking about setting up a video camera and maybe even a digital camera and doing some skyfishing on my own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date of the reported incident is correct.  A total eclipse of the Moon occurred on the evening of September 26, 1996.  PD))<n>

I covered my eyes and looked out the window on the door adark figure appeared outside I was paralized. I closed my eyes and re opened them, I was floating above the headge outside my house. I looked up and saw an arangement of red,blue,yellow and, white lights. In the middle of the craft was a growing light then I noticed that it was a door I screamed, and woke up in my bed three days later, I still to this day can&#39;t remember what happened durring thoes three days. My only reminders of this incounter  are numerous scars, and horrable dreams. Three years ago I was taken to the hostpitial because of a car crash, whall there the doctors informed me of many small disc-shaped growths found through-out my body. The news of this brought the memory back and fromthat day till now I have been drawn to find out as much as I can. Sence then i have moved to Summersville in Nicholas County and I have begun to remember the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, source is anonymous.   PD))<n>

According to Mrs. Beverly C., the girl&#39;s grandmother, the kids saw the creature at 1 p.m. The alien was moving through a clearing in the cornfield near their elementary school, located north of Georgeville, Marchand and Smithport in Indiana County, 75 miles northeast of Pittsburgh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The creature &#34;was striding across the clearing, moving its arms back and forth like a soldier marching would,&#34; Mrs. C. said. Her granddaughter described the creature as &#34;four feet tall, and his arms were long on his body&#34; and had &#34;three fingers but not unusually long.&#34; A most unusual feature was a tube-like appendage lying on top of its head and dangling down in the rear. Its skin color was &#34;the blue of a clear sky&#34; and &#34;a black thing that appeared to be an eye but low where a nose should be.&#34; Mrs. C. said her granddaughter and the boy had the creature in view for about nine minutes but did not hear any unusual sounds associated with the entity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a followup communication, she reported that two other children at the same school had just reported seeing a similar sky-blue creature &#34;in the same spot sometime in the spring.&#34; (Email Interview) (Editor&#39;s Note: There was a UFO flap in the Path Valley, near Chambersburg, between March 3 and March 20, 1996, about 100 miles southeast of northern Indiana County.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reported from:  http://ufoinfo.com/roundup/v01/rnd01_31.shtml<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to the individual who submitted this report, and to UFORoundUp for making the material available.

It was an unseasonably warm September evening, no clouds, no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving my sister&#39;s apartment and speaking to the manager. 2 bright white lights caught my attention to the north-west, approx. the distance of an approaching aircraft. The lights seemed to &#34;turn&#34; as if in a sweeping gesture, and &#34;crossed&#34; each other in what appeared to be a figure eight. They stopped, one making a sharp move &#34;downward&#34;, the other repeated the move back up. The lights &#34;crossed each other again and &#34;disappeared&#34; in one move towards the N.E. I turned to the manager, who also witnessed the lights, and we were both dumbstruck. Although we are quite close to the airport, I believe that the maneuvers displayed by this light would be impossible for any commercial plane, or helicopter. The lights were steady, unlike the movement of a searchlight on a helicopter, or headlight on an aircraft. These lights were dancing, almost playing with each other. The apartment manager was approx. 38-42 years old, wearing glasses. I was 26 years old, no eyewear. I was a retail manager. Neither of us were drinking or smoking, both of us were clear-headed and completely lucid at the time of the event.<n>

I was driving to work about 9:30 p.m. and saw what I took to be a CHP helicopter illuminating the freeway with a searchlight about 5 miles ahead. (This area is flat and the freeway lies in an almost straight line for miles.)  As I drove closer, I  realized the light was not circling the freeway but remainded absolutely motionless, and that instead of a searchlight, what I was seeing was radiated light coming from inside some type of large craft or object.  It was hovering about 1000 ft. above the freeway and as I drove almost directly under it, I could see it had a &#34;thimble&#34; shape (larger end up). I could view it clearly because of all the light that was coming from the large windows that surrounded it. I thought about stopping for a better look but didn&#39;t have a camera (naturally), and also thought to myself, &#34;Sure, get a real good look, like Travis Walton did,&#34;  so I kept going. I tried to watch it with my head out the window as I passed under it, but almost lost control of the car so I focused on driving and lost sight of it--nothing in the rear view mirror to indicate whether it was still there after I&#39;d passed. There was normal traffic on the freeway that night and I regretted not having  a CB radio, because the truckers sure must have been hollering about it...<n>

I was out our home in the county line road between Coweta and Broken Arrow Oklahoma. I had stepped out the back door facing a pond behind our place and witnessed a very large winged animal/huminoid creature gliding about 20 yards high and about 30 yards away fromme. It was traveling at a very slow rate and was coming from the front area of our home across the norther part of our lawn moving west by northwest. My discription of this winged creature; long with a thin human shaped torso, moth or butterfly shaped wings extended but not moving or beating, rather gliding. It had a wide dark grey colored human-like face and peered diectly at me as it crossed the yard. It had very large dark eyes. It had I guessed at least a eight or nine foot wingspan. It apeared to be covered with a hairlike folical. It seemed to have a sort of high ridge or dorsal spinal rise behind the haed and wings. I guess it was extremly light-weight for its size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to rationalize the was my imagination playing a trick on me and returned inside halfwittingly joking with my ex-wife telling her I just saw a &#34;Skilly&#34;. This is the term given by Cherokees who claim a superstition of nighthawk people or like other tribal lores, those who change shapes into other than human form. She was going to leave and go visit her sister in Coweta about then and left out the same door. She returned a few minutes later claiming she came face to face with a nine foot tall creature with a red oilish skin and huge red glowing eyes. She was extremley shaken and histerically crying. I heard movement on our front porch after calming her down and finally getting her discription of this thing. I noticealso about a quarter mile across the county line road in front of our home a red light in the pasture. Looking through the screen I saw at first what I thought a police or fire truck lite. Looking closer through the screen I saw a broad silver flattened doom with a red blinking beacon directly center top. My ex was still horribly shaken and I started to go again out the back door possibly to confront this intruder. At that time I recieved a phone call. I answered and a voice sounding as if it was modulated on a radio frequency started speaking with me. I would tell me such as where I was born, where I had been, then in great detail alot of personal facts. The voice was also using what seemed an older type of Englich which I have seen written such as terms in &#34;three score and fourty et. It made some extremly weid prophetic statements. I became Irate and told whoever it was I would have them traced and arrested. I hung up and it rang again. I removed the plugin and set the phone with cord on the kitchen stove. We had our two children with us, a three yeasr old boy and two year old girl. I was becoming extremly concerned about our safety. A very heavy amonia smell filtered into our house causing my eyes to water heavily. At this time the phone rang again. I glanced and saw the phone still unhooked sitting on the stove. I told my ex-wife the we were going to get the kids between us and move directly to our car behind the house. I grabbed a big kitchen knife and we did as I instructed after I yelled loudly that I would butcher anyone or anything in my path trying to stop us on our way to the car. We saw nothing as we exited our home and got ourselves in the car. I drove to her mother house in Coweta. I returned the next day. No sign of anything, footprints, vandalism et.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really question why this happened to us. It was extremly freightening and I questioned my own sanity when I heard the phone ring after unplugging it. I assume it was using a magnetic inductance to axcess and imulate a voise on the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have red a few books on UFOs since. Jim Marrs discribes numerous events very similar by creature discription in 95-96 I would rather not have ever seen this thing. It looked like it had escaped from hell and could easily fit numerous discriptions of both aliens and demons of folklore and biblical accounts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a few theories myself and described this event with a US federal magistrate in Tulsa a week later. Good luck with your research.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

FIRST SLOWELY AND THEN VERY RAPIDLY IN AN UPWARD DIRECTION. it reappeared again in a pattern, with another glow appearing from two different directions, and came just about together at very high speed and suddenly stopped short of merging into each other. They moveed away again moved around , and stopped at a point and sped away again. Four appeared in a patte4rn and started moving around which looked loke a pattern. I had a movie camera , which I switched on and captured some of the movements . We did not report it then as we were not 100% sure of what it was , as we and a few other passer byes stood ther spell bound for these few minutes, but could not really identify the obejcts. we would look at the vedio every now and then, till a knoweledgable person met us last week to confirm that the object were what we had thought them to be  ufo`s. the dates and thime etc written above is an approximation , as the vedio is not with me as i write this . but exact day .date year and time are available on the vedio ), and can be sent to you if this is of interest to you. The vedeo is fairly clear. and a bit scary, as at that point there was nothing happening except this.<n>
9/19/96 22:00|West Yorkshire (UK/England)||Triangle||HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  The object fly slowly over us and behind a hillside, making further observation impossible.|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37120.html|20|ndxe199609| Location of Sighting: A647, between Queensbury and Halifax (West Yorkshire, UK) Number of witnesses: 3 Number of objects: 1 Shape of objects: Triangular  Full Description of event/sighting: Three friends and I were returning from a trip to see a film. As we drove, one of us noticed the object in the sky. It was impossible to determine the size of the craft as we had no way of telling how high above us it was. It was possible to clearly see its shape (a jet black triangle) against the night sky. There were no lights of any kind that we could see, so we assumed it was not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped the car and watched the object fly slowly over us and behind a hillside, making further observation impossible. Judging by its speed, it seemed unlikely that it was a standard aircraft (and also judging by its shape and the lack of lights - the area is part of a flight path to Manchester Airport so we&#39;re well used to planes flying over, and know what they look for), and having seen a number of military planes fly over, it was moving too slowly to be one of those. There was also the fact that we could hear no sound from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s true that there are people who own private gliders and motor-powered gliders in the area, but having seen those fly over my house before I know that we would have heard an engine. There&#39;s also the fact that anyone flying a glider at that hour in the dark would have to be suicidal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s possible that it was a stealth plane, although that seems highly unlikely in West Yorkshire, and I would have assumed that such a craft would have flown faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ultimately observed the object for a period of no more than ten minutes, and we all agreed that not only had we never seen anything like it before, but that we had no idea what it was. At the time we didn&#39;t report it as we felt foolish claiming to have seen a UFO. There was no report in the local newspaper at the time either, so clearly no one else reported it! I only tell you now as I found your website this evening. (Incidentally, the only reason I remember the date is because I keep a record of all the films I see.)  I would be interested to know if any other such sightings have been made in the area. (I know that my cousins, who live nearby, and my next door neighbor, have all witnessed UFO activity in the sky, although none of them have ever seen a black triangle).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n>
9/19/96 21:30|Avon Lake|OH|Changing|3 minutes|ufo spotted 9-19-96 on the shores of Lake Erie in Avon Lake, Ohio, United States of America|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18356.html|21|ndxe199609| ufo spotted 9-19-96 on the shores of Lake Erie in Avon Lake, Ohio, United States of America<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of September 19th, 1996, I was doing a mobile patrol behind the ((energy)) company in Avon Lake, Ohio.  It was a warm evening, and the lake was very calm.  I began my patrol starting in at the east gate, where we - security was ordered, and then continued on thorough the patrol in the company van.  The sky was clear and starry, and I could see where the sun had set beyond the horizon line, northwest of where I was driving along the shoreline road provided.  After I made it past the horseshoe pond on the east end of the plant&#39;s outside area, I began heading toward the west end of the plant, checking designated spots along the way.  Once I made it to the west end of the plant near the fence and public park next door, I checked around a bit and saw that nothing was wrong.  At that point, the ufo had not yet appeared.  So after I turned the van around and began to backtrack my route, I came around the west end of the roadway at the sharp turn on the west end of the plant and headed eastward, when a bright light over the lake caught the corner of my eye.  I stopped to see what it was, and there was this weird craft hovering over the water at approximately two hundred yards off shore, and about one hundred and fifty feet or so above the water.  It was super bright white and very quiet, having seven straight pertrusions coming off of the rectangle center of the craft.  Each pertrusion was exactly the same length and thickness, and each one pointed in a different direction.  For a moment, I thought it was someone playing a trick on me, so I got scared and rolled up my window.  Finally, after three minutes of watching this thing do nothing, I began to continue on with my patrol.  So I started moving the van with my foot still on the break.  I moved it about fifteen or twenty feet before I decided to stop and take one last look at the object.  When I did, it was gone!  Then I really got suspicious and began looking around the water and the pier below the cliff that I was driving! along, when I noticed something moving around by the rocks almost near the shoreline.  I saw a long black semi-cylinderical shaped object moving around down there, that turned around showing a bright white football shaped light directly toward me, as if it were looking at me.  Then suddenly, the thing turned around again, pointed upward, and darted off into the northeast sky, vanising into the stars within three seconds after it took off.  It never once made any sound or expelled any streams of fuel gasses.  After that, for about two weeks my mind was in total confusion.  I couldn&#39;t sleep, I couldn&#39;t take my mind off of the thing at all.  Even to this day, I think about it and watch the night skies.  The following year, some friends and I went back to that approximate spot to see if any other alien crafts would come down; but we had no luck.<n>

I saw something out of the corner of my eye to the North West. I thought it was a falling star. It was coming down fast at a slight angle when suddenly it turned and made a &#34;U&#34; turn and disappeared. From the time I looked at it, it made a &#34;J&#34; shape making a perfect 180 degree turn and disapearing after going back up about half the distance that I seen it coming down. After I saw it, I realized it didn&#39;t have a tale like a normal falling star. It was a bright ball of white light. There was a red ford ranger in front of me and the driver slowed down and was looking up in the same direction as I was, so he must have seen it too. I wanted to report it, but didn&#39;t know how until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate it, but the date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

Over the trees I saw a large craft hovering noiselessly. It had a gray &#39;hull&#39; with a large white glowing dome on the top. There appeared to be portholes around it. The glow was so bright it illuminated the trees underneath it. I should have stopped because we were passing by and my sister was in the car reading and did not look up until I  started yelling &#39;Did you see it?!? Did you see it?!?&#39; By that time, the saucer was obscured by the trees, but she did see the very bright light. I turned around as soon as I could to come back for a second look but it was gone. I know other people must have seen this. There was quite a bit of traffic on Route 2 at the time. Since then I have occaisionally snooped around on the net to see if anyone else reported a similar occurance or to see if Hanscon AFB is up to anything strange since Concord is quite close to it. I have yet to see anything but I know I am not crazy, and I KNOW what I saw was bizarre. I would like to provide photos of the area where I saw it and also to draw a picture of the saucer (I am an art school drop out).<n>

My husband and I were coming from waltham threw Belmont heading toward mass ave arlington.....aproaching a red traffic light my husband said ,LOOK UP. LOOK UP  I knew what I was seeing but realized after I had said Oh my God what is it, he said a ufo..... I was in  awe .....totally fasinated it was beautiful... It radiated the most beautiful shade of  blue lighting  Id ever seen. it  appeared to be round looking up from under it and  had a lighted dome ,lighting in the dome area was the color of a brightly lit room ..... there was nothing in the dome area it was close eanough to have definately seen any thing if it was in that area.....   it  had what appeared to be recessed lights around it ....described by other as port holes ,maybe because I dont believe the lighting was coming from them  .....it appeared to be  hovering above a yellow sloped roof house with the kind of tall  T type antena that were used  on the homes in the late 50&#39;s  for better TV reception.....  it appeared to be so close to the top of that yellow house that if there was any noise coming from it. it had to be heared from that house   . when my husband said look up..... At that moment we were approaching  the set of lights ,over route 2.the road on the right would have lead to down onto route 2 below .....  I believe it  was  raining that night in that area but when we got home the streets were dry, I had asked my husband  to please go down the side streets so i could get a view of it again,but he could not take a right  and the houses were blocking the view ,as this has hovering much to low. My husband would never disscuss it again so I knew I had to try to forget it, though a few years later 2 or possibly 3 or even more the subj! ect came up about a ufo book and I found, I  mentioned it at the table to all there with all the details I believe are here. we never mentioned it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Glanced up, don&#39;t know why, and glimpsed large Metallic Diamond shape gliding through lower cloud base. The weather was good, blue sky and white clouds. This was near Old Trafford Cricket ground. I remember seeing the shadow of the clouds casting across the object. I did not view all of the object in one go as it appeared to be trying to stay in the clouds. It hAd a translucent appearence, a bit like holographic image found on some credit cards! I looked behind me to see if anybody else had seen, but no one was looking. I continued looking and 5 minutes later, near Stretford station, I glimpsed it again. I was absolutely stunned. The fact that it was travelling at a similar speed to the tram (light railway) made it even more unbelievable (40-50 mph max). It was also dangerously close to the flight path into Manchester Airport, a 737 flew past a couple of minutes after the second sighting which gave me an idea of the size .... slightly smaller than a 737. When I reached Altrincham, I stood at the station for 30 minutes hoping to see the object again, but no luck. The object was so stunning that I was sure there would be a &#39;flap&#39; in the News or TV ... but nothing. I would be keen to hear of similar experiences as this has left a huge impression on me. The object looked ominous, and not something to mess around with. I have taken a photograph of a ceiling light taken at an angle which reminded me of the object, which I shall mail,Rgds.<n>

I thought that i was observing this as a bright light low on the southwestern horizion, and made a comment about it to the driver of the vehicle i was in.  I reached in to the back seat to retrive my 8mm video camera when i turnd around the sight was gone, this seemd strange since star light fades out, any way i kept looking in the same area when i saw movement next to the mountain on my left.  I could see somthing in the air above the side of the mountain only because the trees were reflected off the bottom of the craft.  as i begain to video tape and try to get it in focus which was difficult because the camera was new to me and i had it on auto focus, and had to take it off auto focus.while all this was going on it flew over us at what i estamete was a 1000ft then it stopped above and to the right rear of my field of vision and it flew back into the light of the morning sun and was once again lighted brightly, and i was able to focus and begin recording.you can see the saucer shape and see it travel very quickly away and over a hill.<n>

We left Alaska at 7:00am, so that by the time of the incident, it was between 10:30pm and 11:30pm. It was very slightly overcast as we were driving the highway, I could make out the outline of the mountains against the night sky. It was a mountainous area, forested. My friend was asleep as I drove. We were approximately 80 miles northwest of Ft.Nelson, on the Alaska Highway, when off to my right, hovering over a valley,between the road and the mountains, approximately a quarter mile away, I seen, what looked like, three round aluminated balls of fire hovering over the valley. The round lights looked very hot and veried in color as they pulsated and hovered over the valley. The biggest one was approximately 60ft. in diameter and was bright white, and was hovering, what looked to be approximately 150ft., over the trees. The second ball of light, what looked to be half the size of the biggest one, was directly underneath, maybe fifty feet lower. This second ball of light was bright yellowish white. Directly underneath the second ball, at an equal distance was a third round ball, again, one half the size of the one above it. This smaller round ball of light looked very reddish in color. All three round lights were pulsating very fast. It was like looking at an arc welder. I woke my friend up and we both observed this phenomena for approximately 60 seconds. I stepped on the gas in an attempt to get closer, for I could see that the road went to the right up ahead in a closer direction towards the lights. As we went around the bend, we could the lights through the trees, when they just vanished. Within ten minutes, we seen, what looked to be, a white light, 60ft long,20 ft.in diameter, round on each end, moving very slowly, against the back drop of a mountain. I stopped the vehicle and shut off the lights to observe this light. It moved very slowly, horizontally and started to pick up speed. It left a trail behind it that got duller the further back the trail went. This lighting phenomena lasted approximately twenty seconds and what looked to move about three miles, then all of a sudden, took off extremely fast and left no trail after itself, all we seen was the light traveling at an instant high speed acceleration that looked to travel the distance of maybe 10 miles, in less then two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We saw what looked like 3 round large balls of light levetating in the air.The biggest one was on top,it looked like it was very hot in color, a very bright white, the next one was under that one and it looked like the color of fire yellow, then the next one was under that one, it looked like it was fire red/yellow. All three were equally spaced apart what looked like about 30 to 60 feet apart. The biggest one looked to be about 50 to 60 feet in diameter, the next one down was about 35 to 25 feet in diameter, and the small one was the closest one to the ground, it looked to be about 15 to 20 feet in diameter and was about 60 feet off the ground. They all just hung in the air with no sound, but very bright.As I drove faster to get closer to them, I got about 200 ft from them and they all just disappeared. As we drove further, we seen what looked like a very large white oval light ahead of us maybe 1/4 mile. I then stoped the car, turned off the car lights, and shut off the car as not to disturb whatever it was.My friend and I watched it for about 5 min. then it started to move very slow but started to go faster and started to pickup speed. Then it took off real fast and left a long trail behind that looked like the same shape and it stayed white for some time. It looked like what your hand would look like as you passed it in front of you fast.We drove to Watson Lake and reported it to the R.C.M.P. as a UFO sighting. My friend is a Pentecostal Minister for 20 years, he is about 54 years old, and I am 52 years old myself now. All the round balls were glowing like a electric welder, &#34;a pulsating-light.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My husband and I were driving down our road when we saw something we thought was a low flying helicopter slowly following our road coming toward us.  It was above the telephone lines. It had 3 to 4 red lights like windows on the aircraft.  We stopped to watch it.  As it came closer, we realized it was nothing we could understand. The red lites moved slowly.  As one window on the back went off, another on in the front turned on. It was a slow methodical movement.  One turns off and another turns on in the front.  As if it were moving one lite at a time.  We were unable to discern a shape, only the red window like lites.  This continued until it was right next to us.  I had opened the window to see more clearly.  I even turned off the car.  There was no noise.  As we watched it almost seemed to stop and recognize that we were there and in an instant, noiselessly, shot up and away, out of site.  It was a clear nite after dark.   We were amazed and described to each other what we had seen.  We both did see the same thing. I tried to call a couple of airports, they said they didn’t know of anything that was going on.  We are an hour or so from Ft. Drum Army base, home of the 10th Mountain Division, so I thought maybe it was some stealth secret.  They told me to call some National Aeronautics organization or similar.  So I did.  They thanked me for my call and someone would get back to me in 6 to 8 weeks.  Sure.  They never did. I guess they have stories like this all the time.   I have never believed in UFO’s.  This experience I will never forget.  I wished I had written down the date.  I didn’t think there was anything else I could have done.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in 1996 is approximate.  PD))<n>

They swept around to the front and it took off north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me (26) and a friend (32) were driving home from college one night.  We were going through the town of Woodville on Hwy 72, travelling east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming over a small mountain, I saw a couple of white lights and a red blinking light.  I thought, there is a plane.  See them all the time and it looked just like that. I then noticed, &#34;Hey, isn&#39;t that plane awfully low?&#34;  Oh my gosh, it is going to crash, it looked like it was getting lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend said, &#34;What is that?&#34;   Just so happened he had glass tops in his corvette and I was on the passenger side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it came over the top of us, I watched it.  It wasn&#39;t moving as fast as we were so it had to be less that 60 miles an hour.  It sort of stopped, suspended in air over the highway for a couple seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see the dark shape but couldn&#39;t tell if it was quite triangular or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most amazing thing was the lights.  I saw a red blinking one underneath.  There were 4 white lights, 2 on the front and 2 on the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, what was odd about these lights was the fact that they were all shining backwards.  You could see the beams off into the night sky.  Kind of like shining a flashlight and kicking up a bunch of dust - you see the beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, when it stopped, all 4 beams slowly turned clockwise, sweeping down across the road and then turned up to shine forward.  When they did this, it started moving again and quickly flew north.  It was moving from the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mountains there are about 1000-1200 feet high, so it could have only been 1300-1500 in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never been able to explain what I saw that night and I try to explain away most everything.<n>

The two friends were skeptics of alien activity until this experienced happened.  They are both not as willing as I am to tell the story.  I don’t know if it maybe something still in the subconscious mind that does not allow them to be as open as I.  I do know that they will admit to the same as I.  It did happen and it is real.  There is no doubt in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had left the volleyball game well before the sports bus.  It was a dark evening with some patchy fog along the highway.  Not bad enough to loose your bearings.  Especially on a highway that we had all traveled hundreds of times before.  Highway 2 was our life line to real civilization.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were approaching the Telford rest area between Davenport, WA, and Creston, WA.  I had set the cruise control at five miles per hour over the speed limit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We traveled past the rest area just as we had time and time again.  Suddenly, every body in the car had an awakening feeling.  As if you had just been in a deep sleep.  It was almost the same feeling as awakening from a bad dream.   We all noticed it at the same moment and began commenting on the strange feeling we had all just experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, we were traveling past the rest area again.  Different cars were traveling toward us on the highway.  We had been put back in the wrong place.  It  is the only verdict that I can come to grasp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The travel that evening had taken us longer than it should have.  We arrived only a few minutes ahead of the sports bus.  We lost somewhere between 10-15 minutes.  We were gone.  I don’t have any recollection of what happened while I was gone, nor do the friends that were with me.  They say that we hit a time warp or something like that.  I don’t know what really happened to us.   Maybe someday I will?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of this report, and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded.

As we drove closer, we saw a solid object floating about 20 feet above the tree tops.  I pulled the car over to the side of the road and we sat staring at this glowing object.  There was a house within the field of view, the diameter of the object was twice the length of the house. The object was constructed in 3 sections, the middle section had glowing rectangular panels, the bottom section was massively constructed and we could see ribbing.  There was no sound, the trees did not move, this all happened at twilight.  After discussing what we were looking at, I started the car and left; the object was still there when we left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My pragmatic wife doesn&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s but she does admit that she saw this object. My wife is retired and I work at NASA.<n>

We were about 20 minutes out of Vegreville when I looked out of the passenger side window of the truck a long narrow golden cylinder was pacing our vehicle at about around 700 feet.. I watched amazed and then woke my girlfriend we both could not figure out exactly what it was that we were seeing. I am an ex military member , skydiver and aviation enthusiast. We watched for nearly half an hour as we drove along. It was not an atmospheric anomaly or trick of lighting. This object paced us at 110 km an hour and appeared to react to our minor changes in speed it was about 1/4 mile away from the Yellow Head Highway in the northern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is where it gets funny I don&#39;t remember the object leaving and when I questioned My girlfriend about it a year later, she reacted emotionally (unusual for her) she had absolutely no memory of the object.. we both can remember what we did prior to travelling , but she has no memory at all of this event.

We took some service roads to a remote location North of the lake and  settled down for the evening.  We were looking at the stars towards the South.  We noticed some movement in the sky, just singular points of light that seemed to be moving in the triangular patterns.  We didn&#39;t think much of it at the time, but what we experienced next was incredible.  As we were observing the night sky over the treeline from the South, two glowing orbs moved towards us very close(within 15 feet).  As soon as we both saw them they stopped hovering in mid-air.  They were multi-colored and seemed to be luminous.  It was as if we, the orbs and us, were having a telepathic communication and that we were both aware of each others prescence.  The time that elapsed at this point was minimal as they both moved overhead and traveled North out of our sight.  There was no engine noise and they did not look like mechanical devices.  They did not have flashing lights or make any noise whatsoever.  It felt like they were observing us and we had luckily noticed them.  The only thing I have ever seen to compare them to is ball lightning,because they were spherical.  But the shy was completely clear and there were no thuderstorms in the area.<n>

We stopped and looked at an unusally bright red star in the sky. We commented on it and looked at it for about 10 seconds when we noticed a smaller reddish star looking object appeared to be dropping straight down, very slowly, from the original object. It looked as if it was released from the original star like object. A few seconds after that started happening we hurried into the office. So I do not know what happened next.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

This much I&#39;m sure of. It was on a weekend. I&#39;m a weekend musician and played mostly Fridays and Saturdays. The place we were playing that night no longer exists so I guess I can mention the name. The name of the place was called the Barn in a small town of smithville. I was riding with the sound man. We stopped at a stop sign close to where we had to make a left turn to enter the Club parking lot. I was not driving. The person who was did not see it, and at the time I did not mention it at first. The shape is hard to tell it was very dark in that area. I do remember 3 very large windows on the right side of the craft. It moved very slowly north. I only saw it briefly so I didn&#39;t get much detail. It wasn&#39;t until I got to the club that I would discover exactly what it was. After arriving at the club, the sound man,myself and a few others were unloading the equipement from the van when the lead singer showed up with the two people that she had been riding with. They had taken a different route to the club. They were all very excited and leaped out of the car shouting, &#34;did you see it?, did you see it?&#34; The first words out of my mouth were, did it have 3 large windows on it&#39;s side? They replyed that it did and started to tell us all what they had encountered.  Once they had noticed it they stopped the car on the side of the road. The to younger girls got out to look at it while the older woman stayed in the car. They were shouting at it to land and were waving their arms in the air when it just disappeared from right over their heads. I haven&#39;t seen the girls in a long time but I know I can trace them down if I have too. The older woman to this day will not discuss what she saw for fear of being labeled unstable. The other two girls live outside of nashville now in Tennesse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

Two seperate occasions, the first a month earlier. Disc shaped, no lights, featureless,maller than I first though as it went under some dark clouds and not over. Tilted at one stage and was brighter on top possibly due to reflection. Color very dark grey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I say, it was nearly dark. I had finished work and was sitting outside the rear of my store having a cigarrette. (The First sighting.) I first thought it was a helicopter, as we used to have a tree at back of the store, and my first glimpse of it was through the branches. I expected any minute to hear the sound of rotors, there were none so I looked again. When it cleared the tree and I saw what it was,.....well, I have not spoken of this to anyone except my cousin. He asked had I been drinking and laughed when I phoned him. I told him I was about to start, and indeed I bought myself a drink while I thought about it. A month later,,full moon time again (give or take a day)I saw the same thing following the high street at the same twilight time. (This should give a clue to the exact date in 1996) I was looking into the sunset or what was left after the sun had set, you know, the brightness that hangs for a little while in the hight desert There were people standing outside Le Mairs store.  I waved frantically in hope someone would see what I saw. I didnt realise until I turned, that both I and the object were East of the people and obscured by darkness. The object (hate the word saucer) made no noise at all. Late roosting birds were flying and a light aircraft was landing at our small airport. It had landing lights on and as were the street lights lit. I have only discovered your page today. I am a businessman and don&#39;t want to be called a &#39;nut&#39;. However it occured to me that perhaps someone else reported the same thing if you have a database. None of your &#39;categories&#39; fit. The light aircraft was coming in at right angles to the flight of the object and seemingly totally unaware of it&#39;s presence.<n>

9/13/96 20:30|Austin|TX|Triangle|3-4 minutes|Triangle shaped, low-flying, slow, silent Stealth fighter sized object with a red, revolving light on bottom.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36265.html|45|ndxe199609| Triangle shaped, low-flying, slow, silent Stealth fighter sized object with a red, revolving light on bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a high school graduate(1976) and one of my favorite classes in high school was Astro-science. My high school had a planetarium built into it and it was always an interesting experience to look forward to everyday. I had an interest in space and always watched televised NASA events. In december of 1995, I finally broke down and bought a 4.5 reflector telescope from a department store. I suddenly became an avid sky-watcher. I bought software to show me where the planets were and started a sketckbook to draw the planets as I was seeing them through my telescope at certain times. I would write the times and dates below the sketches. I was lucky enough to see comets Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp and a couple of lunar eclipses which I added to my sketchbook. I could point out Jupiter and Saturn and sometimes Mars with my naked eye as well as star clusters such as the Pleiades and nebulas like the one in Orion to friends and co-workers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I became more aware of just how immense our universe is, my interest in U.F.O.s came to the forefront. I read many books of sightings and have amassed a library of video tapes and books on the phenomena. I was wishing to see one for myself. On Sept.13,1996 I got my chance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time in my life, I was delivering pizza for a living and my sighting happened while on a run. I added it to my sketchbook 2 days after I saw it. It is from these notes and my recollection that I now relay the information to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened in the southern-most part of Austin near the intersection of Slaughter and Manchaca. I was driving east on Slaughter lane and crossed Manchaca road and made a right turn onto Bilbrook. Now facing south, I looked in the sky for Jupiter, but the sky just was not quite dark enough to see it yet. I made another quick right turn onto Slaughter Creek drive, a long dead-end road which is where the delivery was going to. Now I was facing west and I saw a bright headlight up in the air and not all that high. I assumed it was a Cessna airplane which I had seen flying in the area before as there is a farmer on Slaughter lane that has his own dirt airstrip and I had seen him flying many times. The light was coming toward me, flying east as I was headed west. As the space between us narrowed, I became aware that it was not the Cessna that I thought it was and I could not identify what kind of plane it was. It was then that I saw that it was a triangle. Curious, I pulled to the side of the road and looked up through my windshield at the thing. &#34;What is that?&#34; I said out loud. It was flying slowly and low. I could not take my eyes off it. &#34;How can that be flying?&#34; I said outloud again. With my car still running, I stepped out of my car and just watched this thing glide overhead. It was after sunset but the sky was not quite dark yet. I became aware that this was my U.F.O. I did not know what it was, how it could be flying,it was to me an unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a dark (possibly black) triangle, the trailing edge being a little shorter than the other two with the bright headlight being at the front point. There was a revolving red light on the bottom encased in a glass dome and I remember thinking of a fire engine light. There were two or three other smaller white lights on the bottom shining straight down but they were not that bright. It was heading to the east,parallel with Slaughter Ln. at about 45-50 m.p.h.and there was no noise coming from it that I could hear. It was approximatly 100 yds. to my south and approximatly 300 yds. up. As it flew past, and as I was now looking at the rear of it, I could see a pair of small stabilizer wings on the top of the rear section just like a F-117 Stealth Fighter has. I looked at my watch, and even though I did not make a note of the exact time, I now know it was very near 8:30 p.m. I stood there and watched it slowly glide away over the nearby roofs of a neighborhood until I could no longer see it. I got back in my car and made the delivery and contemplated what I had seen. I was familiar with most planes but I never heard of one that flied so slowly without sound. I thought it might be a Stealth Fighter because it was about the same size, but the shape was not right. An F-117 is triangular, but not a triangle. From my vantage point, it appeared to be a flat triangle gliding through the air. There were no navigation lights (red on the left, green on the right) although, I could not see the entire right side. I wanted to tell my friends when I got back to the store but I did not. I always thought if I ever saw a flying saucer, I would tell everyone that they are real. Now I understood why people hesitate or just keep it to themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope I have given you enough information to help out in some way. I never reported it and was kind of scared to tell anyone for a while. When I finally showed my sketch of the object and the notes I wrote to one of my friends, he kind of looked at me strange. I know he did not think I was lying, and it seems to me that he thinks I was mistaken about what I saw. But it was completly unknown to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason that I do not think it was &#34;alien&#34; , is because of the revolving red light on the bottom and the stabilizer wings on the rear. But still, I was pretty exited and I am glad that now I can tell you about it. Thank you.<n>

We were driving along a long and relatively straight stretch of road near the Columbia River, headed toward the West. In the distance, staright ahead of us, was a slowly pulsating white light, to the left of a mountain in the area. At first I thought it was the headlights of a plane approaching for a landing at one of the area airports. When the object never moved for well over a full minute, I called my friend&#39;s attention to it and we continued to watch for at least another two minutes. Still the object held motionless, but continued to pulsate, at about 4-6 seconds per cycle, I would guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both thought this very odd and were sure it could be no plane, when we got an added shock as the final pulse seemed to enlarge and disspate, as if a puff of smoke had been spread from a central point and then vanished. We did not see this again, but the following Monday, a few days later, he told me of a trip he and his girlfriend had taken over the weekend, toward Prosser, a neighboring city to the West. He reported that they had both witnessed the same type of event again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do know that another friend and at least one of my wife&#39;s family have seen unusual occurences in this vicinity, as well. And one, at very close range, many years ago when she was a child..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I remember that specifically. Victorville is 30 miles SE of Edwards AFB. While laying on the patio with my dog watching the thunderheads blowing to the NNE I noticed a dark grey, sometimes shiny object bobbing in and out of the clouds to the NW. It was stationary relative to my patio eaves so I could see it was not moving with the clouds. It was bobbing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was stationary relative to its position over the ground, but lost and gained altitude. Here&#39;s the cool thing. Since I am a geological engineer, I know directions, relative velocities, etc., etc. I have vision so good at that time it was better than 20/10. Anyhow, I could see this object  would have been flying near and over the SE part of Edwards AFB, which is not inhabited. Here it was in BROAD DAYLIGHT!  So I got my binoculars (15 power) and was stunned to see a saturn shaped metal obect making gyroscopic manuevers in place. It was almost at the top of the thunderheads (the top of them being probably about 45,000 feet).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object turned on its side with the flat side toward me and I could see it was round with the profile being saturned shaped. Like that famous UFO photo that those goes took in South America decades ago. It had a black circumscribed ring in the bottom. Then, I noticed 3, then 4, little wispy &#34;blobs&#34; flying around it and seeming to merge with it and also fade in and out! Since the sky was crystal clear (due to the strong jet stream wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing just stayed there for about 3 hours spinning (apparently), then turning verically, then sideways, etc. like it had no particular preference for what direction was considered level relative to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The wispy blobs (slightly rectangular) seemed to have some kind of light energy coming out of them. As the orbs bobbed around the object they would &#34;smear&#34; themselves. Like when you move a candle and looke at it from a distance in a dark room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An Southwest Airlines (?) airliner flew on its designated flightline (maybe about 35,000 feet AGL) below the object which was about 40,000 feet. I could not believe the airliner pilots did not see this or that this flying saucer and companions did not fly away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Relative to the jetliner this think would have multiple times the size of the jet. I&#39;d say at least 6 times the length of the jetliner. Keep in mind I saw all this in binoculars very clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, I looked for my instamatic camera and it had two pictures left. This camera did not have a zoom unfortunately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took two pictures. Eventually, the clouds thickened and I could no longer see the object and its campaions again. The whole sighting was about 2 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my wife came home I  told her about it and she did not believe me. Well, I developed the pictures and you can see the object in the photos but it is real small.  I ran the photos through Photoshop to see if I could pull up some detail and you can see it looks similar to a toy top and you can see the blobs which appear to be more like rectangles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Tonight though, I noticed that something wasn&#39;t right about them.  So I closed the car door and leaned back against the car to see if I could figure out what it was.  Then I noticed 3 stars in a triangular pattern that I could not recall ever seeing before.  I began trying to get a fix on the star patterns.  I knew the location of Polaris and these stars were just left of it.  From my position, I&#39;d say they were North Northwest.  Next I located Cassiopeia, just to my right or North Northeast.  So then I looked back to the stars to see if I could identify them and as I watched them, I thought to myself that they were moving.  At first, I dismissed it as a trick of the light, but after a few more seconds, I used my index finger and thumb to measure the distance from a near by tree.  I was getting ready to take a second measurement when I noticed that I could definitely see movement.  All three &#34;stars&#34; were moving in an East Southeasterly direction.  All three lights were &#34;white&#34; light.  I didn&#39;t notice any color change or flickering in them.  The front light and the back right light were the brightest, the back left light was about half the brightness of the other two.  As I watched, the lights got closer overhead, then they suddenly went out.  All three of them at the same time.  I noticed that there did not seem to be any difference in the movement of the lights, that is to say all three light remained the same distance apart during the time I watched them.  Almost as if they were all attached to one object.  I waited outside for a few more minutes to see if the lights would come back on, or if I could hear some kind of engine noise, but nothing else happened.  About a week later, I mentioned the event to a group of friends and one of them told me that someone who worked in the City of Fayetteville, approx 30 miles away, had mentioned seeing something similar.  Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get the name of the individual and hav! e lost c ontact with the friend who mentioned it.  I&#39;d also like to add that I served in the USAF for 20 Years, where I worked on Aircraft from the SR-71 to Special Operations Helicopters.  I am familiar with aircraft flying in formations as well as doing night operations.  These lights did not appear to fit any formation light configuration that I every saw.<n>

As we flew from sanfran the normal turn is to the north over the city and then over oakland. just as we reached about 4500 foot the plane was forced into a hard left turn in which the food carts came loose and the overheads came open.  my shoes which were off slid accross the isle. Being in first calss I could see the panic in the eyes of the flight attendents.  Then two large ovals craft went past the right side of the plane and above us. They were much larger than our craft the first being nickel in color and the second a rust color. They were close enough to see with detail their shape and construction. Then a third craft nickel came by on the same path as the first two.I was in the window seat but the person next to me and those behind on the right side of the flight saw them.  The flight attendant tried to get the attention of the flight crew but it was some time,three or four minutes befour the crew would take their call.  There was a heated conversation and the attendants became very distrssed and talked among themeselves. The cockpit door then came open and the crew told the attendants be calm all the while one person on the crew was on the radio looking for a new flight path and seeking information on the other objects we just missed.  the door remained open and I could here conversation as how how they would fly a new route to Dallas. Later the crew all denied anything varied from the norm  and would not discuss this matter.  ON a later flight I was with the same attendtent and was reconized and was asked if I had seen them and she said we were very lucky. I have all the flight info if anyone wants to follow up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also have photos of a craft that I took from a flight from New Mexico that was below us. This craft had triangle shape and moved from side to side as it moved to the north at a very slow speed.We saw the craft long enough for me to get my nikon from my case and take photos.  The Dr next to me kept the object in view as I got the camera  out. It looked very unstable in movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, although witness is attempting to establish the correct date.

There was an airshow scheduled for that weekend in SF, as info was in the news I read prior to the flight.  I can go back through my records and get the exact date if needed.  I mean there was activity brought on by the occurrense taking place with the crew and others on the flight that took place for over one hour.  this includes the crew trying to get an ok to fly over parts of Nevada  that were not normal for the flight.  With the door open to the cabin for a period of time you could overhear the conversations taking place.  Also the attendants spoke of this to each other, about the flight being too far south of norm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Actual viewing time was short because of proximity of the three craft, at the most a few seconds.  There were no more than 1200 ft away at the most and details in the surface was obvious.  They  all had weatherbeaten look and looked very as if they had been exposed to harsh conditions. Give me a fax number and I will send a drawing of the craft.  When this started I was on the right side of the aircraft but swiched to the left window after our turn to the left and could see all three over the bay bridge moving northeast and gaining altitude and speed. they maintained this course until out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

Slowly passed over,making no sound what-so-ever even though it appeared to be very low, then sped up and streaked away. Called husband in time for him to see only the disappearing lights...he saw red and white, though I only saw white as it was over us,as it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was ((title deleted)) of the ((enterprise name deleted)) Savannah and we lived on the top floor of the hotel with windows facing to the north giving long unbroken views across the marsh to South Carolina. It was about 5:30 in the morning and still fully dark.  I had an extremely painful toe which was keeping me awake. I&#39;d just gotten up to doctor it and returned to bed, lying on my side facing the window with foot hanging off bed to let medication dry. In this position I suddenly became aware of the fact that something was beginning to pass over the hotel from south to north.  At first I saw just the lip, then more and more of it, almost floating slowly northward. It was round and lit from beneath or within with white lights, not uniform in brightness, but some spots brighter than others and I recall thinking it looked like a tentacle-less jelly fish...why?  I guess because it was sort of translucent appearing. That&#39;s the best way I can describe it.  It didn&#39;t make a sound though was no more than a couple hundred yards over the hotel. I jumped out of bed, speechless and staring in awe.  When I found my voice called my husband and the urgency in my voice bolted him upright so he was beside me instantly at the window.  However in that brief period, the slow, leisurely speed it had had vanished and it absolutely streaked away so that in the space of just a couple of seconds, it was between 3 and 5 miles off.  Thus, my husband only was able to see it disappearing in the distance and it was far enough then that he saw only red and white lights disappearing, but could not make out the shape.  (I&#39;d seen only white). It was such an unbelievable sight and I am so thankful he saw it as well, otherwise I&#39;d be doubting myself. Made one call, very sheepishly to Savannah police who had had no other reports.  Made another call to a local tv station to see if they had had any. They wondered if I&#39;d mind appearing on camera as a human interest story but in no way would I ever have considered it. It&#39;s almost an embarrassment because most people don&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s.  Aside from these 2 phone calls, I&#39;ve told only my 2 children and my two brothers.  This just isn&#39;t something you can talk about to friends or casual acquaintances without them worrying about your stability!! As for my background, I was 53 at the time, college degree, former social worker then didn&#39;t work outside the home while the kids were growing up<n>

We both had not consumed any alcohol our drugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Circa 1 kilometre before we reached our village we saw a red-orange lighting oval object  which flew over a hill right next to the site. It was less than 50 metres over the ground near a power pole (perhaps in 200 or 300 metres distance from the pole) and flew very slow and irregulary from one side to the other in an area of about 50 metres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the ufo for three or four minutes (as we discovered it, we immediately stopped our moped) and could see that the object slowly changed its shape from elliptical into roundly and back again into elliptical for some times. Also it looked like it was completely enclosed by a kind of orange fire, but this fire didn&#39;t jitter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Than we decided to take a closer look on it and drove up on the hill. On our way we had to drive through the village for some minutes and could not see the ufo in this time. Reaching the top of the hill we saw that the object was no longer here but somewhere over the neighbour-village, in a distance of about 2 or 3 kilometres, perhaps up to 5 km, I don&#39;t know exactly. Because the object could be seen from the house of my parents, we quickly drove forward to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At home, I searched for my mother&#39;s photo camera, and because of the noise she woke up. I told her what was going on outside, and so we went into the garden and watched the object staying at the same place near the next village, changing its shape and brightness. At ca. 4:00 I could see that its brightness went darker and darker, and at last it dissapeared in nothingness after over an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took eight photos of the ufo, but I was very surprised as I saw them some days later:   1.) I choosed a long exposure time for the camera, but just on two of the eight photos you can see something more than black sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.)  It was also surprising that there were TWO objects on the photos! Both stood not in the center of the image but could be connected by an imaginary line which leads through the center   3.) On one photo you can see a serial of blue-lightning dots which I didn&#39;t remember having seen.<n>

There was no wild manuevering but the objects did ascend and descend slightly. The distance from the aircraft could have been a mile behind us and perhaps 1000 ft below our altitude. I notified the flight attendant and she said she would notify the crew--possibly the crew made visual contact also.  Most of the passengers were asleep at the time. Do not know if NWA flight crew notified air control. I was formerly with North American Aviation/Space Division assigned to a photographic unit documenting the command module tests during the Apollo program.<n>

Having lived in this area all of my life, I know that air traffic into Newark, Kennedy and LaGuardia Airports are some times deverted in a &#34;hold&#34; pattern and then cleared for approach I believe this is called the &#34;Alpine Apporach&#34; but could be wrong...I am not an aviator. This night, I thought this plane / jet was going to crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me start with my condition. I am not, nor have I ever used drugs, drink or take medications....and I am not psychotic or delusional and do not seek money, fame or lie. I have no reason to write this other than to get this off my chest, after all these years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that we have that straight.... It was a clear night (no rain), but there was a &#34;ceiling&#34; of clouds above. The lights from New York City / Yonkers and the Bronx (On the other side of the Hudson River) cast a &#34;pinkish tint&#34; of color on to the clouds above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object I saw, was a &#34;Chevron shape&#34;. It had one big light in the center and several lights on both (what appeared to be) wings running all the way to it&#39;s tips.  I observed this while driving at about 40/45 miles an hour north. It&#39;s direction (from what I noticed) was coming in from the north headed south west. I noticed this because it appeared to be headed at the water tower in the back of what was then the Thomas J. Lipton Company, Scholastic Magazine Company, Lever Brothers and Volkswagon of America buildings. All have now departed and the new CNN World Head Quarters exists at approximately the spot from which I first spotted the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As It drew nearer to Clinton Avenue (this road runs east and west) and Route 9W, I pulled my car over and got out to observe this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my amazement the ship slowly appeared over the tree line with absolutley NO NOISE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this area of New Jersey sits on the Palisades Cliffs, my only guess as to how hight it was, was about 300 to 500 feet above route 9-W not above the Hudson River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traffic was very light and few cars were headed north at that interval but several cars drove south. They probably couldn&#39;t see this craft or object because as you drive south on 9-W the trees will obstruct any view of an object coming in this direction. The Palisade Interstate Parkway also runs adjacent to 9w with lanes going in a north south direction but I did not take note of this road or how many cars were on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this massive, I&#39;ll call it, &#34;Mothership&#34; passed...everything seemed extrodinarily quiet. I made sure to pinch and smell myself just to make sure I was not dreaming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing had to be the size of &#34;Giant Stadium&#34;...it was incredible. Thats the only way I can describe its mass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed over 9-W....I got home found my binoculars and went back to Clinton Avenue. It had passed. I drove back down Route 9W towards the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey which crosses the Hudson River and brings you on to the Crss Bronx Expresway, Routes I-95, or Manhattan roads such as the Henry Hudson Parkway or the West Side Highway or Harlem River Drive......hoping to see this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had flown away quietly!!! Why people crossing the George Washington Bridge from NY did not see this, I can not explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to several Police stations...Englweeod Cliffs, Fort, Lee and Alpine....I was told there had been many calls from local residents during this time frame...so I wasn&#39;t going nuts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later, while skimming through a famous &#34;alien&#34; book, it was confirmed in the back by the authors friend, that on that same night, he saw the same object pass over the Long Island Express Way in New York, head in the same direction and coming from the same coordinates that I have just described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a great relief to know I had seen, &#34;something&#34; that was not a plane, jet or conventional craft. It could have been a blimp of some sort....but the size was just too outstanding (similar to the &#34;Arizona - &#34;Phenoix lights&#34;) to be a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s my question....if it was military, why would they fly it over a very populated area with the possibility of it malfunctioning, crashing or going down?  But I will tell you it was the color of a dark &#34;battleship-grey&#34; or possibly a charcoal grey and it blended perfectly into the night had it not had the lights on. It also appeared to have srtucture to it&#39;s underside / belly.... something similar to &#34;girders&#34;. As it pass over it was a diamond shape from underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NO SOUND, The size of several Jumbo Jets ...I can&#39;t tell you what it was but it was nothing like I had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n>

My friend followed it and I removed my binoculars to see if the ob- ject heading S/E could be viewed with the naked eye which it could not so I captured it again with the binoculars until it went out of sight. According to the docudrama asteroids there are quite a few asteroids orbiting the earth so I wasn&#39;t to sure if I should even list this one. However I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before moving at the speed that it was so here it is. Thx for existing.<n>

We boated upriver about 10 miles till it grew dark and we found a spot to build a fire and sleep in our sleeping bags. We made a nice fire, ate a little, and sat back to relax. We were situated in a canyon about 100 feet deep, but I could see miles upriver. It was a moonless night with many stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a movement and looked there to see a spherical object which was incredibly bright, yet cast no light (which bothered me constantly even years later) that was slowly rising vertically over the edge of the canyon maybe 1/2 mile away.  Once above the canyon edge, I saw that it was bright white, round with rows of lights that rotated around it that were white also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to my buddy, hey do you see that and he looked and saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then it started coming what we both thought as straight at us real fast.  Even now my hair stands up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said I&#39;m grabbing the machete and he said I got the rifle.  We were both scared and went into survival mode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right as I said Im gonna take them out with me. It stopped.  Stood still.  It reversed the course and floated below the hill just where it rose up. We then heard what we thought were dozens of coyotes howling very close by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were nervous and went out with torches to gather wood for almost an hour.  We made the HUGEST bonfire you could imagine and talked like nuts about how scared we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next memory was waking up completely zipped up in the sleeping bag and covered with about 8 to 12 inches of ash.  Neither my friend or I remember laying down or even wanting to as were so scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left right away that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, I&#39;m a decorated 2 tour Vietnam Army Ranger.  Didn&#39;t think I could get scared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was calm, starry night with light winds. I was going back and forth from my truck to the house carrying groceries and I noticed this triangle shaped object over on the rock quarry property hovering vertically. It made no noise, had three lights, and was totally transparent. As I went to the truck for another load of groceries, I noticed that this object was moving closer to the house. I went into the house and put the groceries on the counter and went back outside and stood on the patio and watched this object, still hovering vertically, approach the house and stop about two (200) hundred yards away from me. This was a perfectly still night and I could still hear the crickets chirping, yet, I could not hear any sound coming from this object that was about as wide as two of my trucks placed end to end. The top left and bottom lights were white, but the top right light turned from white to red and then to orange. I could literally see the stars through this object; it was totally transparent. I stood there and watched this object for about five (5) minutes before I went over to my truck and called my friend, Chris. When I moved towards the truck, which was about twenty five (25) yards away, this object moved so that it could look at me with an unobstructed view. I called my friend then I called my Mom and told them what I was looking at. I don&#39;t lie about anything-period-and they knew that I was serious. After I got off of the phone with them, I watched this object for another five (5) minutes and did something that truly blew my mind, as if seeing this thing wasn&#39;t enough. This object, still hovering constantly, made a vertical move, then a downward move, and then took off at the speed of light. It was gone. No trails. No streaks. Gone in an instant. Vanished. I stood there in total awe and then when I came to, I hopped in my truck and raced to the other end of the p! roperty to see if I could find any burn marks or other evidence. I found nothing. I immediately called the Belton Police Department and asked if there had been some reports of strange craft sighted between Belton and Peculiar. They said &#34;no.&#34; I then made a call to the Cass County Sheriffs office and asked them if there were any operations being performed either out of Whiteman Air Force Base or the old Richards Gebaur Air Force Base. They said &#34;no,&#34; and I responded, &#34;well, I just saw an ufo.&#34; The next day, even after investigating in the daylight, I found nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were all the same brightness except for one light was brighter and would go up three, down five, up six, down all the way, then halfway up and so on.  It did this random strobing very fast.  It was so unusual and compelling I immediately slowed down from about 60 mph to about 30 mph(on a highway!), never looking away.  Slowing down allowed me to view it for about 1-2 minutes. I should&#39;ve pulled over to the shoulder to keep watching it but my subconscious kept telling me that I would figure out what it was, so just keep driving.  When I passed the hill it was above I lost sight of it then realized I HAD to go back and see it again.  I exited, turned arou! nd, merged back on the highway, (this took 5-10 mins.), but by then it was gone. I later saw the video of the Salida, Colorado UFO, and realized they&#39;re exactly the same type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened many years ago but I remember it like it happened yesterday.  I told everybody at the party and they said that the reservoir has a history of strange lights coming in and out of the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few weeks later I read in USA TODAY that an incident involving the military happened there about 30 years previously; a white light coming out of the water, hovering quite a while observed by many people.  The police were called and then eventually the military.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now live in North Carolina, and a few years ago saw two strange lights about 20 feet above some trees in WhiteCross NC. They were flat, about 15 feet across and did not project light but rather contained the light,  no glowing, no rays, almost as if they were portals. When I drove back to see them again, they too just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the beltline in Raleigh, about 8 yrs.ago, I was with two driving students, and observed a small pin of green light materialize about 300 yards above some trees, it instantly expanded into an oval shape and then streaked across the sky leaving a green trail behind it. This event took about two seconds. This happened while the student who was driving happened to be talking about an event two years previously when he saw some strange green lights in the sky flying in random patterns. In the middle of his story, the green light appeared in front of us! We all shouted at the same time (sort of in Harmony); &amp;quot; oh my God, did you just see that!&amp;quot; All three of us shouted the exact same words;&amp;quot; oh my god,  did you just see that&amp;quot;. The kid driving started freaking out pretty bad saying,&amp;quot;that&#39;s it! that&#39;s it! that&#39;s the kind of light I saw two years ago!&amp;quot; it was as if &#39;they&#39; heard us talking about &#39;them&#39; and said, &amp;quot;yeah, here we are!&amp;quot;. Needless t! o say I had him pull over to the shoulder so we could all catch our breath and figure out what just happened.<n>

No sound.|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/001/S01975.html|66|ndxe199609| SUMMARY:  Sighting of crescent moon shaped object at about cloud high, traveling from NNW to SSE in direction of Denver CO, at 9:30 PM. No sound. Two witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sitting in back yard with my wife, we were facing south watching the sky because I had seen something similar to this the previos year that my wife could not see. I looked over my right shoulder to the NNW. As I looked into totaly clear skys with bright stars this object appeared in my field of vision. Just as I saw it I said to my wife who had just turned her head, &#34;Do you see that&#34;, her reply was &#34;Oh my God I do&#34;. We both watched it proceed about cloud height above our heades and move very steadily to the SSE in the direction of Denver. I had my camera with and tryed to take pictured but they were only black when developed. As we watched it disappeared before it was at a distance that we thought it should have. It just faded out. The object appeared to be illuminated by ground lights from the city, and looked like the front edge, and bottom of a disk. It had the shape of a cresent moon, with a slight point in the center and back. There was no sound. Judging by the hight !it seemed to be around 100ft-150ft across.About a year before this we had been sitting in the same place in the yard and I saw the same thing going in the opposite direction (SSE to NNW)  that was the same shape, size, and hight, except that it had four rectangular blocks of light on the leading edge, and my wife could not see it even though she was looking exactly where I pointed. If there were any other sighting in the area around the same time, I&#39;m interested.<n>

This had become our c|8/19/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02283.html|67|ndxe199609| Summary : 9/1/96 SIGHTINGAround 9:30 pm, Sunday, September 1st, 1996, my wife and I were in our backyard watching the sky.  This had become our custom following a previous sighting I had seen alone in early August, 1995.  We live in Larimer County, Colorado, just south of the city limits of Fort Collins, approximately 2 miles from the foothills in front of Horsetooth Reservoir. We were positioned in such a way that our field of vision was to the south.  The sky was so clear that night that we remarked that the Milky Way was visible.  There was no moon visible at that time, although about a hour later, there was a full moon.For no apparent reason I looked over my right shoulder toward the NNW and saw clear skies.  Suddenly appearing in my field of vision was an object moving at what I guessed to be at cloud height.  There was no sound and the object moved fluidly toward the SSE, in the direction of Denver. The leading edge of the object seemed to be lit - possibly by the moon which had not yet risen but which may have been lighting the leading edge of the object from the east.    Also for no apparent reason, my wife turned her head and looked over her shoulder toward the NNW.  After having first noticed clear skies, the object suddenly appeared in her field of vision.Just at the moment that I realized what I was seeing, I said to my wife, “Do you see that?”  Before I could finish the sentence, she responded “God, I do.”As we watched the object proceed toward the SSE, we had enough time to consider and reconsider what the object might be.  The object moved with the fluidity of a bird riding a thermal, but there was no evidence of any wing movement or a change in course that a thermal would create. The object was much too large to be a bird - at arms length it would take a baseball sized object to obscure its visibility.  The shape was reminiscent of the Batman symbol with a curving leading edge that almost made a half circle with a point in the center rear.  The object appeared to be more oval than round, wide rather than long, and the center point was less that half the radius of the implied oval shape.The object remained in our field of vision for 30-45 seconds, long enough to pick up, set, and focus a camera. (The prints came back black.)  There was enough time for the internal dialog of considering, “Yes, I really see this - Yes, its really there” to take place more than 4 or 5 times as we watched the object track directly overhead.  It then disappeared as suddenly as it appeared.  Our field of vision was such that we should have been able to track its movement longer than the object was visible.The object seen in the earlier sighting in August, 1995, was similar in size, height and flight path with the direction of travel being the reverse course, SSE to NNW.  The leading edge was illuminated by 4 rectangular blocks of light and the previously mentioned rear center point was not noticed.  The object also appeared and disappeared in the same sudden fashion at approximately the same positions in the sky.We would be interested in knowing if anyone else had observed this or similarly shaped sightings.

We had just gotten outside of Wattsburgh, Pa when I had noticed 4 round lights in the sky moving around in a square formation. I asked my mother if she sees the lights when she glanced over to look her first responce was that it was a reflection of the window, but I knew they were not. I rolled my window down and sure enough still there so I told her to look again. This time she took good long look and she said they lookes like spotlights shining up from the groung which at the moment sounded legiet to me. It wasn&#39;t till we got halfway to Corry Pa that I started to think otherwise simply because we had traveled nearly 12 miles and the lights where still in the exact same spots as they were and that if the lights were shining up from the ground we wouldn&#39;t of seen them cause there were no clouds for them to reflect of from. By this time I had my step farther stop the car so I could get out and look. My mom got out with me and we stood there for awhile watching the lights move around in the same square formation. Just as we got ready to go on our way a fifth light appeared for a short time afterwards they all just vanished.<n>

About 2 miles before New Holland, we noticed an object hoving approximately 150 yards up in the sky.  It wad 3 lights that formed and equilateral triangle on the bottom plane.  We turned north off of Route 10 onto a rural county road.  I stopped the car and the 3 of us exited the car to observe the object.  Just as we exited, the object slowly &#34;floated&#34; towards us at a slow pace.  It made no noise, which was intriguing.  The object stopped roughly above us (at the same estimated height of 150 yards).  We watched the object for approximately 10 minutes, and then it just &#34;floated&#34; away just as it had approached.<n>

It was dusk. As we neared afield, I saw a large saucer, grey with alarge white highly luminescent dome on top.There were what appeared to be portholes or windows around it. My sister was not paying attention as we sped past it but I started yelling &#39;Oh my God! Look over the trees! Seeit? See it?&#39; She said she saw a very bright object in the sky but could not quite make itout. By the time she looked up it was pretty much obscured. I turned the car around as soon as I hada chance to get another look, but it was no longer there.I have also seen instances of bizarre lights in the sky which appear to be above the clouds, and they make really odd formations. At first I thought they were searchlights that stores and discos usesometime, but the stream of light coming down from the sky that usually tells youthese are earth-based lights were notpresent. The formations these lights created could not have been made by aircraft.There were usually four to five lights.At some point, they would all convert together to create a single point of light and thensplit up again. I saw these on numerous occaisions when heading east on Route 2 nearConcord, MA, going toward Boston last year.On one occaision, my sister Paula also saw these.It is interesting to note, I guess, that Hanscom AFB is off Route 2 (actually, it&#39;s on2A), in Bedford, MA, which is just north ofConcord. I believe Dover AFB in NH is closeby as well.What took me so long to report these incidents? I did not know who to go to. I did not want to contact Hanscom for fear ofridicule. Thank you for your time, and if you wish, you may call me evenings (eastern time)<n>

It was late September, I think, around 8 PM, and the starless sky was pitch black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove down the highway, I looked up and noticed two lights, two lit up objects, travelling across the sky, one following the other.  They showed up in the upper half of my windshield, near the top, and appeared to be moving eastward at a steady clip.  The objects must have been a considerable distance away yet appeared like two quite visible lights separated by three or four &#39;object&#39; lengths.  Since it was rather cold, my car windows were up and I heard no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, a tremendous explosion engulfed the front object, and it appeared to be desintegrating in a burst of flames.  The whole surrounding sky had lit up.  I was shaken by the spectacle because, subconsciously, I wanted to believe that the two objects were passenger planes, and here--one was desintegrating right in front of my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe I slowed down, checked my driving, and then, the next moment, I saw only one object remaining, still travelling East.  There were no falling aflame parts of the structure.  One moment there was an object in the sky, the next--there was an explosion, and then the object was gone from the sky, as if rubbed out by a pencil eraser.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I did not hear the explosion, the objects were too far away anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived home around midnight.  I asked my parents if there were any news about an airplane explosion/accident.  There were none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, I read the newspapers and watched the TV News and heard nothing about the explosion I had witnessed the previous evening.  I believe I had called one of the local news agencies, but without results.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And yet, if I had witnessed the explosion, someone else must have seen it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never heard or seen a word about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
