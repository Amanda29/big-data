11/26/77 14:00|Canandaigua|NY|Triangle|1 to 2 hours|Triangular craft watching Bristol Mountain Ski Resort|6/10/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75720.html|2|ndxe197711| Triangular craft watching Bristol Mountain Ski Resort<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting is going back some years now, but I can remember the precise weekend in which this UFO was seen by 5 people at the same time, just like it was yesterday.  I have created a drawing of what I remember the craft looking like which I  included with this report made on Microsoft paint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 1977 at Bristol Mountain Ski Resort in Bristol Valley , Canandaigua, New York, the weekend that followed  Thanksgiving  Day which was November 24th, 1977.  Bristol Mountain ski resort was teaming with activity for the holiday weekend, that’s when we really used to get snow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I worked in the snack bar on the bottom floor of the Ski Lodge, along with 4 other people present that day.  We cooked Hamburg’s,  hotdogs, fries and such for customers visiting the ski resort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only window’s in the snack bar area were a row of windows located higher up on the wall just below the ceiling, facing the Mountain across the street from Bristol Mountain ski resort.  These are the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, in the finger lakes region.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had been a busy day this Saturday November 26th, 1977.  Lunch hour was packed.  Finally the business dropped of for the snack bar and we were all just goofing around and talking, when one of the guys I worked with yelled out,  &#34;Hey , look at this thing across street above the Mountain!&#34;  So we all looked out the window’s to see what he was making the big deal about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a perfect view of this object above the tree line of the Mountain across the street.  At first you had a hard time seeing it because it was a beautiful sun filled winter day with a dazzling blue sky.  It was like a bright orange yellow glowing severe triangular craft, with like a boomerang back to the triangle, but the craft had a severe point to the front of the triangle like to a sharp point and the back although it had a boomerang shape was not a wide type.  It looked like the shape of a paper air plain you made in school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just  sitting still over the Mountain top and was pointed right at Bristol Mt. Resort.  Like it was observing all the activity going on there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for sometime until we started getting busy again, and after that point I don’t remember if it just left or what?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years I have told this account to different people at parties and such and always can remember it with clarity.  I was completely blown away while surfing the internet, when I discovered that these triangular crafts have been seen by many people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was about 22:30 in the evening, very clear and cool (maybe 45 degrees F)outside.  We were traveling about 75mph, without any other vehicles around.  I was driving the vehicle and out of nowhere there appeared this UFO on the drivers side of the car.  It was about 100 to 150 feet above the ground moving in the southern direction with us at the same rate of speed.  The only visable feature of this UFO was a band of lights moving in the counterclockwise direction.  The lights reminded me of a track used on heavy equipment like a bulldozer track.  The individual foot pads (like on a track) were lite very bright (kinda white/yellow color) just like the color of a light bulb.  There was even spaces between each light just like the spaces between the pads on a bulldozer track.  The rate of movement on the lights was about 50 t! o 60 RPM.  As I stated before we could not see any shape at all besides these lights, nothing.  The size of this object was about 10 times the size of our vehicle (1977 Monty Carlo).  The UFO stayed with us for 1 to 2 minutes and disappeared as quickly as it appeared.  We did not see it arrive or leave, it just appeared and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Got out of car because rear seat passenger needed to relieve himself.  I stood in road and looked at stars but saw none in an area over the horse pasture on East side of road.  Looked closer and noticed that the blackness had a triangular shape but there was no light at that time.  Absolutely nothing, like the blackness of a deep cave.  There was no sound but the inside of my chest seemed to notice some kind of reverberation that was almost like minute vacuum with some kind of humming feeling.  It looked to be about 500 to 100 feet over the pasture but it was very hard to tell because it would depend on how large it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A light came on to the north side at the tip of the triangle that had the flattened edge.  The light seemed to get brighter until you could see it&#39;s beam for at least a mile.  The object barely moved forward to the north and almost in a logrhymithic rate continued to speed up to the north.  We watched it move about a mile and followed it to the T in the road where it turned left toward Tulsa and you could see a glow that seemed to envelope the entire object and it kept climbing to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had to stop near the Grand View school and watched it for what seemed about twenty to fifty miles (about two minutes)until we could no longer see the glow.  Not exactly sure of the date but the time of day is very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do believe it was November of 1977 because it was close to Thanksgiving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

11/17/77 19:00|Bensalem|PA|Sphere|5 minutes|The craft hovered approx. 15 ft. above my station wagon.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97089.html|7|ndxe197711| The craft hovered approx. 15 ft. above my station wagon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> November 17, 1977 walked out my apartment with three daughters (13, 11, 6).  Oldest daughter directed me to orange object in the sky.  It looked like a Chinese orange lanterns.  We drove up I95 a short distance to see other daughter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the way back down I95 (7:30 pm) same daughter directed me to look out her window, front passenger window, and we saw the orange thing again.  It appeared to follow us all the way up I95.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned into our apartment complex it began drizzling and same daughter pointed ahead at our apartment.  There above my apartment sat an object about 30 ft. above.  It looked like it had two high beams, but no light was cast forward, as in car headlights.  As it appeared to approach us, neither of us were afraid.  All of a sudden it was right in front of my windshield although we did not see it travel toward us.  It got to my car in about two seconds, although we did not see it advancing.  It had three lights on the bottom.  Now I can’t remember exactly which lights were where, but there were two same colored lights, one in the front and one in the back under the vehicle.  There was also a light in the center of it.  It was two red lights and one green, or two green and one red.  Don’t remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She never ever showed an interest in UFOs.  She yelled at me to stop the car and I did.  She jumped out of the car and onto my hood.  I was hanging out the left door looking up.  Above me was a circular metal craft, with a definite top and bottom, but no seam to separate them.  It was the length of my station wagon. I looked for widows, a door, an opening, screws and anything to figure what held the top and the bottom together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed my station wagon, it very slowly skimmed at about 3-4 miles an hour (guessing).  It rocked back and forth as it went over us.  It had a sound much like the fan in a bathroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back in the car first yelling for my daughter to get back in the car, which she did.  When she shut her door she said, “Wow, Mom, did you see that thing take off?”  I said, No, I got back in the car before you.”  She told me it took off like a jet into the air and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once home a friend told me to call the nearest base (name not given here).  I asked for the Officer In Charge and reported my sighting.  He thanked me and said he may get back to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now my daughter came out of the shower and asked me about marks on her stomach.  I had never known about Betty’s  Hill’s secret, so I couldn’t connect it.  My daughter had three fresh needle marks below her naval.  We could still see fresh blood.  She said she didn’t get her skin caught in her zipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About four hours later the Officer in Charge called me back.  He confirmed that I had seen a UFO because it was now being sighted over another state (can’t remember which one), but it was at least four states to the west of us.  He asked me if I would talk to two agents on Sunday and I agreed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two men came and told me they were from UFORIC.  I believed them.  I remember the oldest man’s full name and that he said he lived in New Jersey. The other man I only remember his first name and he said he lived in South Philadelphia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took years for me to ask myself where they got the photographs of all those UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had two thick albums with them full of UFO pictures.  Some of the pictures were drawn by various people, but most of them were actual photographs.  We could not identify the UFO we saw but agreed it was the top of one of them and the bottom of another.  They asked us to separate and draw the UFO.   They were almost the same except my daughter had drawn some kind of antenna on hers.  I argued that there was none and one of the men said, she saw it on the opposite side, that’s why you didn’t see it.  I don’t remember if we told him about the needle marks because I had not yet connected them to the sighting.  Years later my daughter said to me, “I’m sorry Mom for telling you all this time that I remember the UFO, but I really don’t remember it at all.  She wanted to pretend she saw it because I saw it and one of my daughters in the back seat saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was years later I learned of the one thing Betty Hill never told anyone, because when people told her they were abducted or saw a UFO, most didn’t mention any markings and that’s how she knew if it was true or not.  I was stunned to hear this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter died on May27, 2004.  My daughters and I were with her as she drifted into a coma.  She said four last things.  I will only tell you the pertinent one.  She said “Tell mommy, the aliens did this to me.” Personally, I don’t think she meant her illness.  Now I am guessing as she was dying, memories were passing before her and she remembered our sighting.  I tried to find UFORIC and there was no such organization.  But I did find that name in Canada.  I believe these men were from the government.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been plagued with situations for years.  They started about 1963 up until 1972.  I was scared to death of my bedroom door.  I knew there were some “things” at my bedside.  I always saw the door start to open, but never saw who entered.  Usually, there was one at the bottom of my bed, one at the top of my bed and one mid-center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My youngest daughter when she was about thirteen used to feel something dragging her off her bed.  She remembers clutching the shag rug, holding it tight, knowing “they” were trying to get her out the window.  She never saw “them” and doesn’t remember if they got her out the window or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you so much for this opportunity to tell the whole story.  I will furnish the men’s names, where I lived and my daughter’s name if you request them.<n>

I was stoking a small fire when I heard a sound like air rushing.  I did&#39;t think much of this initially because I was about a mile and a-half from the power plant and they release steam from time to time and it sounded like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, unusually, this time it was getting louder then louder until I realized something was very wrong, it seemed to be coming from all around me out of the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked all around me but could only see a few trees dimly lit by the small fire, then I looked up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the leaves were off of the trees and I could clearly see a circular craft drifting right above me over the tree tops in a Northerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be about a hundred feet above the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a dome structure on the bottom with a  cross structure as if for support with four green lights around the dome&#39;s edge.  There were alternating white and red lights around the outer edge of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may have had a slight glow to it. The tree tops did&#39;nt move and it glided along then started to curve around to the West and went over a nearby gravel pit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran through the woods trying not to run into trees or trip in the dark.  I crossed a couple fields and fence lines until I came to the edge of the gravel pit where I could look down over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did&#39;nt see the craft and don&#39;t know where it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have read that UFO activity increases during years of close passes of Earth and Mars and this was one of those years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This was in Sidney, MT (pop - 3000 at the time). It was 9:00 at night when I and my Brother were walking to the grocery store to get candy for my upcoming birthday party. As we were walking down the street we stopped and noticed 3 lights above us. At first we thought it was a prank of some kind but then we both suddenly got a strange (but exciteing) feeling. We did not see the body of this craft...only the lights. They were blue, red and green - 3 of them. They were in the shape of a saucer dish. And I remember the lights seemed to &#39;jiggle&#39; a little (vibrating with no set rhythm). There was no sound. It was like this thing was on mute. As we were looking at this thing, a 4-wheel drive truck came tearing around the corner and skidded up to a stop right beside us...the driver leaned out his window and said; &#34;did you see that...I&#39;ve been following it for 1/2 an hour!&#34;. And we just pointed upward. Anyway, this thing suddenly disappeared and we scanned the sky and saw it off in a distance at the other end of town. It disappeared again and immediately re-appeared at the other side of town. The only other thing I remember is that it felt like this thing was right above the telephone poles. I still remember thinking that I could have thrown up a rock and hit it if I wanted too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really surprised us was the next day when there was an article in the local newspaper stating that there were several sightings of a UFO reported to the police station. I need to go back and see if I can retrieve that article somehow (if its possible). I&#39;ve never spoken of this experience (only to a few people).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in Sidney, Montana (November 1977 - early evening - dark out)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

11/15/77 01:00|Newburgh|NY|Disk|10 Minutes|Stationary UFO in Newburgh Upstate New York 1975.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date corrected to November 15, 1977.  PD))|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58896.html|10|ndxe197711| Stationary UFO in Newburgh Upstate New York 1975<n> <n><n> <n><n> My experience took place in Newburgh--Upstate, NY (near the villas)--on November (don’t remember the day) of 1975.  I was staying at my aunt and uncle’s home for a few months.  I don’t remember the exact address, but know it was near West Point Academy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night I went to see a movie with a friend.  The night was very clear, but extremely cold.  On our way back to the house (between 11:30-2:00 AM) we noticed a star-like round shaped object in the sky with a long red glow under.  We thought it was a star because the thing was not moving and was far away. After a few minutes, we realized that we were approaching the object, and that it was actually in our atmosphere, stationed in mid air.  The closer we were getting to the area, the less we could see the red glow, but the object remained lit (white light), and in the same place throughout the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend became very agitated and began to drive very fast as we got closer.  I don’t know how big this thing was, or how many feet high it was from the ground, but I do recall that the size was as big as a quarter (coin) from where we were.  It was a disk-shaped craft, but not flat. The top was round and all the bright white light was coming from there.  I rolled down the window and exposed my head out of the window to look up. The only sound we heard came from my friend’s car engine, and not from the craft. I saw the round shape of the machine, and inside the circle it had a frame-like in the shape of an octagon.  I don’t remember if the octagon was protruded, but do remember very well that inside the octagon were several tiny lights (yellow and some red) blinking very slowly.  I remember shouting at my friend to stop the car, and to please look at the craft, but he began to yell at me to get back in the car. He was driving very fast, and I pulled myself back inside the car only because my face was hurting from the cold air.  I was screaming from excitement and nerves, and could not believe that we saw the most incredible flying machine.  It was right up there, stationed in mid air, and we were so lucky to have had the opportunity to see something like that.  I remember being so mad at Michael for rushing away, but after few years realized that even though he was thirty years old at the time, he was dead scared and wanted to get away as fast as he could. I don’t know if that UFO was man-made or extraterrestrial, but I have never seen anything like it in my whole life.  The duration of the entire sighting was about ten minutes, and the only reason why we lost sight of the craft was because we drove away.  The UFO never moved.  I must say that aside from seeing the craft, we didn’t experience any other anomalies such as: electronic problems with the car; lost of time, etc…<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I told my family what happened the night before, but my friend refused to talk about the subject.  I wanted to tell everyone about my experience, but decided not to do it since my family discouraged me from saying anything; stating that since I was nineteen years old I would probably be treated like a crazy person, or a charlatan trying to get attention.  I limited myself to discuss the subject only with my family and two other closed friends.  I have never again seen another UFO, and to tell you the truth I don’t need to because what I saw was as real as the computer I have in front of me right now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides the fact that I am older and more comfortable talking about UFOs, the reason why I am reporting this sighting for the first time in twenty-seven years is that I really would like to find out if other people in Upstate NY, or any other place, have reported stationary UFO sightings with similar descriptions of the craft.  I have visited several websites on the subject, but haven’t contacted anyone until now.   Another reason I have to share my experience with you is that I am overwhelmed by the amount of information disclosed from many reputable and honest people throughout the years.  It is definitely a fact that the media has been used, by those in power, as a tool for social control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

The information on the original report is correct except the year.  I reported that the UFO sighting occurred in 1975, but it was in 1977.  I just came across an article about Freddie Prince (Sr.), who died in 1977, and remembered watching the news with my aunt and uncle in Newburgh.   So, the year I was living in Newburgh was 1977 and not 1975.  I apologize for the inconvenience, and would greatly appreciate if someone could make the correction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget this great experience, and continue searching for people who may have seen the same machine we saw stationed in mid air with an octagonal thick frame in the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

As I was walking I looked up in the sky. (for no apparent reason)  I was looking at all the stars in the sky on this clear night when I saw something that has puzzled me for almost 30 years. I glared at an object that was approx: 500 feet higher than the large oak trees that it had hovered and traveled and  past from the south. This object was round in shape with lights that wrapped around it. I would have to say the size of this object was as big as Niagara Falls in diameter and height. As I stared in astonishment the object came to a complete stop over the tree&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All that was moving at this time was the lights on this thing and my shivering body. Although I was young I new I was witnessing something with a much greater intellect than ours. I new even at that age, airplanes make noise. Blimps don&#39;t fly in the dark, hot air balloons don&#39;t fly in the dark and weather balloons don&#39;t have florescent lights. This object was completely silent. This object also came to a complete stop directly over me for about 2 minutes then flew over the QEW heading over to the Burlington Skyway eventually out of my sight. I went home shortly after to tell my family of this encounter and was disappointed that no-one believed me. The next day at school (BELL CARIN)I told a couple of class mates of my encounter and to my relief my friend had said he saw the same thing while he was sitting in his tree fort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I often wonder about that night and have thought about undergoing hypnosis to narrow down the exact date and time so I can go to the Hamilton to see if there was other reports of this sighting. I know there has to be other witnesses from the vehicles on the highway that would have seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Silent and hangs up there without falling. The two of us got out of vehicle on Canal Road directly underneath craft and view with binoculars, but craft not that far up any way. Gray, dome on top, red blinker at one &#34;end&#34;, green blinker at other &#34;end&#34;, and white blinker light goes slowly all around ship. When tipped back, we see underneath 3 sets of dual, bright white banks of light going on and off in sequence. Ship starts to move and glides over town. Camera has no film. We follow and stop car on steel deck bridge and see same craft land in open field, about 400 yards out. Passing cars would not stop as we wanted more witnesses. Started to rain and we went home. Did not see any statements in local paper during week. Years later, I figured out why it stopped and turned away from flight path . There was in visual distance, a small air field with private small airplanes taking off, circling and landing. I guess the &#34;pilots&#34; didn&#39;t want to be seen.
