I would visit at my grandmothers house. she lived in north hollywood . I was playing in the front yard when a ball like object slowly came down from the sky. it was the size of a baseball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on the grass when i looked up above the parking lot across the street in front of my grandmother&#39;s house. in the sky was a dot. i could barely see it . it caught my attention. as I sat there it came a little closer. I still could not see it clearly.I went inside for lunch. I came back out and it was still there about 75 to 90 feet away. I sat on the driveway and stared at it. it was neat.there it stayed all day.the next day I looked up and was looking for it interested and curious.it came back and got closer. the object came up to me only 2 feet from me.  I tried to touch it but I would move just out of my reach.it stayed all week and left as it arived.it was clear yet solid it would be constantly changing its surface like clouds and solids interfacing it reacted to me and communicated with me. it was like unconditional love. it taught me and gave me great intellegence and insight.

5/7/58 10:00|North Hollywood|CA|Circle|5days|A visit by a ufo object by a young child in 1958|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56668.html|3|ndxe195805| A visit by a ufo object by a young child in 1958<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have told of My experience with an outside our realm of understanding space craft or object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was four years old and played in my grand mothers yard, the front by myself, Bored with my trucks and cars I would look around at the sky  to see what I could see.  One day I saw a tiny speck in the distance floating, like the end of a pencil so small, It was above some power lines across the street in the distance. I was curious but well, I was only four. I went inside and came back outside the next day to play. Curious I looked up to find the spot had gotten closer in the same location. no detail  just closer. I got very excited, not sure why. Maybee having something to look at starred at the thing, size of a base ball above the power lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next day I was so excited to see the thing , if It was there? And yes getting even  closer. I sat for hours gazing at the object. It got closer to me and I could see some detail. It was round like a little earth. Solid but translucent at the same time. It was constantly moving the outside  layers as  to reach to  change and react to the world. It was communicating but not in words. In a visual mindset. I wish i could explain. I fell in love with the object and could not get enough. It came so close to me that I could almost jump and touch it but would move just out of my reach. The next three days it started moving back further away and finally left. Two questions is how can a four year create  something he has never seen? Why  did  I have such a great connection with this object? I honestly believe that there is something beyond our understanding.<n>
5/5/58 20:00|Palmer Park|MD|Sphere|15-20 min.|I saw a white spherical light zig zaging across the sky leaving a plasma trail at unthinkable speed.|4/22/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28420.html|4|ndxe195805| I saw a white spherical light zig zaging across the sky leaving a plasma trail at unthinkable speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurence happened in 1958 or 59 when I was about 6 years old,I am now 51.  I havn&#39;t told this to anyone but close family.  It was getting dark as I was walking home from the park when I saw a light shooting up from the horizon in the eastern sky.  It was traveling at unthinkable speed zig zaging making right angle turns and reversals.  As it came closer to my position, I could see it giving off a trial of light not like a contrail but more like neon.I stood and watched as it came in my direction.  It was a sphere shaped white glowing ball.  I was standing next to the electric power substation at this time when it came overhead and stopped dead in the now dark blue sky.  It only took a few maybe 30 seconds for it to come from as far away in the horizon to directly overhead.  It was radiating a halo of sparkling blue/white light.I starred up at it for maybe 5 mins. and it suddenly shot straight up and dissapeared into the clear night sky faster than anything I had ever see then or now accept for the speed of a meteor witch could be comprable.  I ran home and told my dad who contacted nearby Andrews AFB.  They reported no radar activity and no missle firings from any nearby sites ie. Goddard spaceflight or Nike missle site in Davdsonville.  After all these years it still seems like yesterday.  I haven&#39;t seen anything like it since then accept for a video clip a few years ago on the history channel.  I jumped out of my chair.It was exactly what I saw.I wish I could find that video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
