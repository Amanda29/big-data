I watched them and thought there were an awful lot of planes out that night.  Then I noticed that two of the red lights seem to stay in the same spot and were not moving.  I watched them for a while and noticed that they seem to be pulsing.  It appeared to have several little red lights pulsing around a larger red light in the middle that did not pulse but stayed constant.  I got my husband out of bed and told him he should get up and look at these strange red lights in the sky.  He looked at them with binoculars but to me I could see them better with a naked eye.  We watched for a while and noticed they were getting dimmer they seemed to be going further out in the sky they did not go north or south just shot straight back into the night sky.  They got dimmer and dimmer.  I looked out later that night and they were gone sometime after midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  All reports of the two sightings (23:15 hrs., 30SE05, and 01:10 hrs., 01OC05) from Illinois will be passed along to Dr. Mark Rodighier, Director of the CENTER FOR UFO STUDIES, Chicago, as well as to Mr. Dave Marler, State Director of the MUTUAL UFO NETWORK for the State of Illinois, who will pass them along to his Field Investigators in the Chicago area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We would be most grateful if witnesses to this event would please submit a detailed report of their sighting, using the ONLINE REPORT FORM on our website, and we will pass those reports along to those two investigators above.

As we left we sat on the cars facing the store, just figureing out where to go when my friend asked if it was just her or where these lights moving. Sure enough 2 red lights above the store where moving. We where faceing the store and lookin in a south west postion and lookin as if a cellular tower becasue they where vertical. They then moved and eventually, about 5 to 10 minuates floated above us. The distance between them seemed to vary as they moved on. Very slowly seemed to expand and contract but not very noticable. I noticed they continued in a northwestern direction. The whole thing lasted around 15-20 minatues until we left. However as we left the lights where traveling in that northwestern postion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  All reports of the two sightings (23:15 hrs., 30SE05, and 01:10 hrs., 01OC05) from Illinois will be passed along to Dr. Mark Rodighier, Director of the CENTER FOR UFO STUDIES, Chicago, as well as to Mr. Dave Marler, State Director of the MUTUAL UFO NETWORK for the State of Illinois, who will pass them along to his Field Investigators in the Chicago area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We would be most grateful if witnesses to this event would please submit a detailed report of their sighting, using the ONLINE REPORT FORM on our website, and we will pass those reports along to those two investigators above.

I went outside to call a friend and noticed the three red lights.  They were definatley way to high to be a helo, and too quiet and too still to be an aircraft (a jet turbine requires far too much inlet pressure, and these objects were moving relatively slow, too slow to power a jet turbine).  While I first started watching the lights, I noticed an airplane flying through the area, I first thought the lights would react to the plane, but they just kept moving very slowly.  The airplane flew over me in about thirty seconds, the 3 lights remained.  I got my friends outside of the bar to see them.  They slowly circled each other, 3 red glowing balls, slowly getting brighter, then dimming themselves out.  They had moved from a staggered line formation (when I first saw them) to a broken triangle formation.  After my friends were watching for about fifteen minutes, the top one on the triangle did its normal, bright then dim out routine, but after it dimmed it never returned.  The remaining two lights moved very slowly around each other.  After I had seen them we were deductively going through possibilities of why they were getting dim and brighter.  My one friend suggested cloud cover, but the sky was completely clear.  My parents had contacted me via my cell phone, and informed me they we watching the lights as well.  Now from where I was standing, they looked very far in the distance and to the north.  My father had informed me that they were very close over the golf course next to our house (george w dunne. forest preserve course/yankee woods) and insisted that they were withing the atmosphere, therefore ruling out a possibility of satellites.  I went back into the pub after watching the lights for close to an hour with my friends.  When we all were leaving the pub, they were no longer in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  All reports of the two sightings (23:15 hrs., 30SE05, and 01:10 hrs., 01OC05) from Illinois will be passed along to Dr. Mark Rodighier, Director of the CENTER FOR UFO STUDIES, Chicago, as well as to Mr. Dave Marler, State Director of the MUTUAL UFO NETWORK for the State of Illinois, who will pass them along to his Field Investigators in the Chicago area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We would be most grateful if witnesses to this event would please submit a detailed report of their sighting, using the ONLINE REPORT FORM on our website, and we will pass those reports along to those two investigators above.

A few of us noticed a very faint 3rd red light every now and then.  The lights were more or less stationary but when they did move, the drifted from our right to left.  The lights would flicker, but not is any sort of routine.  The two lights were on an appx 45 degree angle from each other.  The third light that a few of us saw was on an opposite 45 degree angle, thus causing the 3 lights to form a triangle.  After seeing the pictures from the Halloween incident last year, I would say these are the same lights.  After about 5 minutes, 1 light seemd to just disappear then about 30 seconds later, the second light took off to the east in a rather high rate of speed.  To us, it appeared that the lights were too high to be helicopters and we are certain the were not airplanes because they were stationary for most of the time.  We did not hear any sound, but we were not able to tell exactly how far away the lights were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The conditions that evening were a little chilly but the sky was free of clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us were witnees to the event last October but we did hear about it in the papers and other family memebrs did witness it.

I video taped only about 2.5 minutes as I had to go into the house after watching them with neighbors, family and friends, for about 4-5 minutes, find my camera, a usable tape, etc. Each one went from about 50 degrees in the westerly sky to about 110 degrees from horizontal in the eastern sky. One left by almost instantaneously shooting about 5 to 7 degees across the sky the other appeared to go straight up quickly getting smaller quickly and vanishing in an upward fashion. I saw the other 3 objects at 1:10 am on 10/1/05 also and have extensive non-digital video tape on them,( I witnessed a low very large, bright Ufo last November on a cold moonless evening in the northwestern sky for 2 minutes in 2004.

9/30/05 23:15|Oak Forest|IL|Light|30minutes|2 Bright Red lights above my house, then gain altitude before heading east very slowly|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46845.html|17|ndxe200509| 2 Bright Red lights above my house, then gain altitude before heading east very slowly<n> <n><n> <n><n> Arriving home and parking my car in the driveway, I noticed two bright RED lights almost above my Home. My Son who arrived at the same time also saw these lights. There movement was extremely slow. Thought they might be Hot air balloons, but heard no Noise that might be produced by a propane burner. My son called a meterological friend in Dekalb, Ill. some 45 miles away and he reported to us seeing only one red light to the eastnortheast (approx 45degrees)from his viewing area.  The two lights from first observation were seperated by 15 degrees from my vantage point and did not see any other lights to the north, although I did not scan the complete sky because of buildings and trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we observed for 5 minutes, these lights appeared to be dropping down. Not knowing what they were, I alerted other family members to get out of the house in case of a crash. As the rest of the family came out, we all observed for another ten minutes as these lights seem to be gaining altitude. At this point the lights were seperated by 5 degrees. My older Son went into the house and got his digital camcorder and started to video this event. As we continued to watch, I observerd a commercial aircraft fly East(90degrees) exactly between and above these lights. Estimate height of aircraft about 3500 feet. I did hear the faint jet noise from this plane and can only assume it was preparing for final approach to O&#39;Hara using the Lake Michigan corridor. The surface wind was 5 mph from the southwest. We continued to observe the Red Lights for another 15-20 minutes and then disappeard to the east. Last sighting the two Red Lights were about 30 degrees apart before they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1:15 AM, my son alerted me and said that he now sees three Red Lights coming from the Southwest heading toward our house again. This observation was from his bedroom window and they were seperated by 10 - 15 degrees apart. We again went outside and watched from our backyard (west side of the house). My son again videotaped these lights. They were NOT in a triangle as some later reported. They seemed to be in a straight line. After about 7 minutes or so, the Red lights changed course and proceeded onto the east (90 degrees). They did not come over our house as the earlier sighting. AS we watched, the middle Red light overtook the first one and as it was doing that, both Red lights were woobling. It was only a few moments were we obsevered both lights coming together as one.

I saw the previous red lights reported to nuforc on october 31st 2004, so I am always looking in the sky now for things like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving south bound on 80th avenue and 167th street when I noticed the red light in the sky moving north east. I was driving my automobile so I could not sit and stare at it as much as I would ahve liekd to. Allthough as I was sitting at the stop light of 80th avenue and 167th street the red light movered directly over me and my automobile. It was over my head for about ten seconds, steadily moving, and making no sounds. i continued to deliver my pizza to the hotel I was driving to. I continued to stare every 1 seconds from the red light in the sky back to driving, because I wanted to see it, but had to hurry. I entered the hotel, delivered my pizza, and exited the hotel in a hurry to continue to watch it as I was then done with work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came out of the hotel, a second red light apeared. the were moving at differant speeds, or differant directions because when I first saw the second red light it was about a 12 inches apart when looking in the sky. After a few minutes they lined up over each other, about 8 inches apart from each other. I raced home to show my girlfriend. She was home and we looked at them together from our home in tinley park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I got home the red lights were far east of tinley park, but still very visable. We watched them move farther and fartehr away from us for about ten minutes before they ultimately burnt out in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the whole insident was about 30 minutes I would say. I would like to add again that me, my mother, my brother saw the last 3 red lights on october 31st of 2004 reported by many others to nuforc as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother is a working class 9 - 5 tax paying citizen, my brother is a college graduate working in the news business, I am a attending college student, and my Girlfriend is an attending college student. We are all very normal poeple, no history of any psychotic behavior or any visits with phsyciatrist. none of us have ever seen any thing like these red lights before in our lifes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only differances with these red lights and the ones from october 31st last year, is there was only 2 this time, and these seemed smaller to me in my memory, and last these didnt move around as much as last years did. last years seemed like they formed flight patterns, as these kinda just floated over our heads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I ever see these again i&#39;m going to use my video camera on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  All reports of the two sightings (23:15 hrs., 30SE05, and 01:10 hrs., 01OC05) from Illinois will be passed along to Dr. Mark Rodighier, Director of the CENTER FOR UFO STUDIES, Chicago, as well as to Mr. Dave Marler, State Director of the MUTUAL UFO NETWORK for the State of Illinois, who will pass them along to his Field Investigators in the Chicago area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We would be most grateful if witnesses to this event would please submit a detailed report of their sighting, using the ONLINE REPORT FORM on our website, and we will pass those reports along to those two investigators above.

To me, they looked almost exactly like stars, only bright red.

I saw what looked like a star moving across the sky about as fast as you&#39;d see an airplane moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept staring at it because I did feel a bit odd about the situation.  Something was telling me that it wasn&#39;t an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved slowly, it looked as though it was coming closer, or becoming larger.  I knew this because at first I could not tell what shape it was, but as it was getting closer/getting larger, I saw that it was a cigar shape.  I couldn&#39;t tell if it had a top.  It also had red and white lights.  Here I saw the sequence of lights like this:  1   2   3   4   5  5 was a red light.  It was flash, then 4,3,2,1 would flash one after the other.  Not at the same time, but in order from 5 to 1.  Left to right, then start over from left to right again.  I couldn&#39;t tell exactly how many lights it had, this is just a description.  It only had one red light though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO never got any closer than how high a normal airplane would get.  After about 3-4 mintues--just enough time for me to process what I was looking at, it just flew off and left a tail like a shooting star would.  It looked at though the craft went up and out, not across when it took off.  It tail of light had a sense of depth, not just a flat line across the sky.  It faded into space is how I can describe it.<n>

Our point of orientation was just above and just to the right of a large spruce tree.  Because it was so bright, we were observing it and trying to determine if it was a  star or a planet.  As we watched, it moved slowly up, then left, then right, and back down - but not as low as it had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all amazed and watched intently for several minutes.  It moved almost continuously, but not very much at one time.  The pattern was never exact but always up and down, back and forth.  It reminded me of a balloon, with some type of brilliant light attached, tethered to the ground and swaying in the breeze.  However, in general, it continued to gain altitude and move to the right.  We watched it for nearly an hour and finally gave up trying to figure out what it was.  I did not think too much more about it until the following night (Saturday) around 8 PM.  I thought about it as we sat around the camp fire and asked my children if they had seen yet that night.  As we all looked in the direction we had seen it the previous night, sure enough, there it was again.  Some differences this time.  It appeared to be farther away than the previous night and much lower on the horizon.  It was much further to the left of the same spruce tree than the previous night.  Also, instead of a brilliant white light, it had more of an orange cast to it.  The movement was excactly as the previous night.  It looked as though it was swaying in the breeze but steadily moved higher and to the right.  This may have been some man made object that I am not familiar with and there may be a perfectly logically explanation; but I sure can&#39;t come up with anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet?

No paranormal or abnormal phenomenom was/were associatated with the event. The light emitted was nothing spectacular, no colors, no dimming, a very pale white light.

I know it wasn&#39;t airplane, because airplane don&#39;t flashes their light at day light... Then i observed very carefully it was also ejecting some kind of black smoke thing, and that smoke thing was very dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 2 minutes later, UFO disappeared.  I had experience, i checked her trajectory, suddenly UFO appeared again, this time UFO ejecting light flares, and light was off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> when i looked carefully, it was huge disk and colored silver.... i was surprised and happy...after 2 minuts later UFO starts her light on and off again... then UFO accelerated suddenly fast, like instantenous, smth... then it disappeared very very fast........... so , i decided to aprove my sight, i called to the local airport for ask about any plane that currently landing, they say NO, then i called to the military (RADAR control tower) they also said NO !!!! it was trully UFO<n>

The times are different but with such a coincidence having occurred, I thought it worth mentioning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was part of a large group of amateur astronomers at a star gazing event when several people yelled out to look at the constellation Cassiopeia which was at approx. 45-50 degrees or so to the northeast at about 1920 hrs. or so.  I&#39;m not sure of the exact time but it was not quite dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I, along with several others observed (2) very bright white lights traveling through Cassiopeia in a north/northeasterly direction.  The lights were about 2 fingerwidths apart with an outstretched arm and of a magnitude of approx. -2 to -3.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One light was behind the other. They shined for no longer than 8 seconds or so then faded out quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Discussion afterwards varied but several, including myself believe we saw 2 Iridium flares very close together which would be very unusual or a rocket launch/seperation of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location of this sighting in relation to the Orland Park/Tinley Park sighting which occurred later on this same date is of concern because those two towns are only approx. 25-30 miles north of the location we observed the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received many reports of these two satellites, although we are not able to identify them.  We wonder whether they might somehow be related to the &#34;triplet&#34; of satellites, which, from time to time, are reported to our Center, and which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy&#39;s &#34;NOSS&#34; satellite program.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We suspect that the lights, given that they apparently had an easterly component to their groundtrack, and that they faded in the eastern sky, almost certainly were satellites.  Just a guess, on our part.  PD))<n>

We are close to Travis Air Force Base and we always have planes around the area so I didn&#39;t think too much about the lights I was seeing.  There was what looked light a plane off to our right coming toward us but seemed  very low.  I said to the twins, look at that plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it started to pass over us we looked for the wings and the normal shape of a plane.  It flew over us, that was when we saw that there where no wings, it was round but a octagon shape with lights on each corner and as it passed over us it had a blue light in the middle of the craft.  It made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My granddaughter said was that a ufo?  We watched it keep going lower and it looked like it was going to land in a grove of trees.  I was driving but my grandson said that it looked like it just took off out of the trees.  The twins where very scared and did not want to talk about it untill we got to their Dads home.  We then compared what we had seen and we all saw the same shape and lights.  I have never seen anything like this before, the reason I am writing this is to see if anyone else on the road that night saw anything like we saw.<n>

My daughter looked into the southeast sky and asked me if I was seeing what she was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told her I was and we proceded to watch as the cigar shaped object danced across the sky.  The object was red and silver, no wings and no smoke.  It seemed to glide up and down.  There was no noise.  When it turned on its side it seemed to have disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it would appear out of no where.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted approximately 6 minutes.<n>
9/30/05 05:04|Farmington|UT|Rectangle|25 Seconds|Farmington Utah bright white light with blue in the middle in the shape of fixed wing aircraft flying Southwest to Northeast.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46882.html|58|ndxe200509| Farmington Utah bright white light with blue in the middle in the shape of fixed wing aircraft flying Southwest to Northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what looked like the shape of medium sized fixed wing aircraft. The light from the craft was very bright. There was bright white light on both sides. Like the light given off from an arc welder, but it was not obscure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very clear intense light.  In the center the object appeared to be bigger, as the light appeared to be in a cluster.  It was very clear and intense, but it was blue in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I picked the object up in the south southwest sky over Farmington.  It was traveling North Northeast towards the mountain.  I stepped away from my truck and followed the object over head where I saw the below view.  I could only see white light from the bottom.  Following from behind the object was a tail in the shape of a cone.  The large portion of the cone attached to the object and the point at the end.  The cone appeared to be whit light also, but it was not as intense as the light emmiting from the front of the object.  There did not appear to be any turbulance in the cone, like it was a jet engine. The object made no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> speculate that it was approximatly 100 to 150 feet over my head.  I lost the object as it went behind my home.  My first assumption was that it would crash into the mountain just to the north of my home. I stopped to listen for any sounds of impact, but heard none. When I was able to run throuh the whole scenario again when I came home from work, I realized that I should have been able to see the object come out from the roof on the house, as the path that the object was traveling would have brought it into view again.  I surmise that the object made a turn staight East while the house blocked my view and went up the canyon and over the mountain. The speed that the object was traveling was about the speed of a plane that was gliding without any propulsion.  This is the most facinating thing that I have ever seen. Is there any other sightings that match this event?<n>

It was earily Friday morning of the 30th about 4:55 A.M. cool and quiet outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up to my right into the night shy and seen 4 large white lights in the air.  As I looked closer I reallized that they made A triangle patten.  One in front, one to right side, one to left side and one at back that was in line with the front light.  There was no red or green lights flashing on the craft and it was not moving but was standing still in the air with no noise heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not very high in the sky the reason I say that is because the highest building here in Paducah Ky is the Jackson house 20 stories high It could have been more then that maybe slightly less.  It was not A helicopter as there was no loud pop or click of the main rotor and no green or red warning lights seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I am futher down the street I could begen to See The Shape Around The Lights.  The Craft was Flat black in color as in the latest stealth aircraft.  Yet it was not in the arrowhead shape of A F-117 nighthawk or the long triangle shape of the B-2 Spirit.  It`s dimensions I give as A rough guess were about 70 to 80 feet across in wing span and about 40 to 55 feet in length from the angle I got of the shape it seemed slihtly thick.  Yet it was arounded off at the three edges of the triangle shape.  At first I heard no noise but when I got to within one block I heard A very low rumble that seem to be behind and up futher then the craft itself was.  Then as it moved off to the southwest the noise I had heard was gone.  There was no noise what so ever as it moved off.<n>

Right when this object stopped the bottom right object took off to the east where i eventually lost site of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back at the 2 remaining objects only to see the top object slowly fade into the night sky as if it had risin straight up. the first moving object remained in position at least untill I entered my truck to start my route.  very freeky!!!!!!!!!<n>

It took approximately 10-seconds for this object to traverse the sky and disappear behind the treeline.  The color was black, but far darker than any shade of black we&#39;ve previously seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was almost &#34;void&#34; of reflectivity, so much so that it&#39;s shape was clearly dilineated against the night sky (which by comparison seemed to be dark gray).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds in the sky, only a modest wind of about 15 mph from the N.W., perpendicular to the motion of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the object could be characterized as &#34;cigar shaped&#34; it would have to have been a pretty fat cigar as it was almost a third of the way between a basic cylinder and a football in overall shape.  The front and back ends were brighter, with a steady but dim glow.  There was no apparent sound for this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it was out of sight, we scanned the sky and found an airplane as a point-of-comparison.  The plane was clearly and significantly different from the object we had just seen.  The plane&#39;s shape could be seen against the night sky, but it was lighter in color than the background.  The plane also had strobing beacons that flashed quite brilliantly.  The plane also took about 45 seconds to traverse an area across the sky that was roughly the same number of arc degrees that the ultra-black object crossed in only 10-seconds.<n>

These objects seemed round shaped and moved extremely fast. Some were in perfect formation in groups of 3 and 5. Two formations were a straight up lines in the sky, and one formation of 5 was a flat line pattern across the sky. Visibility was a very clear blue sky a few minutes after noon when the sightings occurred. The objects would often move in various directions and in unusual patterns before coming together in a line formation. Some flew at speeds like shooting stars across the sky until out of range from our sight. Another flew very fast and stopped suddenly. A few minutes latter another coworker came to our location. We told him what we had just seen, and he laughed at us. Approx. 30 seconds latter one object was very visible in the sky and I pointed it out to him. He saw it and replied something like &#34;wow what is that darn thing?&#34;.

The sky was clear and stars were clearly visible.  I noticed a bright, golden light in the sky.  The light did not blink.  It appeared at first to be a quickly moving satellite or other object moving in a linear fashion from the East Northeast to the South Southwest.  It was travelling at a relatively high rate of speed for its apparent height and traveled across approximately 66% across the sky when it stopped.  The light remained stationary for a period of a few minutes when another light, smaller and bright white appeared to make a short hook out of the golden light and streak off at an extremely high rate of speed to the Southwest. After a short time, the golden light appeared to travel in a dithering mode which appeared to vary the location of the light in both altitude and orientation.  Following about five minutes, the smaller bright light, or another which resembled it, sped apparently close to the golden light.  The golden light gave short quick chase and the smaller bright light disappeared.  I kept expecting that the golden light would leave the area, as the dawn began to brighten the sky considerably.  However, the golden light persisted until approximately 6:50 a.m. MDT, when clouds advanced and obscured view of the golden light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a series of white lights that formed a circle. It seemed that there were smaller red lights in between. The lights were twinkling. I don&#39;t know just how long it was hovering there, but we watched at least 10-15 minutes.  It was very high up and looked about the size of a nickel. We are both fifth generation natives of this area and have never witnessed anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/28/05 23:00|Bamfield (Canada)|BC|Light|6 houres|We watched a light for 6 houres drag somthing off Diana Island and ride it out over the hurison.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65944.html|80|ndxe200509| We watched a light for 6 houres drag somthing off Diana Island and ride it out over the hurison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was september 28th 2005 a buddy (buddy1) had a house on bradys beach its a beach on the end of vancuver island that looks acrose to 3 other islands and toward japan  over the herivon.  The 3 of use were walking down the beach to the rock stacks when we noticed a tug boat was heading for the beach. We new it was a tug boat all three of us were raised in the area and we have studied the boats, lights and signals, this tug had its all around white light on aswell as its tow light so we thought. We were just making a comment on how the tug was heading for the beach when we saw its load start floating backwards. Naturly we all got excited and started sceeming on how to go salvige its load when it shot up in the air. The tug boat stratend out and took off, we dint even watch to see were the tug boat went we were all to captivated by this object sowrring throug the sky heading over the 3 islands ( from rite to left when looking at the islands from the beach Helby, Diana, Edward King). The it focused on diana island moving unaxplainabuly and making a wushing nosie like the sound you here when u put your ere agenst a fan. The object was like an L.D light from christmas trees white with a blueish tinge, at first the object looked huge, then seconds later we were watching move so fast through the island we could see it moving through out the trees an obgect like this had to have been really smalland abile to navagiat on a dime. As we watched we tryd are hardest to convince eachother what this object could be, we playd with the idea that it was a rescue helicopter looking for someone, or drug smoglers with some new technolagy but as we watched it move darting and dashing through out the trees it proved us wrong. It apeard to be looking for somthing or taking pictures of the island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We dint know what to think we even tryd telling are selves we were having a mass halusination, so as it kept circuling the island, moving through the trees we all sat there watching it saying out lowd witch way it was moving. All together at the same time we were sayin &#34;left, right, down, then WOW &#34; , we figure that the object must have re-botted because as it was heading up its tail that it would leave as it moved got thincker and hit the grownd and a ball of light whent exploding from each direction. After that we dint speek for a good 40 mins just watching this light endlessly going through out diana island, then buddy2 says &#34;if anything happends, if it ubducts me im going to bit off my tung&#34;, and that was the first moment i belived that this was an alian a ufo, somthing non human.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as i was excepting this, the white bluish lite shawn over the water, over the beach acrose the rocks and hit us we sat motionless i observide the shadows that this light left and they wernt really shadows i could see the sand i could see the opisit side of the rocks witch the light hit, they had a shade like a shadow but they werent shadows i dont know how to explain it.Then the light kept focusing on the island, it kept moving through the trees,we had been watching the light for about 3hourse when buddy1 desided to go get the bonculars so we all walk towards his house yet never took are eyes off the light, buddy2 and I sat down at the edge of the water as close to the object we could wile buddy1 came back with the bonuculas we observed the light through the bonuclas trying to keep up with its movmens, i could kind of make out a roundish figure,but the light it was preducing was more intresting it almost seemed like it was doing tight circuls underneath the object going into it, like the light was coming out of thin air going up into it, then it whent back into the trees and was moving even more rapidly then before. By now it was about 5 am and buddy1 had to go to work within houres so he went back to his cabin. But as buddy 2 and i watched the light seemed to have dragged somthing to the tide line and continued to dart through the trees within another houre the tide hade came all the way up and then the light hoverd over the object , witch seemd dark and round  and just a little bit bigger then the light. The light then started moving almost floating from the island on top of the object it had dragged from the forest, first it had to come toward us, and wile it was heading in are direction the faint nosies it made got lowder and it was woshing through my head i dont know if i was just focusing on the nosie and only the nosie but it was like it was the only thing i could hear, not waves crashing on the beach , or the thought going through my head just this woshing sound sounding like it was going ! in circu les lowder and quite lowder then quite as it started turning for the hurisine, and within minuites it seemed we could no longer see the light, as the sun came out it vanished off into the open ocaen with what ever it recoverd from Diana Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this for 6 houres, I was the only one who wasnt aftaid of what people might think if i told them but no one belived me, i told every one i thought would listen but the boys dint speek of it. We had plans to go over to Diana Island to see if there was any burnings on the trees or plants, or if there was growth abonormiltys to any of the plants, but the next week was stormy, gale force winds and i dont think any of us were ready to find anything that could convince the ones we respect and love. But still to this day we look up to the sky and anything moving we watch it to see what it might be , any time we here a nosie that is simular we listen, just maby we could see somthing again and not be astrange to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Buddy1 and I were talking the other day and he made a coment &#34;You think after seing somthng like that it would change your life, your belifes, but 3 years latter im just like oh yah iv seen the unxplaind and i liked it&#34;. We still live are day to day life we know theres somthing out there and thats alrite because were never alone, who wants to be?.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned to my left (North) and saw a bright (Magnitude -5.0 or brighter) light and said to my wife &#34;What&#39;s that light? A plane with its landing lights on?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the time it took for her to turn her head (about 1 to 1 1/2 seconds) the light dimmed to look like any other star in the sky, and within another 2 seconds it was completely gone from sight.  It did not really appear to dim down (or drop below the horizon), but rather it appeared to fly directly away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About four minutes later, while I was still watching that area of the sky, I said to my wife &#34;Here it comes again.&#34;  It slowly reappeared as a faint, distant star and within 2 to 3 seconds was again very bright (Mag. -5.0 or brighter).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife said &#34;If it gets any closer, I&#39;m going in the house.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then again appeared to fly directly away from us to the North and disappeared within 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never saw it again after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No sightings of the International Space Station or of Iridium satellites would have been visible from Valley Springs, CA, on this date, at the time indicated, according to &lt;www.heavens-above.com&gt;.

My family were on a road trip to Utah in  September of 2005. On Interstate 80 in Wyoming, driving through miles of farm or pasture lands, on the 27th or 28th in the late afternoon, I noticed jet streams from aircraft at extremely high altitudes. This is normal and did not concern me. But as I looked occasionally due to bordom of the drive, I slammed on my brakes due to a fear that &#34;something&#34; may have fallen off one of these air planes and was about to hit the roadway.  As I kept my focus on the object, I drove very slowly, realizing that it was not falling. I guestimate the object was approximatly 300-600 yds above ground. It was almost directly overhead. It was difficult to make out shape due to what I first believed was a very strong reflection of sunlight comming off the matalic surface of the object. It had a compact form, and I believe it to be a spherical shaped object. It did not have wings, strobes, lights, or propellers.  It was still day light. My wife asked why it was so brite.  I told her it might be a weather baloon and it was reflected sunlight. My wife said,&#34;No! We&#39;re driving west, the sun is over there (in the direction of our travel), it can&#39;t be reflecting the sun.&#34; I became nervous at the relization that she was correct.  Then the object turned dark. This was as strange as the brightness. It did not just turn off the light, it became a black sphere in the sky floating above our car.  Then it took off.  I have never seen anything move that fast in my life. It traveled west and was no longer visible within seconds.  As we calmed our children down we tried to rationalize what we had seen. About 5-10 minutes later, my wife yells &#34;there it is.&#34; Just as before, above us, slightly in front, extremly close.  Again, it turned black, and took off.  I took the next exit and waited.  Hoping (sort of) that it would appear again (may possibly be three seperate objects, or same one that &#34;circled back&#34; with out us seeing it). As my wife looked for the camera, it did appear again, but this time it turned to black much faster and, again, took off in the same direction.  Based on size above our heads, and when it visually was no longer visible as it travelled, I guestimate it travelled over at least 100 miles within seconds. No trail, no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

First we saw what looked like long strands of spider like web, some short, long etc.  The spider like strands were swirling, falling and drifting somewhat very high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw the saucer [like a flat plate with a dome] which was a dark grey color.  I told my friend that I saw a UFO and because of his poor eyesight did not see it but he did see the spider web stuff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I picked up my binoculars I could not find it as it was out of sight.<n>

Not really!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My self I am just an average person with a penchant for Jesus, and his Father God Almighty!  I have been seeing the &#34;lights in the sky&#34; since age 8.

I first saw a line of orange glowing lights that appeared and glided southeast and disappeared within 30 seconds.  My mouth was hanging open, I&#39;ve never seen anything like this.  Within the next five minutes a huge triangle of lights glided so smoothly, and with no noise what so ever, in the same direction. It was huge in size.  By then I was hyperventalating.  After it just disappeared, the clouds rolled in and I was unable to view anything else.  I am stunned and excited.  I&#39;ve only told my daughter, I don&#39;t think anyone else would believe me<n>

It glowed bright green and caught my eye through an open window. I watched it descend and disappear about a hundred feet before hitting the ground.  It did seem to slow down as it decended. At the time, I was working at my computer, and I can glance out the window from this position. Overall, this event seemed rather strange.<n>

We have always enjoyed star gazing together and the sky always seems to be clearer when it&#39;s cool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had been sitting out there for a couple of hours when my husband said, &#34;What is that?!&#34;  He pointed directly overhead.  When I looked up, It was obviously a plane.   At that very second we simultaneously said, &#34;it&#39;s a plane.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 4 lights in a very tight diamond formation traveling north.  Then, almost immediately after we spoke, the lights started to separate from each other at an unbelievable speed.  The top light of the diamond shot straight out while the 2 outter lights expanded outward and forward until they were in line with the 1st.  Now, the 1st light and outter 2 are in a perfect row across the sky with the 4th tailing right behind the 1st.  The distance between the 3 lights in front was enormous.  They traveled at ungodly speed in this manner for about 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 seconds they shot back together again into the same tight diamond formation.  This also happened in a matter of seconds.  Then, out of no where, it vanished!  It vanished like someone unplugged the lights.  We were stunned.  We lived within 8 miles of Lambert Airport for 9 yrs, including through 9/11, and have, many times, seen aircrafts that we hadn&#39;t seen anything like before.  However, we have never seen anything even remotely close to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband said that when he 1st looked up, it looked like a misty cloud.  He said there was something very strange about it.  The sky was very clear and there wasn&#39;t another cloud in the sky.  No sooner than he had drawn my attention to the thing it had changed and appeared to be a plane.  He assumed the plane was momentarily hidden behind the &#34;cloud&#34; although the cloud was not there at all once the lights became visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed that the lights seemed to expand and contract.  When they were together they didn&#39;t seem odd.  When expanding the speed was astounding and they must have separated at least a mile apart in a matter of seconds.<n>

It was a halogen-white object that seemed to be wobbling and moving around in a circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was odd but knew that I easily could be looking at a planet, satellite, or star, but after I got my binoculars to observe the object, I realized it absolutely could not be any of those things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a chevron-shaped metallic object surrounded by a glow, and I witnessed it dart across the sky at ridiculous speeds several times, always returning to it&#39;s port of origin.  As I further observed the event, I saw what I can only describe as disk-shaped crafts which were considerably smaller entering the chevron-shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then when I really knew something strange was going on, so I woke up my friend to have him as another witness and to get his opinion on what was going on.  At first glance, he told me he thought it was a helicopter, but it emitted absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost instantly after he came to look, we both witnessed an orange orb &#34;floating&#34; from the ground north to the object, slowly at first, but then speeding up until it entered the craft.  At that point, my friend decided that it was definitely something that he could not explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to observe the activity for a total of at least 45 minutes, as it hovered and several other crafts darted and manuevered across the sky.  I also observed a purple colored beam emitting from the craft at random intervals, though it didn&#39;t project far.  It was like a short purple strobe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to wait to see if the thing would shoot into space, but my friend and I got so tired we just went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported my sighting via telephone but forgot to include the fact that as we were in bed about to fall asleep, we heard several very loud helicopters fly over or at least near the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I regret that I am not more knowledgable about the technicalities of the night sky, though I observe it almost nightly and have NEVER seen anything remotely close to that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other incident I ever have had regarding UFOs was that a beam once entered my room, but I did NOT witness a craft at that time and have no evidence that it was from any otherworldly craft, although it was a frightening event at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident however, with the orange orb rising into a &#34;ship&#34;,  I KNOW was something strange, be it government or something else that I can&#39;t explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After submitting my phone report I took the advice of Mr Davenport and called the amateur astronomy club at my WVU, the university in my town.  The administrator listened to my account and said that he had not heard anything, but would contact me if he did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be watching for further events like that, this time I will have a camcorder and compass handy. I would be extremely interested to hear if anyone else saw a similar event occur.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she seemed to us to be quite rational and eloquent about her sighting.  When we explored the possibility that the two witnesses might have been observing a celestial body, she pointed out that the object of interest, at one point during their sighting, suddenly moved a large (angular) distance across the sky.  We suspect, therefore, that they were not observing a prominent star, since celestial bodies are not seen to move across the sky rapidly.  PD))<n>

9/27/05 20:35|Goffstown|NH|Light|23 minutes|Two Bright Lights Hovered over Power Lines|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46606.html|96|ndxe200509| Two Bright Lights Hovered over Power Lines<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday, September 27, 2005, at approximately 20:35 EDT, I observed, along with my wife and two neighbors, what appeared as very bright lights approximately 1/2 to 3/4 miles away.  They rose from behind a hill across the lake on which I live, along a set of power company transmission lines and stopped just above a set of power lines.  Using 10x50 binoculars, we could clearly see two bright, distinct lights, at least as bright as what might be found at outdoor stadiums.  The lights lit my home and trees brighter than any moon ever has.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a consultant to the Department of Defense, an aviation buff and the son of an airline pilot; this was no standard aircraft.  Using the notch cut into the hill for the power lines as reference, I would estimate the distance between the two lights at anywhere from 100 to 125 feet.  The lights hovered over the power lines and remained silent and motionless for nearly 23 minutes.  I contacted the local police, but they were unaware of any activity in the area.  I contacted the local power company, but they relayed that they had no service or repair crews in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 20:58, while observing through the binoculars, the lights began to move slightly towards the left (my left) and then appeard to turn slightly on their own axis to their own right, as the distance between the lights began to close and the light on my left dimmed a little.  After 30 seconds or so, the lights appeared again to turn on their own axis, this time back to their left, re-establishing the original distance between them.  Then both lights slowly (5 seconds) dimmed until they went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and we deem him to be an exceptionally qualified observer.  He provided several photographs of the area where the object was observed, and provided a witness graphic of what the two lights looked like to him through binoculars, which were mounted on a tripod.  The witness has contacted the FAA, the local police, and the airport at Manchester, NH, to inquire whether anyone else may have reported the same phenomenon, and is awaiting return telephone calls from all those institutions.

But there was no sound..<n> <n><n> <n><n> As My wife and I watched the 2 object&#39;s for about 3 mins. The object&#39;s became more clear. My wife Ran to the truck and grabbed a disposable Fiji Camera.

This happened again and I got my camera out to take a picture. I was able to get a shot of the jet trail just when the craft moved after taking a right turn again sharply at 90 degrees. then it did the same movement and curved left and down and dispeared. 30 seconds later it performed the same procedure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have one eyewitness that also saw the event while driving to work in the same direction. weather was clear skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the area that the craft moved may have been in the edwards airforce base area. where they test aircraft. but this must be a very advanced vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stepped out the door and into my drive way. I decided to urinate outside before we started the walk. It was a crystal clear night and I was looking up at the stars in front of me whan I saw a white light drop out of the sky approx, maybe in space? I thought it was a shooting star but then as I focused my sight I seen 5 huge spheres which were not lite up, but they were reflecting light from the ground, As I kept looking at the spheres I ruled out birds as the source. I then began to scan for structure as the craf went directly over my head. I seen a brown hull with beams to which the spheres were attached. As it went over head I grabbed my brothers arm and told him to look, he also seen it and ruled out birds or plane. I got a intense feeling that we were not supposed to witness what we saw. As the craft traveled approx 100 yards past my house it just vanished? The whole time this craft was observed it was not lite up with any lights, It may have been a government project but it is hard to say how large it was and how high? It also had a large non lite sphere trailing it. The craft was moving to fast to be birds in formation, and there was no sound. At first I thought it could have been a b2 bomber? But it was way to big and the attached spheres and trailing sphere didn&#39;t make sense. My brother said he thought it was about 3 football fields long. The whole incident was very overwhelming, and my brother and I felt nausea for 2 days following the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When it came out from behind these clouds it looked to me like the shuttle taking off, but it was too big and there were pieces trailing behind it. Many pieces. It was a bright yellow, much like the shuttle but moving too slow and straight across the sky. I stopped and watched it for a full minute until it finally disapated, looking like it was over the ocean at this time just falling into pieces except for one last glow which faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this was a meteor this was the largest and longest lasting meteor I&#39;ve ever seen and either way, this HAD to be seen by more than just me, it was just too big and bright. At one point I rolled down the window before I got out of the car thinking I would hear the rumble of this thing, but no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(route 56) towards route 59 in Warrenville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before I passed Fermi Lab, just before Eola Rd., I seen a bright white light (orb) in the eastern sky, which was going across the sky from north to the south at a fast rate of speed, crossing OVER the road that I was traveling on, in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, it rapidly broke stright up into the sky, changing to a red color, and fading a SLIGHT bit in color intensity, and twinkled a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, it shot across to the north, ACROSS Butterfeild Road ( I was using the road as a point of referance to mark its traveling) at a huge rate of speed, and as it did, it turned white again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it was to the North of Butterfeild Road, it then just kind on bobbled and turned to a twinkling red. From there it was moving eratticly, kind of jumpy, up and down and to the north a bit more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object didn&#39;t look much higher than the trees in the background, and has I had to turn off of Butterfeild Road, it was just above the tree tops towards the Warrenville/Wheaton city limits.  I lost sight of it once I had to turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone else driving east on Butterfeild Road, HAD to see this as well.<n>

It was at least the size of the jet or larger.  It may have been my imagination but it appeared that the jet altered course to avoid it or stay away from it.  As the jet left the vicinity the light went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I have not seen any other report of this - I would imagine that somebody on the jet must have seen it - at the very least the pilot and copilot as it appeared they swerved or altered course slightly to avoid it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No flares from Iridium satellites would have been visible from the observer&#39;s location at the time and date indicated, according to the data at &lt;www.heavens-above.com&gt;.

9/26/05 21:52|Hyvinkää (Finland)||Other|30 seconds|"Unusual" satellites seen over the town of Hyvinkää, Finland|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46516.html|105|ndxe200509| &#34;Unusual&#34; satellites seen over the town of Hyvinkää, Finland<n> <n><n> <n><n> Astronomy is my hobby and I´m quite familiar with ordinary events in the night sky.  However, on the stated hour I witnessed something that I couldn´t immediately explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark outside and the stars were shining.  Planet Mars  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus is in the western sky, at present.  PD))  was visible near the western horizon  I was walking with my dog when I noticed an ordinary looking satellite (a spot of light) high in the Southwestern sky. It was visible just out of the right side of what astronomers of Northern hemisphere would call the Pegasi Square and it was almost as bright as the stars of the Square. The satellite was moving slowly towards southeast and also gradually fading away as satellites usually seem to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, before the satellite was completely out of sight I noticed something strange: the satellite was closely (less than 2 degrees behind) followed by another, very faint satellite.  They were visible together for about 15 seconds before fading away and they were moving into exactly same direction maintaining the visible &lt;2 degree distance. The objects behaved just like ordinary satellites. I´ve heard of NOSS satellites and I know that they usually travel in a row or in a triangle, but I´ve never actually witnessed them.  This could be my first witness, but I´ve always thought that the visible distance of these satellites would be greater (more like 15 degrees or so).<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 8 minues after the satellites had disappeared I noticed an extremely bright satellite just above the Ursa Major heading north. It was brighter than Mars when I noticed it. Then it faded a little but brightened again for some seconds before fading out of sight. This again was nothing out of the ordinary. It was probably one of Iridium satellites that usually appear like that. I´m much more interested in finding out what the first sighting was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We received a similar report on September 28, of two satellites in &#34;tandem&#34; flight, but we do not know which satellites they are.  The fact that the two objects quickly faded from the observers&#39; sight, as they flew to the east, is suggestive of satellites, as they fly into the Earth&#39;s shadow.  To the best of our knowledge, what are thought to be the U. S. Navy&#39;s &#34;NOSS&#34; satellites always appear as a &#34;triplet&#34; of satellites.  PD))<n>
9/26/05 20:00|Ellsworth|WI|Formation|2+ Hours|I was driving home from Hudson, and had just driven through River Falls when I spotted the first one. It was a very bright light, large|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59121.html|106|ndxe200509| I was driving home from Hudson, and had just driven through River Falls when I spotted the first one. It was a very bright light, larger than any star and seemed to be falling fairly fast; it got dimmer and dimmer until I couldn’t see it anymore. I was almost to Beldenville when I spotted another. I pulled off on to a side road to get a better look. There were as many as six objects flying in large circles. At the closest part of the circle they were bright and large like the first one I saw; as they got further away they looked to have one red light and one green light, and very fast flashing white lights that ran along the length of it. I watched them for a while then decided to move on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before Ellsworth I saw them again; again I pulled off onto a side road. I saw one very close this time; it consisted of a row of five red lights. It was flying very low and it was wider than the road I was on, yet it made no sound. When it started to circle it banked so sharply that the lights went from being horizontal to being completely vertical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While going east on hwy 10, between about eleven miles out side of Ellsworth, one flew over me. This one was very irregularly shaped, with the same red and green and flashing white lights. While it was over head, I spotted another just like it in my rear view mirror, at first I thought it was the same one, but I looked over my shoulder and there were two of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home I could still see them, little more than flashing lights on the horizon, I brought my dad out side and showed him. Every so often one of them would get very big and bright again, and then fade just as quickly. Dad thinks that they are probably military planes on practice runs, and he’s probably right, but it&#39;s still unlike anything either of us had ever seen before. The weather was clear and still.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object did not move or flash or change in any way.  I was at work taking a cigarette break when I noticed it.  It was too high up and too far away to be a helicopter with that intense of a light plus the light was a lot larger than any aircraft light I have ever seen.  I work at a hotel and I stopped a guest to get thier input and they too thought the same about it.  The guest stayed to watch it for about 5 minutes with me and agreed it looked suspicious.  I was called inside the hotel to check in a guest and when I got back outside around 8:30pm it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only detail I have on the object is that it glowed extremely bright orange and hovered with VERY little movement from side to side.  It was awesome!<n>

I was a non beliver , but now im leaning twards the idea that there are things watching us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saved it and am sending it to you.  I tried to zoom in without much luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I think it may be something other than a regular aircraft is because usually when I am viewing the webcam and a regular aircraft is in the view, you can tell what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This I&#39;m not sure of and thought I&#39;d send it to you to see if you can tell.<n>

I went in my backyard, it was very dark, I got into the spa, sat back and looked up. I was facing NNE. Cassiopeia was in my field of vision. A faint lighted area caught my eye and I watched it move across the sky. It was not a bank of lights but like a vehicle without its lights on. The moon (sliver) was rising in the east and could have been reflecting off it. Or the lights of the city beneath. I thought it was a group of birds but it didn&#39;t change configuration like a group of flying birds would do. As I have seen them do before. I thought to myself, &#39;I&#39;m seeing a UFO.&#39; I could not continuously look directly at it because it was too dark. I looked around it more often, to see it better, as it went over. I could definitely see that it was wing-shaped and looked like there were end structures (see the graphic I include with this: pswing.jpg) I started seeing it when it was passing Cassiopeia and it faded away (at about 50 degrees up in the sky.) It travelled from NNW to SSE. Made no sound. Was the only one I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About fifteen minutes later I saw what looked like a meteor fly UP in the north but it left no trail light. Just started and stopped quickly. By up, I mean it went from closer to the horizon, up towards the center of the sky. It looked like a small light encircled by another light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was the tv glaring off the window because it isn&#39;t covered with drapery or blinds, I watched for about 10 seconds, then I got up and went to the window. It was very cloudy and dark so I could not see an object, just the lights. It appeared to be 3 or 4 bright large white lights that were flashin with a small red one. Since I had on no clothes I went to my closet which is next to the window grabbed my robe and went on the back porch which is only about 15 feet from my window(faces the southern sky). I turned on the poch light and saw that the wind had began to blow and at the same time the lights faded as if the object was lowering. I didn&#39;t see anything else so Iwent back to bed. I was so startled by what I had seen I kept an eye out the window. At 11:21 pm I saw the same lights in the same spot as if they were rising. I ran to window so fast that it woke my husband and he came to the window also, although still half asleep he saw them also. They stayed very low near the tree tops for about 20 more seconds then ascended to far up for me to see. By this time I was too scared to look from outside on the porch, so I cannot tell which direction they went. I know that this was not a plane because it was too low and stayed in the same position for too long, it was too close to have been a helicopter or I would have heard it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/25/05 19:15|Prescott Valley|AZ|Fireball|approximately 2-3 minutes|Extremely bright glowing orange ball of light with some sort of dim object obove it, possibly a reflection on a larger surface|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46497.html|116|ndxe200509| Extremely bright glowing orange ball of light with some sort of dim object obove it, possibly a reflection on a larger surface<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 7:15pm, Sunday September 25th. The phone rang-- it was my wife, calling from work. As I often do while on the phone, I stepped outside as we talked. There was still a good amount of light from the sun, which had set behind Glassford Hill (my back yard faces west, directly toward the hill). I immediately saw the orange ball and knew what it was. I have seen perhaps 10 of these in the 3.5 years I’ve lived at this house. With most of my sightings, the objects have been moving in a roughly south to north path, but a few –including one dramatic sighting- have moved in a north-south direction. This time it was moving south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time the object was quite close, and very distinct, directly in front of me and clear. It was, again, a very bright orange glowing ball. There appeared to be something above it that the glow was reflecting on. As with another close sighting, when my wife and I both had a good amount of time to view one of these objects, I had the impression that the glow was on the underside of a larger object. This time, perhaps because there was more ambient light in the sky, this thing above the glow was more apparent. I almost got the impression that it might be a balloon with some sort of flare burning under it. (Is there any known weather balloon or anything that fits that description?) It appeared to be quite close (although it is admittedly difficult to judge distances on lights in the dark sky) it was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was quite excited and told my wife what was happening. When she put me on hold (oddly, to tell a customer at her work that I was watching a UFO), I started yelling out loudly that there was a UFO in the sky, hoping that one of the neighbors would look up. I’m sure I sounded like a nut, but I was hoping that some other people would see what I was seeing (I don’t know if anyone heard or looked up and saw it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving fairly quickly, and since the air was very still, it seems unlikely that this was a balloon or anything else floating in the wind. I ran inside and grabbed my camera. The object was still quite close but I was having a hard time getting the camera to focus on it in the dim light. I watched it for a little while longer and decided to try to take a picture again. This time it focused and I got the attached snapshot (see email). It was quite far away by now and appeared as just a small dot in the sky. In the picture the object looks blurred because, presumably, the shudder speed was long. The combination of the movement of the object and my hand shaking is what caused the object the be shaped that way (I am assuming this because it was round to my eye).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also attached to the email is a PhotoShop sketch of what I saw, as the photo is so poor and doesn’t really illustrate my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have another report from 12-28-2004 that I can send you, along with a similar photo, if you would like. Let me know. I hope you can look into this sighting tonight and let me know if there is any explanation for what I saw (and have seen many times here in Prescott Valley).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

After watching it for a few seconds I saw that it was moving erratically throughout the sky and was too bright for a &#39;normal&#39; star. Also, the sky was not yet dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it move around the sky for a couple of minutes, the object suddenly appeared to grow in size and vanish. At this point, an aeroplane comes into view. I captured the latter end of this on our video camera. When playing this on our TV, we can clearly see that at the point the object appeared to grow and change it becomes a spherical shape with a rotating circle running around the middle of it. It is far larger in size at this point and it also moves at some speed after this, which probably explains how it &#39;vanished&#39;. We often see planes in the sky, as we are on a flight path, so the appearance of the plane is not unusual. It&#39;s almost as if the &#39;UFO&#39; saw the plane and wanted to get out of its way.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was excited watching it and as I was tracing it with my eyes, it appeared to be vanished. Its movement was rather fast, smooth and different. I later thought it must fly not relying on aerodynamics but other dynamics and that must be why I felt different it moved. I could not tell how high it was but I would imagine it must be pretty high. I could not tell the size of it either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My feeling of this was that I was glad that I finally had an opportunity to see one on my own. I have no way of knowing what they are doing here and hope they are not like us who needs to kill others to sustain and grow by nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved like a jelly fish and looked like it was plasma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thirteen, and at night I often liked to lay down in my front yard and observe the stars. One night, I did just so and noticed something weird in the sky. You can tell it was very far away, but it was huge. I would compare its size to two football fields. It was shaped like a triangle with one open end. More like a boomerang, but more narrow like a triangle. It was moving along sort of like a jelly fish swims. It looked like the sky was water, and it was swimming in it. It also looked more like an aligned trail of plasma lights. There was no metal; it just looked all like plasma. So anyway, I was lying in my driveway for about a minute just watching this thing, I couldn’t get a picture even if I wanted to, it was too dark out and I didn’t have a camera handy. It was just “swimming” in the same direction for about a minute, and then it just dissipated into the air. It didn’t just disappear, it sort of disinagrated into the air. It was the strangest thing I had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

As i came close to where i was going i seen some weird blinking lights in the sky, 2 would blink blue and the middle one was blinking red. I stoped an started looking at it closer, what i thought was the front but turned out to be the back looked like 3 oval shaped things starting small from the left getting bigger as it goes right. It was a blueish colour, at first that was all i could see untill everything started to blink. At first i thought maybe its a aircraft, but there was no sound and it was kind of slow moving. When it passed over top of me i could make out a triangle shape when it blinked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The blinking would start from the left on I guess a wing or a side of it, it was a blue blink, then it would go to the other side of it with another blue blink, then in the front with a red blink.

9/24/05 20:30|Chicago Heights|IL|Circle|1 hour|Three strange lights in the night sky on Sept. 24th, 2005. Were they were man-made or terrestrial?|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46706.html|126|ndxe200509| Three strange lights in the night sky on Sept. 24th, 2005.  Were they were man-made or terrestrial?<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 3 circular objects high in the sky on Sept. 24th 2005. The objects gave the appearance of planets far away, not stars.  They were too close and not as brilliant white or aqua color as stars.  In fact they were light yellow to my eyes while to my wife&#39;s eyes they were red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed them I was sitting at my computer working on some music.  My computer desk faces a window out the back of my home.  All of a sudden out the corner of my eye (left) I noticed this bright light.  It just appeared out of nowhere!?  So I looked at it for a few seconds trying to make out what it was....actually, waiting for it to move.  Nothing!   So I ignored it a few more seconds then took another peek.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THENNNNN, I called to my wife to come take a look at this and to bring me my field glasses.  My curiosity and imagination got the best of me at that point.  I wanted my field glasses because have good magnification.  I can actually see the surface of the Moon pretty good on a clear night with these field glasses (binoculars :-&gt;).  Oddly, these objects weren&#39;t THAT far away where I shouldn&#39;t be able to get a clear image come in but my field glasses could NOT focus clearly????  To me that&#39;s TOOOOO strange?   Why?   All I could focus enough to see was that the objects were circular; there were 3 of them all-together, and each had a very light-yellowish appearance to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could also see clearly how they were positioned in the sky. They were positioned about southwest of my eyesight while I was facing west.  The larger circle was centered between two smaller ones both about 1/2 its size.  What was more interesting was that the larger object seem to emit a very, very faint white (or yellowish) beam of light that stretch upwards and downwards while the two smaller objects emitted lights pointing at 45 degree angles up and down from their left and right sides.  Meaning, the beams of light formed a V on its side (&#34;&gt;&#34; and &#34;&lt;&#34;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t going to spend my whole evening watching this thing but I have to admit my curiosity got the best of me.  I kept peering out the window every 5 mins or so.  At points I would actually watch for almost 5 mins straight! It was compelling!  There seemed to be no explaination of what it was or why it was suddenly there.  I was actually waiting for some government surveillance planes to surround it. There&#39;s my answer! LOL!  What I did see were at least 2 planes (ours, doubtlessly) pass by in the same &#39;spectrum grid&#39; (if I may).  I say &#39;spectrum grid&#39; because the sky is HUGE and we all know how the eyes can play tricks on you while trying to tell how far apart 2 objects are.  What might look like a few feet away could actually be miles!   Anyhow, the lights weren&#39;t stabalized.  It took them about an hour to move out of my sight, northwest.  Watching it move across the sky was no different than watching the moon or sun rise and fall.  If these objects were UFO&#39;s then my suspicions is that they weren&#39;t in our atmosphere at all!  In fact, I&#39;m thinking the &#39;controller&#39; of these lights were probably in outer space using some laser beam, or something.  That&#39;s not fiction!  It could actually be true.  I say that because I&#39;ve read so many stories where people have referred to UFO&#39;s as &#39;dancing lights&#39; in the sky.  Well, I can make that happen too!  Give me a LASER BEAM! LOL!  Seriously, If we can do that &#39;dance&#39; here on Earth with laser beams and project them FARRRRR AWAY then why wouldn&#39;t an extraterestrial!  Well, enough on opinions.  Fact is, the lights didn&#39;t dance but did raise a curiosity in me because they weren&#39;t normal to the eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope that wasn&#39;t too detailed. :)  Thx! ((name deleted))<n>

But I have seen clearly two relatively small ovals (compared to seen aircrafts) flying apparently on much greater altitude. At the begining I though it is a ballon, but because I observed an organized movement pattern (zigzag) towards one direction (north east) I was surpurized. It took approximately 5 minutes for the two objects to pass over Chicago sky in almost the same path (one follow the other with huge distance between). The objects were surrounded with a hallow zone. Both kept flying and they started becoming smaller as they go higher and disappeared. The speed was almost constant (but even slower than the lower altitude aircrafts). I have seen the two objects clearily for the first time in my life!<n>
9/24/05 14:30|Grand Rapids|MI|Chevron|5 minutes|Red chevron shadowing small plane.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46512.html|131|ndxe200509| Red chevron shadowing small plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were attending my son’s 7th grade football game at Northview High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The sky was overcast with a ceiling of 7500’. I noticed a small Cessna-type plane in the sky that was towing an advertising banner. I would estimate that the plane was flying at an altitude of about 1500’ to 2000’. While trying to decipher the message on the banner, I noticed an additional object in the sky above the plane. It was considerably higher than the plane and appeared to be smaller than the plane, even when the greater altitude was taken into consideration. After watching the object for a while I thought I could discern a chevron shape with a reddish cast. I pointed it out to my wife and my fourteen year-old daughter. They both immediately saw it. The object seemed to “pace” the plane, mimicking the plane’s path, though much higher in the sky. We watched the object for several minutes. At one point I looked away for a couple of seconds and when I looked back the object had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the game I asked my daughter what she had seen and she said that it looked like a huge red hawk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several  possible explanations come to mind. It could have been a paraglider, but if it was, it was flying at an altitude far higher than I have ever seen before. I thought that it might be some type of kite or balloon device used to support the tail end of the advertising banner. But the pacing behavior didn’t coincide with the movements one would expect from a “trailer”. Besides, when the plane flew directly over our heads later, at a lower altitude after the object had disappeared, there was no evidence that the banner had any attachments. It might have been an eagle or a hawk, but it seemed too big as well as being the wrong color. Whatever it was, it was unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an experienced outdoorsman, a college graduate, and a professional. My wife is a registered nurse.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 4 weeks after the Hurricane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As evacuees, had little to do, and even less money. I had just washed everyone&#39;s clothes by hand in the utility sink, and was hanging them out on a line to dry. Everybody was sitting outside on the patio, relaxing and enjoying the beautiful, crystal clear Fall day. I was facing South, hanging the laundry on the clothesline, when I turned around to go back for another wet load, and I saw something hovering over the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped in my tracks and tried to focus on whatever it was, because what I was seeing made no sense and it was very close to the house. There was a clean, white rectangular box hovering over the roof. It was hard to tell how big it was or how high it was, because the sky was a dark, pure blue, without any clouds to help determine the depth of field. It looked exactly like a shirt box you would put a dressing robe in to give your dad for Christmas, you know, before you wrapped it. It was a plain, white rectangle. It didn&#39;t seem very big, maybe only a couple of feet wide and about three feet long, but like I said, there was no referencing objects near it. It could have been 10 times that for all I could tell. It seemed to float only about 25 or 30 feet above the house, but I couldn&#39;t really say. At the most, though I would say it was maybe three or four telephone lengths above the house. It didn&#39;t seem very far, like I could yell at it and it would hear me. But I didn&#39;t yel! l. I was too confounded by the sight. I could have shot at it with a gun and likely hit it, if I was the kind of person who acts first and thinks later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my 4 friends out from under the patio cover to see it. I asked them what they were seeing (not to influence them as to my version of the sight). They all saw exactly what I was seeing, and they noticed it was actually moving very, very slowly.  We watched it for about 20-25 minutes as it crept over the house, across the yard, and over the pasture towards the South. Some of them got bored and went in the house, but I stayed and watched it glide away until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. It never made a single sound. It never lost or gained altitude.

We had just finished doing some work on a house when we left for bed. My son, Larry, saw an orb moving in complex turns through the air. He first told me and then proceeded to tell the rest of the people there. There were about 5 people, not including myself, that saw the objects. They were suprisingly easy to see. They didn&#39;t seem to try to mask their appearance. They first moved in tight circles, but then moved on to more complex flight patterns such as figure 8-like designs and even more complex star-like moves. I had my camera with me, so I took a few shots on my digital. I have included one of the pictures and will send more if requested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://img88.imageshack.us/img88/2820/untitled16lv.jpg<n>

Lasted for over 2 hours, hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the last couple of nights I have been inexplicably waking up around 3:00 am.  Early this morning was no exception, but upon waking, I noticed out my window what I thought was a very bright star.  After staring at it for a couple minutes I thought it strange that it was extremely bright and colorful.  I noticed it blinking or twinkling quite a bit and changing from red, blue and white.  I got out of bed to investigate because I also noticed that it didn&#39;t move at all.  It was quite high, higher than any helicopter.  Take note - we live a few miles away from Sikorsky Aircraft so I know helicopters; we see them all the time, along with jet aircraft which land and take off at Tweed and Bridgeport Airports.  The next thought that crossed my mind was that it may be a satelite or even the space station.  But the object was stationary at all times and remained nearby another star, which I was using as a reference for distance.  I woke up my wife (who was none too pleased) and after discounting all the previously mentioned possibilities, she agreed that it was something we have never seen before.  We both went outside and with my binoculars, tried to get a closer view of the object.  Even then, it was still too far away to discern any particular shape, but we could clearly see it changing colors.  Also of interest is that for the two hours that we continuously observed this object it remained stationery and within the same cluster of stars, moving along with the group as the earth rotated.  We saw this in the South Eastern sky without a single cloud around.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(We were facing North) Each light was about the size of Mars in the night sky.  There was no sound, no colors, no strobes.  The lights moved together as if each was a wing tip on the ends of a single object.  The object (lights) moved behind a hill and out of our view.  If I held my thumb up at arms length, the lights were right on each side of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had not moved at all for several minutes.  We got a pair of binoculars and took a look.  What seemed to be a round brilliant white light with a few smaller blue and red lights around it.  Extending from the central light were 3 wing-shaped protrusions spaced at 120 degrees. It seemed to fade as if moving back, and then returned to the original site.  After watching it for approx. 30 minutes, it seemed to sink downwards, and out of view to us due to house blocking it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It approached rapidly directly overhead and then continued by heading toward the east end of the Vancouver airport. It flew by so quickly that all I could see was a triangle composed of about 5 or more dim (average star brightness) bluish-white lights around its edge. I saw nothing other than lights. The apparent size was about like a 747 (judged by watching its apparent speed and angle receeding toward the airport). There was no sound at all. I estimated its altitude at 1000&#39;. After it flew over the airport approach path it became too dim to see, then a plane (landing) flew a few hundred feet below it 10 seconds later. I think it&#39;s important to consider the source of info; so I should point out that I majored in sciences through college, and and not prone to fantasy (unless this is my first?).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Jets in full AB&#39;s in area also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard jets flying over with full AB&#39;s going while in my 5th wheel.  I continued hearing them for about 15 mins. until I went outside to see what was going on and why they would be using full AB&#39;s low and late.  Bearing in mind that hurricane Rita was West of us I assumed/assume they were flying them in from other base&#39;s east out of the storms path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft were coming from west to east.  While looking for the aircraft by sound I saw two bright lights that did not fricker or change.  They were around 1000 feet altitude and had no sound.  The lights had no sound of helicopter rotors or other identifying sound.  I watched them move from west to east.  The lights were constant and not flashing.  They were not in a flight pattern or holding pattern. They were about 5 miles distance from my place.  There was one that was going straight and then made a 90 degree drop of about 200 feet.  The other was ahead of it.  The dropping light then tappered off at around 800 feet and then the other did the same thing.  Both were in a circular pattern of west to east to north.  I then saw them both rise at the same time to about 1000 feet.  I continued to hear the jets sound of AB&#39;s but the sound was coming and going in a direction opisite of the lights.  The lights were bright glows that stayed constant.  I lost sight of the lights in my tree line in a east, north east direction.  I have been around aircraft using full abs before and these lights were not helicopters nor the jets using ab&#39;s.  Clouds were heavy from storm and I never saw the jets ab flame yet I was able to see the lights.  The jets were loud and rolling fast towards the south south east direction.  These were not jets from my expericence of being around them.  Very unusal to see.  The lights were constant and the same no matter what direction I watched them from.  It was as though they were just a ball of light.  Speed was slow.  Maybe 45-50 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Two lights one traveling north to south and the other one east to west.  The lights were very bright and traveling fast.  No other distinctions noted on the lights, thought it was a helicopter or plane but there were no noises or other lights that would signify an aircraft.  Later that night in the East is a reddish light in the sky that looked like a star or planet but this object was moving at first I thought sattelite but this was moving faster but not so fast that you would notice right away.  For the past week now until today there has been two noticible lights in the sky, they are brighter than a star and only in the sky for a short period of time.  The first is in the Western Sky at 2000 and gone after 30 mins.  The second is at 2200 in the Eastern sky.  These lights aren&#39;t doing anything spectacular, but they came the same time each night and only lasted in the sky in the same positions though moving for 30 mins and they are very bright.  Curious to know what this is.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/23/05 20:00|In-flight (Georgia)|GA|Unknown|5 Minutes|Pilots See UFO Over Southeast Georgia|11/3/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47195.html|141|ndxe200509| Pilots See UFO Over Southeast Georgia<n> <n><n> <n><n> In order to protect mine as well as the witnesses name, I have been asked by the witness to report this UFO, as well as omit certain details concerning the event.  Both the witness and I are pilots involved in a flight training program and fear our careers as airline pilots may be jeapardized by this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On September 23rd, 2005 the witness was flying a small light twin aircraft (a Piper Seminole) on an IFR flight plan from Montgomery, AL to Jacksonville, FL.  The sun had already set so it was dark by this point.  Both witnesses on board the aircraft were instrument-rated pilots and were on frequency and in-contact with Air Traffic Control.  The aircraft originated in Dallas, Texas and had been attempting to outrun Hurricane Rita before it hit the Texas and Louisiana coast, so there were very few, if any, other aircraft on frequency or even airborne in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very frequently, it is normal to be one of the only, if the only aircraft on a controller&#39;s frequency later at night.  This was the case this evening, as the airlines and other traffic were being vectored or vectoring themselves well north of the gulf coast area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two pilots were about to enter what is an MOA or a Military Operations Area.  The name of the MOA was either the Moody 3 MOA, or the Moody 2 South MOA which are both located over southeastern Georgia, but the witness can&#39;t remember as to which one it was.  These areas are a type of airspace mainly used for military aircraft training purposes, or other types of military activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When one of them is active or what we call &#34;hot&#34; it is normal for aircraft to be vectored around them via Air Traffic Control.  This was not the case that night, as the MOA was reported &#34;cold&#34; by Atlanta Center after the pilots queried ATC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is not illegal to enter these areas, for they are not prohibited or restriced airspace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, prior to entering the MOA, ATC informed the pilots that their aircraft would go out of radio contact for the next 5 minutes.  This is fairly common, especially along the gulf coast during this active hurricane season when transmitters have often been hit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after radio contact was allegedly &#34;lost&#34; with Atlanta Center, the pilots both said they saw a light, like a strobe or beacon, similar to that of another airplane, not far in front of them at a distance of 3 miles or less.  As it began getting closer, the two pilots became nervous as ATC normally informs aircraft within that close of a vicinity to one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the object began to move rapidly in a way that known aircraft don&#39;t move, darting to the right, then straight up, then back left in right angles.  It got close to them, then suddenly sped away at what seemed to be thousands of miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pilots then conferred with one another as to whether they should try to contact Atlanta Center and ask about what they saw.  Since it seemed that their safety was at stake, they decided to make the attempt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following is an aproximation of what was said: (I am making up the call-sign in order to once again protect both of the witnesses identities)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness: &#34;Atlanta Center, 123 Alpha Romeo&#34; (short pause)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Atlanta Center: &#34;123 Alpha Romeo, go ahead&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness: &#34;Atlanta Center, do you possibly have any traffic up ahead of us at our 12 o&#39;clock?&#34; (almost immediately and seemingly aggravated)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Atlanta Center: &#34;3 Alpha Romeo, negative I have nothing ahead of you.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness: &#34;Roger, 3 Alpha Romeo&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses never saw the object again and had an uneventful duration of the flight.  They both found it peculiar that Atlanta Center would report going out of radio contact, but when asked about traffic ahead got a very rapid and aggravated response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon arriving in Jacksonville, both witnesses met up with me and described the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After discussing it with them, we&#39;ve come up with our own conclusion:  It was probably something military in nature, possibly top secret or a black-project aircraft but we can&#39;t be sure.  We also think that Atlanta Center knew it was there, and wasn&#39;t supposed to give any traffic advisories while the object passed through his airspace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time, and any more info upon the event would be greatly appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate, possibly to protect the anonymity of the witnesses.

9/23/05 20:00|Gorham|NH|Formation|2 hours|Orange V-Pattern Lights Viewed in Mountains of Northern New Hampshire|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55401.html|142|ndxe200509| Orange V-Pattern Lights Viewed in Mountains of Northern New Hampshire<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this evening, I was with my friends up on a mountain.  There is a dirt road up the mountain that leads to a clearing where our cars were parked.  From here we walk a short distance up a rock formation to a ledge that overlooks the town.  We called this place &#34;the ledges.&#34;  We visited the spot almost daily:  It was a great spot to have a campfire and there was a wonderful view of the town below.  I also enjoyed stargazing up here, as it has always been a hobby of mine, and this is the perfect location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night before I saw the UFOs, my friends told me that they saw something weird by another nearby mountain as they were going for a ride.  The whole area is full of hills and mountains, the town is located in a mountain valley.  They told me they saw something strange looking up at the top of a mountain nearby, but only for a second.  They really didn&#39;t make much of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night we drove up this dirt path and went up to the ledges to try to get a good vantage point if this thing appeared again.  We were really only up there because we had nothing better to do.  There were 7 or 8 of us, like usual.  We stayed up there until the sun started to set, then decided to head back down.  My cousin was in front of me driving, his car full.  Mine was also full.  I was on the phone with him, asking him what he wanted to do when we got back to town.  I was going fairly quickly down the road, and then had to slam on my brakes.  On the line, my cousin made some kind of noise of shock.  He had stopped right there, at a small clearing created by a fork in the road.  My cousin got out in a frenzy and started looking up toward the sky.  The other occupants of his vehicle didn&#39;t seem to know what was going on, until they looked where he was looking.  They all had a frightened look on their face, and had stopped their laughing.  Everybody in my car got out too and looked up at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we looked up, we all saw the same thing.  The sky wasn&#39;t dark yet.  Up and to the west we saw a bright orange light.  As we were looking at it, we saw two more of these lights come into focus equidistant from the center one, forming a triangle.  They glimmered when they first came into focus, then were solid.  Shortly after that, two more of these lights showed up even further out to the sides, forming a larger triangle.  All of these lights appeared out of nowhere, there seemed to be nothing at all there, and then something.  There was no visible solid mass that connected these glowing lights.  They appeared to be separate entities.  They were not moving at all it seemed.  If they were, it was quite slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all pretty scared at this point, and all pretty curious.  We drove back up to the ledges, hoping to get a better vantage point.  By the time we got back up there, the orange lights had vanished, and it was completely dark.  We decided to just lounge around a bit and I did some stargazing.  I focused my eyes on what looked like a normal satellite, until it did a quick loop, changed direction, and started moving opposite how it had been.  I called the other guys over and they saw it too.  There were two of them, moving randomly, silently, and quite quickly.  They were covering a distance of approximately 60 miles in 30 to 35 seconds.  (This estimate of 60 miles is based on the distance between mountains they were traveling between.)  The only noise we could hear was the sound of eighteen-wheelers down in town.  At one point, these two specks were travelling the same direction, and between them was an orange glow like we had seen before.  It lasted only a second or two, and resembled a flare.  We watched the two dots move around for a while then decided to go home and go to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night, we went back to try our luck at seeing them again.  We saw the same satellite-looking specks arrive from the north.  They only stayed for fifteen minutes or so, then were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all very curious about what we had seen, and discovered that the mountain to the east of the ledges is private government land.  There was a suggestion that it could have been a jet that was being tested.  It could be, but it was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever heard of before.  The orange lights coming out of nowhere was hard to be explained, as well as the silent flight and incredible quickness and agility of the craft.  This still remains a mystery to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was driving home from work on the interstate and I looked up during a turn toward the right going into another interstate (intersection) and saw 2 bright upside down V shapes that were glowing bright white that were very thin - at the TIP of the upsidedown V - was a dark or dark grey sort of aircraft looking either oval or oblong shaped.  The upsidedown V lights were coming from each craft and they were one aligned above the other to the right and they did not move. They were just hanging in the sky and looked to be about 100 feet up to the V tip and 100 feet down -  they stayed in the same place and had NO exhaust coming from the craft other than the lighted upsidedown V&#39;s .   It was truly amazing and if I had had a camera - I would have definitely took a picture.  Other drivers were looking also and everyone just kept driving.  Never saw the craft or lights again from that time on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We saw 5-8 red lights maybe 1/2 to 2 miles away in the sky at about an angle of 35 degrees. The lights were stationary and then some moved and one rose up a bit to make us wonder if it was somekind of fireworks. Then they seemed to change to white lights, smaller, and more of them - the white lights moving and changing position. They then disappeared. The noise slowly ended. About fifteen minutes later white lights could again be seen. The noise resumed at a lower volume and then two white lights moved from west to east and then back east to west at a constant speed and seperation between the lights finally disappearing to the west as the volume faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was a monumental endeavor never mind the fact that the two wheeler hauler/trailer was critically overloaded!  Since the trailer was new and had new 8 ply tires my brother decided to pass on a spare and this was a mistake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The temperatures  during the day ran from 95 to 108 degrees  and we got baked!  A few times I told ((name deleted)) to slow down as he was pushing it and about 30 miles north of Lareto the rear right tire on the u-hauler melted. The first indication I had that something was wrong was when I heard that familiar and dreaded sound of a tire breaking down!<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I felt the Ford Exloder we were in shake my brother was fighting the wheel to bring us to a pull over stop on the side of the road.

As he checked out our bad right tire on the trailer he told his friend to check the air pressure on the left side.  ((name deleted)) and I did not pay attention as I was sick and he could only watch so much of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) told us he would take our rim to his shop to find us a tire and fix the bent rim. This was around eight o clock to eight-thirty. For about twenty minutes ((name deleted)) and I hung out and as I was looking out into the darkness I saw spotlight come out from what I first thought was a helicopter going real fast. I said to my brother, &#34;Are they using a helicopter to look for illegal aliens or drug smugglers&#34;? Thing was the light source was a square box as apposed to a round searchlight!  The light source then did a sweep over the hills lighting up some hillsides and this was about 2 to 3 miles from where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light source seemed to zip straight away from me and I was looking towards the north west. It the seemed to turn to the left and at that point my brother and I were yelling at each other that we had to take in every second of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could just make out a slivery pinpoint that was stationary in the sky for at least 20 to 25 seconds. Then it took off and all I could see was a thin vapor trail.  However this was a vapor trail that was different from any I had ever seen.  It was heavy and dense and as it started to dissapate  it started to form a long egg shape/oval  type balloon!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then I noticed a shiny glint coming from the vehicle.  Almost like some had a silver knife at a camp ground and the sun reflected off it as you looked down from a switchback or peak of a mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right away I thought I was looking at some kind of inter-planetary space shuttle type vehicle!   My brother was also in a state of near hysteria as the vapor trail continued to expand and for 8 to 10 minutes it continued to expand as it dissapated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pin point silver object seemed to have left for a journey into space!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) and I talked, ranted and raved about what we had seen and what it could be or mean.  I do know that I did see this light coming out from a vehicle that I thought at first was a helicopter but it had a square light source and ended up taking off like a space shuttle only NOT from a launching pad strapped to 3 rocket engines!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I will always be convinced we witnessed a UFO and when ((mechanic)) and friends returned they told us they had seen the &#34;strange&#34; balloon type light that lit up the sky!  They all told us they had NEVER seen anything like it before!!<n>

The light which had a strobe or red light on it quickly disappeared to the south.  The cloud grew into a perfect sphere like the blisters around the crafts in WAR OF THE WORLDS. Then the cloud disipated. We immediately called 911 and within minutes they reported that the FAA said it was a missile fired from Vandenberg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I have seen missiles launched and this did not fit the pattern.  We could see the object and the cloud, no contrail, just this wierd cloud that looked nuclear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was afraid that it might have been just that. But it wasn&#39;t.  I do always trust what the government reports.  I have seen missile launches from White Sands and this looked different.  Any comments???????<n>

These gases left an imprint in the air....We thought it might have been the military passing but then the object disappeared and the smoke or gas remained and lit up the sky. The smoke was white and then changed to an orange color. The smoke or gases lasted for about 15 minutes. We kept walking and 20 minutes later we saw an object shaped like a ball with, this object had no smoke or lights coming form it. It was moving from west to east over old town in San Diego.  The object moved in a zig zag like movement and then started to either get smaller or higher until it totally disappeared. What was really interesting is that while the object was disappearing we could hear military jets passing by the location, probably to check on the object. If someone saw this could you please inform me. Thank you!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Vandenberg AFB missile launch.  PD))<n>

My husband went out on our balcony and called me up to see it.  I couldn&#39;t see the actual shape, and it flew in a straight line at the time I saw it, like any other aircraft.  It had a light coming from the back of it that was BRIGHT and in a V shape...(a *v* on it&#39;s side) We live close to the Santa Ana Airport and this was not ever seen before.  You could see other planes in the distance and it did not compare to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Behind it moving my head to the right it was leaving a trail.

There was a light orange trail of light behind the object that did a series of switchbacks going towards the south but staying at the same height.  In front of this meandering was a birght white light that was slowly moving upwards and leaving a trail of light behind it like a comet.  The trail of light exteneded from the switchbacks upwards.  Then the trail of light stopped and the bright light kept moving upwards and it looked like a haze shaped like a cone was behind the light.  Then all at once, it disappeared.  The meandering switchbacks of light stayed in the sky for at least 7 minutes after the bright light disappeared.  We drove west trying to see where the light was coming from and it looked to me like the trail of light started behing the White Tank Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Approaching from north to south it seemed to follow the Mogollian Rim of the moutains from Sedona To Prescott. On following the rim it came to Copper Canyon and veered to the west.  Object appeared at first sight to be cigar shaped with a greenish orange glow with what apppeared to be smoke or fog coming from behind it.  Cloud behind craft became larger as it approached the canyon.  At this point, witnesses state the the base of the cloud closest to the craft started to emit a more orange glow. At which point craft veered to the west and sighting was lost around the far side on the rim. Object appeared to be going aprox. the speed of a jet fighter.  Two witnesses were watching object from a different angle while off-roading they were facing southeast facing the mogiian rim  Female witness states that the craft was green,blue,orange,pink, and white in color at this point. No noise was emitted form the craft and no explosion was heard. Cloud appeared to be miles long.

Neighbors were walking westward down our cul-de-sac street when they passed in front our driveway and asked &#34;do you see the light in the sky?&#39;  I stepped out of the garage and walked down the driveway approximately 20 feet to the street in order to see a trail of glowing orange-white light low in the western sky.  This trail of light had a &#34;switchback&#34; appearance to it and originated in the west and traveled across the low horizon towards my location in the east.  This trail glowed quite brightly with varying intensities across the length of the trail for approximately 10-15 minutes and then slowly disipated and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Above the trail of orange-white light low in the sky appeared a very bright blue-white light traveling northeast to southwest high in the sky at a constant altitude.  This bright blue-white light illuminated an obvious and very large &#34;cone&#34; of smoke or spent gas behind it as it progressed across the sky.  This light burned much shorter than the low trail of light glowed - perhaps 5-7 minutes.  When the bright blue-white light extinguished it did so with a momentary super-intense bright white flash.  After the high, bright blue-white light extinguished the extremely large &#34;cone&#34; of smoke or gas eminating from behind the light was still visible for approximately 10 minutes until it too disipated and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout the event I was looking at the western sky with binoculars and sighted 5 aircraft that appeard to be helicopters operating along the low horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Local radio news reports broadcast on KFYI AM 550 in Phoenix, AZ reported the event as a &#34;top-secret satellite launch from Vandenburg A.F.B. in California&#34;.  I have witnessed several night launches of missles, rockets and space launch vehicles (some from Vandenburg A.F.B.) and none of these previous launches left a &#34;switchback&#34; trail of orange-white spent gasses in the atmosphere.  Further, if this was a vertical, space-vehicle launch, what explains the bright, blue-white light traveling northeast to southwest across the sky at a constant altitude and then extinguishing with a flash?  I could understand the news report as a &#34;satellite launch&#34; if the launch vehicle went out of control (creating the &#34;switchback&#34; trail of orange-white light) and the launch was pre-empted by ground control and the vehicle destroyed.  That would also explain the &#34;horziontal&#34;, northeast to southwest travel of the bright, blue-white light at a constant altitude, the &#34;cone&#34; of smoke or gas behind it and the momentary super-intense bright white flash just before the light extinguished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Vandenberg AFB missile launch.

The ray that span northwards soon had a very clear and distinct edge to it as if the light had an edge. That edge was defined and perfectly circular. I stopped the car to see if the object in the sky was moving. The light source seemed to be gradually and slowly shifting to the south about horizontally, ie. away from the beam that was emitted. Over the next couple of minutes the beam kept on growing  until it encompassed the whole horizon to the west, forming a perfect half circle in the sky. The source of light then suddenly vanished, as if it extinguished itself rather than disappeared, leaving a clearly defined wake or line in the sky where it had traveled. The half circle filled with light kept on expanding and loosing its intensity over the next few minutes. Over the horizon above Jerome the same glow of silvery light could be seen for a while longer with streaks or strands of cloud like substance. In the Verde valley over Cottonwood an unusually bright and white light also shone, filling part of the valley. These last 2 observations did not have the outer light definition described in the first occurrence. I went back to the same spot where I had observed this phenomenon the following night to confirm the 2 sources of light, one over the horizon above Jerome in the direction of Prescott valley and above Cottonwood could not have beeen attributed to light pollution from these cities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most remarkable aspect of these observations were the intensity of the light(s), the clearly defined circular edge of the beam and its expansion into a full half circle across the horizon. I had a male passenger in the car who witnessed the same as I did and several vehicles stopped along the highway to observe this ocurence. The planet Mars was also above the horizon that night and the source of light moved just below it before disappearing. The whole phenomenon lasted about 15 minutes. No photos were taken but I will email a sketch of what I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I tried to take pictures but in the excitement i couldn&#39;t get it on night mode and so the pictures came out blurry.

During this documentary a photo of an unusual occurance in the sky was shown via photograph. I immediately reacted. Myself, my husband, and my daughter had just seen the exact same occurance. I however, caught the whole incident via digital camcorder. My daughter was also taking photos whiled I was recording. The sun was set and it was dark. My husband was out cleaning the inside of his vehicle. I was out talking to him when this amazing zig zag of lights appeared in the sky. The zig zag displayed several bright colores in a trail floating behind a bright object glowing as though it was on fire. We were all amazed! None of us had seen anything like it. Even my non believing, skeptical, level headed husband was taken watching the object. I hesitated making any kind of fuss over this incident until I saw the documentary. I know what we saw cannot be explained away. It was an Unidentified Flying Object.<n>

I did not see what left the trail of lights and gases but it appeared to be in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trail itself was VERY BRIGHT white glow that graded into yellow, then deep orange, and final at the far end of the trail a dark redish-orange. The trail went in what looked like loops with a few  sparp zig-zags or &#34;V&#34; shape. the lights and gases stay visable for atleast 15 minutes that I saw but there is no telling how long it was there before I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Point of light leaves an expanding glowing pear-shaped cloud of gasses, visible in N.County San Diego.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When first seen, there was a pear shaped glowing fan of gasses behind a single bright fireball.  The fireball was moving approximately North to South.  Behind the globe of expanding gasses, there was a contrail? twisting off to the west/north-west.  The westernmost end of the twisty trail was red with the fading sunlight.  The trail became a very bright white as it got more twisty and blended into the expanding pear of gasses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about two mintes, the point of light disappeared, no new gasses were added to the pear, though it continued to expand in size and fade in intensity.  The twisty trail stayed bright for several more minutes, the colors shifting as the sun set.  After twienty mintes, nothing remain visible of the twisty trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Attempting to follow the point of light to the south, about three minutes after it disappeared, it appeared again, continueing in a straight line.  The new pear of gasses forming behind it glowed reddish (like the sunset).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My guess would be a meteor skipping across the top of the atmosphere.  The initial outgassing causing it to spin, spewing its gasses into the twisty trail.  Finally just melting away on each skip into the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the other hand, it may have been something totally else.  If you know, I&#39;d like to hear back what it really is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It occurs to me that the oldest part of the trail was the red of sunset, suggesting that it may have been low in the atmosphere.  From mid trail on, including hte initial pear of gasses, it was bright white, suggesting it was in full sunlight, not scattered throught he atmosphere.  I don&#39;t know what kind of object would do this starting at a low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Vandenberg AFB missile launch.  PD))<n>

I was headed east from harlem and while passing the park i looked up at what i thought was an airplane. The lights were situate so that when viewed from a more horizontal angle it looked just like an airplanes lights and i would have thought so with no second guessing.  Except i saw it from a more verticle angle also,and noticed an area(much larger than that an airplane would occupy) in a sort of squarish mass that seemed to be reflecting a faux sky, that was almost identical to the sky around the object, except it had a sort of glimming quality and shifted slightly like a liqued. Much like how a road is sometimes cloaked in the distance by an imagine pool of water on a hott day, is how this object was masked,except for the lights. As i drove away and to a more horizontal viewing point,i kept looking back at it, i wish i could say the exact angle it was that you could no longer notice the mirrage quality covering up its actual shape and size,but it remained for a while until i drove around 300-500 yards down the road and it appeared from the lights to be an airplane again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

From just below and to the north of Orion an extremely bright white light riveted my attention, and I watched it drop almost straight down --- slightly ENE --- disappering behind trees in the direction of the Seattle Space Needle.  The light was so bright it left a white trail momentarily.  I have seen many over the eight years I have been driving this route, but this was by far the brightest.  I reported this to 911 at 02:46.

I was walking east and as I turned the corner I saw, through some trees, what at first glance I thought was an airplane heading towards me.  Once I had a clearer view I saw two nonflashing bright white lights, arranged horizantaly, rather low in the sky.  They were clearly connected to a craft though I could not discern its shape.  The craft travelled north by north-west until it was out of sight.  The movements of the craft were unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky.  It kept a general course, but it would visibly accelerate and decelerate while veering side to side.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I looked out the car window, I saw a large black triangular aircraft flying very slowly from South to North off the counter flow highway flowing I-45 pathway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was the government was taking pictures of the blocked traffic on I-45.  I noticed a fluoresce tube light that was also shaped like a triangle on the bottom side of the craft.

We jumped into the car and went to Tennent Cemetary and it reappeared above the trees again.  It again seemed to hover and not move for some time.  The lights were all the way across the craft.  There was no sound coming from the craft.  It again dipped below the trees.  We then jumped into the car and drove to Wemrock rd. to see if it would reappear there.  It did not but what was really amazing, a shooting star shot across the sky around the vicinity where we saw it last. The only craft that I know can hover is a helicopter and it appeared to large to be that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then we noticed fast moving objects with irregular flashing light patterns moving away from flares. Objects would darken for a couple of seconds and then be up or down a large distance in an erractic pattern traveling through the sky when flashing resumed. Travel speed and rapid change of direction was inconsistent with that of normal aircraft, fighter jets do not move up and down and across the sky that quickly.  Objects would move East and West then return to center of our viewing area (facing south) occassionally two or three bright bursts of light could be seen in their trail of flight. After about 25 minutes a jet could be heard, it was fast as you would expect a fighter jet to be, the lights had a regular blinking pattern, it circled above and moved towards the blinking light objects and seemed to pursue one of them to the east horizon, the jet followed the object out of view.  The objects reappeared, there were four, more flashes went off. By this time clouds were blowing in and visability became difficult and we could no longer follow the objects visually.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It flashed so brightly it looked like a strobe light reflecting a huge area on the lake.  At the same time a small plane was over another section of lake, at the same altitude, and its lights did not cast a reflection on the water.

Appeared to have left the earth&#39;s atmosphere.  Left a trail of lights.  It was spiral shaped and really big in the sky.  The trail was bright white at the top where it was big and was red and small at the lower part.  I can hear dogs barking all around my house.  Friends a few miles away say the same thing with their own dogs and dogs in their appartment.  Many people saw it and were driving up to look at the lights.  I tried taking photos of the lights in the sky but my camera couldn&#39;t get it, sorry.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was clear. We observed an orange flare in the horizon above a mountain ridge to the northwest. It was very far in the distance, the orange hue presumably due to the sun reflection. We took a closer look with binoculars and a telescope. The best way to describe it was that it looked like a candle flame - one that you would see in a drawing or cartoon. It had the same teardrop shape and through the telescope you could see that there was a central ridge of blank dividing the two orange flares. This object moved slowly vertically into the sky, and disappeared. It was immediately followed by a second object of the same description, which appeared over the mountain ridge and then slowly ascended and disappeared. About 5 minutes later, a third object repeated this same pattern. The entire incident took about 15-20 minutes. The objects were very far in the distance. The objects moved almost directly perpendicular to the horizon, indicating that they were ascending. My best guess is that they disappeared when they reached the end point of the setting sun where the sun was no longer reflecting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It&#39;s angle was  /  , at about 1000 feet up.   I got home within 5 minutes, got binoculars and scanned the area of the cloud formation. At 3:10 the disk was in the same area, and could only be seen when the sun shined off it, about 3 seconds each time. There were 3 quick flashes as it moved and became invisible once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed too late for churchbells. I looked out the window and saw what I thought was a blimp. But it was making a whining sound by now, and it was too close/low overhead to be blimp (lower than any plane) and too small to be a blimp. I was looking out from a high floor on a building on Prospect Park West and 10th Street in Brooklyn. The UFO sailed by in a southwest direction, over Prospect Park. Now it looked to me like a cross between a small blimp and some kind of &#34;quiet&#34; helicopter--it was still making a whining sound, but MUCH quieter and nothing like the sound of a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decribed it over the phone to 911 while watching it go further southwest, over Midwood, Coney Island (approximately) and I guess out to sea (I could see the blinking lights far away).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 911 hung up on me. I called 311 and asked how to report a UFO. They said it was outside their jurisdiction. I called the FBI. The FBI said to call the FAA.

It flashed some different colors, like red, blue and green so I dismissed it as an airplane. We then pointed the telescope at the moon for a little while. When I turned back around the light was STILL in the exact place it was before. It just hung there like a star, but unlike any star I ever saw. So of course we pointed the telescope at it. When I zoomed in and got a look at it, it was sooo weird. It reminded me of a rocket ship, the way the flames shoot out of the back, except they were flashing lots of colors. There was definetly some sort of solid object in the middle. So thats all it did, stay in one place and flash red, blue and green. After taking my eye from the telescope, I noticed another one,in the same area of the sky. It was a little further away or something because it wasn&#39;t as bright, but it had the same flashy colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, after looking at it a little longer, we went inside. The next few nights we watched for it. Each night for the past 3 or 4 we have seen them in different areas of the sky. There is one out there right now. I just looked out and saw it. It&#39;s starting to get a little strange. I would like to know if it&#39;s something that can be easily explained. That would make me feel better.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 10 pm traveling north on HWY 137, north of Newport Ne. We observed two orange objects falling like flares  in an area over or north of Burke, S.D. We then came to an interchange to proceed on Rt. 12 to go west and then again in the sky to the north we observed 5 more orange objects, they were like round flares being droped from an aircraft, each one lighting up, one after the other in a horizonal line.  Then one final  large flare falling lower. Upon watching we noticed a plane was droping these flares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sending this because we read in the Norfolk paper, that someone reported seeing a flying saucer that same night. I believe that the Air Force Base in Rapid City was busy that night with practice bombing runs over the Missouri River. Might be related.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw what I thought was a helicopter hovering about 25-35 feet above the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down as it had a bright light shining. I thought it was a police helicopter searching for a suspect and given the proximity to the ground, I thought they had him cornered.  It was so close it looked as if it were going to land, so I slowed more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not hearing any noise, I opened my window and noted that there was still no helicopter sound nor the strong gust of wind from the blades and there were no police cars around or sirens.  Realizing that it was not a helicopter, I quickly sped up as I passed underneath while looking back (sideview and rearview mirrors) I traveled about 40 yards, and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then drove down and made a u-turn and looked back, nothing. I sped home, about 1/4 mile away and scanned the area, and nothing was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my son&#39;s telescope from inside (about 30 seconds to get) and came out and surveyed the area especially in the direction of the police station where the copter is kept. No helicopter, no lights, nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ITS APPEARANCE: Since I was looking for it to be a helicopter, my description will not be that good.  I noted it was large but cannot give dimensions but I could appreciate that it was blocking out more sky than it was supposed to be.  It easily spanned 2 lanes and had height.  I recall a bright light and seem to recall three, but at the time, I thought it was the police with a searchlight so I focused on 1 light and where it was shining.  I only became suspicious after noting that neither it nor my surroundings were behaving consistent with a closely hovering helicopter and it was too big.  No trees were blowing either. visibility was clear.  No clouds.  It was behaving as if someone was steering it.  Were that not the case, it would have struck the tall trees or poles near it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unusual movement:  Its movements were smooth and it moved side to side slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BTW I drive that way daily and looked for anything else that c! ould explain it.  I stand by my conclusion.  That&#39;s it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was larger with circling red lights.  This also hovered about a 1/2 mile from me.  At times the smaller one would fly at a great speed and change directions in ways our aircraft can&#39;t.  At times the larger vehicle would also do zig-zigs at a great speed and then return &amp; hover.  And just as fast as they appeared, they disappeared.

They came from Meredith, down the length of the lake over Laconia, almost over my head, and continued over Belmont headed south. There was no noise and they were closely grouped together. I watched for 5 minutes. As they were going out of view through the binoculars I noticed a 4th object, a red blinking light over the horizon of Sanbornton. In the course of one minute, the red blinking object mostly hovered above the tree tops, then shot off a white star-like object that left a white trail as it took 2 seconds to go down in the woods. Then the red blinking light went lower than the horizon, out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before the 3 white lights, I had not seen any airplanes.  After they went by, there were suddenly 4 planes headed that way.  One plane kept circling over the area the flash went down, then headed south. At 9:15 PM an orange glowing light could be seen flying slowly just above the tree line where the white flash went down into the trees, then it also went below the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At around 6:30 PM or so, I looked up at the sky (something very bright caught my attention from the corner of my eyes). As I looked up I saw this HUGE BRIGHT ROUND FIREBALL (not really a fireball, but instead a huge bright round ball). I called out to my fianceé and we saw as this ball travelled West to East at an incredible speed. It was an intense blue with pinkish hues of color. It trailed what I would describe as a fire tail. It made absolutely no sound though it was low enough we though it would crash. What really caught our attention was the intensity of its brilliance. Though it was still daylight its brilliance was greater than the daylight itself. We watched in amazement as it started to plummet downwards and all of a sudden it simply dissapeared in front of our eyes. It did not fall nor did it fly away, it just simply dissapeared in a yet brighter color than it previously had. All that was left behind was a small, thin trail of smoke. This incident was only a couple of seconds long. Did anyone else see anything on the evening of September 20, 2005 over the Florida&#39;s skies? My fianceé and I are still in shock and even asked family, friends and co - workers, no one else saw anything. What was it? It was definitely not a meteor or shooting star (too close to be that). It has been by far the scariest experience I&#39;ve had in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have to say I am a big believer in U.F.O. phenomena as my Mother had extreme experiences but I have never actually seen one until this day nor have I ever heard of this shape or color of craft.

As children we have always had the unexplainable feeling of being watched and have always looked at the stars and watched crazy things in the sky but as children we thought that was normal.  As we got older everyone said we were crazy and left at that.  But on this night I have been convinced that they are the crazy ones.  We were sitting outside late at night smoking a cigg and we noticed an object getting extremely bright and close and at first we thought it was a plane but as it got closer we could hear no sound of an engine.  Suddenly it stopped approximitly two football feilds away directly above our heads.  All we could hear was the sound of a low humming and I got the strangest feeling I have ever had in my life.  My head began to feel very light and my vision began to blur and the only thing i could focus in on was the light above our heads.  I can only explain this by saying it felt like I was on some sort of crazy drug. I was both scared and excited from what I was seeing.  then just like that it was gone, in a blink of an eye just dissapeared. I just cant get over it.  I could see how it would scare some people because it is something that hasn&#39;t been taught to us, but I just like say if they wanted to harm us I&#39;m sure they could have done it a long time ago, but like any smart person knows violence in never an answer and I have the feeling that they are very intellegent. I always have dreams about them and I&#39;m sure some of you others do to, but in my dreams they communicate with my without speaking and inform me that the eld of our world as we know it now is coming to an end and we need to prepare for it and they say they have been here on earth for a very long time and do care about it greatly.  I get the feeling they care more about this planet then we do and that is very unfortunate.  well thanks for those who listen to my experience and share theirs as well. And always remember you are not crazy and don&#39;t be too scared because they aren&#39;t here to hurt anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All other settings were set to normal or default.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While facing toward the southeast an object of light came into my field of vision on the left.

At first it looked like it was flying toward the moon, I thought maybe it was an airplane, but no noise, and lights where blinking to fast. Then I thought what is that? How weird? so I ran in side and got my binoculars and ran out the front door, and caught site of it again, a lot father away, foggy image through binoculars, looked diamond shaped small flickering colors. then it was out of sight moving so fast. Then coming the other direction I saw much closer an airplane flying toward the south, red and blue flickering lights, but much slower. and could definately make out the shape of an airplane. What was that other thing, it was going pretty fast?<n>

I wasn&#39;t playing well, and looked up and asked for help from the heavens, and noticed a star that was moving.  It looked like a regular star and it was directly above us.  We ar right under the flight path for Hartsfield-Jackson airport, so I KNOW it was not a plane, it wasn&#39;t even taking the flight path.  It moved east, made a slow turn to the north, back to the east, blinked three times, shot a little red light to it&#39;s right side, and blinked off.  In this time, we ran from the back yard, to the front yard, because of trees blocking the line of sight.   As we were returning to our game, I saw a bright light in the sky through the trees to the west, we saw a large orange/red light.  That changed from orange to red to orange.  it was moving slowly to the west, and at first, it was really bright, and then it blinked off and on, but when it turned on again, it was dimmer than when it had started, it kept getting dimmer and dimmer, and before we lost sight of it, it turned red.  it was too bug to be a star or plane, in fact, we saw several planes pass in front of it which were higher than it seemed to be, but looked much smaller than the light.  I&#39;m 2 years new to the area, so I wonder if anyone else saw this, and wonder how often this occurs in such a high air-traffic area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My window looks over a large hay field with no obstructions to the view. I watched the light which was an orange color like a sodium vapor light. There are no other lights of houses that I can see from my farm. The light appeared to move slightly and went out and I thought it was probably just an airplane. I looked again and in the same location the light was there again about 10 mintes later. It went out again when I looked. Then I looked again about 10 minutes later and I saw a sight that freaked me out. It was four orange lights in a horizontal row to the left and slighly above where the single light was. The single light was there too. The lights were round and glowing very brightly. It was a totally clear night. The moon was to the east and visible. I saw the lights stay stationary for about 30 seconds and then they just winked off completely. I kept watching and did not see them reappear. I called the Sheriff&#39;s office as I was sort of afraid and told them that I thought maybe someone was driving in my field, (but really the lights were in the sky). But I didn&#39;t want the police to think I was a nut job. But an officer came out and looked and didn&#39;t see anything, but I felt better for the reassurance. I am a teetotaler and do not take drugs. I am sober as they come! I don&#39;t even believe in UFOs. But I maybe do now! I grew up around airplanes as my dad is a pilot and I know the running lights of aircraft very well. Red port, green starboard, white strobe. These lights I saw were not running lights of a conventional aircraft. I listened for an engine and it was silent. From the closeness of the lights the craft would have been on a course to land on my house or buzz over it very closely. It is totally dark out here with no other farms around me and it was excellent visibility that night. I checked all over my field the next day and saw nothing unusual. I have seen The Northern Lights many times and it was definitely NOT that. I&#39;m an outdoors person and know the night sky very well. I have never seen anything like this before. Also after the sightings my lights flickered a bit in the house for about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Maybe you can tell me what I actually saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was pulling out of the parking lot of the college I attend and saw a sparkler type light. The best way to describe the way it moved is like a child with a Fourth of July white light sparkler moving it in their hand while walking around. That is how the light moved Monday night (9-19-05, 9:00 pm). When I first saw the light I thought, “That is not an airplane light.” The light was not moving straight and slow or straight and fast  or hovering, it was jagged, jerking movement, at a medium pace speed. It went over the college parking lot and headed toward the town. A few times it looked as though the light had stopped and then comeback like it was losing power.  I followed it to the end of the college drive and turned the opposite way, thinking no one will believe me anyway if I tell them about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered if it was a meteorological device or some sort of radio-controlled camera. I could not justify those descriptions because the light was so bright and it literally was a giant sparkler.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft was over a residential area just on the border of a farm/Field. I notice that the plan must have been coming directly toward us since it did not appear to be moving. As we got closer to the object I told my girlfriend that it was not moving...She laughed and a moment later said &#34;Oh my God, it&#39;s not moving. I started to get closer and closer to the object. At my closest point I was across the street slowed down to about 15 mph. The craft seemed to be maybe 500 to 1000 feet over the tree line. It was hard to tell since it was dark, and since I could not see the body of the craft I had no frame of reference. As we got closer to the craft I put my window down and was amazed that I didn&#39;t hear a sound for such a low flying object. The craft appeared to be just staying in place. It was three lights directly across from one anther and what possible appeared to be a faint light in the back forming a &#34;T&#34;. The back light was so dim I&#39;m not sure I even saw it. Now to me this seems to be the standard shape of a plane. Under any normal situation I would pass it off as such, but the lack of movement almost made it eerie. Since it is a busy street I had to keep moving. I got to the next light less than a quarter mile and way and did a U-Turn. When I got back to the area there was nothing. This was a strange event but at the same time very exciting. I&#39;m a big time skeptic but this I had trouble explaining. I was hoping I was not the only one that saw it...I will check the local paper in the morning to see if there is any news on the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Moon was rising to my left.  I saw two lights south of the moon.  At first, I thought they were planes, and my next thought was &#34;My God, they are way too close...&#34; Even as I had the though another pair of light flashed on, and then another.  They were motionless in the sky.  The cirle of each of their light growing in intensity and size, while each pair of lights maintained the same distance from each other. Then they flared out light the aperature of a lens closing on them.  There seemed to be some sort of irregular &#34;starshine&#34; or twinkle.  I believed my 11 year old son to be sleeping and looked over at him only to see 2 pairs of the lights at their brighter intensity, joined by another pair.  Seeing he was awake, I asked him if he was seeing what I was seeing.  He said yeah, what is it?  The lights were lined up now like on a circular edge and gave the impression of revolving on that edge. The one on the left going on as the one on the right came on at the same intensity.  It gave the impression of an object turning.  Suddenly the light just diod that closing down to nothing and out thing and were gone. The lights were between 100 and 250 feet in the air and out over an open field.  There were no buildings, streelights, roads, etc. visible.  There were no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

DEFINITLY under intelligent control. utterly silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lying down in a local park, looking at the stars, I witnessed what seemed to be a BOOMERANG shaped craft cross the sky directly overhead. The craft had no lights, but was quite large and easy to spot if one were to know where to look for it. Also the moon was just coming up over the horizon and was nearly full which is probably how I managed to see the craft, in addition to watching the backdrop of stars blink in and out as it traversed the sky. To get an idea of the size and scale I was looking at, extend your hand out above your head, and then create a distance of 3 or 4 inches between thumb and index finger.  The craft was definitly under intelligent control and moved from North to South/Southwest.  The craft was utterly silent. No sound whatsoever that I could hear.  It appeared to be dark in color, roughly matching the color of the night sky, though just slightly lighter and greyer. I watched the craft traverse the sky overhead in a straight line for between 8-10 seconds, until I could no longer make it out against the night sky.  Various other airplanes (with required lights of course) were in the area, as usual. None appeared to me to take notice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are three possibilities for what it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.  Could have been a glider flying at night (but I still think it was boomerang shaped) 2.  Black military project.  Stealth? 3.  Unknown craft guided by unknown intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a similar, yet very different sighting about 7 or 8 years ago in october with a friend, of another silent craft that moved directly over our heads to the point that it filled half of the visible sky.  Huge. only very tiny discreet lights. Could not identify shape due to close proximity. 6 second sighting as it crossed directly overhead from left to right(and again North to South) over the allyway we walked down.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/19/05 20:15|Portage (near)|WI|Light|Around a Hour or so|Lights in the sky around Portage seen on HWY 51|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46392.html|236|ndxe200509| Lights in the sky around Portage seen on HWY 51<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were traveling on US HWY 51 North in the Portage area (we had just filled up at the Portage Quick Trip), when, just above the trees, we noticed several bright lights that looked almost the color and size of streetlights. They would wink on like someone powering up a 12 volt bulb with a 6 volt battery (kind of slow to intensity).  At first we thought we were seeing the blinking of a tower through the trees so we didn&#39;t pay them too much attention.  But then we saw them again, after our line of sight cleared the trees, we realized the lights were not from a tower. Our next thought was landing lights from several planes because we noticed there was an abnormal amount of planes flying in the area.  That struck us as odd if it were true because why would aircraft fly so close to one another and why would they flash the landing lights (not the green and red clearance lights on the wings).  Plus, they would have to all be facing us pretty much exactly the same direction for them to all be the same intensity, there were about 7- or 8 of them in a somewhat straight line four or so on top and perhaps three or four below spaced perhaps a finger width apart from one another (it was hard to tell if there was a pattern because we were in the car going 65- 70 mph).   As we drove on for about 6 to 8 miles we saw them again in approximately the same position as before which told us one of two things, either the lights were moving our same direction, or they were much higher up then they appeared. We saw them several times again sometimes by themselves sometimes in a group, so we thought we could possibly photograph them with our digital camera (they were occurring very often).   We pulled off the Hwy in a rest stop and got out of the car and counted about 5 airplanes circling in the area.   We then realized the planes were not civilian, they were way too fast and flying very tight maneuvers, plus they would all come very close to one another at all different directions and when they converged that&#39;s when we would see the lights flash, we then realized the lights were not the planes, but the planes (we now could hear them) were converging on whatever was making the lights. We tried to get a picture of the lights but with the almost full moon and the streetlights in the wayside we couldn&#39;t.  There was a white minivan in the parking lot in front of us watching the lights as well.  After about 35 minutes or so we didn&#39;t see them anymore and the jets eventually flew away (in a small formation) so we left too.<n>

About a 45 degree angle as I was traveling south on Highway 22. They appeared quite large. It looked like they were some distance apart but in the same line horizontally. The lights were quite bright in the darkened sky (just before the moon rose)and very noticeable. These bright lights went out as quickly as they appeared, like shutting off a light bulb. But they went out simultaneously about a half a second apart. I watched the sky for the next hour as I continued to travel south to Pardeeville in Columbia County.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There is slight cloud cover tonight but a breaking over our apartment, stars still slightly visible through the cover.  I was sitting in my patio chair - noticed a bright white light, not flickering, slightly brighter than the north star.  Got up out of my chair to take a look at it, did a TRIPLE take as I thought it was slightly moving - used a much dimmer star next to it as a point of reference. It was definitely moving UP, as in, out of the atmosphere, because I was almost looking straight up at this point.  I kept looking at is as it got dimmer and dimmer and smaller until it had finally faded out into darkness.  It was almost as if it was a shooting star (not quite as bright but close) but going UP instead of down to earth..never seen anything like this before.  There were no visible blinking lights, it was definitely large because a few minutes after it had passed there were other airplanes and such, and even with MORE cloud cover and they had been farther away, the blinking lights were quite visible.  This all took place within about 30 seconds, it had to have been moving very fast to shrink/darken that quickly while moving up..I am kicking myself that I did not come out to have a smoke a minute sooner, I may have caught more.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

For 20 seconds I watched what I thought looked like the back end of a plane, but as I watched it, it moved and appeared to change shape. Then clearly seen was a large silver-white disk, for about 15 seconds, then just disappeared without moving. I believe it was still hovering but became invisible because the cloud next to it was being blown by the winds, decreasing the reflection ability.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Now I know I have never before seen something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving, I looked up and a bright light was in the sky. The sky was perfectly clear. The light was very bright and appeared to be stationary. It was about the apparent size of Venus, which I thought odd since it was 8:30 in the morning and definitely not a star or planet.  When the light faded I observed a shape that looked like a pill capsule and silver-grey in color with no lights that I could detect on the object. It started moving to the South East. It moved in &#34;spurts&#34; moving a bit and then not moving, and then moving and then not moving, etc. in a straight line. There seemed to be a very light trail, like an exhaust, left behind it when it moved, but this did not linger. It was moving towards the east-south east and disapeared fading out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving when I saw this and knew that it was in vain to try and catch up to it, but I didn&#39;t think to pull over and watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like an extremely bright shooting star, but it was traveling up at about a 10 degree angle to the horizon and much slower than a meteorite. after about 30 seconds of travel, the tail disappeared. The red round light traveled for about 4 minutes at a very slow speed. I got my camera phone ready to take a pic and the tail started to form again. This time the object took off at an extremely fast speed up and toward the east. I waited for a while to see if there were any more signs of the object but saw nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/18/05 23:30|Mequon|WI|Oval|30 minutes|Oval objects with red lights fly at sporadic rates of speed and change direction seemingly randomly.|10/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47096.html|250|ndxe200509| Oval objects with red lights fly at sporadic rates of speed and change direction seemingly randomly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> September 18, 2005  My backdoor neighbor and I where outside talking and taking a walk through my field at night (11:30pm) and I noticed a fast paced moving object to the north-east with  a red blinking light.  It seemed to be in outer space, and I thought it was a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I soon realized it was moving at &#34;sporadic&#34; rates of speed, it would stop, and go, and change direction seemingly randomly.  After raising and lowering from about 40 degrees in the sky to 30 degrees in the sky again at sporadic rates of speed for about five minuets, it started to move to the west, to the point I was looking north at it, where it stopped and held its place for about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were very few small clouds that night, and one of them happened to be passing over the moon which was bright.  I could see the object more clearly when the moon was covered, and spotted two (2) more crafts approaching from the east.  At this time I was under the impression that they were in our atmosphere, and I could see more detail, they seemed to be oval in shape, and possibly metallic in color, and slightly reflected the moons light when the red blinking lights paused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object was holding its ground while they moved from my east to north field of view, and as the second and third object held speed at my approximation of over 300 MPH or at about the speed of a jet.  The first object instantly picked up speed and traveled in triangular formation with the other two seamlessly, as they did not hesitate or slow down.  They then seemed to grow brighter, or move closer to my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could make out a fourth ship, which came from under the tree line/horizon and did not follow in formation instead rising in the sky and movingly slightly North East.  The first three objects continued to move to my west, where they stopped, and the third most eastern object would stray off to a random direction and the other two would then lag behind for milliseconds, then have to keep up with the third ship to keep formation.  The fourth object was moving sporadically in all directions, at different speeds, ranging from very a halt to faster than an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fourth object then moved behind one of the clouds in the sky, and then reappeared on the other side as it traveled South East.  The first three objects were hovering about 30 degrees over the horizon.  The fourth object then was flying south to the point where I had to look away from the first three objects, where I could not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first three objects then started to move east, and I could see them more clearly then ever. They had three (3) red lights, seemingly moving as if electrons around an atom, around the ship, pulsing or blinking at different seemingly random rates and times.  They then moved south, and seemed to get more distant as if flying upward.  They continued to grow fainter over the last five minuets, as they moved south and lower in the sky below the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects did not produce any apparent smoke, or exhaust or a trail of any kind, nor did they make any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Abruptly afterwards I called my friends that live 30 miles north east of me and told them to look for them, and to my surprise they had been watching them for the last thirty minuets as well, and told a very similar story to mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This could not have been a hallucination; I was of well state of mind and sober, as well as all witnesses.<n>

I only saw it for a couple of seconds. I was running back home to grab something for my husband, and a &#34;thing&#34; started to quickly shuffle from one side of my house, to the end of my garage, and back into the woods, I suppose. he was about 15 feet away from me. mid-walk, he turned to look at me. I looked like the so called &#34;grey&#34; alien, yet short, and I got the feeling of fear from it. It had a quite wrinkled forehead, black eyes, with very small whites of his eyes showing... he seemed also to have wrinkles or bags in other places, its head was somewhat large. they were very large eyes though. its nose was small, and somewhat flared out. he was a gray or whiteish color, as was his cloak/hooded robe, that covered most of its body. it made a quiet sound. maybe it was trying to eat from my trash? My brother said he saw the same exact creature, saying &#34;whoa, there is a little weird dude with a hoodie on out back&#34; My family is quite scared as of now, I do not think it left, and we heard the same noise, but a little louder, comming from a diffrent direction. when I saw it at firsty, I did not acknowledge it was there for a second... It was like, I was freaking out in my brain, wanting to scream, but kept walking, like I couldnt help it... very scared and frustrated here..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to get a damn investigator out here, but somewhat afraid of what might happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> did anyone sight a crash of some sort???<n>

It was not blinking and was very bright and moving pretty slowly.  There was an airplane (jet) in the sky at the same time and it&#39;s light was blinking and was nowhere near the size as this light...that is how I could tell that it was not an aircraft.  I figure maybe it was a sighting of the International Space Station?  Anyway, it disappeared into the clouds but the brightness could still be seen for a few more seconds thru the clouds.  That is how bright it was.  And compared to the plane that was in the sky at the same time it was significantly larger than the plane and definitely a cigar shape...longer than a jet (from grounds-eye)and much, much brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The way the light look like a solid red ball but no blinking/no movement this is a major flight corridor into midway airport so I am used to seeing planes come and go 100 times a day sometimes. This light looked rather odd, then I ran in to get binoculars came out and it was gone. However in this same vicity in the Bolingbrook, Planfield area I have seen similar lights sitting moving a little side to side then blinking out this happened twice in the last two months. Hope this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

For roughly 10 minutes it did not change position then it moved at a medium pace (under 400mph) what appeared to be several miles to the east never changing altitude.  The visual size of the object indicated it was much to high to be a helicopter and since it was hovering for several minutes it was not a plane, my mother in law thought it was a kite, but the distance it covered was much further than would have been possible with a kite even at high altitude.  It did not change elevation at any time that it was witnessed only physical position in a course from west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As soon as we met at the airport at 2pm, she excitedly told me, she saw something very dodgy from the plane as her flight was coming into the north eastern coastline of the UK at approx 1pm (she landed at the airport at 13:41). Just out at sea she spotted between 5 to 7 orange round objects...I have below the story in her own words...<n> <n><n> <n><n> When she told me, I checked on the Net to see if there were any other similar reports in the same region and around the same time...Needless to say, I was excited to read of the reports also coming from the east of England of multiple orange discs on the 17th, the previous day to my girlfriend&#39;s sighting. Do you know if anyone else also witnessed her sighting on the 18th September?  My Girlfriend&#39;s report......<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;On 18th September I was flying from Prague to Edinburgh. The sky got cloudy somewhere over the Netherlands. Over the Channel the clouds were a bit torn. I felt sleepy as I had to get up at 4am that morning and didn&#39;t get to sleep too well at night. And seeing just clouds became a bit boring after a while. Also my seat was at the window but near the wing, so the wing and the engine took a lot of my view. If I wanted to see something, I had to lean forward and look out of the farther window. So only occasionaly I looked out to see if we are still over the continent or over the sea or approaching Britain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then around 1pm (GST) I looked out again and saw we were still over the sea. There was a gap between clouds so I could see the sea. Down, deep under me I could see some round orange things. They looked like round rubber life boats on the sea. There were 7 of them. They seemed to be floating on the sea surface. They were moving slowly and then when the left most circle got into its position, I noticed that they created a perfect boomerang shaped formation. That attracted my attention. Creating the formation, they were moving quite fast for something that big on the sea. I could swear that at the beginning they were a bit scattered but now they were very much giving an impression of a single body. That perfect the formation was. I started thinking of an invisible delta aircraft and really, apart from the orange spots I couldn&#39;t see anything between them. Was it a military training? I tried to have a better look to identify what it was but suddenly there were two white clouds bursting out of two of the circles like an explosion and all the formation, like one body, moved forward with great acceleration leaving just two short white double lines behind. The lines were short, just about double the height of the triangle. As a space craft getting enough speed just from a short fire. At high speed all the formation disappeared under the cloud and I had the feeling that it wanted to hide, not to be seen. I hoped that it would come out on the other side of the large cloud before the engine and the wing cover my view, but it didn&#39;t. After the cloud I saw a ship, looked big, at least like a ferry, maybe bigger. And still the length of the ship would make only about two thirds of the side of the boomerang. And the circles were slightly bigger in diameter than the width of the ship. So the object must have been huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after we approached the East coast of Britain and 1.40pm we were landing at the Edinburgh airport.&#34;<n>

Then I looked up and saw someting Ive never seen before it was a gray saucer/oval like disc kinda moving in one spot in the air. It was gray and had huge lights that were square and orange. (Very bright) Then a red car pulled over on the side of the road along with the black truck and was also looking at this site. Then all of a sudden it just like moved up a few notches and dissapared. It was plain of day right in the sky wasnt cloudy or any thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While sitting I viewed a strange light in the atmosphere coming from west to east. In the beginning I thought, this is a shooting star, but first there was no fire tale (as usual) and second, it was moving very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched more carefully and I found out this strange phenomenon was not ONE but TWO lights very close it’s other, one in the front and the other little bit back and the side. The sky was very clear, no clouds, no satellites and especially no planes. All this lasted 10 to 15 seconds until it disappeared in the horizon. I am sure that agnostic optical phenomenon under my analyze, it was UFOs!!!<n>

They lasted for about half of one second each and had less than half a second in between them. The sky was obscured by clouds at the time so all that could be seen was the illumination of the clouds. It was similar to lightning but there was no sound and although the frequency was consistent with lightning the duraion mentioned above makes it inconsitent with normal weather patterns in this region. The lack of sound also makes it unlikley to be lightning. The light seemed to originate from an easterly direction possibly just beyond Walton Jail. The light was so bright that surrounding buildings were alluminated as if it were daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It passed over head and then turned slightly and headed northeast until it was completly out of sight in the sky.It flickered a little bit as if it was fire burning. There were no blinking lights on it and it appeared the same from all sides just a perfect ball of light. No sound! It moved at the same steady speed the entire time. When it was gone we turned back around to where we first saw itr and there was another one exactly the same and traveled the indentical path of the first one. We waited for a third for over an hour but it never came. When we got home we called the police first just to see if there were any reports of this and the officer who answered the phone said that they had recieved a number of calls and that officers on the beat around the town &#34;had been seeing them all night&#34;.

9/17/05 23:00|Rockaway|OR|Light|20 sec|Bright lights in the sky over the ocean.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46760.html|265|ndxe200509| Bright lights in the sky over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were camping at Barview Jetty Camp ground just north of Tillamook Oregon.   Our camp was about 100 yard from the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting around the campfire at about 11:00 when out of the corner of my eye I saw what looked like a bright star over the ocean.   When I turned to look at it the light grew to an enormous size and it was extremely bright.  If you were to take a nickel and hold it at arms length at about 45 deg into the sky that will give you a bit of prospective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to the kids &#34; What the heck is that?&#34;   As the kids turned to look, another light appeared right next to it to the right.  Not quite as big and bright as the first one but still pretty bright. Then another one, and another one and another one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So hanging over the ocean were five balls of light that were lined up horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then from left to right and fairly quickly they went out one by one. I’m thinking to myself let be logical about this.  It must have been a flare or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we ran down to the beach to find other people standing by the ocean staring at the sky.  I immediately realized that the boats that were out off shore were very small compared to the lights we just saw and that the lights had to be at a pretty high altitude.  These were gigantic lights in the sky!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked up to a couple that was standing down by the water and asked them if they ad seen the light.  They said that they did and that’s why they were there.  Then the girl said that this was the second time she had seen them. She said that the first time was a few minutes earlier up north of where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then it happened again down the beach over the jetty.  Same thing with the big bright light and the other four that followed.  It hung there for about 10 seconds and the disappeared from left to right again.  We all stood there looked at each other with no explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5-10 minutes my daughter noticed two faint red lights coming right towards us from straight out over the ocean.  They were very tiny and silent and they went right over the top of us inland.   We decided that they were probably air force jets at I would say about 10-15 thousand feet<n> <n><n> <n><n> Were they doing something out there or chasing something?  All I know is that the small red lights were tiny compared to the other ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pretty Bizarre!  Wish I had a video camera with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

At the times of these sightings i ranged in age of 17-19 years old. If there is any doubt as to my credibility, i assure you i have nothing to gain from wasting my time with a false report. I am however completely astonished to see that other people in Havre, MT have had VERY similar accounts on dates that i very well could have been seeing the same thing! So i apologize that the dates are not accurate, but the account however is most definately accurate, as i can best recount.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most vivid memory i have of these fireballs was not my first, but i must however tell the story of the first sighting of these so called fireball or bright light. So it happened that me and my very best friend, who is also witness to this and a few other sightings, were driving northeast on what would be an unmapped dirt road on a state map, but the locals all know this as a network of back roads connecting local amish (hudderites) communities and leading to the highway that goes to canada. So here we are driving on this dirt road, staring at the stars above and smoking like chimneys just enjoying the company, when we decided we had better turn around as this dirt road goes forever, and we didnt intend on going the full route. Upon turning around and driving for sometime we approached over a hill and i noticed something i definately didnt see going the other way. Now over this hill the landscape evened out, as is common in the hilly area of havre, and i asked my friend if she saw it, and what she thought of it. Open minded as we are, we speculated that it must be a light up on a pole on someones farm. Still stopped we stared for some time at it, it was noticeably brighter and more orange than a streetlamp, or a light on a pole at someones farm might be, just a little fireball with consistent edges that didnt move. However upon careful consideration this light had to be up higher than any light on a pole could be, and way too low to be a star, and too bright for that matter, and too orange. That kind of gave me the creeps, especially that it was hovering in the southern sky, same direction as where i live, and the road i got to travel home alone on. The both of us would recount this story nearly the same, storytelling ability aside, i have given my best memorial account of this event....which led to many other sightings of exactley the same object, and this most noteable one i will share with you next.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the first sighting, it  must have been early before winter, as it was cold, or i would have got out, and before there was snow on the ground. However i clearly remember this most memorable sightings season, as there was plenty of snow, and everything was white, making a nice white horizon off in the distance where the hills rolled off into the beaver creek park. This time me and my best friend, again at night, anywhere between 9pm-12am, were traveling on this dirt route forementioned in my previous account, i noticed there were three lights off in the distance, and in the same area as the previous sights to a tee, now i had seen three lights before in a straight line formation, however they never moved. Now this time me and my friend were already stopped when we both realized the lights at the same time, they were going to dance for us. One, two, three lights spaced evenly apart all jumped up, leaving a tail that dissipated, to a higher location, and jumped then to a lower location, that was lower than where they were at initial sighting, this happened rather quickly, the jumps taking about 3 seconds a piece. After each jump the lights would all disappear and then reappear, it was like as the tail faded so did the light. It was a pattern obviously. Appear, jump leaving a tail, disappear, reappear in new location. In that order. Now as they are appearing and reappearing and whatnot, im telling my friend to flash the car lights at them, like maybe we could get a response. To no avail, but it was worth a shot, in my opinion they were obvlivious to us. They did eventually blink out, they did not appear to travel away, as in get further away then closer, they stayed at the same distance away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now i grew up in Havre and was always fascinated by its bright sky with so much going on in it, and it was all visible. Over the years there are certain things you see all the time. Sattelites, jets, planets that are brighter on certain days, meteor showers, every cosmic even that goes on in our horizon is visible to us, because thats the beauty of Montana. I say this so that i can distinguish to you that i have the common knowledge to differentiate between something explainable to us, and something that is not. These fireballs are to me one of many things, one is it is possible alien spacecraft, manned, or unmanned, who knows. It could be military training, or military related, as there are Nuclear bombs all along the hi-line from what i hear, not sure if any in the immediate Havre proximity, but theres alot of land out there, and i know of one you can see on the way to great falls. What if those lights are what cause crop circles? I was always interested to know weather or not the local farmers ever had one appear. What if this is actually a craft lifting off or studying something. It could be one craft or many crafts. If its one craft it would have to be a very bright, small craft. If it is one, then it would have to be dark and those would have to be its lights, but im only speculating at this point, relaying what goes through my mind when i recount this memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now i hope this helps other locals out there, and i encourage all to share theyre stories of weird lights over montana. What a perfect place to see a UFO, so clear and so much unused land. Just like new mexico and nevada, there is alot of unused land. Could the government be using it? Speculating again, ahh what can i say to a wandering mind when it comes to matters like this. Thanks all for listening. -Smartone<n>

It looked bigger than the stars, a little ways above the tree line.  It appeared and disappeared quickly.  It was a bright green glowing ball that seemed to fall extremely fast and disapper, but it was a big ball, and appeared in the night sky out of nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at my friend, who was driving, and facing the same way.  She looked shocked and said &#34;did you see that?!&#34;  &#34;The light?&#34; I asked her.  &#34;That green light!&#34;   We both saw the exact same thing.

We both looked up to see a very bright white light moving quickly from the south to north directly overhead. The light was steady, with no flashing or other colors.  After about 3 seconds the light suddenly dimmed to the brightness of a semi-bright star, then after about 2 more seconds went out completely.  We continued to watch that portion of sky for the next couple of minutes, but no other lights appeared.  There were no aircraft in that area, and this object made no sound.  There were no trails behind the object, and it moved much faster than typical aircraft we are used to seeing, but not nearly as fast as a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They traveled across the sky for around 25 minutes then appeared to stop. We watched them for about another 20 minutes before heading inside to the front of the building. Upon ariving there, the lights had dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was clear of clouds except for the distant horizon (West) which had clouds only at the base of the sky, and behind us there was a small bank of clouds through which the nearly full moon had just risen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we scanned the western horizon above remnants of the sunset, two of us saw 4, perhaps 5 repetitions of a light show.  We saw a row (once two separate rows) of very bright yellow-orange lights, large rectanglular &#39;panels&#39; of light perhaps 4 times as tall as they were wide, in a regular horizontal row.  One of these phenomena involved two rows of lights next to each other, but not in the same-dimensional plane -- as if there were two objects giving off light that were not level with each other.  The # of &#39;light panels&#39; we saw at any given time varied from three to seven altogether; the time we saw seven there was a gap or space of darkness which provided a marker and it was as if the lights were slowly rotating out of sight on the right hand edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were out over the ocean, perhaps 3 to 5 miles, about 15 or 20 degrees above the horizon from our vantage point.  There were no other lights visible before, during or after we saw these lights (no running lights).  No Sound we could hear above the surf.  The lights were on, very bright light like looking through ports into a blast furnace, for 20 to 30 seconds, and they did not move, remained stationary in the sky, and then they would all turn off at once.  The second set of lights was WNW or so, then the two sets of lights next to each other again due West, then one at WNW again, and finally one light due West down closer to the surface of the water that I saw with peripheral vision, only briefly.  From one sighting to the next, the lights appeared in a different part of the sky, but at the same height, and after a 30 second to 1 minute pause.  We never saw the outlines of craft, or saw the lights move at all when they were on.  One of those times, my partner saw the lights reflect off the surface of the ocean, not as if searchlights, but just that the light was so strong and bright it clearly reached the water and bounced back up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this happened within a span of 5-7 minutes, then it stopped.  From that distance, we estimate these lights were something like 4 feet wide and 10 feet tall @ 2-3 miles away: they were huge and very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background: I practice Chinese Medicine; my friend is a Policy Analyst in state government.  We were camping, and did not see anyone else around us at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Knowing there was no airport around we watched it fearing it was going to crash when it suddenly came to a complete stop and appeared to be hovering.  It had 3 bright nonflashing lights in the shape of a triangle and there was no noise.  We watched the craft while driving due to no place to pull over.  We stopped at a light and we really don&#39;t know what happened, it either moved quickly or turned off the lights.  A few moments later about 5 miles down the road in Cecil County, MD we noticed a large military cargo plane doing about a 15 mile radius circle around the two counties flying low as if it were searching for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object appeared to be coming towards the shore and was slightly bigger than Venus (which was to the left of the object in the sky). About 3 or 4 minutes after I first noticed the light, it all of the sudden split up into 5 separate orb-like lights...all spread out in a line parallel to the ocean. The lights stayed in the formation for around 5-7 seconds and then got brighter and faded out one at a time from left to right. Less than a minute later the light appeared again and did the same thing, only this time splitting into 4 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several people came over to see if we saw what they saw and to talk about what it could have been. We quickly ruled out the possibility of it being a flare considering that it was in the air for so long. Has anyone else seen anything like this?<n>
9/17/05 19:44|Newnan|GA|Cigar|1-2 minutes|A stubby oblong/circular shaped UFO sighting occured over Newnan GA 40 minutes south of Atlanta.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46361.html|275|ndxe200509| A stubby oblong/circular shaped UFO sighting occured over Newnan GA 40 minutes south of Atlanta.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of last Saturday, Sep 17, 2005, I decided to go out to eat dinner at my favorite Chinese place in Newnan GA, a medium size working-class town about 40 minutes south of Atlanta GA on Interstate 85. I had just arose from a 45 minute nap, and felt relaxed, with a little grogginess from the nap. I left my home in the extreme north tip of Coweta County, driving South on Fisher Road. I turned right onto Hwy34 and started going West to Newnan GA. I arrived in the vicinity of Andy Lewis car dealership around 740 PM EST, which is in the eastern part of Newnan. I stopped at a stoplight there. This is a busy part of Newnan, and a busy time of the week, and there was quite a lot of traffic going both ways through the junction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While sitting there, at the light, facing West, waiting for the light to change, I noticed someting moving up in the sky. I could see it through the top portion of my car&#39;s windshield.  The movement caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object would have been a little further North and West of my position.  It was about at the &#34;1:00 High&#34; position, using the old WW2 terminology. It appeared to be a couple of  thousand feet up. It was shaped with an oblong or short-stubby-cigar shape. It was moving from right to left (North to South), at a moderately slow rate. It did not look like a bird, helicopter, large plane, small plane, or anything else I&#39;ve ever seen. In disinct contrast with the hazy fading summer afternoon light, the object&#39;s color appeared to be a solid very dark or black color. I could not detect any patterns or lights on the object. Nor did the object emit any light, or any other extraordinary emittance. It was just up there, moving from right to left at a lesurely pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did see the object turn or sort of bank once or twice, and then its shape changed from the stubby oblong shape to a distinct circular shape, like a Frisbee or dinner plate. When it banked back the other way, I think I saw 2 stubby fins on the top. Due to its height, the hazy quality of the light, the objects extremely dark color, and my lack of binoculars, it was impossible to see any further details. I also checked my watch, and it was 7:44PM EST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this time, the traffic light changed, and my lane had to move. I continued driving west. I did not see the object fly off, zoom away, or disapper, but my automobile reached the point where I could no longer view that part of the sky through the windshield. It was more or less directly over my position, at that point, and I could not see it. At no time did I feel afraid or threatened, just very curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued driving West to Walmart where I withdrew some money from the ATM machine, and then decided to drive back to where I had seen the U.F.O., to see if it was still there. I did not feel afraid, or threatened, just very curious. By that time, it was 8:00 PM EST. I drove east, on the same road, looking out the windows and scanning the skys for the object. I continued looking for the object as I reached the point where I had been a few minutes earlier. I drove on past that spot, and kept on going, still looking. But the object had dissapppeared, and I never saw it again. I then made a U-turn, going on to my favorite Chinese place, where I enjoyed dinner. AFter dinner, I went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background? I am a 43, almost 44 year old, white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, unmarried male. I have a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a technology field, and have been in computer systems admin for about 19 years. Some people have called me a &#34;smart guy&#34;. I work a 40 hr/week job as a computer systems administrator for a major branch of the Federal Govt in Atlanta. At the time of the sighting, I was in a relaxed, typical Saturday afternoon frame of mind. I was thinking only of pulling out some money, and then eating Chinese.  &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34; were the **furthest thing** on my mind. I consider myself a &#34;realist&#34;; I do believe that many UFO&#39;s, perhaps most can be explained by a reasonable rational explanation; yet I also recognize a spiritual dimension that can manifest supernatural out-of-the-ordinary occurences and that cannot be measured with instruments. This is the first real UFO I have ever seen with enough clarity to report it; yet I am not a &#34;UFO nut&#34;; I never read UFO books, or magezines, or anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(Thought I could get some nice cloud shots) The sun was just beginning to go down.  It was still pretty light outside.  When I looked at the view picture on the camera I saw these.  We could not see them at all with the naked eye.  I was just blindly pointing up and clicking.  So I did it again and again until they were gone. I never thought I&#39;d ever get pictures like this.  It was just strange because you could NOT see these lighted objects with the naked eye.  Only when we looked in the preview screen did we see them. I have played around with the program I have installed on my computer and I can definitely tell that these ARE mechanical objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46587.html|278|ndxe200509| Object caught on camera over the Great Wall of China<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live here in Beijing China with my family as an expat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently my brother and his wife visited us and we took them for a day trip to the Great Wall of China.  It was a clear sunny day, and we found a great place for a photo opportunity.  We asked a passer by to take a snap shot using my 5.2 Meg Pixel Sony digital camera and my brother also asked the person to take a snap shot with his camera.  Firstly a picture was taken using my camera and approx. 10 seconds later the same snap shot using my brothers camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a lovely day and nothing unusual was seen by any of us during the walk of the wall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got home, we were keen to look at all the pictures we had taken.  It was then, that I spotted an object over the mountains taken on my camera by the passer by.  The object is clearly visible and in the distance over the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have showed a number of people, and they are mystified what it could be.  I had no intentions of reporting it, until a work colleague told me their had been a number of witnesses who had spotted an object which was reported in the local press.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have attached the picture for reference. The object is in the far top right hand side of the photo.  You can zoom in, and it is clearly disc shaped (although a little blurred).  It almost looks like their is a white light from the base of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the photo provided by the witness.  Our suspicion is that the object may be a bird, but that is pure conjecture, on our part.<n>

Light was seen by others hours before moving above the lake in figure eight motion.  When I saw the lights, the sky was clear and bright due to a full moon.  I was standing on a patio in the middle of town with approximately 30-50 people, who all saw the same thing.  It flew right over us and they appeared to be half the size of the moon and were very bright and silent.  There is no way to tell exactly what they were. After they did figure eights they went back into formation, headed west and got smaller and then dissapeared.  I do not believe that there is a man made craft that can fly in such a motion.  They were moving slowly, so I got in my car with a friend to try to chase them down, but they were no where to be found.  These objects have been seen in this area by others over the last couple of weeks, during different hours of the night.  I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was just a plane or hellicopter, but it seem to just sit there. I called to my grandson,, and went to get the binoculars, but we couldn&#39;t make it out. it seem to drift and bobble closer and closer for a long while then it went higher and higher. the color seem to dim as it got closer, but as I write, I can still see it, but now just looks like a bright star. I saw the same thing about a month ago, but it shot throught the air and disappeared similar to a meteor. I never heard of a meteor at that time on the news.

I went outside alone for a minute, then went inside to get a counselor.  A counselor and another camper came out and watched it with me for about 10 minutes. A triangle hovered above trees, went back and forth, went down a little bit, then went back up, and three corner lights were flashing red, blue, white.  There were little blue lights around the outline of the triangle, like Christmas lights, but the kind in a tube.  It didn&#39;t make any noise.  It turned on its beam from underneath. It didn&#39;t shine all the way to the ground at first. It would shut off and turn on quickly and shine closer to the ground, the beam was slowly dropping down. When the light was off it just looked like a black hole in the middle. The beam stayed on a long time, almost the whole 10 minutes. It was over the woods, maybe over the river. There was something the beam was shining on, like a star, it didn&#39;t move, it didn&#39;t go up in the beam, it just shined on it.  Then the beam shut off and the triangle shot right up into the air faster than a bullet and was gone.&#34; I checked with the counselor before we left for home, he confirmed the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Everything depends on where you live and are watching from. Please read this full document and visit my domain for more information. Millions in the Western Hemisphere are watching this portal since my August 27th Press Release thanks to KOMO Channel 4 Seattle, WA    The red UFO images are only to show where to look, you will only see, with your eyes, three very small, glowing red alien security craft that are there 24/7. They look like laser dots, if you’ve seen a laser pin, that is all you will see, if you can see them from your location. As the earth rotates to the south, this location stays in its location under the Star Arcturus. It can be seen by other countries during spring, summer, fall and winter. Ask your local weather news station when it will be available for viewing in your area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your request.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m very sorry; the news Press release miss quoted what I can/will do: I will send information to you, so you can find the portal; I will not send my PowerPoint presentations over the internet to anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you want to see my PowerPoint presentations, I’m the creator and the MC which will explain what is taking place and how important it is, all humans on Earth must know something is taking place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will gladly perform a presentation to your Town/Township/County/City/State/Country anywhere on this planet.

On August 24th, 2004 they showed up and have closed down this portal and have stopped mother ships from dropping off/unloading their planetary ships. This also means, the UFO’s that are on Earth, can’t leave, which is another problem.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you want to know exactly what is taking place contact me by email, the location and contact information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have the equipment to show 100 to 100,000+ attendees.

Had my video camera w/ me so i started filming in that direction just in case something came back. I saw w/ my eyes a red,orange orb in the distance so i focused in on that. The orb changed color from white to red, orange. The orb also changed shape, the orb split in two, top of it, just before it dissapeard looked to me like it formed a disk counter clock wise.  I followed it for about 49 sec.s, then lost sight of it. Kept videoing out that way when i saw with my eyes a spiraling object. It was white and looked like a sparkerler on a wheel. Focused in on that sighting and followed it for about 50 sec. The spiralling object changed shape also, and seemed to have windows on it when i put my video player in slow motion, and it looked like a disk also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sent copy of video to ufo center, waiting for a reply.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I NOTICED A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT JUST HOVERING OVER THE AIRPORT I THOUGHT OH A HELECOPTER BUT IT JUST STAYED THERE FLOATING ABOUT UP AND DOWN, AND SIDE TO SIDE KIND OF LIKE A BOBBER JUST FLOATING AND BOBBING IN THE WATER , IT WAS KIND OF FLASHING LIKE A DIAMOND ! THEN A PLANE TOOK OFF FROM THE AIRPORT AND FLEW BETWEEN THE OBJECT AND THE GROUND THE PLANE WAS HEADING SOUTH.

9/16/05 07:45|Acworth|GA|Rectangle|2 minutes|Large rectangular shape, almost colliding with jumbo jet over Acworth, GA. on September 16th, 2005|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46317.html|293|ndxe200509| Large rectangular shape, almost colliding with jumbo jet over Acworth, GA. on September 16th, 2005<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurance happened somewhere between the hours of 7:45am and 8:30am. I made my morning coffee and went to let my dog outside. I am a smoker, so I was sitting at my patio table having a cigatette. The day was clear. The sun was shining. There were a few clouds in the sky, but most of the sky was blue. It was like any other morning. I heard the bus pick up students for school and leave, after that, it was pretty quiet, just a few crickets. I don&#39;t think I would have ever noticed the UFO, if it had not been for the jumbo jet I heard coming from somewhere in the sky. I automatically looked up to see it. The jumbo jet came from the front of my house, which is the East. My patio set is in the backyard, so i couldn&#39;t see the jet at first. What caught my eye was a very large rectangular shape. It was perfectly rectangular, had no wings on it at all and there were also no lights on it as well. What I thought was so strange was that it had absolutely no sound. Its color stood out because it looked very shiny against the sky. Almost a whiteish greyish color. I could still see it completely as it passed the few clouds in the sky. It was moving very slowly in a very straight path from South to North. I could still hear the jumbo jet getting closer and I wondered if the pilot of the jet would see it as well. As the jet approached it looked as though the 2 would collide. The jet was coming from the Southeast to the Northwest. I thought to myself, &#34;Some air controller is going to get his warning for the year.&#34; I waited to see what happened. It looked to me like the jumbo jet just made it under the rectangle. The rectangle never swayed, it kept its same path and speed, as did the jet. I watched the UFO keep its path South to North. The jet, I think, would have probably landed at the Atlanta Airport. As the object got closer to the North, I could barely see that it had a very small bubble on the East side of the craft. It was just enough for me to know that it, on the other side, was not perfectly rectangular. I smoked my whole cigarette, watching it the entire time. I lit another cigarette and kept watching it. I noticed that the jumbo jet was so far away that I could no longer hear the noise from it and it was quiet again and I still heard no noise from the rectangualar object. There was no trail behind it. As I looked at it in the sky, I figured that it was about 1 inch long and somewhere between 1/4 inch in height, maybe alittle less. My dog had no reaction to it at all. I watched it until I could no longer see it. The only time it was not above the tree line and in clear view was when it was going to the North  and getting farther away. It was still visable enough to see the small bubble on the East side of the craft. I never thought to go inside and get my camera, although I had PLENTY of time to have gotten it. I am so sorry that I didn&#39;t snap a picture of it, but the thought never came to my mind until my boyfriend asked why I hadn&#39;t. I could have had 100 pictures of it because it was moving so slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for my background, I am a homemaker at the moment. Engaged to be married and have been in Acworth, Ga. for almost 2 months now. We moved from Clarksville, TN. due to my boyfriends job transfer. I am a woman, 35 years old and have a 13 year old son. The night before, I had a full 8 hours of sleep and started my day as any other, getting my son off to school. I was not taking any medication for anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/16/05 05:49|Loveland|CO|Other|10 seconds|Bright starlike object slowly fades at initial viewing|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46336.html|295|ndxe200509| Bright starlike object slowly fades at initial viewing<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking the dog early A.M. on Friday 9/16/05, I periodically looked up at the sky, as it was still dark with stars out and the barest tinge of purple on the eastern horizon. The sky was totally clear, no clouds. I was walking west on a rural road so viewing conditions were unobstructed. After one of many glances upwards, I looked back down and out of my peripheral vision noticed a light on my shoulder as if from a light source similar in intensity to a full moon. Knowing the full moon wasn&#39;t visible at that time I looked up again and in the same spot I had just observed I noticed a bright starlike object, roughly halfway between Mars and Orion (locations of both later confirmed with Sky and Telescope interactive starchart for date and that time of morning). It was white, unmoving, silent, brighter than Venus, and as soon as I looked at it, the object began to fade from view.  The light I noticed on my shoulder makes me think it was even brighter before I looked up. It seemed there was a slight haze around the object as it faded and it was completely gone within 10 seconds.  I watched for at least another minute and saw no other lights or objects in that spot. I kept looking up to that area every few seconds while I continued walking but saw no further objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If not an unknown, then conventional explanations might be a glint of light off a coincidentally perfectly positioned satellite, an orbital SDI test, or a supernova from light years away that I just happened to glance up at the perfect time for - there go my lotto odds.  Any explanation for this?<n>

My brother (15 at the time) and I were outside around 9:30 cdt one night (crystal clear night) watching all the shooting stars.  My brother noticed three planes moving in a triangular formation from east to west.  He joked that it was just to distract us from something happening in the opposite part of the sky.  We both looked over real quick to our left (we were watching to our right), and sure enough, we saw something interesting.  A streak, moving particularly slowly from west to east.  As we watched it, it grew brighter, to the point where we could make out the sparks at the edges.  We both kind of laughed nervously as it traveled from west to east and seemed to get bigger, indicating maybe it was getting closer.  It passed over us and we turned and watched it disintegrate.  We both went &#39;whoah&#39; at the time.  At the same time, another shooting star seemed to be crossing the path of this first meteor (or whatever it was )traveling northeast to southwest.  We talked about this second streak only eventually, because we both noticed it but weren&#39;t quite sure we had.  After that, we both drew the conclusion that it looked like for all the world that the first streak had been shot down by the second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Sorry this hasn&#39;t been submitted sooner, but after, Rita, things sort of got shuffled around priority wise).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We were in the condo where we were staying.  It was about 9:30 in the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The condo is on the fifth floor, overlooking the ocean.  We just went out on the balcony for some air when we saw some peculiar lights out over the ocean.  There was no noise and all the lights were the same configuration. They didn&#39;t appear to move but seemed to stay in the same place and blink on and off.  The lights were arranged in a horizontal line in a set of three.  They weren&#39;t very bright.  The lights were an equadistance apart.  They did seem to be at verying distance from us as some of the crafts (sets of light) seemed to be farther away or at least the lights were closer together like they would appear if the crafts were farther away. The lights were all the same color - white and it was quite dark and there was a high cloud cover so there were no stars. The lights (crafts) were spread out all across the sky at varying distances. I thought it could have been some kind of reflection or a peculiar bending of light but I couldn&#39;t see how it could be so widespread and appear to be at varying depths. The lights did blink on and off at the same time and while I thought that was important, I couldn&#39;t figure out what I was seeing. It went on for probably 45 minutes and then gradually faded away. There is probably some reasonable explanation but I couldn&#39;t see what it could be so I thought I would report it.<n>
9/15/05 21:15|Laconia|NH|Light|10 minutes|Huge formation of blinking lights over lake|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46557.html|299|ndxe200509| Huge formation of blinking lights over lake<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:15 PM I spotted 2-3 blinking lights slowly fly over Lake Winnisquam, from Belmont, about 1,000 ft. up, headed north. As they came towards me, the crafts picked up speed and more lights were visible, it was hard to count them because they flashed quickly, not in unison, 8 or 10 lights, they made no noise. I called my husband and 2 friends that were out night fishing.  The 3 were in an area where they were better able to see the lights and get good descriptions of the crafts. One witness described, &#34;I saw 5 moving simultaneously objects that all maintained perfect formation.  They moved so quickly I knew they weren&#39;t aircraft.  The V formation had 8 or 9 lights and used up a huge area of the sky.  Each ship had an intense orange light shooting up into the sky. When the orange light was on, there was no blinking white light. The flight pattern would change, like geese flying in formation, when the first in line backs off to let another move up to the front.  We could see the lights for at least 5 minutes.&#34;  The 2nd witness stated, &#34;There were lines in the light when it flashed, directed up, I could see the outlines of many ships and counted 8, but couldn&#39;t keep track of them.  Two would flash, then more would come, they would turn their orange lights on. I saw them from one side of the lake to the other.&#34;  He was able to see underneath the craft and made a sketch of it.  A view of the bottom shows a square craft with one large light off-set to one corner.  The 3rd witness said, &#34;I saw beams of light shine up, down, at each other.  There were quite a few.  I&#39;ve seen UFO&#39;s from a distance and was still skeptical, but this, there&#39;s no doubt.&#34; The 3 fishermen were quite spooked, packed up quickly, started the boat, and got back to the dock right away.  The lights were last seen going out of view towards Meredith.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  The 3 had seen many &#34;shooting stars&#34;, probably a dozen, earlier in the evening.  They had marveled at seeing so many.  This observation goes along with a theory of how the UFO&#39;s zip through the atmosphere so fast, entering and leaving, they look like shooting stars. They are usually seen around the big dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am guessing that they were located over Chandler or the Queen Creek area. I have always viewed them at around 9:00 at night around 5 times since February of 2004. The last time I saw them was September of 2005.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father used to be a pilot for many years and he too is unsure of what they are. He knows  that they are not flares since they stay at the same elevation for the entire 20min or so that they are in the sky and no smoke. When they disappear they simply blink out. I usually see a minimum of 2 lights parallel to one another, but I have seen 3 before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never intentionally looked for these lights, each instance I just so happened to see them. I wish we knew what they were, but who knows if we will ever find out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was heading home towards Santa Monica on Pacific Coast Highway with fast traffic going both ways. It was around 19:30 and I had just passed the PCH Sunset Blvd. t-junction. Heading south on PCH you of course have the Santa Monica Mountains on the left, and the Pacific Ocean on the right. The sighting ocurred over the hills along PCH roughly between Temescal Canyon and Potrero Canyon. As I passed Temescal Canyon I looked to the left above the hills and saw an aircraft flying some incredible maneuvers turning at some amazing angles, going up, down, and back again. It was studded with 3 green lights more or less in a triangular formation. It was dark. Unfortunately, there was no place to stop in order to observe the aircraft for a longer period of time as traffic was busy and fast. I only observed it for about 30 seconds, but this craft was already there when I approached the area, and was still there when I passed it up. I wanted to turn around immediately to go back and watch it, but oncoming traffic hindered me. At Chautaqua Blvd. I was able to finally turn around, but when I passed through the same area again, the aircraft was gone. To me it seemed that it was surveying something. The craft looks like the triangular (sort of boomerang like) spaceship depicted on this website.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The clouds were very high also and the craft was above them.  It resembled an airplane initially but as the object got near a rather large puffy cloud it dipped on one side and slid into the cloud.  I watched for several minutes and it never exited the cloud.  When it dipped on one side I could see that it had a plate formation below the shiny upper portion of the craft.  I did not have binoculars so I cannot give an exact description but I would say it was very large, at least the size of a 747.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were laying on the pole vault mat, looking upward, facing the westward sky, and at approximately 10:45 pm (22:45) a large,  cigar shaped object descended from the cloud cover.  The broad side of the object was parallel to the ground, and what could be considered the nose was at approximately 80 degrees to the direction of travel.  Flying no more than 1000 feet agl directly over us, I could tell because the ceiling that night was 2500 ft, and flew directly over us. We were perfectly aligned to see it, as it flew between the moon, (~3 days before a full moon) and our position.  As it flew over us, I estimated it to be about 300 ft. long.  There was a faint purple aura around the margins, and it appeared to spin clockwise at moderate speed.  It appeared to be constructed from some sort of metal, and gave the impression of a brownish color. Moving to the east at roughly 75 mph, soundlessly, it passed over us and came to a complete stop.   At that point, it changed shape into what looked to be a boomerang.  At this point, it moved to the north, back to the west, hovered, would move to the south, then southwest, stop , hover and move again.  It appeared to be doing some sort of manoeuver.  Finally, it changed shape one more time and became a cube-like structure, it began moving to the east again very rapidly.  I was extremely disturbed by this image.  It then disappeared behind a building, and we pursued it on foot, but when we moved behind the building it had completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Vincennes University and surrounding is a MOA, and there are scheduled dogfights with F-16 fighters regularly.  I know what these occurences look like. This was not one of them.  I notified the FAA, and was informed that the MOA just hours before was scheduled to be shutdown for dogfighting for the night.   At the last second, the dogfights were cancelled and the F-16s were grounded.  Not more than 1-2 hours after the figure had disappeared, the MOA was active again with airborne F-16s engaging in dogfights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other people were present during the sighting, at least 200 yds away, but had no concrete view of the craft because the angle between the moon and the craft was wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was very odd to see that sort of light characteristic in the flight path of Sky Harbor airport. It just hung over the San Tan Mountains in the southeast sky. I didn&#39;t entertain it much, until after I got home, my wife ((name deleted)) who was behind me, pulled into our driveway and was very excited - she was yelling if I saw the green lights? She said she saw 2 crafts with green lights and the craft was a boomerang or V shaped craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the husband, and he seemed to us to both sincere, and credible.

Five bright lights in a circle, all of the sudden a large glowing orange ball appeared in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in shock. The biggest ball started to fade in and out as the five other objects stayed completely still, I would say I saw it fade in and out twice and then it disappeared as did four of the five other lights. The one that was left shot off like a rocket into the distance, it climbed very fast and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after, two jets flew by the general area.<n>

I thought maybe it was a satellite dish.  As I was watching it I noticed that it was moving very fast, unlike a satellite or airplane, it was very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 seconds of watching it I noticed that about 5 more of these started to appear all over the sky all around the same time. These bright lights were moving very fast, all over the place.  About 15 seconds after the other lights showed up an much bigger object appeared. The very large object was bright and slow.  It was not moving near as fast as the small lights, it was traveling slowly, it was dimming in and out. It would be bright and fade out, then get bright, fade out, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After fading in and out for about 10 seconds it completely disappeared, that is when I ran inside to get my 2 friends because I knew this was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were all outside, the large pulsating light was gone but the smaller lights were still in the sky flying around.  About 2 minutes later, the large light appeared again very briefly, disappeared, and was on the other side of the sky.  Surrounding the large light were about 5 of the smaller lights, just hovering around it.  This lasted a very short amount of time and they all started to disappear one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the opposite side of the sky, the last little light we saw shot out into space at a very high speed until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  Not even a minute after the last light shot into space, 2 Air Force jets flew  by. I knew these were jets for obvious reasons (lights and sound).  The UFO&#39;s had no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea whether this is a serious report, or not.  The witness provides only an e-address.

Speed was described as fast, but NOT as fast as a meteor.  No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Calls came from witnesses in the Eastern, Central, South Central, Northern, Northwestern, and Western parts of Iowa, all looking to the west EXCEPT a trucker who says the light descended to about 300 feet over a field to the right of the vehicle, and no more than 1/4 mile distant, where the light then went out, and was seen no more by the driver.

Was it space junk?   Was it only one event?  Or in the case of the truck driver&#39;s adamant description, is it possible that there were two (2) events in progress?  Or was it only one event, with a temporary change in altitude, speed, etc., with the light then proceeding on its westerly way unobserved by the truck driver?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Results of the investigation are interesting, but obviously open-ended.  Many calls came in to the radio show the following morning looking for answers, and Bev Trout again was interviewed on results of the investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [It should be noted that NUFORC&#39;s Iowa Database lists a 9/14/05 event at about 6:00 a.m., which sounds as if it might be the same event(s) as described above.]<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Beverly Trout for sharing the results of her findings about this incident.

My girlfriend (also out on the balcony) smoked a cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a red dot move very fast across a small portion of the sky almost directly over the ship.  It caught my attention as the red dot stood out amongst the starts in the sky and seemed to be moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Red dot then moved very quickly to the right and stopped. Then it moved again to the left, stopping briefly then moved back to the right then backwards and stopping again.  This dot continued to move quickly forward backward and side to side then shot off over the ship out of my view. To the best of my ability I pointed the red dot out to my girlfriend, she saw the dot then it shot off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am unsure of the exact location because we were out at sea traveling from St. Thomas to St. Marteen.  The date I believe was 09/13/05. The object (red dot) seemed very far way and was only a little bit bigger then a stars light. The cruise line was Carnival and we were on the Glory.<n>

(Closed to non-tribal members of Taos Pueblo Indain Reservation)<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving, the road we were on &#34; Rio Lucero Rd&#34; goes in the direction north, with open land full of sage, and pinon juniper trees to the left of the road.  On the Right hand side of the road is &#34;Pueblo Peak&#34; or &#34;Taos Mountain&#34; as many of the locals and natives to Taos call the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Puebo Peak is part of the Sangre De Cristo Mountains which runs from Colorado through Northern New Mexico.  Taos Pueblo is located at the base of Pueblo Peak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Reservation which has roughly about 2,500 residents, and 150,000 acres of land most of which is wilderness.   Along with Pueblo Peak and the mountain range is pinon juniper, cotton wood trees ponderosa pine, doug furr, white furr, (mixed conifer) and the Rio Lucero River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving north we noticed lights in the trees to right of the road, which we thought at the time was someone else driving in the area at the time.  We paid no attention to the lights, we moved another 100 ft ahead and I noticed the lights shifted from behind the trees to ontop of the trees, at that point I asked my friend if he had seen the smae thing.  He aknowledged yes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He steeped on the gas to seed up and the head lights flickered on and of three times, and the instrument lights of his truck faded in and out.  When his lights flickered the object above the trees which had two lights flickered its lights back to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a third light came on underneath the two which were already on.  Bright lights, almost as brite as day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we started to approach the lights, they backed up towards the mountain and started to go higher in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend stopped the truck and we got out to take a look, when we got off the truck the lights disappeared.  The night was clear and no moon, just stars, so it took a while for my eyes to adjust to the dark.  When i got my vision stable we noticed a triangle shaped object above the truck, you could barely see it but, you knew it was there.  And boy, was it huge!  No lights, just the light from the sky and stars against the backdrop of the trianlge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I wasn&#39;t scared, but something in the back of my mind told me be worried.  Before I could talk to my friend the object left from where we standing in a blink of an eye, to about 11,000 ft in elevation close to the mountains, Vallicto Peak, which sits at about 12,300 feet behind pueblo peak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it got close to Vallicito Peak, orange and blue lights came on, on the object.  It stood, still at that point for a second and then again the orange lights went off and it went vertical straight into the sky leaving a trail of blue light as it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the the Triangle left a feeling of panic and paranoia fell over me.  We left the area and went back to town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day we went back to the area and looked for clues, but found none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Pinon Juniper that grows aroung here in Taos grows to 8-10ft in height, but still we never found anything yet to this day.<n>

Craft was in approximatly the same area as before, but started off at a much higher altitude than previous night.  Watched it again perform maneuvers for about 2 hours until it finally dropped below the horizon, perhaps landing but I can&#39;t be sure.  There was alot of air traffic in the area this night, but only one aircraft had an encounter with it.  An aircraft was coming from the west, traveling east.  It was at a higher altitude than the UFO, and dropped altitude to meet with the UFO.  Upon getting close to the UFO, the aircraft immediatly changed flight paths and quickly climbed in altitude, then continued on it&#39;s original flight path and continued traveling east.  So far the night of 9/12/05 has been the most active night.  I am about 95% sure that what I am seeing is a govt test as they are returning to the same area each night at about the same times to fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/13/05 20:30|Goodyear|AZ|Unknown|15 to 20 minutes|Slow moving lights in the night sky.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46269.html|335|ndxe200509| Slow moving lights in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between 8:30pm &amp; 8:45pm on 09/13/05 I was driving west on I-10 west of Phoenix, Az. Nearing 107th Ave. when I noticed three lights moving slowly in formation a mile or two south of I-10. I was talking with my son on the cell phone and told him I could see three aircraft in a very tight formation. The lights were very close together at exactly the same altitude and moving in a precise formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or two I thought I was mistaken that they must be lights on a tall building or facility in the distance as they were not moving as fast as an aircraft would move. After a few minutes I could see they were moving WSW slightly faster than the 70MPH I was driving. The aspect angle between the lights was changing and I was certain they were moving. All the lights were at exactly the same altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The appearance of the lights was different from aircraft lights. They were larger and not as intense as an aircraft light. They had a different color than aircraft lights, they were not white, but had a tawny tint similar to the old incandescent sealed beam headlights on cars. These lights were diffused rather than focused. There were no red or green lights that an aircraft would have, nor any strobes near these lights at any time, they had no similarity to conventional aircraft lights. They were definitely not bright Venus in the evening sky. I have been watching Venus &amp; Jupiter the past weeks and they were larger, brighter, lower, further south and moving in formation, I have no doubt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got off I-10 at Litchfield Rd and then continued south on McDowell Rd about 1/4 mile north of and parallel to I-10. While driving on McDowell at 45MPH and in a dark area with no street lights I could clearly see the aspect angle changing and the lights were moving WSW and now drawing away from me. They were about 300 to 600 feet above the ground at the same altitude and moving together. I thought it possible they were three lights on a very large aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove south on McDowell to Sarival and decided to pursue them, turning South on Sarival. It was very dark and a fourth light appeared behind and slightly below the other three. I did not see where it came from, it appeared suddenly. It never reached the same altitude as the other three lights and disappeared as suddenly as it appeared. I drove 2 miles south of I-10 trying to reach some open country roads where I could drive fast and get closer to the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I reached Yuma Rd. I turned west but they were getting further away, they may have been speeding up, but not moving as fast as even a slow single engine Piper or Cessna. They turned to the SW approximate compass heading 235degrees. Another of the lights disappeared suddenly leaving only two. After a another minute the remaining two lights disappeared. They did not appear to land or fly away, they were just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This entire episode covered 10 or 12 miles of driving and lasted 15 to 20 minutes. I was on the phone with my son describing my observations and chase to him while it was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 54 year old, stable &amp; successful business man. I was driving home my usual route, as I do at this time several times a week. I fly often and live near an Air Force base and can recognize and easily identify many types of aircraft. These were not lights that an aircraft would have, wrong color, no red or green and they were not intense enough to be aircraft lights. They I have never seen a UFO before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Estimated size; 150 meter broad and 30 meters high. It´s colour is orange and it´s glowing The shape is oval almost rectangular.I go outside the balcony, to take a better look. The object is turning to the right so it´s becoming less visible.I go and get my binocular, when I go outside on the balcony again the object is becoming less visible. My girlfriend is watching the object from the livingroom window at all time. After just a few minutes the object is turning towards the right again and float away in the clouds. And it´s gone.

The sun had just gone down behind the mountain,and the moon was coming up at same time time.  Started snapping pic&#39;s of the moon.. until it got too dark. Did not notice anything unusual while there,In fact,i was the only one in the area,a nice quiet time of evening. Also no air traffic that i saw while there either. When dark,drove back to our cabin to make dinner ect. Had not looked at pic&#39;s i&#39;d taken,until i loaded them to my c.p.u.3-4 day&#39;s later. While viewing my pic&#39;s, I then noticed an object in only one of the &#34;Moon&#34; shot&#39;s i&#39;d taken. Not a plane, or a bird ?? Look&#39;s to be disk shaped, the moon light is reflecting off the side while casting a shadow on the other side. Also, Notice the angle..??  U.F.O.??? I don&#39;t know , What do you think??

We are investigators for I.C.A.R.(International Community for Alien Research) and we were doing a follow-up on a sighting report that someone else had made when we saw these lights. The objects we saw were under 1500 feet in altitude. They did not change altitude or move side-to-side. There was no sound that we could perceive from the objects and there were no blinking or flashing lights that you would associate with any conventional aircraft. The lights moved slowly to the south and then went out one at a time. There was a family of 5 who had pulled over along the road near us and they spoke with us after these lights went out, asking us if we had seen the lights too. Being a trained investigator I am VERY familiar with the types of aircraft that are seen in this area and I have never seen any lights like this in the sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A random glint of light could occasionally be seen as well, like an intermittent reflection of sunlight which added to the tumbling appearance. With clear blue skies the object itself was clearly visible but impossible to say at what height. Adding to the strange appearance was a ring of &#34;distortion&#34; around the object in an area several times larger than the object itself. This distorted area looked similar to the effect of heat radiating in the distance off a hot road, except that it had a distinct &#34;swirling&#34; pattern seemingly generated by the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They got my attention because they were in line with each other, not side by side as a typical aircraft would be.  There were no other distiguishable lights.  There was no noise heard during of after that I could attribute to the lights.  The lights moved SW to NE across the sky rather quickly and then got to a point where they seemed to become stationary, and continued to flash.  At that point I watched for about 45 seconds while the lights got closer together and then faded away while still blinking at what appeared to be the same rate.  When I could no longer see the lights, I turned back to the direction the lights were moving from and I could make out a contrail, howver it was quite far to the side of where the lights were.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then the middle one drifted a lot more to the right and then stopped, so that they were in a triangle formation.  Then all of a sudden, two of them disappeared, leaving one there.  I could see a helicopter flying around closer to me doing a sort of circular run like they were noticing this too.  Then, as I was about to turn on I-10, I looked over Fiesta Texas, and noticed one of the star like objects were directly north now, hovering over, and it seemed I could make out a sort of dancing light movement around them at this time.  I looked back at the one in the east, and then all of a sudden another appeared next to it again, first at a steady brightness, and then it started to strobe a bit like it was fading in and out.  As I turned on I-10, I started to approach some clouds, and lost them all about a minute later.  It was very strange, and I haven&#39;t seen or heard anything about them today, but I feel sure someone else had to have seen them, because 1604 is a pretty busy route.  This all lasted about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Tonight I drove out to the country to get a better look at it.  I am almost certain this is not an alien craft, but rather a military craft doing test maneuvers. For the first hour it moved around in the sky on maneuvers described last night.  It appeared that 1 or possibly 2 small aircraft were staying in close proximity to the UFO, maybe observing it, but after about 15 minutes they left. Within the first hour I positivly identified an aircraft, possibly civilian or perhaps a small military craft approach the UFO.  Upon getting in close proximity the aircraft did a 180 turnaround and proceeded in the opposite direction it had came from.  About 20 minutes later another unidentifiable craft came down from the southern part of the sky.  Craft was a bright light heading towards the UFO at a high rate of speed and downward angle, after reaching approximatly the same elevation, second craft&#39;s light went out and it disappeared. Not sure what happened.  After an hour and a half, the UFO took off across the sky in an easterly direction at a fairly high rate of speed, stopped in mid air, and traced it&#39;s path back to where it had come from.  Will be checking again on 9/13 to see if it is again performing maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Assumed to be shooting stars at first but they moved independently and were orange and dim in appearance.  (way to far apart to be beacon lights on an aircraft) + (no noise) East object stopped completely while west object circeled it once and proceeded on.  Objects seemed to stop and change directions at will.  Both appeared to be independent from one another and after playing &#34;chase&#34; regrouped in a tight formation (like they were one) and then seperatated and continued traveling north.  Both craft exhibited instantanious stops and 180 degree direction chances as if gravity and physics didn&#39;t exist.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looking up at the stars, we noticed the light travelling in a ESE direction (approx. 125 degrees from north) It appeared to me at first to be the ISS. My friend pointed out that it wasn&#39;t travelling in a straight line! I stopped walking and noticed that the light was moving quickly from one parallel line to another (all lines going 125 degrees from north) The jump from one line to another occured very quickly, I was unable to see the light actually make the transition. The parallel lines were approximately 1/2 degree apart. I guess you could say the flight path was zig-zagging as if to dodge something in it&#39;s path. We were unable to determine the lights altitude. If it were in low earth orbit it would have been moving about twice the speed of the ISS. It took 15 seconds to cover half the sky. When it was about forty-five degrees up from the horizon in the SE sky it wasted no time in fading away. It just ceased being visible. There was no cloud cover at the time as many stars were still visible behind where the light vanished. There was no sounds of any kind for several minutes after. We listened for a distant engine. Both of us were in the USAF in the late 70&#39;s and could not figure out what type of aircraft could move in such a quick moving zig-zag manner. This object may have been terrestrial, but if it were, I hope it says USA on it&#39;s side!<n>

I didn&#39;t have any interior lights on in the bathroom as it was in the middle of the day and very sunny. The weather conditions were extremely clear with little to no cloud cover. Momentarily I noticed that the sky darkened considerably for approx. 5-9 seconds. I was confused as to what was causing it. Looking out my window I expected to see a truck park in the back driveway behind the house but there was nothing. Before I could get outside the sky had already illuminated itself once again. I saw no obstructions behind my house and nothing to explain it. Seconds later the power went out for the whole Southern California region. I was a little struck and thought that it was a coincidence or something else. I detected no craft but cannot explain the strange darkness in the sky before the power outtage. This report is being submitted for the sole fact that it occurred in broad daylight and possibly was noticed by others.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So I am interested in knowing if anyone else reported seeing anything at the same time/night or if you know of any monitoring equipment that was flying around over NH that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my dog outside at around 1:30 am and was sitting on my porch and noticed a relatively large, bright light in the sky. I started staring at it and then noticed that it was moving around randomly in the sky almost like it was being blown by a light wind or something. It was visable above the treeline and looked like an extremely large/bright star, but then I noticed the strange movement. I used binoculars and did not see it much more clearly so I imagine it was quite high in the sky, but realized it definitely had lights on it of some sort - and they were bright enough that it was throwing light around it like a halo. From MY PERSPECTIVE, way away from it, when moving it was only covering a patch of sky about 3 inches X 2 inches. It kept moving around in that general area. I also noticed a few times that a short distance from it there were flashing lights, coming off from about 2:00 and 9:00 and 5:00 if the object was in the middle of a clock-face. I then noticed a second one to the right but farther away as the light was much smaller and dimmer, but I could still see it was moving around also. I thought maybe it was a satellite, but then realized that the movement was not right and it was not tracking across the sky on any sort of trajectory. I also thought maybe it was a weather monitoring device, but didnt understand why it was covered in lights... I studied it with binoculars for about 1/2 hr and couldnt get any clearer picture of it. I looked for it in the morning but could not see anything in the sky so imagine it was either gone or far enough up to not be visible by day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was obviously not a star, as it had the same type of reflection that satellites, the ISS, aircraft, etc have from the moon and sun.  It changed directions randomly and suddenly, and sometimes sat still. To the north of the UFO doing accrobatics was a triangular formation of 3 other lights, that I first thought was the tail of the little dipper, but realized it wasn&#39;t the dipper since the &#34;dipper&#34; portion was missing.  Looked like the formation might be moving very slowly but couldn&#39;t tell.  Kept my attention mostly on the acrobatic, looking at the formation every 10 minutes or so. After an hour, went inside to take a shower (aprox 15 minutes), came back out and the formation had moved higher in the sky and closed into a perfect triangle.  The moving light was still present and in the same area, and started to see random flashing lights coming from the ground, what seemed to be maybe 20 miles northwest of town, out near ranches and farms.  Continued to watch for about another hour. About midnight finally went to bed as the UFO kept repeating itself and I had to go to work early.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Along with 2 guests, looking northward from an apartment balcony in southern toronto, we noticed an extremely bright light in the sky about 45 degrees above the horizon. The size of a star, it was amazingly bright, like nothing else in the sky. Remained bright for about 10 seconds, before fading away completely. After it faded nothing else was visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw the same thing happen about 8-10 minutes later, roughly in the same position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time, my friend quickly trained a telescope onto the object, I observed it for about 2 seconds before it left the field of view. Couldn&#39;t make out any detail just looked like a starlike point of light. Again, in a few seconds it faded away completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am in apartments sw of the I-235 and I-80 interchange. My apartment has a balcony that faces north and I was in my living room.  It could have a been a firework, but I could throw a rock and hit I80 from my apartment as it is right by it, therefore someone would have to be out on the freeway shooting them off. It would have to have been traveling at least 300 miles per hour, but there was no sound. It could have been part of the Air National Guard stationed in Des Moines, but there was no sonic boom and I think they are prohibited from travelling that fast this close to the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/11/05 20:10|Chapel Hill|NC|Unknown|10 SEC 5 MIN|low quick moving light|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46221.html|361|ndxe200509| low quick moving light<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a unusually bright light in the sky for a second time in a few days.  The lights were changing color and I assumed it was the twinkling of a star.  I was pointing it out to a friend I was giving a ride.  He followed the light and pointed at its direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While stopped at a traffic light I looked over and a small orb of light raced from about the top of the tree line across the sky parallel to the ground.  Its speed was far greater than a plane or helicopter and it&#39;s size was quite small.  It moved faster than even a firework and left no trail.  The ball of light looked similar to video of ball lightning that I have seen but no clouds were present and it was really right at the top of the tree line.  It&#39;s movement was similar to that of a shooting star but it was so close to the ground and it&#39;s trajectory was completely unlike any of the many meteors i have observed.  The main light I had been watching continued to change colors around a main white but UNUSUALLY bright light.  I have observed in my area and around in other research I have attempted that these unusual lights appear in alignment with existing heveanly bodies, but they look quite different than the bodies they are alligned with.  Meaning that you notice a light that does not look like a star and displays properties that are quite different than a star, Venus or Mars but occur in identical places.  The regular bodies can be seen later in the position of the unusual object, light, or occurance, but appear to have little in common with the occurance.  Draw from this what you will but i feel that this could possibly be more than just a coincidence and not necesarily difficult to control.<n>

I watched it for 5 minutes and realized that it was not moving in any direction.  This sparked my curiousity.   There are always plenty of airplanes coming and going from Maui but this was not one.  I continued from the pinnaple fields toward the ocean and consitantly towards the hovering black diamond disk.  The black object moved minimally from side to side up and down and front and back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained hovering at cloud level while I watched it.  From the cliffside I noticed that the object did have some sort of faint exhaust streaming at some length behind it with the direction of the east wind.  The object went in and out of the clouds with no problem but tended to remain out of the clouds for the majority of the time.  Some 45 minutes later (as it was getting dark) I decided to walk back to my truck (for camera phone)and drive back to the site to see if anyone else had witnessed this.  When I arrived back at the site  the object was gone.   It was just turning dark and some stars were peeking through the twilight.  There were some locals fishing down the cliffside on the coast... but it was getting dark and I was not going to take my chances on the steep cliff hike nor with any unknown locals at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a dim orange orb. It did not dissapear after a second or so, like a shooting star. It remained visible traveling at a high rate of speed (3000mph) and over central Albuquerque began a sweeping curve to the west. The curve continued until it was traveling WSW until it traveled out of sight. I might point out that when I first saw it, it came right over the Kirtland AFB. The object&#39;s light emission never varied, staying a dim orange the entire 10 seconds of the episode. I could not discern the size of the object, but a guess would be that it was no more than a 30 feet sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/11/05 03:00|Blockhouse (Canada)|NS|Diamond|1-2 hours|3 strange, fast moving crafts over Blockhouse|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46198.html|369|ndxe200509| 3 strange, fast moving crafts over Blockhouse<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early, 3am on the morning of Sept. 11/05 my friend and I sat around an outdoor fire in his backyard. As we sat, the sky beyond the wooded treeline starten to lighten in that one area only. While we questioned what we were seeing, we also questioned each other, isn&#39;t it awfully early for the sun to be coming up? Once we realized it was much too early, we sat and watched for nearly an hour as that portion of the sky got brighter and brighter, at one point I questioned my friend as to what I was seeing, and if he saw it the same way. Apparent beams of light were now stretching to the sky in that one area of the sky only. Slowly, towards the latter part of the hour, the light faded away, until once again the night sky was completely black. At this point, I went into the house to check the time again, It was now nearly 4am. I returned to the fire, and as we sat there discussing what we had seen, I saw an object in the sky, we believe coming from the south, I questioned my friend, &#34;Isn&#39;t that object moving awfully fast?&#34; Other aircraft (planes) could be seen in the sky, the standard, slow moving, plae blinking light. This first craft had four, large, unblinking, white beams, in a diamond shape. It was moving so fast over and above our heads we were having a hard time keeping track of it.  Followed very close behind this object and moving just as quickly was another craft with what appeared to be two solid green, and 2 solid red lights, these did not blink either.They followed very close together on the same course, and were out of sight in a matter of minutes. My friend and I sat awestruck, and debated what we were seeing, the objects were soundless, but very large, and were travelling so quickly that ordinarily you would hear a sonic boom- but nothing. We figured that about 15 minutes passed and were still discussing the nights events, and how eerie this all seemed, saying &#34;No one will ever beleive this, I&#39;m glad to that you are here to see this!&#34; Just as we were going to get up to go to bed,a third, fastmoving object came flying from the same direction as the previous two.The big difference was that this one appeard to be disc shaped.lights,all different colours, flashing it seemed to be a completely random order. This ship flew as quickly, and fllowed the same course, and we actually got up out our chairs, clinging to each other, walking beneath the object, up the yard, we had a hard time keping them in sight even as we got up and walked across the lawn following them. Even after it had passed the blinking band of mulicoloured lights could been seen clearly until it passed over another wooded area. This whole event from start to finish may have lasted as long as 2 hours. When we finally went to bed it was nearly 5am. I just want to add, that the night sky was clear that night, numerous stars and constellations were presnt, and whether tht two events, the light in the sky, the crafts, etc we part of the same occurance, I&#39;m not sure, but both my friend and I can honestly admit, that we&#39;ve nevr seen anylike that before, and it sure gave us an eerie feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/11/05 03:00|Blockhouse (Canada)|NS|Diamond|2 hours|Light in the sky, followed by three, different crafts.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46363.html|370|ndxe200509| Light in the sky, followed by three, different crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were sitting around a campfire in his backyard. This is a rural, wooded area. It ws nearly 3am when off in the woods beyond the yard, I noticed the sky was starting to brighten. I thought this odd, and questioned my friend that it seemed awfully early to be getting light. It started off dimly, but slowly began to brighten, only in this one area. The sky was clear, with many stars visible. After 20 min- 1/2 hour, my friend and I noticed that apparent beams of light were now pointing skyward from this one location. (Think, Hollywood, movie/searching lights, the kind that point straight up). I questioned him again, to be sure that he was seeing the same thing I was. After a few minutes these beams started to fade, and for the remainder of an hour the lights slowly faded altogether, the sky then becoming dark like the rest of the night sky. We thought this odd, but didn&#39;t know what to make of it, and went back to our campfire. A few minutes later, we noticed an object in the sky, I made a point of saying, that it seemed to be moving awfully quickly. As it approached it became apparent it was diamond shaped, made up of four, large, bright, unblinking beams. As it sped across the sky over our heads, my friend mentioned how an object moving as fast as this should break the sound barrier making a sonic boom, or some sort of noise, yet none could be heard. Right behind this object was another, following on the exact same course, moving just as quickly. Only, this craft had two large red lights, and two large green lights. While they were travelling above us, other regular aircraft were visible, and there was no comparison between the size, speed, etc. These were no regular crafts. They were big, silent, low flying and extremely fast. As we watched, I held my friend&#39;s arm awestruck, not able to say anything. After they disappeared we sat questioning, trying to rationalize what we had seen. We were nearly ready to go to bed, when 15 minutes later a third object, flying so quickly, that I got out of my chair, and followed it on foot across the lawn, and had a hard time keeping sight of it, flew overhead. This one was the most shocking of all, it had rotating, pulsing, multi-colored lights. The lights followed no pattern, and the craft seemed to rotate. As I said it was overhead and gone so quickly, I had to run across the lawn to keep sight of it. After this third craft, we were quite shaken, and retreated to the house. We have discussed what we saw numerous times since then, and still it is shocking. That night I had made a simple diagram of the first, diamond shaped craft, and had noted the approx. times that we saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving my car home, as I saw the streaks, it seemed as daytime around me - i could see clear blue skies and then it slowly faded.  As I got nearer my home - there appeared to be other bright spots in the sky around the area - they lit up quickly and then faded quickly.  I have never experienced anything quite like it before.  It did not seem to be a meteor shower - there was no tails of light or streaks???  I didn&#39;t see any crafts or objects, but the lights were so bright it was hard to tell where they were coming from or where they originated from exactly - it was four distinct area&#39;s in the sky that were bright and lit up and then it all faded the same and then it was very dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

THERE WAS A HUGE HOUSE ALL WITH TONS OF LIGHTS ON SURROUNDED BY FIELDS. WELL RIGHT ABOVE THE HOUSE LOOKED LIKE A VERY LIGHT CLOUD THAT WASNT FAW IN THE SKY ONLY A LITTLE ABOVE THIS HOUSE. NOT THICK BUT NOT TO LIGHT TO SEE THROUGH AND COMING FROM THIS CLOUD WAS A BEAM OF GREEN LIGHT THAT WAS THERE FOR A FEW MINS THEN THE BEAM OF GREEN LIGHT WENT AWAY AND SO DID THE CLOUD THESE LIGHTS LASTED ABOUT 10 OR 20 MINS AND THEN THEY ALL WENT AWAY.

It was about 8:15 PM. My brother, his friend, and I were on our way back from a foothill we call &#34;Sawtooth&#34; out by the Silverbell mines. I was spacin&#39; out, staring out the window. Directly where I was staring about 4 or 5 larger sized (about the size of 2 or 3 planes coming in to Tucson)yellowish orange lights appeared in the blank sky, and held a steady glow. They sat there for about 15 seconds with their lights on, then all went dark. At this point the 3 of us were standing out on the side of the road. So, about a minute or so later, a single light comes on. Then another up and off to the right of the first one lights up, then another in the same direction, and another. There ended up being I believe 5 lights at that time. By the 3rd light, the first was fading out simultaneously, and the rest followed suit. After a little of this type of action, different light patterns and #&#39;s of lights, etc. they seemed to be playing or something, maybe just flying around observing. The thing about it was that now there were maybe twice as many lights and they didn&#39;t blink. They would sometimes shut off their lights, but never blink. Then, at about 8:45PM, the Marana Regional Airport sent 2 jets out. I heard them take off and watched them cross the sky. All the unidentified lights were now shut off. But once the jets were close, they all turned back on, and were very close together, shining toward the jets. There had to have been like 15 of them. It was like a wall of light in the sky. Eventually the jets arrived and chased about 4 of them toward 3 Points, and 2 or 3 toward Pheonix. The rest were gone. I&#39;ve seen them do many different but similar things since then on maybe 7 different occasions, and have maybe a dozen other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It held its straight-line features and didn&#39;t disolve like a cloud or chem trail would. It hovered at an angle then slowly went down below the trees in Sanbornton. We were able to count 4 more appear and slowly go down the same way. A 6th white line came UP from the trees in a different area and slowly took off going up. Through binoculars we could see soft blinking white lights on the tops and underneath these crafts.  I think the reason we could see them was the setting sun causing light to reflect on them, when normally they can&#39;t be seen during the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It made absolutely no noise, and was moving very slowly.

Some could see these lights and others could not.I looked intensely in the sky for 5 minutes before I noticed the 2 lights that resembled stars dancing in a sparing way to each other. These lights were closer than the stars, in fact they were in our atmosphere. Soon there were 3 lights moving crazily through the sky always in a localized area. After five minutes of searching the sky with a binocular I finally was able to zero in and the light revealed itself into the shape of a saucer.It moved similar to a wobiling spinning top. This continued for two hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They lights hung there for about 15 minutes, without movement, no sound, no change. Then, the light to the left dipped low, as if it were a plane and it were banking to make a turn. And then the lights just dimmed out. They were gone.  About 20 minutes later, they were back, only this time they were lower in the sky. Again, the folks on the ground out in that area were lighting off fire works (not the large profession kind, a much smaller version of them). This time the lights stayed on for about 10 minutes and just dimmed out and disappeared. Again, unwaivering and without sound. I was able to take a photo of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were facing south, towards the St. Mary&#39;s River, when a low-flying object, which appeared to be somewhat flat and round, flew quickly by. It flew extemely fast, and emitted a blue light. The light was an incredible bright blue, and it moved so fast that we only saw it for 5 to 10 seconds. There weren&#39;t many stars, and the sky was very dark. My friends thought it was a plane, but because I fly so much, I know that no plane travels that fast, or has a blue light. A few moments later, an actual plane (with it&#39;s blinking red and white lights) flew overhead at a MUCH slower speed.  I came to the conclusion then that this was a very unusual sighting.<n>

I could tell it wasn&#39;t a shooting star, cause I have seen shooting stars, and they are much smaller and don&#39;t leave that much of a &#34;streak&#34; of light. It almost seemed like a comet - except that it flashed almost too quickly for a comet, and the point of light of the object, or whatever it was, was very noticeable. It was distinctly a light purplish blue, and left a faint streak of light of the same colour. I have never seen anything, in my entire life, like it! I never even thought I&#39;d ever manage to see a UFO (or whatever it was) in my own eyes!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was moving faster than a jet or plane but not as fast as a meteor.  We watched it for about 15 seconds and then it just disapeared!  I wish we could have seen it closer or longer.  I also have a relative (who does not believe in UFO&#39;s) tell me she saw a strange orange light in the sky around midnight last week.  Suddenly she heard an extremely loud noise and saw what appeared to be three military jets surround the object and fly away<n>

As we drove closer I could see that they were not balloons. There were low clouds so I had a good background to judge distance and size, maybe 400-500 feet in altitude, about 25-35 feet long. The wind was blowing pretty good but the objects were completely motionless against the moving cloud background. They had a strange shape, almost looked like silver acorns! They had what looked like a seam where the bottom of it connects to the top but were rotated 90 degrees so they that were laying on their side. I got a good look at them for about 8-10 seconds before we had to turn. We came back the other way about 20 minutes later and they were gone. I drive this route everyday. Not very dramatic, just some odd things hanging in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked out of my 2nd floor terrace doors and saw 2 small red lights which seemed to be resting on the ground on the golf course outside. I tried to determine what I was seeing, but could not see anything but the lights. I went back to the kitchen to put my glass in the sink. When I returned, the lights were gone.The light appeared to be only about 30 yards from my terrace.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It coincided with a smoke alarm that is broken and beeps at night.  My ears have never popped like this before, and the beeps have been present for at least 6 months.  My body felt weird, it felt like there was extra electricity in the air.  I looked out the window at the sky from my bed, and I saw what looked like a star.  It looked like it was flashing different lights, but I don&#39;t necessarily know if it was flashing different colors.  It traveled in darting patterns, first it would go one way, and then it would come back to the original spot I saw it, not too fast, but not too slow either.  There were clouds in the sky, but no too many, it was mostly clear, but the light would disappear at seconds at a time, and sometimes if I looked at a different angle it wold disappear.  I became very spooked because of my ears popping and just a feeling of weirdness all together.  If I put my hands over my ears they would not pop.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

For the short time i saw it (apr. 5 sec.) before it disapeared over my roof, it rooled first about 100 degrees one way, then it rooled back to level fligt and about 70 degrees the other way. I guess it was about 15 meters long on all 3 sides, and had light on the tips that was a bit less bright then the stars. It looked like it was computeranimated, it looked so unreal with a black body, that was a bit darker than the sky. It made a wery silent swosj sound as it pased over, like a gentle constant brees blowing in the leaves on a tree, only lower. I made a picture that i can mail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any questions, you can contact me on email.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got into a conversation with her about the tilt of the earth, and how it causes the seasons, and explained to her why we see different stars at different times of the year, depending on which side of the Sun we are on, and since our night-time has us looking a different direction.  Just about the time I finished explaining this to her I noticed a VERY bright light in the north sky, directly under the North Star, about 1/5 the way up from the horizon to the North Star, not too far above the trees.  I said, &#34;What the hell is that?&#34;.  My mother turned and observed it also.  It appeared redish, just like Mars now appears in the Eastern sky, only much brighter, and was as bright as a landing light, but totally stationary.  I then observed it fade out and seem to disappear, but I had my binoculars in my hand so I brought them up to look and see if I could still see it.  I observed what I thought was the object, but it matched the stars in the background, same brightness and same color, and it was motionless, so I didn&#39;t know if it was the object or not, but I kept looking at it just in case I might see something.  About twenty seconds later it started moving RAPIDLY downward toward the horizon and disappeared behind the trees.  About three to four minutes later I looked to the Northwest, just underneath the Big Dipper and saw a light heading toward where the object was, but it had red and white flashing anti-collision lights and appeared to be an airplane headed that way, but there was no way to tell if it was military or a normal airline flight, but it did appear to be fast enough to be at least a jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I&#39;m always looking up for shooting stars and  satelittes I saw in the south sky a object like a shooting star but much bigger. It was traveling a southeasterly direction. I saw it first and pointed at it to my wife she had time to turn her head and see it. Normally there isn&#39;t time for this if it were a shooting star.  It was about the size of my thumbnail with my arm stretched out.  It was white with a dark center it looked to have a streaming tail like shooting stars. It appeared at the 3 o&#39;clock position and disappeared at about the 8 o&#39;clock position. There were no sounds heard.  The only thing that bothers me is the speed, it traveling as it was slower than the shooting stars I observe. I was just curious if anyone else saw this.  My guess would be a meteor glancing off our atmosphere because it was so big.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The two middle lights for a few minutes were diagonal in the middle of the formation. They did not get very bright. When looking through a telescope they looked like they were on fire and spinging in circles in one spot. At one point you could see smoke trails come from each light. Again the Luke, jets came out extremely  quick,maybe even more faster than before right over our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident may be approximate.

As craft passed over head, going due south the rear end had two very bright white flashing strobe lights - pulsing about every 1/2 second.

I thought it might have been a planet, possibly Venus, but it was glittering a variety of colors ranging from bright red to green to blue to yellow.  It was obviously not an airplane because it didn&#39;t appear to be moving.  As I watched it, I noticed it would occasionally move up and down or left and right or in small ovals, very rapidly and sporratically but not in any intelligble direction, it seemed very erratic.  I woke my sister and she watched it with me.  It was to the East just right of the little dipper.  We watched it for an hour and I took photos and some video.  It was still visible and was still moving as it became light out, and I took a video showing the only two objects still visible in the sky were this object and Mars.  While it was still dark out we noticed a number of shooting stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, at the same time, I noticed three of the same objects making the same motions, not close to each other, about 20 degrees left or right of each other.

We have a wonderful large view of the sky from our back yard so we were just looking at the stars and chatting.  My husband went into the house after a while and my son and I were just looking at the sky when I saw what I thought a satellite must look like.  It was coming from the south in a straight line headed north.  It was extremely high in the sky, much higher than any air planes.  (We live in a flight path from Cuyahoga County airport, about 5 miles from the airport so we are used to seeing all kinds of planes, and we know their paths) There were other planes in the sky at the time, however they were much lower in the sky. I pointed out the object to my son and called to my husband who was just inside the house. We all were able to see it. The object was bright, kind of like a star, but was moving pretty quickly across the night sky, as I&#39;ve said, south to north.  I&#39;ve seen many meteors, and this was not moving that fast, also, it had no trail or sound.  It was just so high up in the sky that we couldn&#39;t make out what shape it was, however if I had to, I&#39;d say it looked either square or round.  It did not appear long or &#34;V&#34; shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I continued to drive my way home(roughly about five mins of the sighting itself) and noticed it was blinking on and off like a tower for the airplanes but this was white and steady on and off not red like they normally are. As I got closer home I was able to stop (due to the red lights and examine it closer)it was moving very slow across the sky. Once it was getting closer I could see the colors started to change. They went from red to green to blue to white again but each one flashed a different way.I could tell by now that there was no wings like and airplane. I also know it wasnt a blimp- that would have been closer to me and I know it wasnt a helicopter either that too would have been closer.I have never seen anything like it before. When I got home I tried to see it again but it was no where to be found.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I don&#39;t always report them to your center but today I will as this one was not a quick 30 second thing - blink of the eye and then it&#39;s gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went for a jog in the Point Grey area here in Vancouver, very close the beach, when on my return towards my home, I saw what I thought was a plane, I&#39;m quite observant of the sky.  Then I realized that it wasn&#39;t a plane.  Then I thought it looked like a blimp.  A telephone company here in Canada uses one quite frequently here in the Lower Mainland for advertising purposes, but quickly I realized that it was simply too high up in the air for anyone to see it with the writing and logos on it.  Then I thought, oh no, here we go again.  I watched the object for about 3 minutes maybe a bit longer.  It was located in the south sky and the visibility is excellent.  Object appeared to be heading towards to USA and climbing higher upwards.  Colour white.  Solid Object.  Moved slowly.  Not planes in the sky from where I&#39;m stood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I obviously stopped jogging to gain a beter look at this object and I was simply courious if this passing stranger could see this object as well.  I asked a stranger &#34;Do you have good eye sight&#34;? and asked her if she could see &#34;that object in the sky&#34;.  She said yes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS.  Last night Sept. 6th 2005, as I was walking home from a video store with my boyfriend, we happened to see a bright light in the north sky get bright and then retract very quickly. We couldn&#39;t see any traces or trail of anything like a plane in the general vicinity in the sky such as when a plane may be glarring it&#39;s front headlights and then turn, this wasn&#39;t quite the same. He was about as puzzled as I was.  Just thought I&#39;d mention last nights oddity in case anyone else in Vancouver, B.C, or North Vancouver saw this bright light.  This light was after night had fell I would estimate the time we saw it to be around 9.30 ish PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was nearly as bright as the sun but of course very tiny in comparison. The weather is exceptionally clear at this time. Note that the light remained stationary for the duration of the sighting and appeared at approximately sixty to seventy degree elevation in the Northern sky at an altitude of over 10K feet. At first, I thought it was Venus (visible near the cresent moon at dusk in the West) but then it &#39;flickered&#39; or flashed twice. I checked my watch and noted that it flickered regurlarly every ten to fifteen seconds. I waited for my son, who had a dentist&#39;s appointment, and when he came out I pointed it out to him. His eyes are better than mine and he thought that the light was slightly elongated and was metallic in appearance. At one point he noted that there appeared to be more than one light in close proximity. We also noted that the  area immediately surrounding the light(s) appeared slightly darker than the rest of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched them for a bit as they slowly made their way to a westerly direction and the airport. I happened to look to the south and saw a bright object, that I thought was a high flying plane, moving at what I thought was pretty fast for a plane. I moved a bit to the grass taking my eyes off of it only until I moved and the object that was once moving in an easterly direction was now moving in exactly the opposite direction. This was my first experience with something like this and almost doubted what I was seeing until I thought it through and realized what it was that I saw. After the object had changed direction from E to W it continued in the westerly direction until it was obscured by the trees in the neighborhood and I could no longer follow it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(He knows Stars are in the sky, although it was daytime.)  That day there were clear blue skies - a minimum of haze.  We were walking in the vicinity of Marymoor park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If he hadn&#39;t pointed it out to me, I would have never seen it.  At first I thought it was a normal child&#39;s white balloon.  When I focused on it, it seemed much larger and higher than a normal balloon, and was shaped along rectangular forms, something like a blocky chair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be tumbling quite freely, and lazily, like something in freefall.  This &#34;naturalistic&#34; motion was what caused me to first think of it as a balloon; along with everday expectation.  But the tumbling didn&#39;t seem to &#34;fit&#34; with it being a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size, tumbling, and shape all struck me as odd.  The tumbling is what stuck in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of it after a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

(USMC) 42 years old.  (I add this detail as my qualification for this posting)  My wife woke me at 2 am to show me a  Bright Object in the sky above our cabin in the Big Sur Wilderness.  The sky in that area is dark and has the advantage of having no city lights to &#34;throw&#34; a viewer.  The night was extremely clear with no smoke or haze or moonlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Bright Object was steady and appeared to be an orange colored Star.  Larger than other stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First we saw what appeared to be a shooting star drop down, right next to the Bright Object. The shooting star did not come from the object but was near it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the Bright Object dropped what appeared to be a bright plasma ball similar from our vantage point to what one would normally term a shooting star.  At that moment the Bright Object  suddenly began to move from East to West and had the shape of a diamond, but it appeared as if the entire Object was on fire.  Like a space shuttle on fire.  As it moved, it dropped two more &#34;Plasma balls&#34; or &#34;Shooting stars&#34; and simultaneously, it left a large &#34;Smoke trail&#34;, which did not have the consistancy of smoke, but more like the trail of a comet.  Then, in a flash it seemed to accelerate out of our atmosphere and disappeared, leaving the &#34;Smoke trail&#34; which lasted for another 20 minutes in the star filled sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The important part of the sighting is that the Bright Object first appeared STATIONARY and only after dropping the first of several &#34;Shooting stars&#34; or &#34;Plasma Balls&#34; did it begin to move across the night sky from East to West.  No noise could be heard during the entire event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an ex military jet pilot, I know of no technology that would allow a craft or even a meteor to behave in this way.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Was a slightly hazy night where only bright stars are barely visible.  I looked West out toward the Children&#39;s Hospital a few miles away where somewhere beyond it I saw a small orange light low in the sky.  Helicopters sometimes take off from the hospital roof, but this struck me as unusual because there were no blinking lights as most aircraft have.  It also appeared to be climbing slowly upward at a very steep angle uncharacteristic of planes or choppers.  After a minute I noticed a smaller blinking light, but after a few seconds the blinking light separated from the main light, trailed behind at a distance then blinked out.  I called my girlfriend from inside the house to come see.  We watched as this light continued to appear to climb straight up.  After another minute, the light began to shimmer and then suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear night and from the East I saw 4 lights streaking across the sky moving in close proximity to one another. The lights had an orange tinge to them. The altitude appeared to be well below that of satellite orbits. The lights disappeared in the sky to the West of me. They were travelling at a high rate of speed and were only visible to me for about 5 seconds. No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stealth aircraft training in our area?<n>

The object moved behind some tree limbs and back to the open sky in a motion like a ball bearing being moved in a tupper ware container.  It also moved in 90 and 45 degree angles.  It was observed for more than a half hour, as jet liners passed on their normal routes, I knew it was not a plane.  The light later changed from a red, to a white, then to a blue/green color in no set pattern.  It did not shoot off in any direction, just faded out in an off white color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Noticed 2 distinct orange/red lights in the SSW sky for around a minute. I went inside for no more than 30 seconds to retrieve my camcorder. Came out to my back patio and began filming object(s). After a minute or so, a third light appeared, and then a forth. Then the object drifted beyond the mountain range. less than a minute later, the four lights reappeared over the range in approximately the same area of space. The lights were all the same color. Of the four lights, each one would disappear for a couple of seconds, in no particular order. The lights then seemed to head off towards the SSW and fell behind the range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then took several side steps to my left and was able to see these lights again. The number of lights visible with the naked eye was more accurrate than using the zoom on my recorder. At times my camera would pick up more than two lights, but for several minutes, the naked eye was better. For instance, I would see four lights-or three with my eyes, but my camera would pick up Two. The lights would again blink in and out for several seconds at a time until they left my field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed 2 commercial vehicles in the air. One was coming from the north, possible to PHX. another was broadly circling towards the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I think the object was cirgar shaped becaues of the the four lights were just offset of each other.The craft was at a very high altitude, and it moved forward, sideways and backwards when the 4 lights flashed. I used the star&#39;s in the sky to dertermin which direction the object was moving. The craft moved from the eastern sky to the west then took a 90 degree turn to the north before returning to the east the whole time of the observation was about 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It would slow down,dip up and down zig-zag and sort of wiggle around.

9/6/05 17:45|Olin|NC|Unknown|About 6 seconds|While scanning the sky with binoculars for the planet Venus a strange object flew into the field of view.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46104.html|440|ndxe200509| While scanning the sky with binoculars for the planet Venus a strange object flew into the field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tuesday September 6th, 2005.  First I want to say I have been an amateur astronomer since 1972, or for the past 33 years.  I have seen many strange objects in the daytime and nighttime sky and have never seen anything that could not be explained, until now.  I also spent 20 years in the Air Force and know a little about what planes can do and cannot do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 5:45 PM (East coast of US) I was in my yard looking for the planet Venus with 7X50 binoculars.  I was scanning the southern sky at about 40 degrees elevation when an object appeared in the field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a second I thought I had spotted Venus but quickly dismissed this as it was moving and I knew I was observing too far to the left of Venus.  If I had not moved the binoculars left to begin another sweep I doubt I would have seen this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I next thought I had picked up an airliner, as there is an air corridor over my house for planes taking off and landing in Charlotte, North Carolina.  I then dismissed this as it was flying almost perpendicular to this corridor and moving much too fast to be an airliner and I mean fast.  I have also seem all kind of small planes from the old bi-winged planes to you name it kind of planes.  Even high up you can hear their engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time the object had moved from almost due south of me over into the southwestern sky.  A fair distance and I cannot estimate how fast it was going other than to say it was exceptionally fast.  I have never observed anything that moved at this speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hate the term “Flying Saucer” so I will say the shape was more of a blob shape.  At the speed it was traveling it was hard to hold the object still in the binoculars long enough to get a good look at it and the entire event was over in a less than 6 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do know it was not an airplane, at least none that I know of.  The speed was too great.  The color was a light gray and almost blended in with the sky.  I have no doubt if I had looked right at it with the naked eye I would never have seen it.  The object appeared to be at a fairly high altitude.  I heard no sound and there was no vapor trail of any kind and I did not see anything like wings sticking out from the sides.  No mater how high airliners fly I do not always see a vapor trail but I have always seen the wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was very clear and a dark blue color.  This may be the only reason I was able to see it.  If the sky were the usual pale blue or grayish color the object would have been invisible to the eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it had disappeared at this point I would have thought little more about it.  What happened next made my knees weak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it continue on over the southwest horizon.  While watching the object in binoculars the object suddenly made a very quick and sharp turn to the right and accelerated in speed, then it was not there anymore.   It just disappeared.   If this had been any type of normal aircraft the pilot would not have been able to withstand the G forces from such a sharp turn at that speed and maybe not even the craft itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was it some type of craft that had no wings, maybe?  But that takes us back to the old “Flying Saucer” concept.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unless some nation on Earth has come up with an extraordinary aircraft capable of performing astonishing feats in the sky, then what I saw was indeed what I would call a true UFO sighting where the “U” stands for “Unidentified” of course.

Then I got my Bushnell binoculars out but it just looked like a bigger, brighter dot in the sky through them. After watching for about 20 minutes, I decided to call my girlfriend.  We are both in out 40&#39;s {and sane!}. She lives in St. Catharines but it is too bright in the city to see any stars. We talked for about 1/2 hour and when we said good night to each other, it was still &#34;hovering&#34; around the same section of sky. This was quite an unexpected sight for me.

9/6/05 00:48|Morgan Hill|CA|Light|Approx. 60 sec.|A white bright star like object moving slowly in the 15 degrees above the horizen from Henry Co State Park!|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46231.html|446|ndxe200509| A white bright star like object moving slowly in the 15 degrees above the horizen from Henry Co State Park!<n> <n><n> <n><n> While photographing celestial objects with my telescope and astro-photography gear atop on Henry Co State Park at about over 3400 elevations, I noted this consistant bright white star like object, approximately -3 in magnitute, traveling slowly from East to North-East covering about about 15 degrees of the sky in about 45 second, very low in the horizen just about 10-20 degrees above the horizen and barely above the distant mountains as visible in the photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier that night before I head up there, I checked for any possible Irridium flashes or ISS (International Space Station) passes as well as other bright and visible satellites which could have been photographed throughout the night (Sep. 5-6, 2005).  There were no passes over California of the ISS or any other other known objects that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brightest I have ever seen ISS was about -1 magnitute at the most and at it&#39;s highest in the sky!  This object was not ISS or any other known satelite for sure as it&#39;s orbit indicted that clearly, not to mention it was too bright to be ISS or any other Earth orbiting Satelites!<n> <n><n> <n><n> So the only thing I suspected was an aircraft flying towards me head on since there were no flashes and the lights were extremly bright!  However, after observing it&#39;s flight path for about 45 second, I realizing that it was not flying towards me. Therefore eliminating to be a normal aircraft as well!  No aircrafts has a bright white spot light on it&#39;s side as far as I know!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been doing astro-photography since 1986 and I am pretty much familiar with all known flying objects, aircrafs and space crafts in the sky.  I can quickly identify what sort of objects it is when I see one!<n> <n><n> <n><n> In this case, I was puzzled as it did not make any sense!  Luckily, I had my digital camera mounted as piggy-back on my telescope&#39;s counterweight bar and was ready to take sequences of tracked 30 seconds wide angle shots to be stacked later.  So I snapped a shot of the object.  The duration of the snapshot is 30 seconds so the star like object streaked a bright white light through it&#39;s flight path right below the constellation Auriga! Note the brightness of thte star Capella (Alpha Aur.) is about 0.1 magnitute! In the photo, the stars are being tracked for 30 seconds so the light from them has been accumilated for 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In contrast, the object was moving so the brightness of it is not accu milated like stars. Meaning it is much brighter than it appears in the photograph!  It was so bright that I was confused for a second there as it was the planet Venus (-4 mag.)<n>

We live near an air force base so we constantly watch the skies for odd aircraft.  This night as we were leaving our street to get on the main rd we noticed a slow moving craft to our right in the sky not very far up maybe 500-800 ft. with 3 white lights in a triangle shape on its bottom. It was moving so slowly we thought it was wierd so we stopped to take a closer look as we slowed the craft smootly banked to the left and slowly crossed the road we were on and within about 10 sec it had done a complete 180 degree turn and was heading the opposite direction. My children and I knew this was an impossibility because 1) we hear aircraft all the time overhead, and this on made no sound what so ever; 2) It moved way too slowly for anything that we normally see; 3) The size of the arc created by the turn was only about the width of 8 streets. The size of the craft was huge maybe 200 ft wide triangular shaped, dark maybe black or grey. We turned around to follow it to get a better look but as we did it seemed to silently accelerate with amazing speed to a point we could not keep up with it. Anyway I&#39;&#39;ve been waiting my whole life to see one now I have and I have my children as witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was scanning the sky a very bright star-like and star sized object caught my eye from the Southeast.  When I turned to look at it I initially thought it was Venus or some other very high altitude plane. However, the light was very bright and after watching it for only a few seconds, its luminosity changed and went back to just an ordinary star brightness. I noticed that it was also moving in the Northwest direction so I continued to monitor its path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it move to the NW it looked like one of the numerous satellites I see all the time so I was about to turn away and find something else to look at it when I began noticing that this light was not moving in a straight line.  It was meandering right and left in a slow s-styled motion.  From my ground vantage point it looked like it was maneuvering through an obstacle course.  The speed of the object remained constant and it was still heading in the overall NW direction but it would jog right and left about 8-10 degrees every 15 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a satellite or plane change directions before like this at such a high altitude.  The change in direction seemed purposeful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been watching this first object for about 3-4 minutes when I noticed a faster moving companion object 10 degrees below it and gaining on the first.  Both objects were coming out of the Southeast and headed to the Northwest.  This second star-like object had the normal star luminosity and was travelling 3-4 times as fast as the first object. This second object was not moving in any sort of irregular pattern.  It seemed like it was traveling on a very straight line.  I could see both objects in my field of view and as I watching both, the first object flared up again.  Extreme luminosity.  It was intensely bright. The luminosity coincided with second object  below overtaking the first object above. This time the intense brightness lasted only a second before returning back to normal star-like brightness. Then a couple of seconds later the first object went dark. It completely vanished. I could still see the second object continuing to the NW but my first object just turned off or disappeared.  About a minute later the second object left my field of vision and I could no longer track it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Description seems consistent with the flare from an Iridium satellite, but neither Iridium satellites, nor the ISS, was visible from Bothell on the date, and at the time, indicated by the witness.

I was looking straight ahead of me, playing ball with my dog when I heard was sounded like a distant explosion and a second after I heard the sound, the ground and the area right above it turned to what looked like a deep, velvety blue. Something made me look up at the sky to the east where I saw the ending of an explosion of a giant ball of white/golden light. It faded entirely and then what remained a little off to the side of where the light had been was a vibrant, yet misty purple/blue/yellow haze which faded slowly and then disappeared completely, returning the sky to blackness. I likened the purplish haze to that of a nebula – the colors, patterns and shape of the mist resembled photos of nebulae I have seen. Unfortunately, my mother was inside the house and I was the only one to witness the whole thing. I posted the story on a couple of UFO websites, hoping to find someone who had witnessed the event as well yet received no response. The entire event happened very quickly, but still after all this time, it still leaves me unsettled and baffled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At first we thought it was a satellite, weather balloon or military plane, however, after looking at it through wthe binoculars we all saw the alternating red, blue-green and white lights moving continuously around the unidentified object. While watching the object, we observed it move slowly down, then to the right, and then back and forth to the left.

I was looking down on the ground. I noticed a bright light coming from the sky, as if it was a full moon. I realized the there was no moon. The light appeared to be a stoplight, so I looked up. The shape of the light was like the top half of a circle and the lights was coming from the middle portion of the circle. There was no bottom portion of the circle. It was extrememly bright. As I looked at the light it seemed to closed. Then I saw a trial go southeast. There was no sound of a plane or helicopter. It was relatively close to the forest floor. I called my neighbor and I told him about the incident and he said it maybe a meteor, but on Tues and Wed night a military plane flew overhead very low,so now I&#39;, wondering if it was really a UFO.

My Cousin and I were fishing on the Huron river and I was admiring the evening sky. I saw what I thought to be a satelite, very dim,red-orange, moving slowly at high altitude, almost exactly from west to east. Aprox. two seconds after I first noticed &#34;the satelite&#34;, another appeared next to the first. The second one was the same color as the first, only slightly dimmer. Almost as soon as the second object appeared, it encircled the first, one time in a counter-clockwise direction,  and then the two objects split up. The first, having changed it&#39;s course only slightly, continued in an easterly direction. The second bolted south and disappeared. The two objects seemed to be at their brightest when they first appeared toghether, then got dimmer from then. I watched the first object moving east, until it was too dim to see.  This whole event took less than five or six seconds, so my Cousin didn&#39;t get a chance to look up in time. However, we both noticed five aircraft, also at pretty high altitude,(too high up to hear), flying fairly close together, following the same flight path the first object took. When I say fairly close, I don&#39;t mean in formation, but they were too close to be commercial aircraft. The aircraft flew by about one minute after i lost sight of the first object.(following perhaps?)<n>

I often go out at night and sit on the hammock in my backyard and look up at the sky.  I see lots of planes and shooting starz. but on three seperate occasions over a one month period. I saw somthing I cannot explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first one was like a flash of light out of the corner of my eye to the south west muontains like someone took a picture in the sky. like a bright strobe light flash. I looked in the direction of the flash and did not see any thing again so I did not think too much about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following week in the same general area I saw a bright flash again. This time I staired in the loction for about 45sec and it flashed agian. I watched this for about 15min. about every 45sec to aminute or more it would flash this vary bright strobe. it was in the same location each time I lined up the flash area with the corner roof of my house and this object was in the same spot each time. The flashes were inconsistant and vary far apart not like an airplain flashes its light when flying over. I went in and told my wife to come and take a look at this. when she came out I told her to look in the area I was seeing this light at and about 1min later it flashed again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THEN IT GOT BETTER!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next time it flashed it was like the light stretched like someone took a rubber band and stretched it and then let go of one end. It was like it move so fast then stoped and the tail of the light cought up to it. This happened in in the blink of an eye. It did this one more time a few seconds later  leaving a green, blue and yellowish haze in the sky. after that i never saw anything agian. afew days later I saw and wathed the same flash in the sky a little more to the south the the fist two lights. Agian it would flash in an incosistant time interval. This time the last flash was very bright had the shape of a cresant moon. Then nothing. Has anyone els in the SF Bay area seen anything like this?<n>

The light was brighter than any other star or planet in the sky.  G. then got my attention and told me to look up.  I looked up to the west and noticed the same bright light without him pointing it out.  It looked like it was far away, but still was enough brighter than the stars/planets to know it was not either of those.  The bright light then dimmed a bit and then proceeded to move.  It made a backwards S curve slowly, yet not as slow as a satellite(which also cannot make S curves).  It then stopped at the bottom of the S curve.  Then we both saw the bright light shoot straight out away from us and fade into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides only an e-address.

I saw it while I was outside running laps on the high school track, so I got a very clear view of it. I describe it as a fireball for lack of a better word, but really it wasn&#39;t because I&#39;ve seen bolides before and they look much different in both color and it the expulsion of material. This was more like a very bright, very large flare because of its glowing nature, but it was falling way too fast to be a flare. It was quite beautiful actually.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Color varies, red, bluish green and that bright bluish white like some of the new cars have today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crafts seemed to hover over an area and occasionally there seemed to be lightening happening last night but tonight the appearance was different it was almost like ripples of lightening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the crafts that seem to hover several nights now but tonight is the third night in a row that I have witnessed the crafts.  Funny thing was that at 2 am the rooster began to crow and tonight the cows were mooing and almost moaning as well ... quite unusual it seems for the animals to be making any commotion like that during the wee hours of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen these crafts over a few year period now but never for so many nights in a row like the past three nights.  The crafts seem to move so slow that if there weren&#39;t trees as a guide to their movements you would not really realize they had moved at all!!!   So strange for our community to witness such strange things!<n>

I&#39;m always looking at the stars whenever they are visable. I spotted a star that looked to be blinking. I watched it for about 3-4 minutes before asking my husband to get his glasses and come outside. I pointed it out to him and he returned in to the house to retrieve his binoculars. I continued to watch the &#34;star&#34;. I could tell that there were at least three colors, white, red and green (or blue). When my husband returned with his binoculars, he said &#34;whatever it is, it sure is neat&#34;. He then gave the binoculars to me and I watched it for a short time. There seemed to be a goldish colored light that would appear occasionally. It hovered in the sky over what looked to be the Freightliner Truck Manufacturing Plant in Cleveland, NC. I checked two more times to see if the light was still in the sky. The first time, it had not moved, but the second time it had moved slightly higher and to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was only one beam of light. The sighting took many forms. There was a while where there were three crafts orbiting in a counter-clockwise fasion. They were oval shaped, solid (non-transparent), and bright white. They were 3/4 the size of a full moon. No other details on their cosmetic forms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night this happened, the sky was completely clear. No clouds whatsoever, no visible fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These crafts or orbs were amazingly fast, faster than any aircraft or vehicle that I know of, that is known to man, that has this technology. Before the crafts emitted the beam of light, the crafts seem to have multiplied to form a strand of what I like to call orbs, similar to that of a pearl necklace in an upward movement every rotation. The crafts slinkied up like this to make it look like there were several crafts (maybe there were) then returning back to one craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather balloon, no. Too fast and sporadic. I mean these crafts were FAST when they were moving. Blink and it&#39;s on the other side of the sky. I seen the shapes perfectly, they were a &#34;perfect&#34; oval shape. They were silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some background. I live in the middle of a 15 acre field. I am reposting this because it&#39;s now Aug 19th, 2010, and I can&#39;t seem to find and answers on what I saw. Since this happened, I have been increasingly interested in paranormal events, UFO&#39;s, and other things of the sort. I have respect for those who try to debunk phenomenons to prove they are fake or man-made. It&#39;s how you find answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even though I have not really done scientific or physical research on my sighting, I have a hard time thinking it something fake or man-made. It was way too elaborate and extraordinary. I saw my sighting above the treelines in my field. The forest beyond where I seen the crafts travels a little ways, but then comes to another field owned by a farmer whos name I will exclude from here. Beyond that is more forest, and a few country residental houses. Nothing very populated by any means.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning (close to noon), there was a helicopter flying very low right above the tree-line exactly where I saw the crafts. Almost as if the government or a private helicopter owner was checking the scene out. As if they seen it too, or knew something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve NEVER seen helicopters there the 10 years i&#39;ve been living there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even odder yet, about a week or so after the sighting I was relentlessly looking out my bedroom window, between 3 to 5 am, and that is when I seen something moving in the tall grass of the field. I had a pair of binoculars handy, you know, since I just got done witnessing the UFO&#39;s earlier the last week or so. I seen a creature. It was crouching at about 4 1/2 5 feet tall. It was making strange gestures. It&#39;s arms and hands were moving in almost a wave-like motion, like taunting. It was bobbing up and down a little, and left to right slightly. It was dark colored, perhaps a dark grey or brown. The most amazing thing about it was it&#39;s eyes. They were the size of grapefruits -- bright yellow, to yellowish-orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Never seen this creature before, or again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My reason for reposting this 5 years later is because I have now since moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted the full report to be known finally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was younger then. It had typos. It was poorly written. It was missing much info because it was rushed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still remember the incident(s) like it was yesterday. The details are still very fresh in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is VERY important to me to notify the new house and land owners of this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have and still strongly believe there is something in the woods and field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is something out there still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Either it&#39;s always been there or it has been left behind - or placed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for reading...<n>

I looked up and noticed what I thought was an airplane but as I stared at it, it was a brilliant blue light that was not blinking.  I stared at it for quite a while and noticed it would not blink, stay still for a bit, then move in one direction for a bit and then disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds later another bright blue-tinted light would appear in another section of the sky; maybe the difference between 12 o&#39;clock and 2 o&#39;clock. I asked others to look up and see if they saw the same thing.  They all agreed they were not airplanes or satellites.  There were probably as many as three at one time but they kept popping up and disappearing.  Then after about 5 minutes of watching, we saw no more lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The lights flickered and seem to change with smaller lights appearing around a central white light.  I watched it and it was making no consistent progress toward any direction.  I then thought it was a star, but every once in a while it moved erraticaly coinciding with strange feelings that it was going to move. The movements were way different than a plane, or any plane that I have seen.  I still thought it was probably just a star, but i noticed that my original point of observation (where I had been watching it through the trees) had changed significantly.  I saw a plane fly overhead and I lost sight of the light.  Soon it reappeared assumably from behind a cloud but vanished soon there after.  I came inside to check the night sky map to confirm that it was a bright star or planet.  Since it was almost certainly the brightest star I saw in the sky.  I sky mapped only the brightest level magnitude of star.  I estimated its bearing to be sw -  wsw, but could night readily identify a star which corresponded to its position.  It was probably nothing more than a star or planet that I could not identify, but if anyone else saw something this could be a secondary source.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To the east over the mountains she and I witnessed 2 white sphere shaped lights equi-distance apart moving away from the ground in a north easterly direction.  They moved parallel to eachother and the event lasted 20-30 seconds.  I describe the event like a reverse shooting star as the lights were as bright as a night time star moving rapidly although not as fast as a shooting star.  the lights didnt fade but just stopped being visable.   Aircraft and sattelites in orbit are frequently spotted over this area, as the night sky is very dark and clear.  No aircraft were witnessed at the time of this sighting and no aircraft have ever been seen moving in such a manner as was witnessed.  The kids were watching the movie and didnt see the event which might have spooked them.   I&#39;m 37 my fiance is 27 and we&#39;ve never witnessed anything like this before.   I just found your site tonight that&#39;s why I haven&#39;t posted sooner.

The black or dark area were at the top of the triangle the lower part the light/opaque part. The two objects were moving north to south  in a north to south parallel formation to each other at a fairly close distance to each other.  I followed them for appx. 8 seconds then their direction changed and both went in unison to the east until I could no longer see them in appx. 1-2 seconds.

The sky was so bright it seemed strange to see such a bright light in the sky. it&#39;s possible it was a planet, i guess, but i have never before seen a star or planet against such a very bright afternoon sky. no other stars or lights were visible in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw it expand and contract slightly a few times. It was moving about as fast as a commercial airliner as far as I could tell, maybe a little faster. I could tell it was about as high as the clouds because it seemed to pass through a couple. There was no contrail, and no sound. Also from the istance that i estimated it to be from me, it must have been about the same length as a commercial airliner, maybe more, and also it looked maybe 30% to 50% wider. As I was watching it in clear view it suddenly dissapeared. I watched cover about 40% of the sky. The sighting lasted about a total of 4 minutes.<n>

I was star gazing while having a smoke. I sat there and searched the sky carelessly. I noticed a few &#34;shooting stars&#34; meteorites I assume. I saw something move in the sky at an extreme speed which caught my attention. It did not travel far. I am unsure of the distance at which I saw it but, it over an hours time did travel farther away. It was to the best of my judgement circular but its possible it may of been of other shape due to the distance. I did notice that it was equipped with lights. Some green or blue, some red, and some white. This led me to believe it was an fighter jet on test or practice mission. It moved slowly in virticle and horizontal directions... Then it would instantly accelerate.... Un realistically, completely intantly travel at sureal speeds. only in a horizontal or close to horizontal direction. It did not travel across the entire sky only short distances before it would stop as fast as it accelerated. It  would slowly return to its gerneral place of origin. It also made manouvers of irratic direction only at slow speeds. I watched it for over an hour before I returned inside. I had wanted to watch it untill it disappeared but I didnt think it was leaving so went in for the night. I have never seen anything like it in my life. Never. I have lived close to airforce bases and to my knowledge there is not a craft on earth that could move as fast as this one did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe a twinkling star would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witness had observed a genuine UFO.

NOT THINKING ANYTHING ELSE OF IT I GLANCED AWAY, BUT THEN GLANCED RIGHT BACK AT THE OBJECT AS I REALIZED THAT IT WAS FAST APPROACHING, AND HEADED OUR WAY. I KEPT MY EYE ON THE OBJECT AND SOONER THAN I COULD IMAGINE, IT WAS RIGHT UPON US, ONLY I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION RIGHT AWAY THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY THIS COULD BE AN AIRCRAFT OF OUR WORLD! REASON: THE AIRCRAFT CAME WITHIN A FEW INCHES(12-18) OF HITTING MY VEHICLE ON THE RIGHT FRONT HOOD, SUDDENLY STOPPED AND STAYED THERE FOR A BRIEF FEW SECONDS, THEN BOLTED UP TO THE RIGHT AND LINGERED THRE. IT STARTLED MYSELF AND MY MOM, TO THE POINT THAT I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THIS AIRCRAFT WAS GOING TO HIT MY VEHICLE, THAT I HIT MY BRAK! ES AND MY MOM HAD A LOOK OF SHOCK ON HER FACE. MY SISTER, MY DAUGHTER AGED 9 AND NEPHEW AGED 11 WERE IN THE BACK SEATS ASLEEP AND WERE AWOKEN WHEN THE VEHICLE JOLTED, DUE TO THE APPLICATION OF THE BREAKS.MY SISTERS TWIN DAUGHTERS, ALSO IN THE BACK SEATS,REMAINED ASLEEP. I YELLED TO THEM TO LOOK AT THE AIRCRAFT, AND WE WERE ALL AMAZED. IT WAS HOVERING, BUT STATIONARY, AND DIFFERENT COLORED LIGHTS, LIKE STROBE LIGHTS, WERE BLINKING FROM THE AIRCRAFT. AS SOON AS MY SISTER SAW THIS, SHE REACHED FOR HER CAMCORDER, BUT AS YOU CAN GUESS, THE BATTERY WAS DEAD! BY THIS TIME WE NOTICED THAT OTHER VEHICLES WERE DRIVING SLOWLY AND HAD THEIR ATTENTION ON THE AREA WHERE THE AIRCRAFT WAS HOVERING. I NEVER FULLY STOPPED MY VEHICLE, BUT WAS DRIVING SLOW, AND WE WERE ALL WATCHING IN AMAZEMENT. NOT KNOWING WHETHER I SHOULD OR NOT, WE DECIDED THAT I SHOULD CONTACT THE POLICE. I EXPLAINED TO THE OPERATOR WHAT WE HAD SEEN, BUT WAS UNABLE TO TELL HER EXACTLY WHERE THIS TOOK PLACE, AS WE WERE UNAW! ARE OF THE AREA. STILL IN AMAZEMENT, ALL IN THE VEHICLE WERE S! TILL IN SHOCK AS TO WHAT WE HAD JUST SEEN, AND I EXPLAINED TO THOSE IN THE CAR WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THEY WERE STARTLED AWAKE BY ME APPLYING MY BREAKS, THEN MY SISTER ENCOURAGED ME TO TURN AROUND AND SEE IF THE UFO WAS STILL THERE, WHICH I DID, BUT IT WAS GONE, SO WE KNEW IT WAS NOT JUST OUR IMAGINATION. IT WAS REAL. WE SAW A UFO! IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN AN AIRPLANE, JET, HELICOPTER, OR WHATEVER ELSE, IT STOPPED DEAD CENTER, MOVED UP AND RIGHT, AND HOVERED. WHAT EARTHLY OBJECT DO YOU KNOW, CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS?<n>

This object had to have been at a very high altitude, because we heard nothing.  We live just outside of downtown Milwaukee and only a few miles from Mitchell international airport.  We hear and see aircraft several times as day; this was like nothing we&#39;ve seen before.  We never would have looked twice if it hadn’t been for the very obvious &#34;wavering&#34; from side to side that this object was doing.  It is very clear tonight and there were several planes in the area, all with the typical blinking lights, and all at different altitudes at the time we witnessed this.  This object had no blinking lights, which is what attracted my husband to it in the first place. We both watched it travel at a pretty good rate of speed across the sky, and then disappear into the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I diverted my eyes momentarily and two objects in the southward sky had caught the glare of the sunset. That is how i know they were metallic. They were very far off, possibly far enough to be in orbit, moving quickly due west at a uniform pace. They looked higher than i had ever seen a plane, but lower than i had ever seen an artificial satellite. I noticed the one to the rear first, and whether it was perspective or size, the one in the lead appeared smaller, yet moving at the same pace and appearing to be the same (MAYBE) cylindrical shape. The male friend of mine suggested that it was the international space station. I do not know, but a similar report given several years ago convinced me to put one in myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Those flew out of range from our view sight from where we were. There is a big blue building blocking the view of the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we kept on looking into the sky and saw another one flying across the sky, it had all the same characterisics as the triangle one&#39;s flying.

I was on the phone to my girlfriend, enjoying the clear sunny sky. Whilst talking i was observing the small clouds disapating under the suns stress and glint caught my eye. I followed the object from directly above me, several times higher than the planes flying overhead, to the horizon to the east. The object was oval in shape and appeared white, but that could have been the sun reflecting at relative angles to my position. The entire duration of its flight to the horizon was between 6-10 seconds in length maybe faster, because I only questioned what my eyes were seeing after it had disappeared. I am hesitant to presume what i saw to be alien, all i know is i have been observing the skies for about a year now through a telecope. I have seen stars, planets, satellites in my time studying astronomy but this object moved faster than i can comprehend and has no natural or man made explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Usually I notice planes moving but this object appeared to be stationery.  I kept looking at the object expecting to see some movement or wing but did not.

The object was white but seemed to glimmer a silver color. The sun was low in the sky in the east and the object seemed to be reflecting the sun, much like a mirror does. The object really struck me becuase it was not moving at all, there were no markings, lights, or other things that made the object look like a plane. I lost sight of the object (sky) for about 15 seconds as my car passed a row of trees. After passing the row of trees the object was gone. I have never seen anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had an outside cabin and were on the XXth deck of the ship room # xxx to be exact.  My sister had gotten up to use the restroom and then went to the window to look out.  She immediately woke me up and told me to hurry and come to the window to see what she was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 5 to 6 balls of light maybe 10 to 15 feet from our window that were just hovering and following the ship.  It was very dark out that night and these balls of light were very brigt, gold in color, and had a haze or aura around them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there for 15 minutes or so just mesmerized by what we were seeing.  They were in groups of 5 or 6 and we saw one shoot straight up and over the ship, it was faster than anything I had ever seen.  They just seemed to hover and then would disperse rapidly, then would reappear again.  We could see smaller ones further out just above the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On one of the balls of light we saw a triangular tail appear, it looked transparent, but you could see the outline of it, and then it just shot off and left a vapor like trail.  We called the front desk after that and reported what we had seen, but they had no answer of what it might have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day the Naturalist on the ship called us and we explained to him what we had seen, but he had no explanation.  I was looking at the other reports, and low and behold there was another reporting from someone in Aug. 2004 that was on the Regal Princess cruise ship that had reported seeing glowing objects from there balcony.  They were lucky enought to be able to take a couple of pictures of the objects because they were outside, unfortunately we were not lucky enough to get any pictures of what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But because these were sighted by another person in 2004 aboard the same cruise ship and in the same area as where we were at, I am convinced that what we saw was not from this earth.  We looked out on 2 other nights at around the same time and we never saw them again.  So maybe these are seen out at sea between the route from Juneau to Tracy Arm Alaska.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to hear from anyone else that has seen these objects or anything similar, and would be happy to answer any questions you may have.  I do not mind giving my email address out, sd_huitt@yahoo.com.<n>

I was volunteering my time at the 4th district Police Station in New Orleans. I  was a Paramedic for about 25 years and was CEO of a large EMS until 2004 when I sold the company and was in retirement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was full of stars, there was no power for close to a hundred miles in all directions, everything was pitch black in the City and, the sky was bright. This was the first night any of the military showed up and we started getting additional manpower from ICE and many Police Departments from all over.  I was waiting on the commander,I usually road with him and the Leiutenant. We had two military guys that were there when I arrived. One of them was playing with a Pit Bull puppy that was hanging around the station. He had two night vision goggles with the single scope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked if I could try them out and he told me to knock myself out. I looked around a few minutes then turned to the sky. Ihave never seen so many stars in my life the sky was glowing and I was in awe. I was looking to the west nw when I saw what appeared to be a really bright shooting star very high crossing to east se. It crossed the sky within a second or so and it was well east of us when it stopped, made a purposeful movement like a semi circle then shot directly south and disappeared. I was freaking out and couldn&#39;t believe what I saw. It was about the size of a pea with a tiny haze around it when it made the turn it seemed to have a slight distortion in the haze.Almost like a tiny tail. I kept looking in astonishment and I kept seeing them all over the sky. I pulled the night goggles off and I couldnot see them at all. I got to thinking they could be  birds or bugs or maybe a bats. I went near a light run by the generator and with ina few minutes ruled that out. I kept looking in fascination I saw other objects that flew straight over with an angelic glow or or aura, but these looked like they were orbiting. They traveled straight and lower in the sky at a fixed altitude.This I felt confident was a satellite. The UFO&#39;s were completely different,They moved much faster had purposeful movement and made very erratic turns not capable with any aircraft I know of. A captain from a sherrif;s in Iowa was sitting with me and saw them as well, we were taking turns with one pair and he was as amazedas me. About 3 or 4 am some clouds moved in partially blocking the sky.I was looking up and saw one coming from the west when it made sharp turn came directly over them staion  under the clouds, it was huge and fast, it covered my whole feild of vision in the goggles.It moved so fast it was like a blast of light moving over, no wind,no sound.  I tried throughout the night to film it with the google over my camera but it didn,t  work. The cloud cover got thicker and I didn&#39;t see them after that. I am convinced that ! you can probably see these on clear nights with good night vision goggles. I saw too many of them for it to be afluke and I would be interested to know if any one else reports similar experiences.I saw at least fifty of them over a three hour period. I have never seen a UFO before this and I really don&#39;t believe that aliens could reach us if they do exist, but I saw what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Im surprized that your windows did not break .this jet was fallowing the same path that this silver cigar was travelling end north.Ten munites later another jet fighter was circleing around lisbon and that is it.Cant wait to get pictures developed.Question? Were should I go to develope this film to make sure I get these pictures back?If anyone saw anything like this today please reply to my e-mail- ((e-address deleted))     I will post pictures a.s.a.p.<n>

They were darting back and forth very quickly in one small area. The second one we saw came about half an hour after the first one almost parallel across the sky from it. The second one we saw for only 10 minutes, and then it went behind the horizon. The first one lasted about an hour, darting back and forth while slowly moving behind the horizon. The blinking lights and the way the UFO was moving had apparently no pattern and was very random. After an hour the first UFO had also moved behind the horizon. The shape of the object was hard to make out, it was very small from where we could see with the naked eye, or even binoculars from the ground. It was closer to a sphere than other shapes. Myself and 2 other witnesses live in a very rural area where the sky is wide and open with no tall buildings or street lights to block our viewe. We are often out after dark, and on clear nights we can see the entire night sky. This is the second similar sighting we have seen within the past year.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Instead of pulling in to my house I kept going towards it. I was traveling west on New Ave. towards the refinery which it was hovering above. It moved slightly to the left and right like it was trying to get a good look at something in the refinery. As I got closer(within a couple of blocks)it started to move south. When it got about a mile away it started to move directly east,accelerating as it went. I turned around in the road and started back east on New Ave. Then it really started to pick up speed as I saw it through the trees. For a second or two it looked like it was landing like a small plane. We finally caught up with it when it gained altitude and started to head north. As it came directly over us I pulled over and shut the van off. I tried to see if it would make an idetifiable sound. Absolutely nothing was heard. As it was passing over us I noticed some different colored lights blinking in a random fashion.It appeared to be about 100 ft. in the air,not very high for a plane.We have a Coast Guard helicopter that flies up and down the I&amp;M canal on a daily basis,and we can always hear it coming, so that was not it. It continued north out of sight and that was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After watching this particular craft another appeared from the north and passed directly behind the other moving south the second object continued moving south, south west decinding into the horizon. Both objects appeared to flash and pulse colors continously with two intense bright circles on the top of the egg shape. We noticed several more of them to the north west but were further away. The first object continued to move west until out of view. None of the objects made any noise.

I looked up and saw a White, Blue, and a red blinkink light, one light at each corner.  it was in the city, and i could make out a triangle shaped air craft.

It looked just like a star. There was no flashing strobes lights on it, just a solid light. I did not hear any sound from it. I watched the object move towards my location. I then went and got my wife to come out and look at it. My wife and I observed this object go directly above our location. Once it started passing by I noticed another object that looked identical. The new object was going towards the other object. It looked like the were about to collide, because the new object appeared to pass right in front of the other. The objects continued there course for another minute then both objects lights disappered. There was no sound throughout the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second Incident:  I went back outside to look at the sky again this time with my son who is 10 years old. At 22:25 My Son and I noticed a object that looked just like the one I saw 30 minutes earlier. Just a solid light that looked like the other stars in the sky. It made no noise. As my Son and I watched this object go overhead again I noticed another object again that looked identical. Just a solid light and no noise. This time both objects were parallel to each other. As we watched these objects, we noticed that one of the lights got extremely bright for less than five seconds, then went back to its normal setting. The objects were observed for another minute then again disappered.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was large,extremely bright white, and as it traveled east, just above the big dipper: It got brighter, then dimmer, then turned red, then just dissapeared. {PLEASE NOTE: There was not one cloud in the sky on this night} We then watched the sky above USRA Major for another hour and a half. The TWO bright stars above and to the right of the dipper spoon, a pulsing white light strobed on 3 seprate times within a 1 minute period. The first time it strobed once, the second time it strobed Twice, and the Third time it strobed once, then it just dissappeared! There was also faint red light hovering in same area.There also appeared to be some sort of CLOAKED Craft too.  There was ALOT of activity in the area over URSA MAJOR that night and again the next night, {which is tonight}.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Don&#39;t remember date but late evening on I-24 East coming over the hill you see Murfeesboro well.  There were several triangular bright shapes on either side of the interstate.  They did have a red light to some and somewhere I drew a picture.  I remember large round lights to the craft.  Most were up pretty high in the sky but what made me post this is a 1998 sighting and I saw the saw 3 triangles hovering very close to the ground directly over Mufreesboro in a triangular formation.  They were still.  People were pulling off the interstate and slowing down so I know I wasn&#39;t the only one seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I’ve seen these light before 4 times over 2 years. First i though it was maybe a jet reflecting the sunset or either a satellite. I don&#39;t think its either now. There are no flashing lights or sounds. The other times i saw the red light it was usually low on the horizon in the south or west sky with little to no movement while dimming and brighten. I’ve also seen it disappear and reappear. I even had a chance to view it with my telescope and it looked the same. It looks like a star through the telescope but brightens and dims. my girlfriend has also witnessed the strange light.   What is it?<n>

I had just looked up and noticed a triangle shape off to about my 10 oclock.  I then pointed it out to my wife and saw right away. We both watched it go into the distance till we could no longer see it.  It had the width of a medium size prop plane. On all three corners where circles that had a light glow and went around the edges. There were no bright lights about it. The only outline was from street lights from across the street.  It had the speed of a lear jet and figured it was a plane that had no becon light because there is a small airstrip about 2 miles from our home.  That is when we realized there was no noise of a prop or jet. Because of darkness it was hard to tell how far up it was but by best guest about 1000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It made no noise; however, there was an aircraft just south of the object. The identifiable craft was a commercial airliner. I have experience in aviation, and this dot did not have wings that could be seen. Aircraft pass over all the time; however, you can always see their wings and they frequently leave contrails across the sky. This was a UFO, although I doubt that it was extraterrestrial. Maybe a secret military plane? Who knows?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
