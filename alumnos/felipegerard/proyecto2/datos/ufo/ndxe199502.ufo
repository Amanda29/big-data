The A.T.C. said it was a type of U.S. Military craft I can&#39;t remember. C.A.P. confirmed.Next summer pix of same craft in paper didn&#39;t look AT ALL LIKE CRAFT I DESCRIBED TO THEM!!The A.T.C. said we live in a blind radar area, by the way.I feel this is the new stealth, but who knows?  COMPLETELY SILENT AND COULD HOVER SILENTLY?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I worked at Stanford University Hospital for 22 years.Ten of those years were in Administration and the rest were as a Ward Clerk on various nursing units.I am now retired.I am 52 years old and am female. My son, now 15 and my daughter, now 17 both saw it.My daughter came running in on a clear,cold February night yelling to me that there was a UFO hovering very low over our private road.She was pretty shook up.  By the time I got there,it had gone on.However,I went outside and check the sky.Lo and behold,I saw this very large craft shaped like a stingray fish without a tail flying very low in an oval pattern.The craft appeared to be in a training mode,because the pattern never varied.The craft slowly flew the same pattern for about 30 minutes.Our house was located just before the craft turned to the left (east),and was flying so close to our 2nd story deck I could have hit it with a rock!There were norunninglights.  The entire underneath had what looked like very large glass bricks.They were so bright,it was difficult to look at them for any length of time. There was a HUGE bubble where a cockpit would be.It was VERY tall and narrow (that&#39;s the only way I can describe it).Color was either grey or green.There were no windows apparent.I think I saw a tail fin, but I might be mistaken.It was dark.My daughter, however says she didn&#39;t see a tail fin. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t own a video camera or any kind of camera at the time to record this incident.<n>

2/20/95 02:30|North Cove|WA|Fireball|2 minutes|A very very large meteor|3/6/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16690.html|38|ndxe199502| A very very large meteor<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living on the SW Washington Coast in an area of high erosion, in the aftermath of very high winds, and a very high tide, I went out to assess the damage in the light of a first quarter moon, shining thrugh a moderate cloud cover .  After walking along my property on the shoreline, I came to a road, which was once a highway, but now broken by the erosion.  I stood, looking in the dim light at the waves breaking and the driftwood being beaten on shore.  All of a sudden, I noticed a deep green glow.  I don&#39;t know exactly how it first caught my eye, but it became more and more apparent.  The intensity grew... and the deep green turned into an electric... or an increasing radiant green.  I was standing at North Cove of Willapa bay on SW Washington.  I was now looking into the entire 110 sq. mile bay.  The Hills at 2:30 AM were brightening and visible unlike anything I had ever seen in the daylight.  This light compelled me to look around.  I was wearing a baseball type hat.  Apparently, the brim of the hat kept me from seeing what I finally saw because I had to look.  Fifteen to twenty seconds into this electric green light intensifying experience, I finally looked up.  Through an opaque cloud cover, and over the moonlight, I saw a silver fireball.  (thinking, how could a silver fireball produce a green light?  But it was the way I recorded it.)  This object, from where I was standing, was as large as the moon, but moving downward from horizontal at about 15 degrees, and to the north (left to right)...  There was a period where I wasn&#39;t aware of any object, but saw some ground effect. Then there was the time I moved my attention to the object.  The total duration of the visual experience was around 20 seconds.  In retrospect, I&#39;d divide the time to half observing ground light, and the other half to observing the object.  I have seen magnesium burn before.  The ligh emmissions of this object were magnesium like.  It trailed at a slight angle, from where I looked, located half way between Seattle and Portland. It looked to be a long way off and moving very fast.  Then it went dark.  As I pondered in the instant what had happened, I turned from the edge of the road and began walking up it towards a building I owned, located some several hundred feet away.  About a minute and a half after I started walking, about the time I was ajacent the structure, there came a crash which nearly knocked me off my feet. It so happens that I tuned into Art Bell the night after and heard him ask if anyone had any information on a sighting in the NW.  Two men from Everett Washington called, stating they had been out on break in the middle of the night when they saw this flash in the sky. Now understand this.  It was a miserable winter night.  No one had any reason to be out.  I was only out because of extenuating circumstances dealing with erosion on my property. Calling in the same hour I saw it, local law enforcement called it &#34;some loud thunder&#34;. As I understand, subsequent to the experience, something hit the Gig Harbor area.  My personal feelings are that this thing came into the atmosphere around Portland, heading north/northwest.  Given the 150 mile covered in 20 seconds,  I&#39;d estimate it&#39;s speed between 25 and 30 thousand miles per hour. ((name deleted))<n>

2/16/95 21:25|Lyndhurst|OH|Triangle|12 minutes|We heard a loud, rumbling roar, observed three stationary, strobing blue-white lights which eventually moved west at a very slow speed.|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17142.html|53|ndxe199502| We heard a loud, rumbling roar, observed three stationary, strobing blue-white lights which eventually moved west at a very slow speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:25 PM, 2-16-95, my wife and I heard a jet plane type roaring.  This was not suprising, as a small airport is a few miles north.  I soon realized that the roaring was intensifing, rather than diminishing.  Looking out the west window of my family room, I saw three bright, blue-white strobe lights at about 40 degrees in the overcast sky.  The lights were arranged in a flattened triangle, with the two base lights about 10 degrees apart, the one apex light three digrees to the left and two degrees high.  If you connected the lights, it would have made a simple ship profile, with the bow to the left, the water line below. The lower to lights strobed simultanesouly, and when dark, the upper light strobed.  The rythem of the strobing would correspond to a normal resting heart beat of about 72 beats per minute.  These lights were stationary.  I opened the window and distinctly heard the great roaring sound emminating from their direction.  Using 7X35 binoculars, I could not make out any shape or outline, as the area between the lights blended in with the night sky.  The lights looked like typical aircraft strobes, but about twice as bright.  My wife also saw and heard this phenomenom. I observed the lights move, in unision, extremely slowly to the west  I watched for about 12 minutes before they dissapeared behind distant roof tops.  Just before this happened, the lights seemed to rotate slowly towards the north. I called the local radar tower and the tower at Cleveland Hopkins airport.  Neither had any craft on their radar in my vacinity, nor had there been.  I called the FAA the next morning to inquire about the same, and the woman there stated she had received a similar report from Huron, Ohio.  There, a man claimed the roaring had broken some windows.  Huron is due west of here.  Another friend living in Chagrin Falls Ohio, slightly south east of here, claimed to have seen and heard something similar the same night, glimpsing it through the tree tops surrounding his home. I am refiling this report because of the similarity to the Kalamazoo, Michagan sightings on the same night.  Kalamozoo is west by northwest of here.<n>

Nearby small airport has planes usually flying nearby, thought it was one of them.  Roaring became louder and sustained over three minutes, so looked out West window.  Sky was overcast.  Observed three blue-white strobing lights similar to aircraft strobs in the following positions, indicated by an astriks and periods.  &#34;  *      .                .  &#34; The top left light would strobe or blink and the two bottom lights would blink off, then they in turn would blink while the top left would be off.  The sequence repeated in regular cycles of approximately one second.The window was opend.  Tempeture was near 25 degrees.  Roaring sound could be heard comming from the direction of the lights.  Secon witness was called (wife) who watched for a minute, commented that that can&#39;t be a plane since it was not moving.  In fact, lights were stationary.  Got out 7x35 binoculars but could not detect any observable shape.  Distance from one light on left to one on right was eight inches at arms length with naked eye.  Brillance of light was similar to venus and hour after sunset. As I watched, noticed lights seemed to be drifting due west.  Continued watching for nine minutes  as they indeed moved away at an incredably slow speed.  Just before dissapearing behind foortops in the distance, noticed the top left light drift or rotate towards the center light, then slightly back.  Then lights were out of sight. Third witness , 83 year old mother, heard loud roar and went from window to window.  She lives 4 miles due west.  She is hard of hearing but thought a truck was outside or something. Called Cuyahoga county airport at 22:30 to ask if any military craft was in the area, negitive response.  Called Cleveland Hopkins airport tower and received same respose, but was advised to call FAA the next day. Called FAA on 2-16-95 sometime in the late morning and reported what was seen.  Woman at FAA stated similar report had come in early that AM from Huron, Ohio where man reported &#34;fighter&#34; aircraft had been so loud and low that it broke several of his windows. Nothing ever turned up in local news.<n>

This did not suprise us as an airport is nearby, and similar jet sounds are heard from time to time.  However, this sound continued well into three minutes, getting louder and louder, unlike any plane that passes by.  I looked out the westeren window of my family room and saw three blue-white strobing lights about 30 degrees above the horizon,  in a pattern which I will represent with an astrix and two periods:<n> <n><n> <n><n> (     *    .                 .       )<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lower two lights would strobe together while the upper left light was off, then the upper left would strobe while the lower two were off, doing so within one second intervals. The sky was grey overcast, tempeture about 23 degrees.  I then noticed that the lights were stationary.  At arms length, the length of the formation was  approximatel;ly eight inches.  I called my wife in to view the lights. She agreed that they did not look li! ke any plane she ever saw before,  and why was it stationary?  I opened the window and noted that the roaring noise was comming directly from the object, but there were no visable exhust jets or any obvious source for the soise.  Through 7x35 binoculars,  the lights appeared similar to aircraft strobe lights, but very intense.  No shape or outline of any kind was detected.   As I watched,  the formation  seemed to be moving extremely slowly to the west, at a speed of perhaps only a few feet per second, barely noticable.  I watched for 9 minutes before it dissapeared behind the rooftops.  Just before it did, the light on the left moved or rotated towards the center light, almost merging, then returned to its original position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I imimediately called the Cuyohoga county airport tower, (i had the number due to other problems) and asked if any military craft were in the area, or a blimp, or anything like that.  The reply was negitive.  I called Cleveland Hopkins airport and obtaind the same comment, but they recommended I contact the FAA the next day.  This I did, and the woman on the phone who took my report stated that a man had called in from Huron Ohio that same morning to report a jet that had been so low and loud, it brook several windows. Huron is due west from my home if you draw a line to it, and this was the direction the lights headed.  My mother also heard the roar, and, although hard of hearing, went from window to window looking for a truck or something, but never looked up.  She lives directly west of us on the same line.  We are self employed professionals, and I am an armchair astronomer and avaition buff, so I am fimiliar with various types of craft and celestial events.  This did not match any known objects or! vehicles.  Nothing was reported in the news.<n>

Weather was cold, 20&#39;s-30&#39;s, light wind, broken clouds. I happened to look out to the left (West) and I thought I saw a light DROP DOWN (fast) from the sky and stop dead in the air... Immediatly I rolled my window down to eliminate the possibility of a dashboard light glaring from inside and causing this anomaly. It was still there, and now was turning a light yellow-orange color. Seemed to be approx. 2-miles away -Just then I slightly ran off the road while watching this happen (wife let out a gasp -a girl thing). The next event I observed (almost slammed the brakes on to see this) was a shower of molten materials[?] and sparks &#39;dumped&#39; to the ground (LAKE? see map) Then it seemed to turn a brighter color yellow-white and Blinked off or faded-out very quickly. My wife was to hysterical from me running off the road to notice what I was gawking at... I did notice (a few days later) that there is a large  secluded pond in that same area (could this be a covert dumping of spent fuel?) Evidence may still be at the bottom of pond, a great hiding place...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was reluctant to report it because I thought I would be ridiculed for what seemed to be impossible, but, in a recent sighting report I happened across, another witness saw something VERY similar. I have since learned to trust my observations and keep an open mind to any possibility...<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: This object SEEMED to perform this feat with a military type precision!

Let me back up and say that she was only about 7 years old at the time and I had recently given her a silver baton as one of her birthday presents which falls on Valentines day.  Well, I was on my way, taking her to school early one morning not far from where we live and i had noticed she was being exceptionally quiet and staring intently out of the front windshield of my blazer.  I said , honey, what are you looking at, and she said, &#34;mommy, theres a baton in the sky&#34;.  I said &#34;what&#34; and looked in the direction that had her attention-and I saw this -perfect cigar shaped metallic looking object just above tree top level.  I immediatedly pulled my truck over and got out.  I was mesmerized. I probably just stood there a couple of minutes just watching this object-and if i had to estimate, it was probably the size of a large automobile more pewter in color than silver.  I never saw it move. I heard absolutely no sound, no lights, not anything, other than the fact that it was hovering just above the trees, and was extrememly close to us.  After watching it in awe, I suddenly got scared and jumped back in my vehicle and left-when I looked back I could no klonger see the object.  This is my first, only, and last time that I will report this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were driving from Minnesota to New Jersey, and I believe it would have been I-80 or I-90 that we were traveling on in Ohio. The incident occurred in Ohio while driving on the highway in a very isolated area.  My husband was driving, and myself, sister and daughter were sound asleep in the car.  My husband said that it had been hovering along side of us in the car for quite a while, and he was stunned by it to the point he couldn&#39;t speak to wake me up.  Finally, when he hit me in the leg to wake me, I instantly sat up and saw this thing with bright lights.  If I remember correctly, it was an open isolated area with open fields around it and I would guess that it was hovering along the highway over the field. It was incredible, and I was so excited I wanted to get the camera but it was in the trunk.  I jumped toward the back seat to awaken my sister who sat up to see it.  It was as though once we were all awake and saw it that it moved behind the car over the highway and hovered behind us.  It was as though it knew we were all aware of its presence.  I looked ahead to see an overpass approaching where I wanted to stop so I could get my camera.  When I looked back, it was gone.  My husband said that it flew away in the blink of an eye.  My sister was traumatized by it, and even at 28 years old will start crying when the subject is brought up.  I don&#39;t think my daughter remembers it at all. The strange part of it also was that my husband was driving down the highway the entire time fixated on this UFO and not even paying attention to the road, yet he kept the car perfectly straight.  The time was asked above, and I can only say that it was a couple of minutes from when I had been awakened.  My husband on the other hand, said that it had been following him for quite a while...  Even though my sister and myself were sound asleep, it was so incredibly huge and bright that the second we opened our eyes we saw it right there in front of us.  There was no pointing to look at any object, you could not miss it. It had extremely bright lights, but I do not remember it having a &#34;plasma&#34; appearance as described in some sightings.  I believe that the pictures that described it that way was a result of the camera or the fact that it was moving very fast that made it appear to look blurry.  It was approximately the size of a football stadium. I called the (800)SIGHTINGS number to report it and left a message, and if they have record of my call you could determine the date that this took place.  They never called me back.  It was a couple of months after our sighting that I reported it. In summary, I have to say that when I was looking for my camera and considering pulling over...that the only other thoughts that were going through my head were if we stop under this bridge so I can get the camera out of the trunk...will they abduct us.  They really were that close that I was starting to get worried and why they were following us like that... FYI...  My cousin, ((name delted)), who sits on the International ((deleted--aviations organization)) (or something like that), referred me to this website to report it after a family gathering where it came up in conversation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We wonder whether the witness is alluding to the dramatic incident that occurred on the night of Tuesday, March 15, 1995, which was reported to NUFORC from approximately ten states.

2/6/95 20:30|Hamilton (near?)|TX|Light|10 - 13 secs|1st week of Feb 1995.  abord flight from San Antonio to DFW.  Bright light that speed away as we approached.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42254.html|93|ndxe199502| 1st week of Feb 1995.  abord flight from San Antonio to DFW.  Bright light that speed away as we approached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (10 years have passed) I was onboard a flight from San Antonio, Texas after my father&#39;s funeral, and was heading back to Dallas (DFW.)  Since I get motion sickness easy, I have to look out the window in order to get a fixed point to look at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Cold front had gone through that cold cloudy day and it was rather windy around the time the flight took off.  The takeoff was rather bumpy, and I had my face looking out the window for something to focus on.  But the front had begun to clear the clouds away and as we gained altitude, it plane smoothed off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the plane had leveled off, I was looking out the window (right side of the plane) facing eastward.  I was enjoying the lights of the towns below and to the distance wishing I had not packed away the video camera so that I could show my son what it looks like from above.  I could see the tiny lights from the light poles along the roads and suddenly I noticed a light off in the distance that was down and in front of the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was from an airport tower because it had flashed to white as if it was turned on.  I wandered if I could see a plane take off.  But it went from a dim white light to a very-bright white light. Then all of a sudden, the light changed from white to bright red about the time the plane approached it, and it was then that I remembered that airport towers do not have red beacons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although this was away from the plane, (it appeared to be about a mile or so) when we were almost side-by-side (figuratively) it accelerated from what appeared to be a standstill and quickly outran us as if WE were standing still.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t see it anymore because of the thickness of the windows on the plane, but it as it left, it was angled upwards at a slight angle about 15-20 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other than family and one friend at work, I haven&#39;t spoken of this until now.  I was wondering if maybe you might have a report on or about this date in February 1995, the actual location is unknown. But I do know that we stayed on the West Side of DFW all throughout the flight.  As we approached the area of Dallas/Ft. Worth, our plane turned and headed east for about 8 - 10 minutes or so, then turned left in order to land from the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve looked at the map of the area several times trying to remember the details.  After we took off, I could see Austin, TX in the distance to the East.  Then Killeen (still east of the plane, but much closer) and Waco off in the distance more North East of my location when I spotted the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the light?  I&#39;m not exactly sure.  But the light itself was circular in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Dramatic.|11/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/000/S00114.html|109|ndxe199502| Four children left home to go sledding on a hill located approximately 500 yards away.  At approximately 2010 hours, the children observed a disk-shaped object streak from the night sky to the overhead position above the children.  (When asked by Mrs. Lammers how big it was, they held up their arms in a big &#34;V&#34; and stated it was within 50 feet of them.)  The next thing they remembered, they were scared, they found themselves sledding in their underwear, and they ran home, the first of the four, Nicky, the only girl, age 10, arriving home first. All four children were talking about the saucer they had seen.  The mother had not addressed the possibility of any kind of interaction between the craft and the children until her second telephone call, made approximately 25 minutes after completion of the first.  The children reported that the craft flew to the west, then to the south, then disappeared.  They estimated that they watched it for 2 minutes.  Craft was oval, and gave off soft, white light.  It gave off a &#34;microwave&#34; sound.  Ages of boys was 15, 14, and 13 years; girl was 10 years.<n>

I was taking my wife to Work because of a snowstorm. Snow was falling heavy, we saw three lights in the distance close to the ground. I thought that SOME IDIOT was flying a small plane in the storm and had iced up the wings and was coming down (crashing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The closer we came to the lights originally bright white, they were orange and very bright.  When we drove to the top of the hill, I realized that the lights were stationary, spaced equal distance apart and about 200 Ft off the ground and not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The small farm where it was hovering (making no sound at all) looked like all the buildings were on fire the light was so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped the car turned off the engine but left our lights on, and I opened the window.  We could hear the sound of the large snow flakes land on the car in clumps but the huge black triangle was making no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kind of creepy feeling, all that watts of light no mechanical sound, so we just drove on to town.
