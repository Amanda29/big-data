Then another and another all in the same flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in the house to get my daugthter she came out saw the objects and ran back in and got her camera.  In all their were at least 10 glowing orbs that all followed a southwestern path and then disappeard.  I do believe in UFO&#39;s,but I&#39;m thinking someone set off some sort of glowing objects maybe with parachutes or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They came up over the neighbors roof,so i didn&#39;t see anything being shot into the air.  It was pretty exciting and my daughter got pictures and maybe video,don&#39;t know see is still sleeping.<n>

It was a ball in the front with a tail.  It appeared and disappeared very quickly.<n>
7/31/10 23:05|Stanmore, Winchester (UK/England)||Light|Two minutes|Low flying orange spherical UFO / filmed and revealed to be displaying distinct illumination|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76963.html|3|ndxe201007| Low flying orange spherical UFO / filmed and revealed to be displaying distinct illumination<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 23:05 hours on the evening of August 31st, 2010, I happened to look towards the southeast from the upper floor of my home and noticed a fast moving brilliant and steady orange colored spherical light source.  The source was moving wards the north-northeast in a smooth steady motion, which I estimated given its relative distance of roughly one quarter mile from my position to be traveling at between fifty and seventy mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it flew, the source appeared to make a small, very smooth deviation from the straight course it had been following when I initially noted it, and in a long lazy arc came to a complete stop in the sky approximately at an angle of sixty degrees above the horizon, wherein it seemed to perform a complete stop and then in a matter of seconds faded away to nothingness (this effect may have been achieved by the source moving away from me on an easterly course, gradually being lost from view, or by some other means).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able at the time to motion capture approximately fifty-nine seconds of the source objects flight using a Kodak EasyShare C813 8.0 MP camera, which when played back seemed to indicate that it was spinning, and was not entirely orange in color.  Instead, brilliant instances of white and a very brilliant and distinct blue hue were also in evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sadly, due to my initial attempts at sighting the camera on a moving object set against a black sky and under less than ideal circumstances, the initial footage is shaky, but still clear enough for it to be clear enough for analysis.  At the time of the incident, the sky was heavily overcast with broken slow moving clouds.  There was a full moon, and the source appeared to be moving along some distance below the cloud base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish to point out that the route on which the object was seen is part of the regular flight path for aircraft coming into Southampton Airport, yet it was moving counter to the established route and was seen to be carrying lights ((which were not)) consistent with known aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> My apologies, that was an obvious and somewhat unfortunate mistake on my part. The date should read, July 31st 2010, not August as you so rightly pointed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, be advised that a small typo should be amended, it is &#34;yet it was moving counter to the established route and was seen to be carrying lights consistent with known aircraft,&#34; which should read:<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;...yet it was moving counter to the established route and was seen to be carrying lights which were not consistent with known aircraft.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you are interested in the footage, it is just under 60 seconds long and in MOV format just under 18MB long. If you know of any reliable means wherein I can send that securely without correuption and at a lower file size, I would be interested in hearing about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for contacting me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have an additional comment to add.  I have only just learned from my father who lives at the nearby village of Fair Oak, Hampshire, some seven and one half miles from me that on the night of August 25th, approximately 22:50 hours, he observed two independently operating orange spherical light sources.  In the course of the observation, the objects travelled an undisclosed distance, probably no more than one quarter miles knowing the viewpoint that he had, and from south to northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting was terminated when one of the objects stopped abruptly in mid-flight and shot straight up at considerable speed, followed five seconds later by the second, both subsequently vanishing from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can attempt to obtain additional details, but this is certainly curious given the nature of the object that I personally observed and managed to capture in motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  All requested corrections have been made in the text above.

My brother in law commented on different constellations and I mentioned how on the night before my brother and I used an application on his phone that would tell you what you were looking at in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and saw what looked like a group of birds in V formation but in light form.  I thought that was odd and continued to look and the lights moved very quickly and then shifted from V formation to where the left side of circular lights moved to the right side and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said &#34;look, look&#34;, and by the time my brother in law and sister looked it, the cirular lights of around 10 lights in V formation was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They thought I was seeing things, but I have never seen anything like this.

My niece looked up and said &#34;what the f__k is that&#34;?  We saw two objects that were orange in color and round in shape. The orange color was much darker in the center. It looked much like an &#34;over easy&#34; breakfast egg. The outer portion was more like a glow coming off of the inner &#34;yoke&#34; portion for lack of a better term.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were green colored static like charges which extended from the outer center of these objects to the outer center of surrounding glow. All three of us confirmed that we saw these green energy flows within the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects appeared to be in a straight line with each other, with one being approximately one mile behind the other. I can only guess at the altitude which I would say was about 2500 feet. Maybe slightly lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched these objects for two or three minutes as they were moving slowly when suddenly the object behind was side by side with the first object. It happened in a split second. They proceeded slowly for a short time and the trailing object just kind of took a slight right turn and took off. The leading object lumbered around for a few moments and took a slight left turn and took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they left you could see the speed and direction they were taking, but it was a split second later that you could no longer see them at all. I&#39;m way too busy to be making this up. In fact, it&#39;s become more of a chore for me because I won&#39;t let it go. I know what I saw!<n>

After falling It grew brighter ( Blue ) then flashed an orange white hue and shot directly east at a completely perfect horizontal flight path.  The Object did not appear to be a Aircraft or Shooting star I know the difference,  It was almost like an falling orb than turned into a rocket.  I didn&#39;t have time to take a picture of the object due to the fact I was on the cell phone looking up at the Big Dipper.  My friend told me to report It and so thats what I did, hopefully someone else saw what I seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was mesmerized by the object and noticed it made no sound.   The sky was mostly clear so I got out my camera but could not focus on it and gave up trying to take a picture. It did not seem too far away, traveled in a straight path, did not have any sort of tail, and wasn’t really fire as much as glowing and omitting light from all directions.  Its movement was more floating than flying and was very fluid.  You could not see a definitive shape to the object and it was definitely not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got farther away it appeared to slow down or possibly stopped, but that could have just been the depth of field playing tricks on my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a friend and described it to her in hopes she could see it from her house, but no luck.  The whole experience lasted at least 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not really a believer in UFOs, but I definitely saw something! I can’t explain and am very curious to know what I saw.<n>

When I looked up, I saw 3 lights, red, green and blue in a triangle formation rotating in a clockwise direction.  The lights were pulsating/blinking very fast.  The object was moving from East to West towards the Tappan Zee Bridge.  At first I thought it was an airplane, but I very quickly realized that this was something like I have never seen before.  It moved at the same speed as a plane but I could not hear any noise.  After about 30 seconds, I lost sight of it behind the trees, but appeared to be heading towards the Hudson River.  When I first saw it, I was facing North- North - East, and it was at about a 60 degree angle.  The lights were larger than those on airplanes.  I would imagine that someone on the Tappan Zee or I-287 would have seen it since I live so close to the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When we got through Waukon, IA, we noticed 4 bright lights...three of which were PEACH size and color, and the other bright red.  The bottom light was peach, and the next one was red...as we thought we were looking at a light tower that had been tipped at 45 degrees to the right...though we knew no towers were there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we noticed 2 more peach lights above that... the heighth from the ground unknown.  The 4 lights moved TOGETHER and kept a common onterval...seeming as if it were one object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To me it looked as if it were a triangle shape... or closed V- shape.  The opening of the V was pointed West and the point, as it were, was to the East.  The object was moving very rapidly to the North West very rapidly.  I&#39;d have to say 5 times faster than a normal 747 would...maybe faster, as it was only visible for 5 mins... at first it didn&#39;t seem to move, for 5 mins, and then all of a sudden, this whole thing shot off to the North West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can try to submit a drawing of what we saw if desired.<n>
7/31/10 21:52|Riverside|CA|Light|10 sec approx|Brilliant green object, seems to launch smaller white objetc|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76933.html|12|ndxe201007| Brilliant green object, seems to launch smaller white objetc<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 07/31/2010 I was on my back porch looking at the sky.  The sky was clear with just a few scattered clouds. I had originally gone out to see what was happening, as about an hour earlier, a pair of Blackhawk helicopters were circling the area, extremely low with only their battle lights on.  I ended up looking at the stars after they left.  At 2152 hrs I noticed what seemed to be a satellite approaching from the south, about 30 degrees above the horizon. It was moving rather slow for a satellite and moving towards the northwest.  It started as a dim white color but began increasing in size and intensity.  Just when I thought I was about to see a good iridium flare, I realized that instead of flaring and then subsiding, this object was continuing to increase in size and brilliance.  It became huge, larger and brighter than Saturn visible to the west, and the color was now an unusual shade of light green around the edge and brilliant white in the center.  It appeare! d to be self-illuminated and not reflecting the sun.  It remained at its brightest for several seconds, then it suddenly went completely dark for a fraction of a second, then returned with full brilliance.  Concurrent with this display, I noticed a small, white object shooting off to the west at a slight downward angle.  The white object looked like a small, very slow meteor leaving a short trail.  It appeared slightly below the green object and quite a bit to the right of it, but the trajectory of the white object in relation to the green object gave me the impression it had shot out from it. (It is possible that it was just a meteor as there was nothing unusual about it other than its appearance and proximity to the green object.)  The green object, after re-appearing, remained illuminated for a about a second, then rapidly diminished in size and became completely dark. It did not just blink off but seemed to &#34;power down.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2202 hrs., I saw a two more objects one after another, almost directly overhead going from south to north. They performed similarly to the large green object, but did not become as bright and they remained white in color.  They too grew in intensity, flashed on and off several times and then went dark.  I checked the Heavens Above website and discovered that there were NO iridium satellites visible from my location on that date, and the other known objects that were visible were not overhead at the times or locations of these sightings.<n>

It was white, about a third the size of the moon &amp; diffused.  We were simply talking outside in a unlit area on Regional Road 56 and this the sky was quite visible at the time.  There was intermittent cloud cover at the time.  At first it appeared to be a plane above the thin cloud layer &amp; so I did not pay much mind to it. However when I checked back to it several minutes later the clouds have passed &amp; I noticed that even a clear sky the object emitted still was glowing a diffused white light. It did not appear to be solid &amp; I could not gauge a distance.  The other interesting thing was that it did not move at all in that time &amp; when looking at it with peripheral vision - it seemed to flicker quite rapidly.  However one was unable to see the flickering when looking at it directly.  The flickering was somewhat random, &amp; very rapid, not like a star. During the next roughly 3 hours as we! continued to observe the object, It continued to remain in the exact same location, flicker quite vibrantly &amp; every few minutes it would seem to dissipate for a minute or so, only to return to the same location.  The flickering was quite prominent at times, to the point that it seemed to light up the sky quite visibly in the peripheral vision when not paying too much attention. At roughly 12:30 the object disappeared again but did not return this time. It remained stationary the whole 3 hours when looking south east @ roughly 30-40 degrees inclination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD))<n>

I was sitting at a table between two modular homes. I was facing approximately, North, North-East.  At the time of the siting, I looked up about 45 degrees and saw a light in the sky.  Then there was a second light to the left of the first one. I first thought there these were early stars, but the sky was still quite blue, the star Antaries, which usually came out first, directly above, was not out yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that I was seeing an aircraft, or a satellite, or a space station.  I commented to my friend about seeing two lights.  Then the one to the left started to move to the left.  As it did, two other lights appeared about these first two.  They were closer together than the firs two.  Then the second light that moved to the left disappeared.  Thie direction would be toward the North West. Now there was just the three.  Then the upper two lights disappeared followed by the first light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was puzzled because, these lights really looked like faint stars, but it was too early for stars to appear. The final formation of these four points of light could be labeled like the geometric figure known as a trapezoid.  The lower left point of light was the one that moved away. I tried to see if the other three moved in any direction. They did not. They only disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thirty minutes later when the Great Dipper came out I tried to get my bearings to determine which part of the sky these lights appeared. This was approximately above the constellation of Cassiopeia.  But not as high as the North Star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This siting was so unusual that I got up from the dinner table and started mentioning to my friend that there were some lights in the sky and that one was moving. It was shortly after standing up that the other two higher lights appeared and then disappeared. My friend also got up from the table.  I pointed to the area of the sky where I was seeing the lights.  I asked him if he saw the lights, but he said he did not see any lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Usually I wear contact lenses in both eyes.  For over a month I have not worn a contact lens in my left eye, in order to prepare for an eye test, prior to cataract surgery.  I was only wearing one contact lens in my right eye.   My vision in my right eye, with corrective lens is better than normal.  It is between 20/50 and 20/70.   I am very certain that I say what I saw.  Also, I have an uncanny suspicion, that these lights were part of the same phenomenon.<n>

I was talking with a fellow truck driver when the sky lit up a very white light and the other driver jumped and asked &#34;what&#39;s that?&#34;  I turned and saw about half the sky was &#34;lit up&#34; with a very constant (not flickering like fireworks) light and in about the center of the lighted area was a gray cigar shape. It never moved or made any noise.  After 10 seconds the cigar shaped object started to disappear. It&#39;s size never changed.  After 5 seconds the object was gone.  The light started to dim and after 3 seconds (or so) it was gone.  There were no thunderstorms in the area, only a few very small clouds.  No lightning anywhere was visible.  I am a licensed pilot and don&#39;t drink or do drugs.<n>

It was moving west at a very slow speed for any type of craft except a plane approaching landing.  There were what appeared to be red, blue and orange lights toward the front that were glowing steadily.  After this thing went about a mile past us the lights went out and you could no longer see it.  About three minutes passed and there it was again going overhead to the west and again after a few minutes the lights went out again.  A second craft maybe?  Strangest thing I have ever seen on a clear night with a nearly full moon to boot.<n>

It was very high up and was moving north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, it turned right and headed west in a straight line and at the same speed.  A few minutes later, I and my girlfriend noticed other objects like the one I have described and for the next hour and a half we watched 14 or  more of them moving west in a straight line and one consistant speed which was rather slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of the objects looked round but some were triangle shaped.  Most were moving slowly west but, some just hoovered in one spot.  One hoovered for 30 min and then slowly moved north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the army surplus across the street and told the guys working there about the objects.  They got some binoculars and we looked at one of the objects.  Through the bino&#39;s I could see that the object was 3 white orbs held in a triangle frame like thing.  And as we watched another white object moved toward this 3-orbed object and was very neat it before it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the objects were very high up.  When jets would pass by , one could see that these objects were way higher in the sky than the jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects made no sound , they made turns, changed directions , and moved in straight lines as well as hovering.  NO high speed stuff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing I noticed, when I was looking at some of these objects, I would notice another similar object  behind the object I was looking at that was much much higher up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:<n>

This white light begins as a speck in the sky, then quickly grows bigger &amp; brighter within seconds.  It lingers for approx 2 seconds, it then moves to the right before it gradually fades out.  On  July 27th it was spotted for the first time by my daughter.  July 28th, it appeared twice, this time I saw the second appearance at 11:19pm.  The following night, July 29 it appeared 2 times at 11:19pm, and again at 11:29pm.  Last night, there were 5 appearances, beginning at 11:05 and ending at 11:29.  I believe it will happen again tonight and I just hope someone else reads this, see it and has an explanation.  Height approximately 10,000 feet.

He saw some strange lights coming from the north that he recognized wasn&#39;t a typical plane.  At first, it appeared to be planes flying in a formation but there was no noise.  It appeared to him to be five sets of lights.  The front light was flashing multi colors.  Two white lights appeared to be behind those lights.  As it changed direction the lights appeared to bank together so he realized that this wasn&#39;t a bunch of planes. He came inside and quickly got me to come outside and look at what he was seeing.  At that point, the lights appeared to be hovering at a few thousand feet and there was no sound. what I can describe was a triangle pattern of red lazer type lights that moved in a erratic nonuniform pattern and above that was multi color lights of red, green, blue, white,yellow or orange that flashed the colors intermittently.  As we stood there in shock, after about 2 minutes watching this, it slowly moved ! to the south and disappeared in seconds in the darkness.<n>

I have viewed it from several different vantage points, both with the naked eye and with binoculars, a well as taken pictures.  Anybody who looks up at the sky could clearly see it. It is not being shy or covert at all.  It doesn’t seem to move much except to make a very slow descent behind the big mountain that makes up one half of the Camarillo grade (101 freeway, where truck scales are), so by 11:30 or so, it ha disappeared from my view. It does appear to change colors occasionally, from brilliant white, to a hazy yellowish orange, to a bluish white glow, and sometimes a red aura appears on the top part of whatever this is. It also appeared to have some much smaller, much dimmer lights come off it in several instances over the past week.  Because there is a military base nearby ( Point Mugu) I at first thought it was some kind of helicopter holding its position in a military exercise of some kind. And it might be just that, I don’t know what it is at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wouldn’t have even come here to post this, except for a caller I heard on the Coast to Coast  radio show that described how he was seeing a strange bright light in the sky from sundown to 11:30pm, and this had been every evening for the last week or so. He went on to describe the very same characteristics that the light I was seeing possessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The show host told this caller to report his sighting on this website. So I figured I should do the same with my sighting, for whatever its worth. I unfortunately did not hear where the caller was calling from, but would like to find out if it’s the same light or two different ones in two separate places. I guess I will just continue to watch it at night, and to try to get some better pictures of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus in the western sky, we suspect. PD))<n>

MUFON says this is impossible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first of four appear directly over the City Of Reading, PA.  It is NOT VENUS. It is BIG and BRIGHT looking, through binoculars, like a kryptonite headlight.  When it first appears it sometimes looks like a white circle with light beams coming off it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It goes through about 20 minutes of &#34;development&#34; during which time it becomes larger, brighter and drops lower in altitude.  During this time, also, it develops a metallic protrusion at the five o&#39;clock position...we often refer to it here as the ((deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 9:30 the second, third and fourth appear very high in the sky and much farther out.  They clearly come from the same factory.  We now call them JFV1, 2 3 and 4 in honor of John Forester, the Managing Editor of The Reading Eagle who continues to insist #1 is Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The biggest, closest and brightest (JFV1) then goes through his nightly routine of travelling a semi-circle over and away from the city getting so low the camera is well-below the LEVEL point.  Throughout his routine, he is approached by INTRUDERS that look just like stereotypical flying saucers and the like. These are not visible to the naked eye but are captured quite well by 14mp and 900mm Pentax SMC lens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The INTRUDERS seem to use JFV1 as if it were a New Jersey Traffic Circle.  Sometimes they seem to be in conflict.  JFV1 often contorts into ugly shapes when they are moving too fast or too close...very weird but they are definitely communicating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> STRANGE PHYSICS...When taken out-of-focus JFV1 becomes OTHER clear and IN-FOCUS OBJECTS usually in the form of a nonagon.  Surfaces of the nonagon can be presented looking like a bucket of garbage or even the scene of PA countryside from an airplane.

Well then he saw another one in the same part of the sky and then I saw another one again also in the same part of the sky the first two had been in I concluded it had to be a meteor shower, then his girl friend said &#34;What that moving up there?&#34; we were all looking up and we watched as this small little dot moved across the sky I figured it was a satellite it appeared to make a straight line but more like those carts from IKEA make a straight line... NW in direction hugging the west.  We all just keep talking about ghost stories and what we thought of aliens and other things that we all thought maybe we saw something, my, brother and I continued to look at the sky, until I saw another object exactly the same out of the corner of my eye this one looked as if it came from the same sector of the sky! as the fisrt one but was on a slightly different path, now the strange thing about this one is that my brother and I we watching it as I said &#34;look it&#39;s getting brighter&#34; when it light up like a light bulb and then dimmed again, we were both aw stricken for a moment but thought that if it was a satellite it could have been the moon reflecting off of the wing of the satellite, but than I looked into it further and found that only the sun is bright enough to do that but from the angle we were at and where it shinned would have been the complete opposite direction of where the suns beam would have caught it.  anyway the second one looked as if it was also going north but on a different path but hugging the west even more so than the first.  I looked into sighting the next day and found something about the UK, and Uruguay, but nothing that match we we all saw that night any who the sky is still pretty cool!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Object was white changing to red then green then back to white.  Object was seen moving  and then hovering for a few seconds. It was not any type of aircraft and it made no sound.  I thought it looked like a giant laser pointer in the sky.  When it went across the sky, it went from the southern most horizon to the northern horizon in no more than 2 seconds.  I have never seen anything like this before.  After about 10 seconds object came out of the northern horizon back to its original position, all the while changing colors, again object made no sound.  Object then rose up to zenith above my head, pulsated colors for a few seconds and then disappeared.  The object was there one second and gone the next and did not return.<n>

We were facing the east side of our yard.  When we turned around to go back in the house, we were both immediately drawn to two large, globe-like lights that seemed to be glowing a bright orange.  We live near Selfridge Air Force Base and are very familiar with the aircraft that frequent this area, both at day and night, along with their lights.  These lights were nothing like we have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects were positioned with one much higher than the other.  They were just hovering. This was for around 1:30 minutes.  The objects then moved very quickly and very near to each other.  The object that was originally lower than the other,  made a rapid clockwise circles, around the other object and the two seperated, both going in seperate directions at very high speeds and just dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not have a camera ready as we were both in awe of what we were seeing, and we both know what we saw was nothing like we had ever seen.<n>

He said to me &#34;Come out here NOW!!&#34;  He had a very serious look so I followed him out in my towel and stood on the porch. He turned me around and said, &#34;What is that??!!&#34;   He pointed at the sky. As my eyes focused on the clear night sky, I could then see what he was talking about.  Something very large was hovering what looked like across the street just above the houses at less than 10,000 ft.  There was no noise and red lazer like lights were blinking quickly in a triangle pattern although not uniform but random. Above that were different color lights, blue yellow white, orage and green alternatingon and off, again, not in any uniform manner.  I asked him in shock, &#34;What is that??...&#34;   He responded he didn&#39;t know. We stood there for about two minutes watching it.  I wanted to yell at a neighbo! r who happened to be in his garage at the time but again, I was only in a towel.  Slowly it moved to the south and was quickly gone. We were both in shock.  He said he had noticed it when unloading the luggage while it was flying from the north.   He didn&#39;t believe what he was seeing and came in and got me.  I threw on some clothes as we walked around the block to look for it.  I had seen UFOs before while living in Colorado but nothing that close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day, those light are imbedded in my mind.  I think the multicolor ones reminded me of a Simon game and since then, went and purchased one to mimic those lighs.  We haven&#39;t seen them again but I know they are still out there.<n>

As is my habit, when I got out of the car I looked up and surveyed the nighttime sky. Looking in a south-easterly direction I noticed what looked to be an airplane. Again, as is my habit, I looked for the FAA lights (blinking red and green lights). I did not see any.  The light was pretty bright, so it&#39;s possible that, due to the angle and the brightness of the light, I just couldn&#39;t see them. I also noticed the speed, which seemed relatively normal for an airplane.  The trajectory was mostly straight, though for a moment I could have sworn that I saw it drift to the east just a bit. This could have been an optical illusion.  However, over the course of the 20 or so seconds that I was watching, I saw the light increase in brilliance.  The object seemed to get bigger, though this might have been an effect of the increasing luminosity, changing from an off-w! hite color to more of a resplendent white. This lasted about 5 seconds, after which the light dimmed, making the object seem as if it were getting smaller. As it dimmed it became blue, like so many stars.  What was left, for a moment, was a dim dot of light surrounded by an even fainter corona; it resembled the dot of light that would be left in the center of the screen on old black-and-white televisions immediately after being turned off.  This lasted for just a moment, after which the dot became smaller and dimmer, until disappearing altogether. I kept looking at the sky for at least another ten minutes, in case it was an airplane that had turned it&#39;s lights off momentarily, but the light did not reappear.  I could not see the outline of any kind of craft, nor was there a sound to be heard.<n>

Commercial Flight Altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the West, over the Rockie Mountains, I saw a grey/silver object floating stationary at my best guess around 30,000 ft. It was near commercial flight altitude. Too high for a helicopter, and not moving at all, unlike a flare, missile, or Satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would periodically and randomly flash a bright white light at me, as bright as a super bright iredean flare. Not in any kind of consistent order like FAA lights. Every now and again it looked like the light shown right at me. Atleast in my direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the course of about 10 minutes it started to slowly move off to the North where I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took pictures and video of the object. I can&#39;t see it yet, but I haven&#39;t put it in Photoshop to blow it up and clean it up yet. But I did notice 2 round very strange lense blurs on my camera. Almost look like if you were to look down into a cone of water. Only when I shot photo&#39;s of the object did these blurs show up...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were winking on and off intermittently (no rhythm to the intervals)  and appeared to be changing location slightly from their formation. They were just above the southern horizon in respect to my location which is in the Uniontown area just south of the Hartville flea market..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded to wake my wife up and she then witnessed the event. We watched the objects hover until’ about 6am, when they appeared to disappear over the horizon. In respect to our location, the lights were about the size of a burning cigarette tip held at arms length. They appeared to be moving very slowly to the south as we watched them. The entire elapsed time of the event was 45 minutes, although they were probably there longer (before I saw them).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I continued to investigate, it slowly -- and at a deliberate and even pace - traversed east across the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got the sense I was witnessing something quite unique and even though it sounds mundane as I type this, it was truly awesome as it stretched as far north and south as the eye could see.  It was geometrically perfect, narrowing at both ends.  If I had to guess at what it might be, I could only say that I believe it was a deliberate mass of something that had a specific purpose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it arrived close to the moon and was about to cross it, I could determine it was approximately twice as wide as the moon, and as it traveled east and away from the moon, it got dimmer until I could no longer make out the outline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: I am a frequent sky watcher, C2C listener and have observed (and filmed) many unexplained phenomena and I have never seen anything like this before.<n>

She was turned looking at me and talking to me while I was looking up at the stars, and I see this circular object, made of all light, fly across the sky.  It flew by pretty fast; it took about ten seconds to get out of my sight.  It was bigger than the stars; from the distance away it looked like the size of a ball.  We BOTH heard a sound come from it, but my girlfriend didn’t see it (since she wasn’t looking at the sky).<n>

Out of the corner of my eye in the bay window I was sitting near, I suddenly saw a bright green light appear out of nowhere, as the light came closer (it seemed like it was flying) to the house it became bigger and brighter, and just disappeared!  It seemed to fizzle out quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was frozen, and didn&#39;t say anything and my sister in law said OH MY GOD DID YOU SEE THAT?!  I turned on the outside light and saw nothing.  Not even 30 seconds after the fire station alarm was going off.  I still do not know why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a 1/2 hour after seeing the light, we witnessed a flash of green light coming from the other side of the house.  My mother told me today that a lot of people who went into her work today were complaining about losing power as well last night.  I have to say that this was the weirdest, spookiest thing I have seen in my life.  My sister in law saw this dead on, where as I said, I saw it from the corner of my eye.  She will be writing in as well.<n>
7/28/10 23:45|Walatka|FL|Light|6 minutes|Orange glowing balls over rural Florida Lake.|7/29/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76844.html|46|ndxe201007| Orange glowing balls over rural Florida Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday night, right around 11:45pm I witnessed 2 Orange glowing balls.  It was distant, but was bright enough to reflect light off of Little Lake George on the St. Johns river in North Florida.  I was looking almost exactly South, With a clear view of the Stars and the moon was not a factor, it was behind me.  It was Clear,  but with Clouds that had rolled in off of the Atlantic. It was in the sky when I noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I smoked a cigarette watching it, I&#39;d say 7 minutes total time watching it.  It looked at first as if it was stationary, but very high in the air.  I&#39;d obviously say no more than 6 miles away.  Stayed stationary for about 5 1/2 minutes.  It started moving at an incredible speed from right to left then down lower and lower away and down below the horizon, never losing luminosity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve spent a lot of time in that spot, and I&#39;ve never seen that before. I&#39;ve seen night training, I&#39;ve seen jets buzzing the tops of trees, following the river down to the ra! nge.  Not that big, Not that bright. No exhaust vents on a jet can put out that much light,  There is nothing in that direction, no light, no civilization for that matter for about 30-35 miles. The lake goes out for 2 miles, and reflected the light. Around 30 miles down the river and through the forest is the Ocala National Forests Bombing range.  I&#39;ve seen Flares, I&#39;ve seen training over that thing more than once, Night and Day.  After the bombing range is the Umatilla Municipal Airport.  Way too far away, in my opinion, that&#39;s around 50-60 or greater miles away.  If it were a flare, from a boat on Lake George, once again, I&#39;d have ruled it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were visible aircraft in the Area, with green and red lights, blinking. They were obvious commercial Aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my friend, explained what was going on, while watching it. That was 3 minutes in. He works at a Government facility near Jacksonville and asked if he was busy with anything that night, I&#39;ll keep that interpretation up to you. There is a Power Station North of the site, and I thought well maybe it is some kind of reflection. He said no.  He will talk to me in person soon about this, But because of the sensitivity of his job, I&#39;m not sure if he will.  He&#39;s a close friend though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for myself, That&#39;s where I was, that&#39;s what I saw. My  Anonymousness is no matter,  My Personal description is one of a College Educated Young man. I don&#39;t have any experience with Military Aircraft, but talked to someone via phone during the event that does. I&#39;ve also never seen a UFO or anything for that matter that I can&#39;t explain easily. This was something entirely different.<n>

I have observed what would appear to be &#34;black clouds&#34; moving at will across the sky.  Some will contain lights which move within the clouds and in the last couple of days, the lights have actually been moving from cloud to cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last week for the first time, the lights were orginally white within the black area, but then in one particular cloud, they started flashing red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, tonight I witnessed the lights, several in one black cloud, change from white to red.  Not all of them changed colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These clouds are located in the southern sky from my vantage point and will move both horizontally and vertically at will.  There does not seem to be any particular pattern to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen them almost every night and have tried to figure out if there was a pattern that could be explained, but it just does not seem possible that someone on the ground could be creating this activity since sometimes, several of the &#34;black lit clouds&#34; are moving in different directions at the same time, again with no pattern.<n>

It was approximately the same brightness as the stars comprising the Plough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about five seconds as it dawned on me that it can&#39;t be a star, whereupon it gradually faded to nothing, taking about another three seconds to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was hoping to see it move but it remained absolutely stationary for the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No big deal as sightings go, but I thought I&#39;d commit it to posterity in case someone else saw it too and can provide more information.<n>

Upon looking at it closer I noticed that the light formation on it was different than the airplanes that I’m so used to seeing. What caught my attention was that it was moving abnormally slow for an airplane, but on par with maybe a helicopter or blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a minute, I thought it could be an ultra light aircraft, but it was completely silent.  Next I thought maybe the lights on the bottom of a blimp, but I have never witnessed a blimp in 15 years of living here.  My best guess was that it was triangle shaped, but it was very hard to make out with city lights around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing whatever it was made absolutely no noise.  It kept slowing down and finally stopped and sat there for about 10 seconds before changing course.  It was initially heading west but stopped and changed course to heading due north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it changed direction it went straight over head.  As it flew over I tried to make out what it was.  It had three white lights in a triangle formation with one blinking red light in the middle with one additional slightly dimmer blinking white light mixed in.   The red light was slightly brighter than the rest of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn’t seem to be very far up at all, and it wasn’t very big that I could tell.  Before it changed course, it was sort of near the moon I could make out sort of a roundish looking bottom to it, but only for a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved northward, it picked up speed to what would be expected of an airplane.  I ran into the house to get my video camera, but when I came out it was way far off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am quite used to planes flying over and see them often.  I don’t however EVER see a plane slow down, stop, and then completely change course.   It was very eerie watching that fly overhead with no noise at all!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The blinking red light seemed to indicate that it was manmade, but who knows?   Whatever it was it gave me the creeps!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a student here, and have good eyesight and wasn’t at all drunk or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not the first weird thing I’ve seen here either.  On Dec, 23 and 24 of 2009, I saw a ball of light out in the distance that looked like the spot light on the front of a helicopter, but got dimmer and after it travelled some distance faded into nothing.  I saw this twice in two days!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the second one for a block or so on foot just watching before it finally blinked out.  I highly doubt it was &#34;Chinese lanterns&#34; as some might say.  These were not flickering, and they were Venus bright at times and silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

He took off his headset, stopped playing the game and went outside to see what he thought might be a military helicopter. (we do see military helicopters fly over our home ). He told me he saw a large dark colored triangular shaped craft that had a sphere shaped lighted thing underneath.  He also stated he could see &#34;windows&#39; on both sides of the craft, but that they were gray &#34;tinted&#34; looking.  The sphere had a yellow-whitish light that pulsated.  The craft hoovered over the back field directly in our back yard.  Then the craft shot off very fast into the clouds and disappeared.  I asked him if he was afraid while he stood outside and looked.  He told me that he didnt believe in UFO&#39;s, but while he was looking at it he did become confused and somewhat afraid.<n>

Sky completely clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location: LAT 36.87, LONG. -120.78  I was driving northbound on Interstate 5 in central California.  I noticed two bright white disk-shaped objects, very close together, very distinctive as opaque objects, with a thin dark grey edge, meandering through the sky, sort of slowly circling each other but together moving swiftly southward down the valley.  They seemed about 2 miles up. No trails or glow, just two waferlike disc objects, not natural, not spherical.  These were definitely manufactured objects. They were not birds or balloons that is for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The edges of the two disks were crisp and defined, and there was no reflection, like it had a white matte finish.  No markings that I could see.  When I first looked I thought it could be two aircraft. But then I focused and realized these were round and the way they behaved together, sort of a figure 8 motion to each other as they moved collectively and rapidly through the air heading down the valley, I have never seen that before with aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What were they?<n>

As I neared the object it appeared to be a very large white blimp-like craft, moving quite slowly over the countryside just east of North Mountain.  It was in vision for several minutes until I lost sight due to the terrain.  Inquiries to the Augusta County Sheriff’s Office, the local airport, and at a nearby store were of no help in either corroborating the sighting or revealing the craft’s origin.<n>

I noticed the neighbors house directly in front of ours was lit up also, the rest of the neighborhood was pitch dark as it should have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the center of the circumfrence of green light there was a dimmer transparent ball.  The ball never changed its color it stayed the same, while the outer part dimmed, went bright then dimmed, then bright, then just seemed to collapse into the ball.  It then just dissapated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A strange electrical sound like nothing I ever heard came 2 seconds after the light was gone and lasted only 1-2 sec.  The light was like looking through a view finder with a green slide.  I&#39;m 100% sure the light came from the sky above our house.<n>

Diablo was a small circular craft with the bottom illuminated with rotating colors of red and blue, at first I thought it may be a small plane and was going to fly over top of the mountain, but to my surprise it dropped slowly in front of the mountain, still rotating colors, slowly descending close to the bottom, and when it was near the tree tops it seemed to hover for a few seconds and I saw more of the red lights, and then it dissappeared.<n>

The car got stuck in some mud on a dirt road we went down. After trying to put sticks under the tire to get leverage to drive out we gave up and decided to walk to the main road we drove on and to stay on that road until we could find a house to call for help..(We were in the middle of nowhere.) We walked I would guess 3 miles then us 4 including myself saw two &#34;balls of fire&#34; in the air about 30 yards off the road we were walking on. They did not appear to be large, maybe the size of a basketball. They moved quickly in all kinds of directions. Not sure how to explain it. We got scared and started running down the road, until we were a good distance away from the &#34;fire balls&#34;. We stopped and watched and the 2 fire balls continued to move quickly in many directions but never really leaving the same area. We were still scared so decided to run again. W! e ran until the fireballs were out of sight. (Ran for about 5 minutes streight). This has caused me psycologic issues, I am now on several medications including sleeping pills due to the fact that I can&#39;t sleep at night because it still freightens me. I&#39;m only 21 years old, and I was not drunk or on any drug at the time this happened. My brother and his roommate and my friend all saw it. My friends roommmate died a week ago in the same area due to losing control of his car. (Its unknown why he was out in the middle of nowhere,and still unknown how he lost control of his car,possibly a deer ran out in front of him.) I don&#39;t believe in &#34;aliens&#34;, but somthing is going on I swear to god and I&#39;m christian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fire balls were a dark red on the inside and a lighter red/pink on the outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved very quickly in a &#34;z&#34; like way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about the size of a basketball I would guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a joke. This has caused me neurology issues, and now have to take medications to keep me sane pretty much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for listening.<n>

7/27/10 23:00|Orem|UT|Changing|5 minutes|We saw a group of about 12 dim lights moving together in the night sky in a graceful fluid pattern.|7/28/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76825.html|64|ndxe201007| We saw a group of about 12 dim lights moving together in the night sky in a graceful fluid pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (boy) It was around 10:45 p.m., when myself and my girlfriend were taking a late night walk around the outside of the college campus.  After walking for awhile we decide to lay down and relax for a bit in a nice grassy area.  It was a nice spot with many small trees well spaced apart.  Me and her were relaxing just talking looking up into the sky when I first spotted a group of lights.  I then pointed and said to her &#34;what&#39;s that?&#34; &#34;right there...that group of lights&#34; then I jokingly told her &#34;right there it&#39;s a UFO.&#34;  Of course she didn&#39;t believe and said something a long of the lines of &#34;no it&#39;s not!,&#34; but then 30 seconds later she spotted it as well.  So then for a good five minutes we watch the group of lights trying to talk out what it might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (boy) The pattern of the lights is best described in my opinion is that of a school of fish swimming together. It was about 10 to 12 very dim lights in the very far distance (past the cloud line) moving around together in a very fluid motion.  The overall movement was not in a straight line, but as I said like a school of fish moving in a large circle.  Very fluid, very pretty, and very graceful movements.  The lights were very hard to keep track of, and we both had to strain our eyes to see it, but what we both saw is very consistent and unmistakable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (boy) Neither of us can say that we believe that is was aliens or anything to that effect, but what we did see doesn&#39;t a line with anything we&#39;ve seen before.  It could not have been a plane, helicopter, or satellite.  It was very foreign to us, and I thought it would be best to report while the event was still fresh in our minds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Girl)  I don&#39;t exactly know how to describe what i saw because i have never seen anything that nearly resembles it.  To me it looked as if an invisible bubble that was nearly the size of the moon was containing a small group of 12 or so fire flies.  The light didn&#39;t move like fire flies, the movement of the light was so fluid and graceful. It was so hard to see the lights at times but once you had your eye on the lights it was unmistakable what you saw.  The lights almost looked red to me but I&#39;m not sure, just like dim stars look red sometimes.  The lights moved together in random patterns, but as they moved in their sphere they as a group moved in a circular movement.  The lights didn&#39;t flash at all they were completely solid unlike a plane light or like a twinkling star.  We watched it together and discussed what we saw for about three minutes until a cloud moved in front of the lights and then it was completely out of sight.  There was no sign of the lights through the ! clouds.  We sat for about a minute and were a little confused at what we saw and decided to get up and go home and tell my boyfriends family what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Girl) While we had been watching the lights I had mentioned that we should call someone so that they could come outside and see what we had seen but then I realized that no one would be able to see it unless they knew where to look and also the light pollution is bad and we had been lucky enough to have stopped in a slightly dense area of trees.  It was barely dark enough for the two of us to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

They didn&#39;t flash or anything- they stayed red for about the first 15 seconds then switched to white for about 2 seconds, then back to red and it was gone from my view with the airplane still trying to keep up.  This is the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my entire life.  I wish I&#39;d had someone to see it with me for verification purposes, but I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

My son who is 9 years old pointed the sky and told me to look at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then he asked :Mom, look, what is that?  First I thought it is a hot air  balloon, later I saw a fire inside of it.  It was red and orange color and it was circling around.  After 3 min it disappeared among the trees.  I took a picture of it but it is not very clear.<n>

Disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 27, 2010 at approximately 19:30 my roommates and I were sitting on our front porch.  My mother’s boyfriend, noticed something gliding through the sky.  The object was noticed in the eastern sky flying in a SSW direction.  We had visual observation of the craft for about 5 minutes before it faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was a silver cigar shape with a dark band in the middle.  I could not make out any wings or a tail.  It was completely silent, and there was no contrail.  I live in the hills.  Most planes go out of sight over a hill, but unlike most airplanes I see, this did not go over the horizon out of sight.  Rather, the object seemed to get smaller and smaller, until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a sense of confusion upon realizing all the strange attributes of this craft.  I managed to remember to grab my camera and I was able to capture several photos on a Nikon D-3000 DSLR camera.<n>
7/27/10 15:00|Las Vegas|NV|Disk|2-3 minutes|Large, white, dome shaped object spotted near a  "Janet" plane in Las Vegas|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76874.html|68|ndxe201007| Large, white, dome shaped object spotted near a  &#34;Janet&#34; plane in Las Vegas<n> <n><n> <n><n> I smoke cigarettes from my second floor balcony many times throughout the day.  My balcony faces Northeast towards Nellis Airforce Base in Las Vegas, NV, and has a clear view of the northeastern section of sky.  As I smoke, I frequently watch planes landing or taking off from Mcarren Airport, or I watch aircraft fly to and from Nellis.  On August 27th around 3 p.m. I was on my balcony, and I noticed right away that a plane was approaching Las Vegas from the North. Whats interesting about that is Ive learned through months of everyday observing that planes do not fly in from the North, so I picked up my binoculars (used for watching the planes and helicopters fly from Nellis) and saw that it was one of those &#34;Janet&#34; planes that transport employees to and from Area 51 (Classic red stripe passenger plane with no identifiable markings). As I followed the plane with my binoculars, I then noticed something appear in my field of vision that was further away beyond the! Janet plane. I stopped and adjusted my binocs to get a clearer image of what this object was, and once I did I could see a white, solid, dome shaped object hovering in place far off in the distance. I know distances can be deceiving, so I dont want to say how far away i think it was exactly, but I can say it was miles, beyond Sunrise mountain and perhaps even Lake Mead. I stood and watched it for 2-3 minutes until I noticed another Janet plan coming into approach at McCarran. I took my eyes off the craft for only a second and when I scanned the area it had been, it was gone! I searched the entire sky for about 20 minutes and never saw it again. It was dome shaped, white and never moved from the spot I first saw it. I assume that it was far away, and if it was then I would say the craft was huge. Being stationary, I was able to study it for 2-3 minutes through my binoculars and though it was too far to make out any details, I can say it was big enough to clearly make out it! s shape. I am absolutely certain that it was not a plane, heli! copter, weather balloon, or any other craft Ive ever seen in my life. It was a clear, hot summer day with no clouds in sight. I hope you find this information useful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  PD))<n>

To the naked eye, it was about the size and brightness of Jupiter, slightly less.  My attention had been kept because this star had a pulsating twinkle to it, where it would twinkle white, red and green colors while keeping a white color to it.  The twinkling was rather fast, not a slow changing in colors, but pulsating.  The object was always stationary and did not move.  The first 10 minutes I looked at it with my naked eye.  I then went in the house and looked at it again for 10 more minutes with 8 X 21 binoculars, no change in size but still had the same pulsation to it.  I then went inside and spent 10 minutes looking at online star maps and satellite tracking maps on Nasa.gov, went back outside and it was gone.  I never saw how it disappeared.

It was like a triangle in the center surrounded by a flaming orange with almost a tail of the same flaming orange. I stared at it for 2 minutes expecting it to eventually make sense.  But it didn’t. It didn’t move much really.  Never any noise.  I was expecting and listening for an engine noise that never came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it started to fade. I thought it was turning away, but then it faded, still visible but smaller.  Then it totally disappeared.  I thought maybe it went behind a cloud.

I got a pair of small pair of binoculars out of my car and to try to get a better view of whatever I was seeing, when I went inside to get a larger pair of binoculars with a little better range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not make out any discernible shape but it looked as if the blue or green light was on the right bottom and the red flashing light was on the left edge of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that if it was an airliner or something it should have moved much quicker and not look to me sitting almost motionless.<n>

I looked, and at first thought it was a star, but it was orange.  Another one blinked into focus, and the two got brighter and moved toward eachother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked and discussed if they were moving, what color they were and mentioned that we had not seen anything like that before.  Then another orange glowing ball was seen below the tree line and rose up to join the other two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three orange spheres made a triangle with the two points on top and the third on bottom.  The top left point started fading away and was gone in a matter of a few seconds as the third light was getting brighter.

7/26/10 23:00|Sault Ste. Marie (Canada)|ON|Light|2 Nights|Multiple white lights and a Whitel light with Red shining through|7/28/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76805.html|78|ndxe201007| Multiple white lights and a Whitel light with Red shining through<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night a friend and myself were out on my balcony and we noticed something moving in the sky.  It appeared to be a star, but as we watched it for awhile, we noticed that we could both see something like spurts coming out of it and it would move.  My first impression was something was shooting out of it like a projectile.  It was far enough away to appear as a star but close enough to see almost tracers off of it when it moved.  As we were watching this light move around, another star looking light came floating across the sky towards the one that we were watching and continued past it without stopping or slowing.  There was no erratic movement with the one going across the sky, but it did manage to cross the entire skyline and out of our sight within 2 minutes or less. I don&#39;t know how fast that would be.  Now as of July 27th, 2010 there are still lights in the sky and I have noticed up to 6 or more. I have an apartment that has windows facing the other side of my building and I could see more of these moving objects in the sky on that side as well.  It almost appears as if they are making a circle around a large part of my city, but very high up.  I do live in a border town, which borders Sault Ste Marie, Michigan. I noticed one light that stood out more than the rest and it seemed to have a red that I could notice through the white. When I first noticed this light from my balcony, it seemed closer than the others and it was more centered over the international bridge on the USA side. I recently went back out to look and this red and white light seems to have now moved more to the Canadian side and more over Essar Steel which is what I believe to be the 3rd largest steel comapany in the the World. I don&#39;t know if anyone else has seen anything like this on either side of the border, but I encourage anyone in the area to take a look and see if you can notice these same lights. This is not my first time seeing the white light with r! ed shining through. I did submit a report back in September of! 2009 wh en I was about 4 to 5 hours out of town and I witnessed a sighting at a closer range that appeared to be the same type of light. My friend that witnessed this recent sighting has also witnessed another sighting about a month ago from his back yard and was lucky enough to get footage of a white star looking light flying at a constant rate across the sky. I have heard of people referring to the movements as almost seeming like the operator is drunk, but being an outdoors man, the best way I could describe the movement is, the way a water spider moves around on the water. I have tried to research satellite flight patterns, but they seem to be moving to fast to be satellites.

They emitted red and orange light over their entire surface, almost as if the light was being reflected from their surface.  The orange and red light was hazy but it spread in every direction; similar to the same effect that takes place when one squints while looking a street light at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon was entirely full and these objects were easily detectable.  They moved very fluidly as they flew to the northeast.  They made no sound and they flew as if they were all separate entities; flying closer and farther apart.  It seemed as if they were gliding because they were almost dipping in the sky, but they also rose.  They flew very smoothly, but it seemed as if they were suspended at times and even slightly moved backward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled to both my girlfriend and her friend to look into the sky and they were immediately taken aback by the occurrence as well.  My girlfriend took a picture on her Iphone and the figures’ arrowhead formation is unmistakeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew out of view to the northeast and another object of the same description emerged from the southwest.  This object, too, flowed very smoothly but seemed to have slowed down more than the other three and stay suspended for a longer period of time; about two seconds.  It was difficult to see how large the objects were because they were so far away but they were about the size of a penny on its side at arm’s length.  After the fourth object hesitated, it followed the other three objects out of sight to the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other two witnesses and I are typically very skeptical of UFO’s, however, there is no denying that we witnessed something incredibly bizarre. We are at the top of our classes in the colleges we attend; the University of Maine and the University of North Carolina and were sober at the time of the sighting. I understand that the Southern Delta Aquarids Meteor Shower takes place at this time, but meteors typically flash quickly, fly at the same pace in one direction and disappear.  That was not the case, here.<n>

They stayed in the sky and 2 lights extended long tentacle lights.  At one point an additional 6 or seven blue lights appeared.  One light landed to the ground and at that point looked like an oval saucer glowing light.  My son and I continued to drive towards Needles, CA  where the flying lights appeared and disappeared behind hills.  At one point there was a red sphere, yellow sphere and white sphere traveling along the ground.  Many trucks were stopped by the side of the road witnessing this spectacle.  Hundreds of people had to have seen this last Monday night.<n>

I noticed an orange light in front, but above me.  As I stared at it, I realized that it seemed to be falling toward me.  Directly toward me.  It was round, but it looked like it had a web of lights on top of it, making it look almost teardrop shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I considered it was flames.  I thought it might be a comet falling from the sky, so I turned onto 13 Mile road and pulled into the parking lot of the apartments that were west of Grove.  It had gotten higher in the sky at this point and looked like an orange dot.  It started moving north. I took a picture of it and watched it for a few minutes.  It seemed to just be standing in the sky at this point. So I continued heading west on 13 Mile Road to Schoenherr.  In the parking lot of the Kmart at 13 Mile and Schoenherr, the orange light was still visible and heading west, toward me.  As it was getting closer, close enough to notice the round shape again, I pulled around a building, and when I looked back, it was gone.<n>

It flew over us without a trace of noise, and sped off zig zaging and stopping very abruptly.  When you freeze the dvd shot it looks like a disc, but eye sight it looke like a fireball, but moved so fast it was remarkable to see in person.  It actually looked like the back end of a fire ring, hugh fireball shaped, silent and repeated a circlular track for about 20 mins.

I found it odd my dog didnt make a sound as the dog always always alerts to anything outside. I got up after it was gone and looked around outside at which the dog came running up to me but there was no evidence of anything outside I know im not insane I was afraid to tell anyone at work I know what i heard I know it was not any type of plane or copter I grew up on base next to the runway and been air force all my life. This was definatley not normal and I do not watch sci Fi movies as my coworkers suggested and i was not dreaming I was petrified listening. NEXT time I will get up and take a picture for sure.

It was while he was doing this that he happened to glance up into the sky and off towards the south-southeast and saw what seemed to be two distinct and very brilliant orange colored lights in the sky at probably not more than one-quarter mile from his observation point. According to the observer, the lights were flying vertically across the sky, with one trailing the other at a distance, estimated by the witness to be between six hundred and one thousand yards, and at an angle of approximately fifty degrees above the horizon.  Suddenly, the leading light source terminated its forward motion and made a sheer vertical acceleration, vanishing into the sky.  The trailing object continued on course, and in a matter of a few seconds was lost behind two story buildings, terminating his observation.<n>

I saw something streak north in the sky; I thought I was seeing a shooting star (I have only seen about 4-5 in my lifetime), but then it went behind clouds, and I could see it partially obscured by the clouds, and continue in a straight, maybe barely arcing path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no accompanying roar as if it was a plane or jet, and it was not as fast as a shooting star, but faster than any plane I have seen.  My roommate was in the car (passenger seat), but he did not see anything, and I kept asking him if he saw it, and he said no.  It was only one object I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up around the space center in Clear Lake, Texas, and have seen shuttle launches in Florida when I was a kid, and my best description is if a shooting star had a bit of a trail that disappeared as soon as it was made.  It was traveling South to North, and was too bright and constant to be a star, along with being too big.  It flew just behind some clouds, continued on and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what to make of this, but this is not the first time I have seen something weird in the sky here in Montana.  I Arrived in Bozeman December 23rd, 2009, and last Friday (July 16th) I saw a very strange object in the sky that I mistook for a star, until it moved, leading me to believe it was a plane, but then it moved in very tight curves and zig-zagged.  After about 1 minute it disappeared, but then I could only see it with peripheral vision, and could not observe it if I looked directly at it.  My roommate was outside with me as well, and witnessed and confirmed the object, it&#39;s movement, and then it only being observable with peripheral vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After tonight&#39;s incident, I checked online for other stuff like that, and came across your website.  I do not like UFO phenomenon, and honestly I am a bit shaken by these two incidents.  I have never witnessed anything like it, with excetion to shooting stars, that DO NOT look like what I saw.<n>

They occur nightly without fail. All photo captures are from the front yard of my home. I have over 5000 still pics of these objects. I have compiles them into a few video compilations and I have posted them on you tube. I AM A 48 YEAR OLD MALE. I do not prank and I take what I am getting pictures of very seriously. My channel on &#34;you tube&#34; is called &#34;botifigus&#34; if you would rather not click on the links that i have provided.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIdHWdV3D2M<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUDIsVH2HJ4<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHzJKnNRkUo<n> <n><n> <n><n> there about 11 video compilations in all, these were all captured in the month of July, 2010.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were all captured at night. Upon hearing you on Coast to Coast last night.  it seems as though pranks are an issue and a pain in the neck for your organization. I would think that it would be. As you don&#39;t want to be pranked, I do not want my intellect insulted.  I filed a report with MUFON and must say I was embarrassed for that organization for its lack of integrity.  The investigator made contact with me via the phone having never even looked at the pictures that I submitted. If you initiate an investigation please at least view what I am offering before contacting me, or please do not contact me. I am also not inclined to listen to the &#34;satellite or other heavenly bodies meme&#34;.  Satellites and other heavenly bodies do not get within 2500 feet of one&#39;s home.  Lastly , if there is no interest in what I have photographed that is understandable.  Again there is much to more elaborate on these things and will should you be interested.<n>

The UFO came out of the sky directly below the rising moon to the south.  It flashed a very bright white light then dimmed as it shot across the sky.  It came from nowhere and made a horizontal line across the sky in one second then stopped for five seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During that five second moment it flashed two very bright white lights, then took off directly up towards space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited outside for the next ten minutes and saw nothing more.  The speed it was moving at was amazingly fast, with no sound ever and was oval in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we saw the UFO, we thought it might be another meteor at first, but it didn&#39;t descend down to earth.  We were both already looking in the direction from which it appeared at, because we were gazing at the full moon.  The UFO just appeared from nowhere, like it came from another universe or dimension into ours when it flashed the light, then took off.<n>

The night sky was clear, other than the clouds in the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is difficult to judge the airplane&#39;s altitude, though I could see its underside in detail.  As the plane flew directly above my apartment complex, I noticed a yellow ball of light dart into a position behind the plane&#39;s tail where it began to follow the plane for about 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball of light was about the size of the airplane&#39;s tail section.  The light did not seem to produce a noise, though it was difficult to know since I could only hear the sound of the plane&#39;s engines.  After it trailed the plane for a short time, the ball of light veered off in a northerly direction, and at times flew erraticly (suddenly slowing down, then speeding up). I estimate the light was traveling at least twice as fast as the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to track the ball of light until it faded into the clouds in the north.  It was obvious to me that this ball of light was not another airplane, considering it was not displaying blinking lights, nor was it at a safe distance between the plane I was observing. This incident has great significance to me, especially having read about the increase in &#34;fireball&#34; reports recently.<n>

If we slowed down so would it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If we sped up it would catch up with us and be right by us once again, it was So very fast!! A few times along the way we could see the light from a differant angle and see it coming directly at us then when finally catching up to us it would turn back straight and go right along with us. There were no flashing lights, just a white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point i looked to see it behind us and we sped up trying to lose it, not even 5 sec later seeing it had already made it in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it would back off the more we stared at it, only to come right back and follow us again.  At one point we had slowed down and in amazement of what this could be we were just really trying to figure it out and all of a sudden the light just slowly dimmed to nothing.  In shock we quickly pulled over and couldnt believe it had just vanished.  Not even 5sec later it slowly reappeared.  No clouds in that area at time.  We found a gas station and stood outside staring at it for probably a good 10 min.  It just stayed in place.  But when we pulled out, it Sped up REALLY fast to catch up with us!  Trying once again to lose it,  We made a right on 85..seeing it behind us slowly backing off....ive never seen anything like it....Its just amazing that it even waited on us numerous times.  I wish i had some answers<n>

All this was in the inverted position like it wanted to land some where.  I call for my son to view this and he also wittiness this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this for 10 to 15 minutes, then craft went up at least 2000ft and then started moving to the north west as it picked up speed.  The craft seem to be in the 40 to 50 ft range; tall. I could tell because it was fairly close to the TV towers, each painted section is 100 ft so I could gauge this a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this was over I&#39;m sure others saw this since we live in North Oklahoma City.  Also there was no enging noise, the craft was a matt black as best i could tell.  My wife was scared and my son was a little shaken over the event.<n>

My|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78389.html|97|ndxe201007| The sighting happened towards the latter part of July 2010.  While watching my son play I noticed  a large object in the distance.  My first thought was a hot air balloon since we have many in the area during the summer months.  It only took a second to realize that it was no hot air balloon.  Having worked in the aerospace field in the past I am a pretty good judge of flight characteristics of all aircraft both military and civilian.  The trees in the photograph though they look close are approximately 300 yards from the children in the foreground.  I am approximately 10 yards from the children.  The object is behind the group of trees.  The photo was taken with a Blackberry curve cell phone.  The direction is due east looking at the foothills of the Blue Mountains, Walla Walla Washington.  The time was approximately 6:15 pm.  The Sun is at my back.  This object had structure.  The color was dark with different shades of gray.  It seemed to be of a metallic! type substance but did not shine in the sunlight.  It had no visible lights.  After taking the first picture the object slowly rotated to a profile that measured approximately 20% of its circumference.  At this point the object either moved directly away from my line of sight or imploded out of sight, either way it happened faster than the blink of an eye.  I did not have enough time to take any more pictures or a video of the object.  The entire incident took approximately 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

7/25/10 10:00|Washington, D.C.|DC||30 seconds|I saw a silver metallic ball fly over my house in Wash., D.C. in broad daylight!|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76934.html|100|ndxe201007| I saw a silver metallic ball fly over my house in Wash., D.C. in broad daylight!<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of July 28, 2010 at 10:00am I was sitting in my back yard contemplating a conversation my son and I had then night before. It was a crystal clear, beautiful morning with very few clouds.  I looked up and saw approaching from the west in an easterly direction, a silver metallic ball slowly approaching.  It was as low in the sky as any commercial airplane is allowed in and over Washington D.C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amazed, my first thought was to call my family, however, they were still asleep and I feared it would be gone by the time I got back.  I considered grabbing my camera but decided against it for the same reason.  As I sat gazing at this clearly visible metallic ball, I realized I had my cell phone on me. Unfortunately, my cell phone camera only works when I don’t want it to and as I attempted to photograph the object,  I couldn’t get it to work, to my frustration. It was probably due to nervousness.  The object was visible for at least 30 seconds and then when it was directly above my head,  it disappeared.  It didn’t zoom off or fly away, it disappeared!  The only reason I know it was 10:00 exactly is because after it disappeared my phone clock said 10:01am.  This is real!  It was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, perfectly round, reflecting the sun on the side that was nearest the sunlight.  I know what I saw. It was real.  If I’m lying I pray my children drop dead now.  Something is going on in the nation’s capitol!<n>

However , I must admit that I felt slightly ridiculed as someone had written his own evaluation of what I saw on that report by  adding the following lie to it &#34; possibly Jupiter in the southern sky&#34; .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trees where the UfO was silently floating are  30 ft away from my house!  One cannot put a planet in those trees!  The ufo was directly behind the trees, moving and changing its appearance. I saw the perfectly bright lights in detail and its pulsating lights.  Planets do not move, display lights and change appearance.  This was a moving object not  Jupiter.  I feel slightly insulted by this odd addition to my Report. It should not be there.     Best,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness may be correct, but we believe it is the rare UFO that hangs around for an hour and a half.  PD))<n>

Circular pattern was irregular, not a perfect circle. About 3 different circular patterns taking approx.  6 and 8 seconds respectively.  Light was only seen within the clouds, when the light entered an area outside of a cloud formation it was not seen.   As the cloud formations began to change or dissipate, the light pattern altered.  Finally after witnessing this for about 25 minutes it reduced from 3 separate circular light patterns to only one. T he pattern of the counter clock wise movement changed as well. Finally, it faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened about 1 ½ to 2 hours after scattered thunder showers.  At the time of the witnessed light movements, the sky was clearing away.  There was no storm activity; not lightning or rain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound.  No flashing or colored lights.  Only a round white light moving counter-clockwise within the clouds in an asymmetrical round pattern.

I saw 3 whitish lights moving towards me ( to the east ) at what I thought was about 500 to 1000 feet in the air. As it drew closer I was able to make out the crafts shape as triangular in fashion. It drifted slowly over head and away to the northeast and seemed to speed up the further it got from me until it was gone. There was no sound that I could hear and my dog did not react to it at all. I would like to know what this may have been, but, due to my being a doctor I request to be kept anonymous in the public eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Contact info withheld by request of the witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initial findings:  I met with the witness on 7/28/2010 in the park and asked him a barrage of the usual questions and from first impressions I found him to be a stable intelligent man without an agenda or any obvious deceptive statements.  He seemed truly perplexed and concerned about the sighting and was not making any rash statements about it being an alien craft or a craft of known origins. He seemed fairly savvy on the local ( usual ) air traffic in his neighborhood too.  He did repeat several times that “ It was like nothing I have every seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The OUFOR2 will be conducting further checks with the FAA at the PDX tower and also by contacting the Oregon Air National Guard at PDX as well. OUFOR2 has already checked the weather conditions for the sighting date and has confirmed that the witnesses statement and the official weather conditions match.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shown below are views of the location via map and also forensic models built to illustrate the witnesses sighting.  The witness has viewed the forensic reconstruction models and has agreed that they closely represent what he viewed that night.

These models are NOT 100% accurate as to what may have been witnessed since there was only one witness and no photographs or videos taken.<n>

I have never seen anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know if the blue orb was there to take our attention off the black blotch or not but when I looked back to the East the Black blotch was gone.<n>

Our deck overlooks snohomish river and the olympic mountains. it was already dark and we seen flashing lights, but couldnt tell what shape it was because it was too dark. By the way the lights were blinking you could tell it was oval shaped.  The craft was extremely low and made no sound. It seemed like it was flying very close above the snohomish river. the blinking lights would stop and the craft would be in a different spot, this pattern was continued. I dont know of anything that could travel that fast. within a minute it was over the olympic mountains. you could tell by the way the lights were munuevering that the craft was spinning. and the route it was going was not like a airplane, because it would go in different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the sighting occurred on July 24th, and we have amended the date indicated above, submitted by the witness, to reflect that fact.

I would be surprised if no one else saw it because there were 300,000 people on the beach last night (July 24, 2010) for the fireworks but around 9:00 PM while sitting at Kits beach we saw two lights (almost like slivers) in the Northern sky.  One faded out and came in at a different location, while the one sat there for sometime before moving to our right and disappearing behind the mountains.  The one was visible for at least 10 minutes.  We asked the people next to us to check it out and we all scratched our heads as to what could sit there above the mountains and then move so gradually out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure if you have heard anything else on this siting, the fact it was still light out may have prevented it from being seen by most people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brent<n>

Must be MacArther Airport out there.  Looked up once and noticed three far up and tiny silver balls hanging in a row. Looked away and back.  They were then hanging from top left to bottom right.  Got the camera and located them in view finder.  They were no longer in a formation and only one is shining in the sun but the other two are there.  I thought later that they could be those silver balloons but in a formation? I didn&#39;t even stay focused on them because what I was seeing didn&#39;t make sense and I was trying to think up a logical explanation.  They then faded. Could&#39;ve been something floating like balloons on a 105 degree day.  Hmm.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry, I don&#39;t have any work right now so I can&#39;t accept a collect call.

The object was bright and was flashing red and green lights along with an almost L.E.D. white light. These lights were clearly visible to all three of us using just our eyes and later confirmed with binoculars and telescope. The object almost appeared to be rotating at high speeds which could explain to alternation of lights which had no apparent pattern. This object was relatively fixed in the same portion of the night sky compared to other celestial objects. The object would move in irrative movements, suddenly going to the left and right really fast and then in circular movements. Then, it stopped moving and the green and red lights settled down. I flashed a bright HID light at it in sequences of 3. It was like the object was reacting to my flashes by beginning to move again and flashing back once again. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was! seeing and neither could my astronomy buddies, we were all stunned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As it got closer and flew near over where i was atanding i realized that one light was really two lights just one behind the other and the object was black as night. It had a very low humming noise to it.  Not like the plane that i had saw go by not but a minute or so before it which was higher in the sky and made a noise that we all hear when planes fly, over the sound of the engine.  The object continued out of my sigh! t,obstructed by trees heading in an east/ southeast direction.<n>

I am a very good observer.  My mind isn&#39;t easily fooled.   Me and my equally conscious buddy saw an aerial phenom at about 0600 UT to 0700UT July 23 or 24 that was not easily explainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are in western canada on MT. So it was about 11 pm or 12 midnight local.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My buddy alerted me to this and this what we saw.... 2 apparently stationary lights, one about 1.5 or 2 magnitudes brighter than the other that was &#34;in front&#34; of the less bright one and separated by maybe 1- 2 degrees.  I realized right away they weren&#39;t stars because the position near Lyra almost overhead, wasn&#39;t  correct. ..anyway, these apparently stationary two lights &#34;began&#34; to move together in formation...one trailing the other SW to NE and certainly too  slow to be satellites because a real N-S polar satellite passed by...SO the crazy thing is the brighter light in front of the trailing one faded to the same brightness as the other..then they both just faded away. I estimate we saw this for a good minute..maybe 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t an Irridium Sat because they are in polar orbits only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the ISS sightings for this area too and there weren&#39;t any scheduled for Friday or Saturday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I like to think we saw a real UFO ..or rather 2 !<n>

It has a nice open space where the stars are visible with a picnic area that you can sit at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went out wanting to enjoy the nice weather and have a romantic ending to our night.  It was around midnight when we went, walked to the back of the pond and sat down.  We where there for aproximately 10 minutes when I looked up saw something circular blinking in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was towards the south of us flying lower than an airplane would, and it was blinking red, green, orange, blue and yellow, something an airplane would not do.  I urged my husband to look at it, and he agreed that it was not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not moving at all, as if it where hovering.  We both at the time just kind of blew it off a bit,joked about it being a UFO we lit a cigarette, and looked up and it was gone.  This is when we began to freak out and get real serious about it, realizing that we where talking about it and observing it for at least 10 minutes without it moving, and then it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to scan the sky when I noticed the same looking object to the west of us.  Appearing about 5 minutes after the other one dissapeared.  It had the same blinking colors, only the distance seemed closer, and lower than before.  We kept watching it hover in place, shift to the left and right real fast, and then at moments it would stop flashing colors and turn a yellow-orange color.  It also would get distant and then come closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband then noticed to the north another one, by this time I am really freaking out, and almost in tears because I cant believe my eyes.  My husband on the other hand excited about what he is seeing.  My husband watched the one towards the north as I watched the one to the west.  We would report back and forth to eachother what they where doing as we watched.  My UFO then shifts right then zooms left leaving a trail of light behind it then dissapears in a split second.  If i would have blinked I would have missed it! Im still not sure where it d! issapeared to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the UFO I was staring at had disappeared we both continued to watch my husbands, which was not moving at all.  It was just flashing red, orange, green, blue, and yellow.  I looked over in the direction where the one I was observing disappeared, and it reappeared!  They where both there in the sky again, one to the north, and one to the west.  The one that I was watching seemed as if it would get distant, and then come closer, contunuing to shift right to left and up to down.  My husbands seemed to stay in the same spot not getting closer or farther.  As we observed them seperately we would continue to report back and forth to eachother what they where doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all came to an end at about 2:40 p.m. when all the sudden mine turned yellow-orange, then his did too.  Then mine started blinking colors, then his did too.  Then all the sudden both of them began to get distant and higher extremely fast together(still in their seperate directions of west and north), then they both just disappeared.   We stayed until 3:00 to see if they would come back, but they didnt, so we walked to our apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what we collected and witnessed, it seemed as if the two crafts where comunicating back and forth with their lights because one would blink lots of colors then turn to a yellow-orange color, then the other would do the same.   And it also seemed as if the one I was watching was on a mission, as the other one was on the lookout.   We collected this because mine was doing all the moving and his was just still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a very hard time getting to sleep after having experienced this.  My husband was very excited about our experience, and was releived that he now knows life on other planets exist.  He seemed pretty calm about it, but still said that he was a little freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never been a believer in aliens and UFOs, but I now honestly have to say, that after experiencing this, I am a believer.  Nothing could explain or justify what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star, or celestial body, perhaps?  PD))<n>

I swear to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the past year I&#39;ve seen odd things in a certain area in Louisville. It is craft that are mimicing normal aircraft, kinda.  It sort of looks like an airplane, but it&#39;s not.  I have lived near an airport for 16 years so I know aircraft! The lights are weird, and it makes no sound, and hovers, and goes fast real quick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have saw it 4 times in a year. I&#39;m going to tell you about the most important sighting. In July of 2010 at 11pm a friend and myself was driving on I-64 heading one into Louisville. Up on my left I noticed some bright lights, three or four whites &amp; one larger red at an unusually low altitude. At first, I thought maybe it was from a tower of some kind, but it was too big and was definitely some sort of craft. It looked like plane lights kinda, but it wasn&#39;t moving at all.  It hovered at about 700 to 1100 feet. I could not see the shape because of the brightness of the object.  Then it started moving and turning/rotating, and for a moment I saw it outlined against the sky. It was a black triangle probably about 30 to 40 feet long. It hovered/turned to where the wings were facing the ground as if turning a tight turn. Then it moved out of sight VERY quickly. Probably a mile in 15 to 30 seconds!   Then it came back just as fast!  Needless to say, we were shaken as we drove out of ! view. This was right off the freeway. I have seen these lights other times as well. Something is up with this certain location. Want to see what it looks like? Look up Oxicarian Ufo on youtube.com and you will see what I saw. To the Tee!!! I researched what we saw and me &amp; the other witness agree that that was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And yes, this is 100% the truth!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I looked over the horizon and noticed a light.  We always carry our binoculars with us every time we go to the beach on Friday nights.  I picked up mine to get a closer look, and lo and behold, there was a group of lights hovering over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was probably a cargo ship, but the lights were way too high for a ship.  There were a group of 5 lights; one red, three yellowish and one yellowish-white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden the lights began to change shape, from triangle to rectangle and then back to triangle again.  The yellowish-white light was below the others and moving back and forth over the water. None were blinking, just hovering and forming triangle and rectangle shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while it drifted north and the lights began to dim and it slowly disappeared.  It lasted for about 20 minutes.  My husband and I h! ave seen several UFOs last year at the same beach, but this was the first one we’ve witnessed this year.<n>

We noticed what we thought was a shooting star and watched as it darted across the epanse of the sky.  This point of light then began to zig zag ever so slightly from its parabolic path.  We also noticed a red blink, which led us to initially believe it might be a VERY high flying plane.  Again, the light zig zagged from its path, then fell back into line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time we began watching it from about the middle of the dome of the sky to our left horizon, the light took less than a minute to cross the sky (much, much more quickly than other planes in the sky at much lower altitudes.)  We placed our &#34;event time&#34; estimation on the time it might have taken for the light to begin at one end of the sky to the other, prior to us watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Despite the camera being secure, some of the imagery showed a blur…indicating that the object was moving; it wasn’t camera shake, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then ran over to the top of the Seattle Center parking garage for a better vantage point.  The garage rooftop has an elevation approx. the same as my own apt’s, but the object appeared to be lower in the horizon, still appearing to be over the Elliott Bay area, west downtown Seattle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took an additional 10 or so shots from this vantage point.  The object finally dipped below a tree-line, obscuring my viewpoint and was no longer observable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned home, downloaded the digital files for review.  Successive frames showed movement from the object, because of the blurring it induced.  Again, the camera was on a tripod with a timer being used; there wasn’t camera shake induced.  2-3 shots are relatively crisp…and show the pentagon-shaped body; in others it appears to be almost an “upside down hat“, with more mass below the “brim“.  The camera I was using, a Nikon Coolpix 8400 only has a limited zoom range, 24-85mm + tele-zoom, but I was still able to reveal a distinctive body shape.   Given the limited optics, and the relative crispness of a few of the images, I felt I could guesstimate the approximate area of it’s hover…which appeared to again, be over Elliott Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably not a UFO, we suspect.  The object may be a plastic bag, or some other object which may have been filled with helium.  PD))<n>

The semi-setting sun was at approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. This shot was taken straight overhead as I stood facing west.  Once I downloaded the digital photos, I discovered one showed an orb located in the upper left corner.  Unfortunately that area of the picture is blurry; however, the orb definitely shows the reflection of the neighboring clouds.  None of the other photos include an object.<n>

I was out watering the yard &amp; caught sight of movement in the sky. Very high, but not as high as the commercial airliners, was a craft moving very quick across the sky. At times it glinted in the sunlight...shining as if shiney silver, but too high to make out shape.  It had a tail coming out the center end (directly behind), white...but the tail dissipated (unlike the commercial jets that leave a white trail in the sky..that comes from both sides, behind the wings). The tail was about 7 times the length of the vehicle. I have seen satellites, the space station in orbit...this was not like anything I&#39;ve seen....easily visible.  It kept a straight path and steady speed...disappearing at the horizon. This was not an airplane..it had more of a rocket-like shape. There was NO sound at all...when it&#39;s quiet I can hear the commercial jets sometimes...&amp; I heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Both my daughters also saw it.  It was illuminated for about 5 seconds and then was gone and though a cloud obstructed it but it was a clear evening. The object appeared 3 more times over about a 20 minute period of time.  It didn&#39;t appear to move that I could tell and again there no stars visible at the time.

It is a fob within a fob. The afghan fob is the outer perimiter to our fob.  Since my return to Gamberi I walked the whole fob every day to check on the measurements.  Also check maps to check on the height of the mountains on which i saw it come from, the mountain is 1200 ft high and cloud level for that night was 3000 ft, which means that the V-shape object was at least a mile long or longer since its 3 corners stuck outside of the (ANA) Afghan National Armys fob.

It was a bright moon and some haze, but otherwise clear night.  At 10 pm they all said LOOK at the same time, Did you see that?  In the sky to the right of the moon was a triangular shaped object with lights.  Almost as soon as it appeared it &#39;shut off&#39;.  They all looked at each other and said &#39;what was that&#39;?  There were no helicopters, ships, planes in the area. No noise at all. They all studied the sky after wards and about five minutes later another &#39;object&#39; appeared to the left of the moon, closer to the horizon, this one was saucer shaped. It had a row of bright lights red gold and green. It was as if someone had turned on a light and then turned it off, and it was gone.  They all saw it again and shouted Look  There! at the same time.  Many others joined them on the porch afterwards but nothing else appeared in the sky that night.  We do not know what it was, did anyone else see this?<n>

Sometime between 9 pm and 10 pm, my sister and I were sitting side by side on the second floor porch of our beach house looking towards the ocean when we saw one small reddish, slightly orange light appear out of nowhere.  It reminded in the sky for a few seconds, then disappeared; poof it was gone.  Brief seconds later it reappeared in the same place then suddenly become two and moved apart slightly, then disappeared: poof gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brief seconds later the single light reappeared and then quickly blinked out.  There was no sound.  They seemed very far away  The lights were not the same red as lights on airplanes or helicopters.  My sister is in her mid- 40&#39;s, very intelligent, very down to earth.  I was surprised when she said, &#34; I saw them too.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  Later, after 10 pm, my two sons (14 and 17) and my brother (early 40&#39;s) were sitting on the same 2nd floor porch looking towards the ocean.  My son (17) saw a large, saucer-ish shaped object, about the size of the moon only not the moon, not round, not white, but red on the outside, fading into bright yellow on the inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared out of nowhere. It slowly (but still in brief seconds) moved to the left and remained there for 2 seconds.  It slowly (but still in brief seconds) separated in 5 objects, reddish orange in color, saucer-ish shape.  but smaller than the original mass.  It was as though the large saucer-ish shaped light was covering the 5 smaller masses and it disappeared to uncover the 5 smaller things.  Then they disappeared from the outside in: they went from 5 to 3 to 1 to none.  My son (14) had the impression of a red light that &#34; looked sort of like fire&#34; that &#34; looked like it sort of came in&#34; and then &#34; went out.&#34;   My brother was not looking in the same direction and missed all of this because happened so quickly.  My sons both have good heads on their shoulders as far as I know.  My brother is ultra logical.  I was down stairs.  My sons came and got me and I went back up to the porch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  Now my 2 sons and my brother and I are sitting on the 2nd floor porch (between 10:30pm and 11pm), raptly studying the sky over the ocean.  After about 30 min. suddenly a large (moon sized) saucer-ish object came out of absolutely nowhere.  It was the reddish, orange color. No sound. It seemed to have movement, as thought it was vibrating or something.  It was there for seconds and then POOF! it was gone.  We were all amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen 2 maybe 3 things in the sky that I cannot explain during my life.  I&#39;m 51.  I am open, but also try to be a critical thinker and question everything.  I would not mistake the moon or the planet Venus for an alien craft or a manmade craft!<n>

Almost full moon and clear night- little clouds in the sky.  Looked up with my daughter and asked her if she saw the lights and she agreed- we saw 3 red/amber lights in a row, no sound coming from them, maybe a flicker, but not blinking- then one by one they went out- in a row.  About 10 minutes later I  saw them in about the same position in the sky and they appeared to come on one by one and then go out one by one- a total of 3 lights.  Again, no sound, no continued blinking like a helicopter or a plane would make- silent.  I called my family outside- 4 more adults and 6 more kids.  In about 10 minutes we again saw the row of red/amber lights- 4 lights this time come on in silence and then go out- my dad said&#34; well that was a circular shape&#34;.  Everyone started screaming and was very excited.  10 minutes later we saw it for the final time a little bit further no! rth or to our left.  Caught it on  video film this time- same amber lights- no blinking, just on and then off, one at a time.  Everyone agreed it was not an aircraft, flare or fireworks- no smoke, no sound, no &#34;falling flames&#34;- just the lights in the sky.  Stayed outside for another 30 minutes and didn&#39;t see them any more.  Will have to submit video when we get home and I have time to download it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was firework ambers that were still in the sky, but they seemed more of a white bright light, with an orange tint to them with a halo glow around them.  The 3 circular lights moved around each other and changed positions a few times while I was watching.  I slowed the car down, the lights were much bigger than any other stars in the sky.  As I scrambled for my phone to video the objects, I looked back up and the lights were gone.<n>

This is what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling north to south, I look up and there is this object in the sky, I can not give you a shape, as I don&#39;t recall a shape, what I saw was almost like a craft to say the least.  There were three red lights in a line evenly spaced apart.  The object was about 300ft or so high up in the air, but it made not a single noise.  The object moved slow, I screamed for my wife to come out and check this out. My wife came outside and saw what I saw we stared for a couple seconds.  I told my wife to grab my truck keys, she ran in the house and we hoped out and started to follow the object.  As we drove down 71 following the object south, it suddenly sped up and shot east over the Atlantic Ocean.  We followed it to Manasquan Inlet and could not go any further, the object disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have many weird situations that happen and I think it has to do with camp Evans.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There was a plane in the sky, far away enough to just look like a white spot, but close enough to see it&#39;s lights, red and white I think.  And it was leaving a white trail behind it, like normal planes do. It looked like a typical commercial aircraft.  But below it, there was another object.  It looked like a white spot in the sky. It had no lights at all, and it wasn&#39;t leaving any kind of trail behind it, yet it was keeping up the same exact speed as the plane.  We watched it for awhile trying to decide what we were looking at, and eventually I decided to run inside and get my camera.  By the time I got back outside, the UFO was in front of the plane quite a bit, and too difficult to locate through the lens of my camera. We never got a good shot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This reminded me of another sighting I had witnessed a week or so before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in the same area of the sky, and also in broad daylight.  Again, I was on the porch smoking, and a small flash in the sky caught my eye.  When I looked up, there was nothing there. I watched for awhile to see what might have caused it, and a couple seconds later I saw it again, what it looked like to me was something (that I couldn&#39;t see) was reflecting the sun.  That&#39;s all it was, a bright white reflection that lasted a few seconds.  Disappeared, Re-appeared, and then was gone. I wasn&#39;t looking through a window, or anything, so I don&#39;t know what was reflecting the sunlight, but there was very obviously something up there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few nights after that incident, my husband and I heard a helicopter really loud outside our house, he went to see, but I stayed in front of the TV..  He explained he saw what looked like a military helicopter, because of it&#39;s green color, flying around the vicinity of our house.  The strange thing though, is that it had a search light on, and instead of searching the ground, it was searching the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of these things happened just within the past 2 weeks. I decided it was one two many incidents to not mention anything.<n>

On 7/22/10 i was standing on my back patio and  i could see a lot of low flying and transparent objects  flying over my apartments almost like a see through shadow with no lights like they didnt want to be seen. I was getting ready to go in the house so i wasnt looking in the sky i looked to my left to turn around and g inside my house and i couldnt believe my eyes i saw a glowing gold metal it was so bright  object that looked like something  out of a scifi movie i still cant believe what i saw  i keep thinking what it could have been almost like i dont want to to be real. It wasnt very big about the size of a family S.U.V. it was thin in the middle and the shape was kinda! like a  upside down v and was going so fast and then just slowed for a second as it was almost like it was coming in for a landing about 100yds from me i will never forget what i seen i have been out every night for the last month looking in the sky hoping to see some kind of moving light changing colors in the sky i never thought i would see what there ship looks like up close i am 39yrs old with a wife  and 1yr old daughter i am was so scared for my family i cant even explain whats going through my mind i am not sure if i even want to tell anyone about about last night i am so worried and scared  on whats to come.  I am %100 sure there was at least #20 flying very low over my apartments last night going past one by one and there ships were transparent like a shadow that was see through its hard to explain its like they were hiding from the planes that were that flying around with very bright flashing like lights. I have lived here all my life i have never heard of any ki! nd of sightins hear ever...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))   Lodi, Ca<n>

I noticed that at the top of a nearby tree there was a blinking light. As I studied it closer I saw red, blue, white, green, and orange lights flickering very quickly. It reminded me of a sign you would see in a store to grab peoples attention.  I showed my friends to confirm what I saw and they started finding more of these objects.  There was the main one (we called it the big one) above the tree, then, we started spotting one over lower trees to the right (we called it the right one). Then, one popped up in-between those two (we called it the middle one), and eventually one showed up underneath the big one. Now, my friends claimed to see very small ones surrounding them sometimes diving, flying around or “attacking” the main ones.  A few times we saw what looked like large bright shooting stars shoot down from them but it didn’t shoot acro! ss the sky, it quickly fell, seeming as if it may have fell to the ground.  We also saw beams of light across the sky often appearing to be blue. There was also this area that we called “the group” because it looked like a cluster of dim, glowing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure these could not have been planes because we watched for hours and the objects were still in the sky around 6 o’clock am.  Planes go over our area frequently and the lights and slow speed were just a few things to prove they weren’t. It was truly one of the most intriguing, weird, and exciting things I’ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I forgot to mention that the lights seemed to arrange in trianles at times<n>

The sky was perfectly crystal clear and their was a 3/4 moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object I saw was first thought to be a cloud.  But I thought it was very strange becaue it was so tiny compared to any other cloud I had seen.  The object was far in the distance.  I would estimate at roughly 5 or 6 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regardless of me thinking it was strange, I still just thought it was a cloud especially considering it was greyish in color.  It stood absolutely still in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the moon that was about a fist&#39;s length away as a good landmark for reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly went into my house for maybe 20 seconds to grab my binoculars which were right by the door.  I turn around and look out and the object is gone.  This is what made me decide it was not a cloud.  This fact combined with that it was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured a cloud doesnt just disappear in less than 20 seconds and it definitely wouldnt have moved out of sight in that time considering it didnt appear to be moving in the first place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a bit spooked at this sighting and still sort of am but I am excited nonetheless.<n>

I looked up and there was an object moving extremely fast. I live by Hill AFB and this object moved 5x faster than any F16 F18 F22 I have ever seen. This object wasn&#39;t very distinct. Once focused on the object I noticed it was slightly glowing but I only really saw it because the moon was so bright. It was traveling north to south and only through the moonlight did i notice it also had a tail. To be honest it moved just like a meteor but it was so close i could actually see the object. It was bulky in shape almost cubed and left a trail but not a light trail like a meteor it was almost like a smoke trail like a plane would leave but it disappeared very quickly. It looked more like it was just moving so fast it was displacing the atmosphere around it. I would have said it was a meteor but I saw that low flying meteor that passed through the atmosphere back in late &#39;09 and it lit up the entire! sky so I don&#39;t believe that this was the same case. This was a big chunk of something that darted across the sky almost invisible. I don&#39;t know if this site checks air traffic in the area of these occurrences but I would just like to know what it was thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This “star” (first being spotted WNW) began moving west at a very slow rate and becoming more orange as it furthered itself in the distance.  At roughly 11:15pm we got out of the lake and I went to see if I could still see the star, I could barely see it.  In the time it took me to walk 15 feet back to my girlfriend, I looked back in the sky and there was what looked to be a fireball in the sky.  It was NNW in the sky and roughly a 45/50 degree angle off the water, about 40 times the size as the brightest star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This fireball was incredibly bright, with a yellowish color.  We had talked about how it was weird and possibly a plane.  I looked at my girlfriend, made another statement and looked back and there was a second fireball (about 25 times the size of the brightest star in the sky).  These lights hovered in the same exact spot for about 8 minutes or so.  One began to move while the other stayed stationary. The first fireball moved directly north, then directly east and looked exactly like a plane, then began to take a square shape and continue moving east.  The second fireball remained in place for about 5 more minutes and was still in the same position when we left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve lived on Lake Erie my whole life and I have seen orange orbs that seem to be unexplainable. Objects moving far faster than a plane would move.  However I haven’t seen anything like this before. I was blown away when I used google.com and saw others were talking about this fireball in the sky.  I hope my information has helped and I will be sure to post any further sightings I see.<n>

(Forming a triangular shape) They were all the same color shape and size and they faded in and out one at a time.

The moon was located in the south,venus was setting to the west.  Showed her venus through the telescope.  Above venus was another &#34;star&#34; which although rather high in the sky i thought could have been Jupiter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When i found the object in the telescope, i could not focus on the center disc.  I also noticed several &#34;sparks&#34; which could have passed for Jupiters moons.  Again i could not focus on the center disc. I showed my wife,claiming it was Jupiter.  One of the sparks was red and one was a pale blue.There appeared to be a haze from the main disc that passed through the sparks.  When i looked again into the eyepiece after about 2 minutes i saw the &#34;star&#34; explode and emit sparks.  I also saw the sparks tumbling away from the disc.  Before this explosion the only objects in the sky were the moon,venus and the mystery star.After the explosion the &#34;star&#34; was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There were absolutely no clouds just a peek of sun and an outline of the moon.  We saw just about three circular space crafts just come out from behind the moon.  It was flashing three huge lights that changed from green to blue.As soon as we noticed the UFO our neighbor was unable to start his car. We immediately called my mom my brother and my grandma to see.  They said it was a UFO and ran to get there cameras.  The craft was completely visible but wasn&#39;t able to be captured on camera.  Halfway across the sky the crafts just disappeared into space.  We tried calling the local radio station but of course they didn&#39;t believe us.<n>

I&#39;m a Mensa member since a few months.  I don&#39;t drink nor use drugs.  I know quite some things about astronomy but I&#39;m nothing close to an expert or anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since a few weeks I&#39;ve seen an extremely bright &#34;star&#34; in the sky at night time.  The first time it seemed like the light of an airplain, yet it missed the blinking white and red light of the wings and it was so much brighter.  And it moved much faster but dissipated before it was out of view. It didn&#39;t have a tail or anything else a normal meteor has.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight I saw it again but it was completely stationary.  It didn&#39;t move at all. Not even when I compaired it with the stars.  When I first looked at it my eyes almost hurt of the brightness it almost looked as if it was a tiny sun of it&#39;s own but the light did not difuse.  Then I noticed that the light seemed to get a little dimmer but when I looked closer it was as if its aura (at night the moon has a circle of light around it sometimes when there&#39;s a thin layer of clouds) was shifting it made me think of the head light of a car in the mist yet it was very short-ranged and I couldn&#39;t really make out if it was really like a moving &#34;head light&#34;.  But then around the object itselve.  Even though it was far away and due to the light not really clear I did have the idea it was a bit triangle shaped but it could just be rays of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now about half an hour later, 3:12 AM, it&#39;s gone.  I&#39;ve kind of a light head ache of looking at the bright light but I only watched it for some 5 minutes and that was almost 30 minutes ago.  I also felt some sort of pressure on/in my head even when I closed my eyes, when I watched it. And I&#39;m one of those rare, blessed persons who doesn&#39;t have head aches, ever!  But I could be a side affect of my light sensitivity, but still, sunlight never has an effect on anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also tried to take a picture of it but my camera wasn&#39;t able to capture it due to the extreme light contrasts between the black sky and the bright &#34;star&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a picture but its really vague if you still wanted to view this picture let me know.  But at the moment I don&#39;t have the needed cable to put it on my computer, with me.<n>
7/20/10 22:30|Orrville|OH|Light|45 minutes|Immensely bright object appears in the W sky by my house. Occurs regularly, nearly every night.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))|7/28/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76692.html|168|ndxe201007| Over the past month, an immensely bright object appears in the western sky by my house. This occurs regularly, nearly every night. It appears suspended/fixed for about 3-4 minutes at a time, then continues to move slowly, further west. I have been keeping an eye on it, trying to discredit this object as a mere, bright star or a planet (Venus perhaps).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, 7/20/10, this object appeared brighter than ever.  It looks just like what an airplane&#39;s headlights would look like at night if it were coming directly at you, however, this object does not appear to move at all.  The curious thing about it is, it twinkles with a barely perceptible reddish hue. It will also dim to the point of being unnoticeable as if a dark cloud were obstructing the view. Interestingly though, there has been little to no cloud cover over the last few days.  I have tried to take video/stills with my phone but my camera does not fare well in low light conditions. But at the same ti! me, my camera cannot pick up any other star in the sky let alone a dot of light.  In conclusion, I can&#39;t discount the fact that planet Venus could be the culprit as I have little experience with astronomy.  But if you were to see how bright this object is, you would most likely say to yourself, &#34;That object is much too bright to be a planet or star.&#34;  I just want someone with experience to take a look at it and prove me wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.

It looked like a meteorite heading right towards us. The flames were visible.  It was at that point a basketball size.  It was flying north at a downward angle.  It looked like it was right over us.  It then appeared smaller as it turned and leveled out north then suddenly it went East and disappeared.   We got back into the car and headed North.  I looked out again and it reappeared over town again.  We turned the car around and headed South see it, but it disappeared again.   I thought that it was a meteorite or even an Iraq missile headed towards us.

At first, I thought was seeing things.   I readjusted my glasses and took another look.  This time, I confirmed an extra &#34;star&#34; in the handle.  Upon inspection, I was startled to see it suddenly move in a northerly direction.  After watching this &#34;star&#34; move for approximately 10-15 seconds it disappeared.  I have lived in the Chicagoland area all my life and am very familiar with the air traffic patterns.  I believe this was not an airplane nor satellite.  My refence to the &#34;star&#34; is exactly what it looked like.  I have no other description to offer.  Thank you.<n>

The time was around 9:30PM - 10:00PM. We were driving to Millen Georgia on I-25 if I remember correctly around Portal when we observed what we believe to be multiple UFOs.  This wasn&#39;t the first time, I had seen a very similar thing close to that area as a child maybe 10-15 years ago.  You can see from the map on this link exactly where the sighting took place between I-16 and Millen somewhere on I-25 heading north from I-16...<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.flashearth.com/?lat=32.554451&amp;lon=-81.86212&amp;z=10.8&amp;r=0&amp;src=msl<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was seen cannot be described any other way but very ominous, for me anyway.  I was looking straight ahead at the road through the front windshield and didn&#39;t notice anything.  I was in the middle of conversation when my mother, who was driving, said &#34;Hey, is that a UFO?&#34; jokingly.  It was directly in my line of sight however I didn&#39;t seem to see anything until she said something.  When I focused my eyes I began to see Orange/redish or more like golden colored lights in the sky.  Roughly 2 or 3, although she had been looking longer and counted 5 or 6, approximatly 300 to 600 yards high off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I had just glanced and only witnessed 2 or 3 for no more than 5-8 seconds, they all simply faded out at the same exact time.  The odd thing is that it couldn&#39;t have been clouds covering them because they all did it simultaneously and they were approximately 2 or 3 miles from each other, spread apart throughout the sky in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother claimed that the other ones that I had not seem did the same thing a few seconds earlier.  Then another golden light appeared maybe 2 or 3 minutes later to our front/left.  It was very high up at first and only visible for a few seconds then faded out, far too high to be a light tower.  Then this proccess repeated with no noticeable pattern of timing with only 1 golden light for about the next 10 minutes.  I do some photo minipulation and 3D work for my career so I know distances, angles, and optical illusions very well and this was no illusion.  As we got closer it began to appear lower and lower to the ground, another indication it was not a light tower. It never got under maybe 90 ft from the ground though.  The last time we saw it, it was on the left side of I-25 going north and about 1 mile to the left I believe.  It would disappear, then suddenly appear again in its quite unique golden color for about half a minute or so in different places and appeared to be completely still then it would fade out again.  It was very steady, no pulsing just faded in then out again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later relayed this info to some family members who live in the area and they said that they had seen some very similar things at other times as well around there. Another interesting detail is that the very next night an extremely severe Lightning storm occurred in that same area. Literally the most severe Electrical Storm I have ever encountered. The thunder was loud enough to cause the entire house to tremble, and it had a sharpness to it that a .44 magnum revolver couldn&#39;t reproduce if it went off right next to your head. I&#39;ve heard that many sightings take place just before or after very severe lightning storms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the reasons this was so ominous to me is that I had recently had a dream of seeing a large UFO only a week earlier, which is not a common dream for me. In the dream seeing this UFO was so daunting that it terrified me and I awoke, a dream I&#39;ll not soon forget. On many occasions I have made predictions from my dreams that I discussed with people that later came true, this dream had a similar feeling so I did discuss this with my mother before the sighting took place. In the dream my mother was next to me on my left just as she was during the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this on another website as well, and someone had a very similar sighting with lights of the same color and character only 30-40 miles south of that location in Jesup Georgia just 2 months before. Here&#39;s the site...<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.ufosnw.com/sighting_reports/2010/jesupga05172010/jesupga05172010.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just want you to change a detail on the other report i made, change date to 7,20,2010, I was thinking 4th of july, sorry<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

I said to my friends (7 of them plus me)what is that? when another light appeard along side the first light, then another and another.  There were 4 in total at that time, then they blinked off and back on again and four more lights appeared along side the first four to make a total of 8 lights in a &#34;V&#34; formation.  They stayed lit for about 30 seconds and just vanished.  These lights were not moving nor was there any sound.  Everyone in this group had never seen anything like this in their life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 53 and do not drink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights reminded me of the Arizona lights.<n>

I normally don’t look up but this night I did.  Lo and behold, I saw a V-formation of UFO marching in a northwest formation.  There was about 15 to 20 of them.  When one of them got directly overhead, I took the attached pictures.  It looks like you can see energy radiating.  I don’t think this was the space shuttle (especially since there was 15 to 20 of them).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally, one day a couple of years ago in the fall of 2006(?) I was on the train coming home from work in downtown Chicago (I live near O’Hare Airport).  I looked out my window and there are 7 or 8 UFOs heading to O’Hare Airport.  Planes do not travel in groups of 7 or 8 so these were definitely not airplanes.  This was around 5:00 to 5:30 p.m., or so.  I know other people who saw them also, who lived south of Chicago.  A couple of weeks later I heard there was a UFO over O’Hare Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I looked up into the sky and I saw a very bright object of thin rectangular shape, with no lights flashing or blinking, that moved quicker than any airplane I’ve ever seen.  The light dimmed into the sky and there were no clouds for it to hide behind; it was as though it had evaporated.   The light was of a fluorescent quality, very white.   I followed the object for about 20 seconds and then I saw a second object and shortly thereafter a third object.  The lights of the second and third objects also just dimmed into the distance without blinking.<n>

My colleague was driving.  She told me that in Mexico DF it was normal to see OVNIs and that even the local news sometimes showed them on TV; warning me for what I was about to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then she told me to look over a tree pointing me in that direction, and then in the sky pretty far away, maybe thousands of meters away, was a silver object absolutely static in the sky.  It looked pretty small from where I was, but I know it was made from some kind of metal because the sun shined and kind of reflected on a spot of the object.  It looked as if it was rotating, because its edges where somehow dimed; and this happens when something is rotating at a high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then moved at a VERY high speed away from the site and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not aware if other drivers saw it, we were on a heavy traffic avenue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time in my life that I see something like this, and I am very happy that I did.<n>

7/20/10 09:03|Rocklin|CA|Rectangle|20-30 seconds|Rotating, dark gray, rectangles I saw during the DAY!|7/28/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76679.html|179|ndxe201007| Rotating, dark gray, rectangles I saw during the DAY!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning at 9:03 AM, I saw in the bright, blue sky, what appeared to be a dark gray rectangle flying across the eastern sky.  It was faintly dark gray and was spinning so it looked like a rectangle building block being thrown and spinning. It spun and flew slowly for about 9, 10 seconds.  I was watching this from my balcony so I had a very clear view.  It was spinning to look as if someone had thrown a very big, very far rectangle and it was actually going very fast and I would be able to tell if I was way closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of the sudden, it stopped spinning, it was still flying for 3 seconds, then stopped flying also. Since it was sitting there just still and obvious for a couple seconds I wanted to grab my low power telescope as soon as possible. So I got my telescope and came back out.  It was still in this position. So I looked at it through my telescope, and all I saw was the same big gray rectangle but, this magnified, I could see that one corner of it (the top right corner) had a bent, broken off part. I zoomed in and out and if I zoomed out slightly, I couldn&#39;t see the broken off part. It just looked like the rectangle I saw without the telescope.  But through the telescope, as zoomed in as I could possibly get, I could see the faintest yellowish glow around the edges of the rectangle.  There were no sounds or rumbles whatsoever coming from said rectangle(s). Nor any lights.  Just dark gray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it had to be something far, far off in the night sky and not some kind of bag or weird toy (they&#39;re making all kinds of weird, powerful kids&#39; toys these days) because even through my telescope it was still far and fuzzy.  And I&#39;ve easily looked at Jupiter through my telescope before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After putting my telescope back down on a chair, I looked back up in the sky and it was gone... poof... just... gone. Very frustrated, I stayed on the balcony looking at the sky. The same thing came again, appearing over some nearby buildings.  But this one (or the same one?) was not spinning, just flying through the sky very slowly. I looked at this one through my telescope and saw nothing.  Not one thing!  So I looked up and it was gone, again.  Weird?  A little creepy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [Conditions at this time were 84*F outside and no clouds in view during this sighting]<n>

My buddy went to the truck to get his binoculars, we could all see the disc shaped objects in the sky.  It looked like they wer close to the planes landing and taking off.  Im sure the pilots could see and also the control tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There wer at least 10 objects in the sky at the end they seemed to look cigar shaped then they went in to the clouds.  They wer all moving at a slow then high rate of speed and not in any particular pattern.  Her in wichita kansas lately.  There seems to be some activity towards the airport in the sky at night.

I stepped out onto the lawn and looked up towards the big dipper when a bright white light looking exactly like the brightest star in the sky, was moving in a north to south direction following the handle of the big dipper at a speed like I’ve never seen.  It covered the whole sky in maybe 4 seconds.  No tail or burn like a meteor but just a bright white orb.  It appeared to be very high. It didn’t flicker or change colors but was moving extremely fast. It looked like a star.  It was definitely not a satellite.  It was moving at least 20 times as fast as one.<n>
7/19/10 22:22|Nevada City|CA|Unknown|3 min|My girlfriend and I witnessed a  well lit craft that was completely silent, but appeared to be flying at speeds upward of 5 hundred MPH|7/28/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76680.html|194|ndxe201007| My girlfriend and I witnessed a  well lit craft that was completely silent, but appeared to be flying at speeds upward of 5 hundred MPH<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Girlfriend and I were sitting out front of her Nevada City home, listening to lectures on the Ipad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was about 22 minutes after 10 pm when I noticed a very bright star off in the south southwest sky, between two other stars of average brightness.  It wasn&#39;t long, maybe just a few seconds before we both realized this very bright star seemed to be moving.  When we say bright, we mean like venus has been for the last several weeks, just really standing out in the night&#39;s sky.  So the &#34;craft&#34; (obviously can&#39;t call it a star now that it&#39;s moving), began to move upward in relation to it&#39;s neighboring stars then began to get brighter very quickly which we realized was being caused by it moving rapidly in our direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached I guessed it looked to be no more than 1 mile up, either that or it was a very large craft because as it flew over us we could distinguish individual lights on the body of the craft.  Also I could faintly see that there was a blinking of some sort, however my girlfriend got a much better view as she had run inside and got the binoculars.  She then raced to the north side of the house as it flew overhead and told me a moment later that she was able to clearly see what appeared to be a paramecium shaped craft with rythmically pulsing light from front to back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft continued it&#39;s North by Northeasterly course until I could no longer see it. It was extremely bright to me the whole 3 minutes that I was watching it. I have been fascinated by technology and space my whole life and am very familiar with our current abilities as humans in regards to vehicles and propulsion systems.  This craft or vehicle that my girlfriend and I both saw last night in no way compares to anything I have ever seen or heard of that humans can construct. It doesn&#39;t even compare to stretching our most advanced flying vehicles to the point of absurdity.  The reason I say that is the most shocking part of the experience for us:  The Speed of this craft, based on its apparent size, distance and luminosity had to be upwards of 5 or 6 Hundred MPH.  For all of its speed and distance covered, the craft we saw remained COMPLETELY silent.  I mean this thing didn&#39;t make a sound. Not in the distance and not when it was right above us, and it looked like it was over Sacramento 1 minute, then right above us in Nevada City the next, then on it&#39;s way over Nevada the next minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am completely certain this craft was not Man Made and I am not a ufo advocate, nor have I ever seen or reported anything like this in my life.<n>

7/19/10 22:00|Mebane|NC|Fireball|one minute or so|A orange glowing object changed direction in the sky without making a sound, then went into "hyper speed".|7/28/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76694.html|197|ndxe201007| A orange glowing object changed direction in the sky without making a sound, then went into &#34;hyper speed&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Fiance, friend, and myself were grilling out at our pool around 10:00pm on Monday night.  The stars were bright and while I was grilling, I noticed a peculiar light coming over the trees way off in the distance.  At first I noticed the light was staying consistent and not blinking, so I wanted to continue to pay attention to it.   It did not seem to be a light on the front of the object like an airplane; the light did not project in one direction like a high beam on your car either.  It seemed to be illuminating from within.  I told my Fiance and friend to pay attention to it and be quiet so we could listen for the sound of an engine. We heard nothing.  The light seemed to hover very slowly but consistently at first; so I took it to be just way off in the distance and coming directly at us.  But then it seemed to be just a mile or so above us and started &#34;curving&#34; in a different direction. It curved about 90 degrees into a different path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it started moving in that direction, it gained an amazing amount of speed and took off until it disappeared.  It never made a sound, even when going into &#34;hyper speed&#34;.  Coincidentally, an airplane passed over our heads within a minute of the object.  It was loud, moving in a straight line, and easily had a distinguishable front and back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light itself seemed to be small at first.  But then it seemed like it was close to right over us, but the light stayed small. It seemed to be trying to look small.  The light was a very warm glow of orange. It seemed to me that the light was almost coming from the inside of the craft, and illuminating almost in a translucent way. It was very peculiar to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe in aliens by the way.  I have seen satellites traveling over night skys before, this was not the same thing.<n>

Further observation with 7 x 35 binoculars showed a pair of identical objects that had red glowing vertical bodies and each with a midway ring with 4 separate green lights, (from our viewing position.).  The objects appeared on the same horizontal plane in what appeared as a stationary position.  After approximately 10 minutes, the Western object’s lights faded and the shadow of it’s profile could be observed moving rapidly west on the same plane until out of sight.  (It was twilight yet one could still discern the horizon tree line and the moving unlit object.)  After another approximate 5 minutes, the Eastern object’s lights faded out and it also moved rapidly west until obscured by what seemed to be clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Residing only 40 miles from an international airport, 15 miles from 2 municipal airports and 3 hospital heliports and at least 2 private airfields, during my past 25 years I have witnessed a number of varying aircraft servicing these facilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observation of 07/19/10 seems to be an anomaly from what I have previously observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a plane, helicopter, or other flying object turn away at night and not have at least a tail beacon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These had nothing.<n>

It hovered in one area for a couple of seconds, then darted to the left, then the right horizontally.  Then it went straight up and then down after which it repeated the same pattern a couple more times in and out of this cloud.   I had not said anything to my son at this point because I wasn’t sure what I had seen.  After this display, my son says to me, &#34;Did you see that thing in the sky mom?  Stop the car.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over to the shoulder and took out my phone and started recording the objects motions.  After a couple of minutes it darted into the cloud, came back out then went back in and never returned.  We sat there for a couple of minutes waiting for it to reappear but it never did come back.  Once it disappeared my son noticed a fighter jet circling the same cloud we were looking at, as if it were looking for what we had seen in the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another plane then proceeded to follow around the cloud cover as if it were looking also.  This went on for another minute or so then they left.  We were not far from a military base at the time.  We have several in area.<n>

Then I clearly saw that there is no body and wings to this airplane, and then second fireball came into my view.  They were flying in paralell, some 500 meters apart, some 300 meters from the ground.  Also those 2 balls were no more then 500 meters from observation point.  Their color was very live and sparkling amber/orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light must have been very strong to be so clearly visible in sunny summer day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also dismiss any idea of chinese lanterns or 2 invisible planes competing for runway.  Considering speed, it was easily 100 km/h. It felt like they were patroling the area.

(All planes lights are visible at this time). As I&#39;m sitting there, I see something light up really bright for about 1 second which draws my attention, the light goes out, and the black object continues to fly across the sky with NO LIGHTS (which is the only reason I don&#39;t think it was a plane.) I could see it clearly because it was still partially light out. It was flying south to north, which most planes don&#39;t, but did sound like a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Whatever this was it looked to be just over our town, looked like it was just observing.  It would sway out slightly then back to it&#39;s original position, as it did this I also noticed the light casting  out  lines onto a diamond shaped craft.  It also seemed to move closer, then back again, each time it moved I could see the shape of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about an hour and a half, it was still there when I went to bed, and it was still changing it&#39;s position.

And then I get a little interested in that and I look again and I see that it dipped down to where I couldn&#39;t see it.  I kept looking over to glimpse it...I thought I lost it but I kept looking anyway because I kept seeing bits of it through some bushes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 sec pass until I see it again, and it&#39;s fairly low to the ground; it looks like it&#39;s moving quickly so it must be have been somewhat close.  Maybe 50-70 yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I see it again and it pops up and this time, I saw more lights on it.  Each corner of the triangle had white lights and there are more along the edge that were turning on and off in a random pattern...some would flicker, blue ones flickered, but could have been other colors too.  It was black as the night sky except for the pattern of lights on each edge of the triangle.  And I could see this by the time it swooped up from a lower position.  So it would swoop up and then it would flip or tumble and then swoop very low to the ground.  It would swoop and tumble and traverse through the air while tumbling.  Like it was a black triangle flipping end on end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 big bright white lights would light up on the edge of it.  And they would get really bright every time it would swoop down.  It would probably be down for 3 sec at a time, then it would go up again and tumble again.  And when it would tumble, it would stay up for about 10 sec at a time just doing random things in the air, flip up over end, go through the air at the same time, looked very random.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dip back down, flatten out...looked triangle the whole time, then it would go down and the 3 white lights would swell and look like head lights.  Then would go back up and other lights would come back on.  It did this about 4 to 5 times that I saw and then I got to the overpass and called my girlfriend to tell her about it...looked behind me on the phone and saw it again.  From that point onward I didn&#39;t see it dip down again.  I took the next off ramp (W Kamm Ave), took the overpass and parked. I could still see it but by that time it looked like a normal plane in the air because of it&#39;s lights.  It traveled away, north, for about 2 minutes until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most incredible thing about the sight was how close to the ground it would get.  I thought it was landing at times and then it would go up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3 bright lights that shone down seemed to illuminate the ground, like it was scanning something.<n>

My sister said, &#34;Is that a satellite?&#34; and upon that I look around to see what she’s referring to, and suddenly see on her side of the car an enormous flying object that had lights all across the side I was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I’m trying to drive and also adjust my eyes to the very dark night sky, I start seeing that whatever it is I’m looking at is flying at a tilt.  I assumed it was a plane with extra lights along the wings, but then as I keep looking it starts listing upwards and the lights that were on a 45 degree angle on the &#34;wings&#34; suddenly started tilting/listing up into vertical and kept rotating all the way around 180 degrees.  I didn’t understand what I was seeing and thought that it was a plane that was crashing into the ground, but it was in such slow motion I just had to pull over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I pulled off onto the emergency lane, we saw what appeared to be a saucer/oval shape gigantic ship with lights all around the rim.  When it was tilted I could see that they went all around the rim.  This ship looked to me like it was the size of two football stadiums or so.  That is all I can compare it to.  It was so big and silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;ship&#34; looked like it was dark grey or black and the lights around the rim were yellowish. Not plane lights and no green or red or flashing.  There were three distinctly brighter lights on the side I was looking at, one on the left, one in the center, and one at the right side, but there were a few smaller lights. All the lights were glowing in different capacities.  This &#34;ship&#34; seemed to be &#34;landed&#34; after it did the somersaults in slow motion, next to a very dark mountainside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound from this &#34;ship.&#34;  After a few brief moments we saw the first of five balls of light that slowly floated out from the left side (from my view looking at it) of the ship.  These lights were a silvery ball is the only way I can describe it, but we were at quite a distance from the mountain and where the ship was.  One after another these silver glowing balls came out but at different travel paths.  They were going around the base and midpoint of the mountain slowly but steadily.  The ship that I was looking at slowly had the lights around the rim go dim or something and they were not as prevalent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most startling thing was that the ship appeared to disappear.  I’m not 100% certain of that as I don’t understand how that could happen but from my vantage point it either disappeared or lowered behind land or a hill that I could not see as it was so dark in the desert that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not going to go check out this situation, as my sister and I were traveling alone at night and I started to get nervous being on the side of the road with big rigs going by so I decided that we saw enough of whatever we were looking at and we went on our way to continue on to Marina del Rey, CA where I live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not looked into any other sightings or websites or books to see if other people have seen what I saw.  Please let me know if there are other sightings similar to this so I know I’m not crazy or making things up that have a good explanation.

I looked over my left shoulder and saw a huge fireball(approx. the diameter of half of a school bus. It was yellow and orange and never lost intensity the entire sighting.  It was pushing a coneish shape.  We could see the outline clearly but inside the outline was blackish-grey. It flew slowly over my neighbor&#39;s house aprox. 500 feet high and 400 feet away from us.  It maintained same heighth for 4-5 minutes traveling into a heat lightning storm in the NorthEast.  It made absolutely no noise and no fire debris or jet stream was visible from fireball.  My son also witnessed it for approx. 2 minutes.  He took a video on cell phone and I took 1 picture.  When we went to view, niether were there. Gallery was empty and not even a poor quality picture or video......nothing.  It was so close I could have hit it with a bullet.

Half an hour later i saw another one and minutes later a third one they kept on flashing and moving from side to side slowly.  The experience lasted about 2 Hours.

I was looking up at the night sky when in an eastwardly direction about 45 degrees from the horizon, when I thought I saw a very bright star. This sparked my curiosity because I had never seen a star that bright before.  After about 5 seconds the star faintly pulsated once, and then grew brighter in intensity.  After it grew brighter the light shrank into itself and disappeared.  The light was a darker blue, not the normal blue you see in any celestial body.<n>
7/18/10 01:16|Inver Grove Heights|MN|Light|45 minutes|Bright string of stationary lights after tornadic storms baffles stormwatcher|7/19/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76627.html|218|ndxe201007| bright string of stationary lights after tornadic storms baffles stormwatcher<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was up late as I am a storm enthusiast and we had a tornado watch until 3 am.  I was outside smoking a cigarette and as usual I was looking at the stars between cloud banks.  I was looking due east and about a half a degree south there was a string of bright lights that seemed to blink.  I at first just passed it off as an airliner coming in for landing approach as we are in the direct path of the mpls airport, (about 7 miles to the east southeast). so we see many aircraft on a daily basis.  When I was done with my cigarette I noticed that the lights did not seem to move.  At that point I looked for a point of reference to see if indeed the object was stationary.  I stood against the house and put my arm up at a 45 degree angle and held out my thumb horizontally so the tops of my neighbors oak trees were in sight just below my thumb, the object was an eighth of an inch above my thumb.  I watched it for 40 minutes and it did not move.  It looked like a string of five! stars that were very close together with the second from the left star blacked out.  The lights were so bright that they left a residual light shadow in my sight when i closed my eyes like when you look at a flash and it stays with you for a while after.  I would have watched it all night long if the cloud deck did not block the view.  They were white with a tinge of blue and the left most light seemed brighter than the rest.  The light clouds that would obscure the lights from time to time helped me to see that this was a string of lights as opposed to one bright one.  The clouds are not uniform in their thickness and it would show as they passed how one end would be brighter and the other would be dim and successively the other would get dim and then bright depending on the shape of the cloud. Imagine a 747 about six miles out at 5000 feet coming right at you with landing lights on.  We see this quite often from our front yard.  As It did not move and as the clouds were in front! of it I would have to guestimate that the thing was quite lar! ge and somewhat cigar shaped. side note....not the first ufo I have seen.<n>

I noticed two large brightly lit orange balls in the eastern sky, one above the other, above my neighbor’s roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them for about 15 minutes.  During this time, they seemed to move closer to one another and then seemed to merge.  They did not diverge.  Other than that they didn’t move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them through binoculars but they didn’t look like anything I had ever seen before.  They were much smaller than the moon would be in the same place but much larger than a star or planet might be, and a very different color.  I had no way to determine how far away they might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night seemed to be clear.  There had been some sea-mist earlier in the day and before dark but that was only seen to the south.  However, perhaps it is possible that the sea-mist had come up again after dark and caused some kind of unusual reflection.<n>

There were maybe six or more.  When the cloud moved off, we couldn&#39;t see anything.   As soon as there was cloud cover again, in the same spot, the lights returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first the lights moved quickly but randomly, never out of the cloud area that we could see.  Then they started a pattern, like an x or a cross pattern.  They would meet in the middle like a bump, then back out to edge of clouds then around edge to return to center over and over. They moved very quickly but stayed in same spot in the sky.  There was no noise at all.  This lasted quite awhile, off and on again, for maybe an hour.  Then when the sky had no more clouds and we couldn&#39;t see anything more and went inside.<n>

I looked up at the sky and spotted what I thought was a shooting star.  I was very bright and falling very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It suddenly stopped and started to fade away.  As it faded away, I saw what looked like 3 red lights in a triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the white lights got very bright again and looked like LED lights.  When lit fully it almost looked like an X, but curved.  It looked far away but very big, probably the size of a large plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved faster then anything that I could imagine.  I watched it go from one part of the sky to another in seconds.  It continued to fade away and I would see the red lights again and then get very bright white again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really can’t stress the speed that it was traveling and the size of it.  There is no way that something that large should be able to move that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 4 minutes I decided to run in and grab my video camera.  I was able to get a! bout 45 seconds of it on film and it does show the speed that the object moved at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went up and down and across and zig-zag. I still don’t know what exactly I saw, but I do know that there was something physically out there.<n>

We watched them for about 10 minutes as they floated from east (direction of Puget Sound) toward downtown and then drifted upwards into the clouds and disappeared.   They lasted longer than a firework remains lit, but their motion seemed more determined by air currents than locomotion.  They didn&#39;t all appear at once, but rather, appeared one after another, twinkling into being, drifting from east to west, and then uplifting into the clouds.  No idea what they were.<n>

We were told to immediatly come outside and look towards the sky (due west) and see them for ourselves.  We then saw 25+ orange lighted objects (which appeared to blink in and out as they dimmed in the upper atmosphere.

They were silent and as they moved flew in a zig zag pattern. One went north to south and the other went west to east.  They flew so fast and shot straight up into the sky and then just vanished.  This is not the first time that any of us have witnessed this and many times I have knocked on my neighbors door just so that I could have another witness. I do have pictures of these things and have witnessed them several times.  One of the witnesses used to serve in the millitary, the other witness used to be a sherrif and both have never seen anything like this before. Last year when this happened I had eight guests in my back yard for the fourth of july celebration.

Off The Ground Forming A Triangle Flash In And Out Twice & Then From Afar Coyotes Howl At It For 4-5 Minutes|7/28/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76668.html|232|ndxe201007| 3 Lights, 25 Ft. Off The Ground Forming A Triangle Flash In And Out Twice &amp; Then From Afar Coyotes Howl At It For 4-5 Minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> MY UFO TESTIMONY  It was Saturday, July 17, 2010. Me, my girlfriend and her son visited the Bruneau Dunes Observatory in Idaho (between Bruneau and Mountain Home). The staff was there along with us and 20 or so other people. They did not allow us to have on any white lights and the only lights there were the small red reflector type electrically lit lights on the cement. At around 11 PM I was facing what I believe was South East towards the Education Center (look at the map I provide. I think that was the direction) and suddenly out of nowhere, above the building, three white lights with green on the outer parts of the lights flickered for 1 to 2 seconds and then they in a sense “turned off” like you turn off a light in a room. It just went black. It seemed that even though these lights were like 7 FT. or so above the building, they were actually coming from further away, ahead of us and were probably a lot bigger than what we saw. Keep in mind the building is 10 FT or more in height. I think! I said out loud, “What was that?” There was a guy on the left of me who saw it too and so did my girlfriend who was on the right side of me. They both clearly confirmed what I saw. We continued to look in that same direction and only a few seconds later the three lights flickered on again for 1-2 seconds and then disappeared. Whatever it was, it did not emit any noise at all. From where I was standing, it looked as if each light was 2 ft. or so in diameter or almost double the size of the moon from where I was standing if I put my thumb up to the moon which was to the right of us almost behind us. They looked size-wise like three double-sized basketball shaped balls of light that were glowing white and green and shook a little bit. There was 1 light on top and two others on the bottom, forming a triangle shape, but I did not see any structure holding it all together. It must have been much further away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a few minutes later, we suddenly started hearing a pack of coyotes a little bit from the left of the building but far ahead of us, over 150 FT or more away making some very nasty howling noises as if they were on the defense against something that upset them. They were howling (right) in the direction of where we saw the 3 lights. Their intense howlings got more intense and nasty for about 4-5 minutes or so. Keep in mind that we never heard the coyotes howl before or after they howled. This only took place after the lights emitted twice and then ended. After that, they went on the coyotes went on and on for 4-5 minutes. I asked one of the staff members who was manning one of the telescopes about it and I told him what the three of us saw. He said to me, “What are you guys smoking?” Still the young guy in a baseball cap who was about 6 ft. tall and around 27-32 years old saw the lights. Me, I’m 35 and my girlfriend is 38. All three of us saw it. We, the three witnesses ! and my girlfriend’s son were the last ones to stay at the observatory with the staff. I spoke with the person who gave the presentation in the education center earlier at 9 pm and he didn’t act like he didn’t believe us but from what it looked like, he had never heard of this before and was startled a bit but very calm and professional. We then went home. It is weird to call this a UFO since as it seems from what I saw it was a &#34;UO&#34; (Unidentified Object) since I nor the other witnesses saw it &#34;fly&#34; or &#34;fly away&#34;. It just blinked in and then out and then the coyote&#39;s flipped out yelling at whatever it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some background info you should know: Today, July 19, 2010, I contacted the Bruneau Dunes Observatory and mentioned this situation that happened on Saturday. They were very nice. Apparently this had never happened there before. I asked what was beyond the building. Two people at different times on the phone told me there was 150 FT of mowed green grass. Beyond that is a lake, which they call “small lake” (people fish there) which is left of “big lake”. Apparently both lakes combined make up half the size of a football field (300 Acres). With that info and the fact that they said that coyotes are afraid of people and would not be on the 150 ft. of grass behind the buildings, they must have been on the grounds area past the grass and on the surrounding left of “small lake”. I won’t make any assumptions but if I put this info together, it seems to me that whatever this triangular light object was (at least we saw it as triangular from our view) it could have been hovering over ! the lake and it flipped out the coyotes 2 minutes after we saw it and they were yelling at this object for 3-5 minutes. I also contacted Mountain Home Air Force Base that is way on the other side of all this and spoke to them about it. The lady mentioned that they did not hear about any of this and that they do not have any dealings in that area since they are on the complete other side of it (behind where we were standing). Other info I found out is that the observatory is 20 miles south of Mountain Home and 6 miles SW of Bruneau. I believe that is what the lady at the observatory told me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MY GIRLFRIEND’S UFO TESTIMONY  It was past 11 PM on July 17, 2010. We were at the Bruneau Dunes Observatory in Idaho. I was lying down on the circular cement seating to the right with my head up looking towards the tree next to the Bruneau Dunes Observatory Education Center. First I saw two round lights. One at the top and one below it to the left of it and it appeared that there was another light behind the branches of the tree on the right. They flickered forward and back for a second, but when they retracted it was very smooth. It looked as if they were on top of the roof but they weren&#39;t. I didn&#39;t know what they were. And then I sat up and asked my boyfriend, &#34;Did you see that?&#34; and he said to me, &#34;What was that about?&#34; and then I saw it again. I saw like three rounded white flickering lights. They were not aligned. I saw one on top and the other one was one across from the other. I said again to my boyfriend, &#34;Did you see that?&#34; and then he said, &#34;(my name), what was that?&#34; And there was a young guy ! sitting opposite from me on the circular cement seating area and he said, &#34;I saw that too. What was that about?&#34;  And then I told my son, &#34;You missed it!&#34; He was sitting in front of me on the cement seating area but was looking in the opposite direction. My boyfriend, the guy and I started talking about what we saw. My son was also with us as we were talking. I thought it was cool but weird since I didn&#39;t know where it came from. My boyfriend said, &#34;I saw three lights and they were kind of green.&#34; And then the guy who also saw it agreed with my boyfriend and said, Yeah, they were green.&#34; I said, &#34;No. The ones I saw, they were white.&#34;  As we were talking, the coyotes started to howl and they angrily started barking, like they saw something. They were on the left side of where the lights flashed. The coyotes were howling for about 4 minutes then stopped.  That was the only time we heard the coyotes that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the coyotes stopped howling, my boyfriend told one of the observatory staff members what we saw and then he said to my boyfriend, &#34;What are you smoking?&#34;  Then my boyfriend said to him, &#34;I&#39;m not the only one who saw it?  They saw it too.  My boyfriend pointed at me and the other guy who saw it. Then my boyfriend said to the observatory staff member, &#34;If I&#39;m smoking something, it&#39;s Parliament Ultra Lights and Wallgreens is my supplier.&#34;  The three of us and my son continued talking about it, wondering what were those lights.  We had the question the whole night: “What was that?&#34;  And nobody could answer the question about what we saw.<n>

I pulled off of Hwy. 33 at the next intersection, got out of my car and spotted a faceted cubic shaped object with a very bright amber light underneath illuminating the craft which appeared to glow orange.  It was almost directly overhead at this point, traveling West to East, and climbing at about the same rate a private plane would.  At this time a State Patrol squad pulled up along side of me and the officer lowered his window and asked &#34;what&#39;s wrong?&#34;   I said &#34;My son spotted a U.F.O.-  Take a look&#34;  He craned his head out of the window and said &#34;Sure enough, the Air Force must be doing some testing tonight&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object ascended in the distance I got back in the car and traveled at normal Hwy. speed in it&#39;s direction but was not able to regain sight again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve reported this incident to Milwaukee T.V. stations, and they all claim no other reports were filed.<n>
7/17/10 22:20|Blue Springs|MO|Fireball|10 min|4 orange flaming lights traveling south to north with 8-9 loud booms, and flashs to the north of our location.|7/19/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76622.html|234|ndxe201007| 4 orange flaming lights traveling south to north with 8-9 loud booms, and flashs to the north of our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:20 PM Saturday 7/17/2010, I was sitting in bed on my laptop online when I heard a loud boom outside.  Fearing someone had hit my car I looked outside to see nothing out of the ordinary, but due to the load nature of this boom I continued to scan my neighborhood.  I then looked up to see that there was a orange ball of light in the sky.  This ball looked to be like fire, but seemed to be in a half circle shape, rounded in the front and trailing off to the back side.  I immediately called my wife to come to the window and take a look, and she came to the window and watch the events with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange light in the sky continued from south to north disappearing behind a few clouds before reemerging from the clouds.  After this light had reached almost the end of our vision another orange light very much same shape as the first appeared to the south tracking about the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we heard a boom to the north of our house.  The boom was accompanied by a bright flash that seemed to emanate from ground level, and that was very bright.  This was no fireworks, it was bright white, produced shadowing effects and kind of hurt our eyes.  Then this happened again, I moved to a window I could see farther north from but did not see anything burning nor any explanation for the booms or flashes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife then announced to me that another one had appeared to the south same as the first two.  Prior to this one even getting close to our house we heard two more loud booms each accompanied by that same bright flash.  At one point I feared we were under some kind of attack mainly due to the intensity of the booms, and flashes, I dialed 911, as I awaited the dispatcher (placed on hold and transferred once since I called from my cell phone, made this call at 10:30 per my cell phone memory)  I saw another one enter from the south this one on a path south to north but much closer to my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard a total of eight to nine loud booms, and saw a total of four bright orange lights. and witnessed 6 flashes, we were not at the window for all of the booms, got phone for one and was moving to different window for another, and the original boom that made me go to the window was approx 3 booms I had not been looking outside during.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 911 dispatcher told me they had reports of fireworks in the area, but I told him it was not a fireworks display. The light was high enough to be in clouds, and was traveling south to north at a fairly slow pace for something that high in the sky, with the flash and explosions occurring farther north then the orange light in the sky, and the flash appearing to be ground level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the event my wife and I saw our neighbors come outside pointing into the sky at the lights, with still other neighbors looking out their windows for the origin of the booms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do intend to talk with them tomorrow, but wanted to file this tonight as the information was fresh on my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I do not personally believe in Aliens or any such thing, I know today I was witness to something unidentified and flying.  I am not prone to events like this, having worked 10 years as a paramedic and been very scientifically grounded I realize now, that this was something very odd and I am intent to find out what was going on.<n>

I was in the passenger’s seat and my husband was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happened to look out my window to the right and in the distance, coming towards the earth diagonally; I saw what I thought to be a large, slow moving meteor coming towards the earth.  It was orange-yellowish in color and had a long tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was approaching, it split off into 3 different balls of light that seemed to be about the sizes of very large stars and they continued to have the same color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They hovered in different parts of the sky and hovered up then down (not simultaneously) and then finally just down until we could no longer see them because of the obstruction of view and the fact that we were driving in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be a quite serious-minded individual.

They descended from high in the sky, following each other in a row. They did not make any noise at all, and did not move like airplanes. There flight was very smooth, almost as if they were floating. They preceeded towards us and became brighter. People in their cars stopped to observe the phenomenon backing up traffic in a very busy intersection. Two of the balls of light appeared to get close together, almost as if to touch, but then split apart quickly and went opposite directions and faded away. One remained bright, and quickly darted westward away from the others. The two others disappeared from site.  A small plane heading west was in the sky at the same time and appeared obviously different from the others.  I tried to use my cellphone to make a call and it wouldn&#39;t work.  I continued to press the buttons but they wouldn&#39;t function.  About three minutes after t! he event ended, my phone began to work again.<n>

My wife and I decided to take a night walk, with our kids (10 and 2), into town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we walked south, through a parking lot, we (my wife, daughter, and myself) noticed a fireball way up in the south sky.  It was heading in an eastwardly direction at about the speed of a jet liner at around 30,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was an airplane out of Detroit Metro Airport, but it started to get brighter and then dim again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The longer we watched it the more we realized it was not an airplane.  It was too much like a fireball. It didn’t leave any kind of streak or trail.  It was almost like something was burning up while entering the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take a picture, or video, with my iPhone but it was not visible on the screen when I tried.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We assumed it would be on the news when we got home, or on the internet (news) the next day, but we found no stories about it.<n>

At approximately 22:00 hrs, people were gathering in the front yard, preparing to leave.  Someone said, “Hey, look at that!  What is it?”   Everyone (more than 15 people—adults and children) looked toward the eastern sky to see what it was.  We observed what appeared to be a white light that was moving very strangely.  It would go to the right, then the left, circle and up and down.  It was able to stop abruptly before it changed directions.  I’m not sure exactly how far away it was, as there was nothing to accurately gauge it by.  It also appeared to have lights that changed from white to blue to red or purple.  Finally, after about 10 minutes it just seemed to disappear.  I got up the next morning and looked at the local news online to see if anyone had reported seeing this same thing.  No luck there.  However, I searched You Tube to see if by chance anything was there, and! to my surprise there was!  Someone who lives in Spanish Fork, UT, which is about 15-20 miles south of Lehi, UT, had witnessed what appeared to be the same object that we all had witnessed only it had been seen above Spanish Fork about 15 minutes or so earlier.  They did capture this on video; however it’s a little shaky but looks to be the same object. .  In the video it also looked to be about the same distance away as when we observed it.  If interested, you can find that video on You Tube titled, “Friendly Neighborhood UFO.”<n>

I said what did they mean and they then proceeded to say look up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a quick glance out the front window and saw five to seven yellow with a tint of red globes traveling in a Northwest to Southeast direction in no particular formation and all traveling the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my wife to look and she ran for the camera and we went out into the front yard and watched as the globes kept coming.  The person on the phone said I had all ready missed about 20 of them.  They kept coming in groups of 2 to 5 for another ten minutes or so primarily strung out in a long disconnected line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife proceeded to take pictures and one video clearly showing the globes in flight.  Although difficult to ascertain, my experience at the Air Base leads me to believe they were at or about 2,000-3,000 feet in elevation.  You can see ! in the video the faintest sunlight as they proceed across the sky.  We have pictures and a video we will attempt to attach or load onto your website.<n>

My sister-in-law was already in the car when I told everyone to look up at the light moving across the sky.  My mother and brother both wear glasses and have poor eye sight but I indicated description and the location of the light in relation to the half moon and light clouds in the sky.  They could not spot it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was the size and brightness of an average star you would see in the night sky only it was moving steadily in the blue sky in a westward direction towards Lake Erie.  As I was trying to show my brother where it was it gradually vanished, this could have been from cloud cover but it was clearly visible moving through other clouds near where the Moon was in the sky.  It appears that when I first saw the object, it was flying below the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no trail like what you would see from an airplane, the object was high in the sky but appeared to be a white orb or light.  Moving at that speed and distance I would rule out that it was a high flying seagull which would have a different shape and not be as bright.  The weather conditions at the time were clear, no excessive humidity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There was no sound. Shortly after the last fireball dissapeared, we witnessed 3 of these balls slowly drift back toward the earth into my neighborhood which is Mount Baker Seattle.  Unfortunately, we were not able to see where they finally touched down.  As they were coming down they drifted lightly, reminding us of a plastic bag drifting through the wind.  Also reminded me of those camping lamps they used to make with the netting that would burn out.  Strange, seemed manmade once they came down, but I don&#39;t understand how they went up so high so quickly and they were quite large....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It looked like it was just a satellite moving accross the sky but it lit up for maybe 10 seconds brighter than the North Star.  Then it suddenly changed direction and faded away.  Right behind it came another one that followed it, then a third came from a different direction and disapeared in the same area as the first two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really have know clue what it was but I have noticed that the past week there has been a lot more activity in the sky at night than I have ever seen before.  I have seen shooting stars,sattellites, etc.  But this was just really weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just the first one made a real bright light, the others were dim but they moved very fast.

They appear in various places and are mostly stationary, however every occasionally they seem to make small circular movements and then return to the original position.  They do not appear in the same place every night.  At first I only noticed one at about 0300.  The next night I saw three.  Since then I have seen different numbers on different nights.  The lights seem to be white primarily but flash to blue and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t have access to a large telescope, but I did watch through a 60x spotting scope.  Through the spotting scope it appears that the red and blue lights are to the side of the white light, not the same light source changing color.  I was unable to see the shape of the object that the lights are coming from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am police officer who works night shift and I told one of my squad mates about the light the first night I noticed it and he and I both spent about 15-20 minutes watching trying to figure it out.  About a week later the other officer told me that he pointed out the lights to a friend of his and the friend used his telescope (significantly stronger than my spotting scope) and said that he could see a vague shape like a satellite of some sort but couldn’t think of any satellite that would be flashing red and blue lights and moving that way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also pointed out the lights to my wife, and none of us have been unable to come up with an explanation for these lights that I see every clear night.  Whatever these objects are they are either small or very far away.  Any help would be appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I&#39;m involved in an aeronautical Institute, currently passed general aviation with a 90 overall getting my a&amp;p license! .  I know aircraft, I witnessed the international space station a few nights ago, I know this subject i witnessed floated in, something wasnt quite right about it, it glowed and floated but moved like.....a laser pointer on the wall... is the only comparison. also witnessed three shooting stars all heading west to east 15 min apart around subject in view. from my viewpoint an airliner flew under subject which helped verify subjects altitude. There are no cities in this area, very wooded area, i may have been the only witness, i watched the sky smoking a cigarette just as subject floated into place. Why is this positioning itself in the sky all night as if it was held in orbit with the earth it moved through sky like a star bright as hell.  I&#39;d witnessed something two weeks ago about 2:30 am walking in a bright light floating towards the house simply vanished as I seen it.  I&#39;m tired of not understanding these happening, and not being believed by anyone. hopefully this helps! someone else with the ongoing question... i will report from ! now on w hat i see now that i live here. there are no neighbor&#39;s and open fields to get a spectacular view of the sky since. thank you this is not a hoax I was very worried when subject moved in the sky, end even more so when it sat in the sky all night, i know the stars the planets and aircraft, and do not understand what els would have done this, i simply got tired and lost site of object with cloud coverage, thank you for listening. maybe you can help me figure out what these are...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))|7/19/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76630.html|248|ndxe201007| On the night of June 16, I watched and recorded a UFO (for 4.5 hours) in the skies over the Giant Sequoia National Forrest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of July 16, 2010, I witnessed an Unidentified Flying Object over the Giant Sequoia Forrest in the Southern Sierra Nevada Mountains.  The object resembled a star, although this particular light was twice as bright as any star in the sky, and the light emitted was not consistent with the other stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object began to move in various directions (upward, free-fall, diagonal, side to side on a perfectly level plane.)   The craft also had the ability to stop and remain perfectly still in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft moved through the sky coming very close to my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout the evening I recorded the craft with my iPhone video camera.  While the details of the videos are not recognizable, the movements and lights from the craft are visible on my footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my knowledge, there is no current man-made craft capable of maneuvering like the craft I watched.  What I saw is unlike anything that I have ever experienced in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus or Jupiter?  PD))<n>
7/17/10 00:00|New York City (Bronx) (Yankee Stadium)|NY|Changing|Above Yankee Stadium|I'm back with another report only this time I'm not confused.|7/19/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76636.html|249|ndxe201007| I&#39;m back with another report only this time I&#39;m not confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a Superintendant of a Residentual Building across the street from the Bronx Supreme Court and one block away from the Yankee Stadium.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My two nephiews and I were walked up to the roof to watch the amount of Yankee fans that came for the Old Timers Game.  Sure enough, as I last stated here back in July of (I think it was 1999), we witnessed them again, the first one appeared to us like fire directly above our heads it just spun around in a circular motion then just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second seemed like a star but it was too high up to say anything about it and was moving very rappidly also not in a steady motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third was astonishing. It was amazing but we were not surprised due to the fact we saw them before plenty of times just spending time up on roof-tops. It was close to the Supreme Court&#39;s roof just hovering straight across in a very slow-motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an oval egg-shaped like object, about the size of a full-sized van and an orange or fire like color to it with no shine or light, just creeping across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What got us was that about 3 minutes to the direction it headed towards there appeared to be a crime scene.  All of a sudden a Police helicopter flying in circles around the area and about 20 Police cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we saw a fourth heading towards the same direction but this one appeared to be white.   A fifth was coming behind him, this was to the left of us while the other to the right of us.  This one startled us a little because it was very close, seemed to be coming towards us at head level then it rose up at about 50 feet above our heads, this one was very clear to us.  It was definatley oval, saucer like, with two blue lights going around in circles on the top center of it.  The lights were not bright at all, perhaps they weren&#39;t lights.  It then changed shape, seemed like two legs came out the backside of it then it crumbled like liquid metal and again back to it&#39;s solid shape and headed to the same direction as the other four.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five minutes had past and the sixth appeared behind us this time above the Yankee Stadium heading straight towards our direction also at head level and slowly towards the last fives&#39; direction.  Then about two minutes later, five in a V shaped formation headed straight across the sky for about ten seconds and just vanished before our eyes, again towards the same direction as the last six before them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped wrighting to the National Ufo Reporting Center because I wasn&#39;t getting any answers.  I was going through a lot of great disturbing confusion and wanted to point the finger at all the wrong places.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instead I decided to ask, what ever I was looking at, for answers.  This is all I wanted to share for now, it makes no sence what-so-ever for me to dwell into this because the life experiences I have had lead me to believe and understand that folks all over the world will always be blinded by the truth and wouldn&#39;t believe it if these crafts were pointed out to them.  Yet a large amount of us believe and preach that there is a God but don&#39;t have enough faith to understand the huge fact that heaven is directly above our heads, in space, there are millions of angelic and demonic beings, or just normal like you and I, watching over us or just living their lives out there in different worlds.  We don&#39;t have all the answers as facts because we all need to find faith in order ! to get the answers we want or wait untill we die.  That&#39;s what makes us God&#39;s favorite creation, remember that we are a creation from above.  I searched for many answers during my first experiences and I found many answers with nobody&#39;s help.  There will be a time when they will reveil themselves to us with or without the approval of our so-called-leaders.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you believe what I am saying and search for aswers using faith from God then they have a special place for you.<n>

We saw a fireball? hot lava colored fireball orb like object rising from what appeared  to be the ground and coming toward us.  I had droped my camera or I could have gotten a good picture of it.  I didn&#39;t want to take my eyes off of it.  It seemed to have spike like objects coming out of it as it passed over the car.  I lost sight of it after it passed over the car.  It seemed quite large going over us.<n>

It was a light silver colored disc with a bottom that was about half the size of the craft. The half round bottom looked as though it may have been translucent (it&#39;s color was grayish and slightly opalescent.  When the craft passed over what was probably SeaTac airport, it became very, very bright and looked like a star.  But only roughly 6-7 seconds later, it dimmed again and we could still see it&#39;s disc/orb outline. We watched it as far as our eyes would allow for.  My daughter mentioned the uncanny lack of air traffic as this object moved over the airport area.   About two minutes after we could no longer see it, we saw a plane come from the airport area.  We did not observe the object come from the South; it seemed to just appear in the sky out of nowhere.  It was east of us when looking north.<n>

The computer is in front of the window.  The window was open.  I noticed a very bright object in the sky. I thought it was a plane on fire, heading towards the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First point of observation  The window faces Southeast and is 3’x3’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved from E to SE, horizontal with a slight ascending direction, just over the tree top, (tree is about 40’ high and about 100’ from window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was cylinder like, (side view of a plane, without the tail, no wings).  Using the size of the window, 3’x3’ as a reference and a piece of tape on the window to represent the object, the tape would be about 1 to 1 1/2  long, and 1/4 wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was  an orange-yellow-red liquid fire and was moving/flowing/changing within the cylinder.  It was very bright,  and had depth, as if you could see into it.  (It did not appear to be a flat surface, but a surface with depth)  There was no glow or halo around it and no trailing tail.  All the light was contained within the cylinder.  No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second point of observation  As the object neared the outer edge of the window, I went outside to continue observation.  (Retraced steps today and it takes approx. 45 secs. to get to where I was standing last night.)  The object was not where I thought it would be, instead, it was stationary and enlarged into a circle. (I thought the plane had exploded.  There was no sound and nothing falling from the circle.)  The light was contained within the circle, there was no halo and it was not as bright as the cylinder light.  There was still movement within the light.  The circle dimmed, brightened, dimmed again and then blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to the house and checked the time:  10:45 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Standing in the same place today, I noticed the size of the circle and location of the circle was almost in the same place as the (whole)  Moon was at 5:24 PM today .

7/16/10 22:12|Carter Lake|IA|Sphere|5 minutes|One brilliantly illuminating ball of light that float over our heads and shorty afterwards, vanished before our eyes.|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77273.html|255|ndxe201007| One brilliantly illuminating ball of light that float over our heads and shorty afterwards, vanished before our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 16, 2010, a few of my co-workers and I had just gone to lunch break at 22:00.  Down the street from where I work is a gas station/Subway and that particular night I bought my friend lunch.  We had just returned to the parking lot, we got out and my friend dropped the rear gate on the truck and we sat there to eat our lunch.  I was sitting there looking up at the Little Dipper constellation. We started talking about dreams that we’ve remembered or that had made a strong impression.  Right after I took a second bite of my sandwich, we all noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right above us, approximately 250 to 300 feet was this extremely bright object, spherical in shape. It was about the size of a soccer ball, as far I could tell.  I immediately called out to the others behind me. The object seemed to just float and was moving south east, but as it did so, it slowly zigzagged and even paused a couple times.  I observed this object for no more than 5 minutes, when suddenly it stopped moved moving.  It rotated and as it did so the light was turned off. It almost seemed like it had a shudder that rotated over the light. But just as the light went out, the object vanished right before our very eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four of us just stood there staring up at the sky in awe of what we had just witnessed.  The others tried to come up with some logical explanation as to what it was. I knew right away, that whatever it was, it was not made by humans.  One person said “maybe it was helicopter.” 	In 2000, shortly after I graduated, I joined the U.S. Army.  I went into the infantry and for the next three years of my life (2000-2003) I served as a parachute infantryman in the 1/501st Parachute Infantry Battalion, B co. I’ve been around quite a few aircraft, many different models both civilian and military.  So when I heard “it could have been a helicopter.” I stated “if that were a helicopter, why did it not make a sound?”  This thing was absolutely silent as it flew.  But mostly, what vehicles do you know of, that have the ability to just vanish before your very eyes.<n>

They were all floating in a straight, diagonal line.  Slowly, one by one the lights began to disappear until there was only one left.  Then, the lights all started to reappear one by one until there were 4 again.   All while this pattern was happening, the whole formation was moving downwards.  After watching it for about a minute, it eventually reached down to the earth but we couldn’t see it anymore as it was hid by the trees.  Every 5 seconds or so, a faint yellow light was seen behind the trees, as if the UFO had landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We know it can’t be planes or helicopters because planes do not flicker their lights on and off, they do not maintain this weird formation, and there is no runway near this location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lantern kites were also ruled out because like I said, they don’t just flicker on and off, and they were high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We can’t explain this unusual event, but I hope I’ve given enough information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few other witnesses in the parking lot also saw this scene.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The craft was not stil but it was moving fast.   As we contiued to stare at the object it did almost like a little dip and then started moving away until it faded and was completely gone.  The closes thing I can liken this sighting to is china UFO on 7-8-10 it was the same white light but without the huge tail or smoke that the Chinese UFO displayed.   What we saw was just the light with just a little glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

At first thinking it was lightning I pretty much dismissed it, but as I watched  it changed.  It started fluctuating in light color and brightness as if something was just on the inside of the cloud wall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached the south side of Spring Hill it was as if a hole opened in the cloud and a bright light shined through it.  It was long and cigar shaped.  As I continued to watch I started to see two of them.  They would go in and out of the cloud as if to use it for cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we got close to Hillsdale, KS my sister finally was able to catch a view of it.  We eventually pulled over at US Highway 169 and Kansas Highway 68 to watch it.  At one Point It appeared that there may have been as many as four with one being longer than the rest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cloud was a shelf cloud that traveled directly over the ! town of Paola, KS.<n>

There were no green or red lights, only a single star-like white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After turning to the south, the light dimmed and then made an abrupt turn to the north and brightened to about 1 magnitude or brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object began a series of acrobatic maneuvers that an airplane could not perform.  It reversed direction almost instantly, swooped down very rapidly, and climbed just as quickly.  This pattern of movement continued during the entire episode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although the object seemed to stay in one part of the sky, it slowly drifted toward the east and finally disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for about 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While observing the strange motions, I saw an early-morning jogger come by and pointed out the object to him.

It didn’t make a sound at all and was flying so low that we thought it was going to hit our house.   It was a triangle shape and had a few lights on it.  A white light and two red slow blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after this flew out of sight, we noticed another one of these aircrafts flying towards us.

There was a darker center to this object.  Size wise, the object would be more comparable to the size of the moon than to any stars from our perspective on Earth and much larger than any meteor I have seen.   It was about the size that a dime looks when extending your arm fully and looking up at it.  It was closer to the ground than a plane would be flying, but higher than a bird would be flying in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not at all comparable to fireworks, remote controlled airplanes, etc.  It had an orange glow emitting from it which looked almost like fire does, although I could see no flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved toward the Northern sky and disappeared out of sight.  At first the glowing object was stationary but then it started moving.  The flight pattern was mostly horizontal, although it did rise straight up and go straight down twice and it moved diagonally in the sky once.  This all happened in a matter of 30 - 45 seconds if not longer I would guess.  It was much quicker than a plane would be viewed moving in the sky, although it did hesitate a few times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no sounds associated with this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness:  I was the only witness to this at my location and did not have a camera or video recorder on me.  I am a 20-something year old college graduate with some emphasis on geology and astronomy.  There are no drugs, alcohol, or mental illnesses involved.<n>

Then it would stand still. At first a single light then it seemed as if a plethora of lights came from it.  The other witnesses saw it and we are not a thousand percent sure what it was, but it moved like nothing I have ever seen.  It would stop suddenly in the middle of its movement and then proceed faster than before.  It was amazing to see for the first time and just incredible movement.  If it were a aircraft it had to be one of the newest craft.  I&#39;ve never seen anything do this.  It was simply incredible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was planning on using a good colorfull shot of the moon coming out of the eclipse, for  use on my laptop as wallpaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used my camera&#39;s tripod to get a good steady picture.  I took the camera&#39;s flash card &amp; downloaded the photos to my laptop &amp; pulled up the 1st photo when I noticed something there that I did not notice while tsking the shot! I could see a triangle of 3 white lights to the left &amp; below the moon.  I thought it was most likely an aircraft except that there was no bluring of the image indicating movement! I decided to use the available imaging software to enlarge &amp; enhance the image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my astonishment as I slowly enlarged the image, it became some kind of vehicle like I had never seen before. It was actualy a sphere with two apparent round apperatures/windows attached to a long cylindrical body that ended with three long angular arms with a light on each arm! I showed the photo images to my wife &amp; eventualy family members &amp; various friends!  My son recommended that I send copies to the newspaper &amp; Mufon. I sent an E-Mail to our paper The Seattle Times offering to send them a DVD copy. They did not respond at all. I contacted Mufon on line &amp; received a response from one of their local reps who asked me to foreward the DVD to him.  I then received an e-mail multipage inquiry directly from Mufon&#39;s headquarters that included a multitude of related questions to my sighting. The questions were so lengthy &amp; repetitious &amp; un-related that I just gave up trying to finish them &amp; just closed the site down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not attempted to go any further with this siteing report untill now, as I was watching a History Channel special about UFO&#39;s!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It seemed to have a red light at its core with yellow lights blinking in sequence on the outside.  After a couple of minutes, a second identical light pattern emerged from the first one and began erratic flight patterns around the first one which seemed to stay in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After performing maneuvers impossible for an aircraft to achieve (moving straight up and down vertically and laterally with the pattern of lights remaining the same), both craft departed in different directions before we lost sight of them in the darkness.<n>

PD))|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77088.html|277|ndxe201007| Close up encounter with an object that was translucent, low luminance, floating<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had already been seeing strange craft in the sky and purchased a camera to document my sightings.  I have pictures of a few of these crafts but not the one that I&#39;m reporting.  I was standing out in my driveway looking up at the night sky. Looking, constantly looking for something unusual.  After about 2 hours of staring at the stars, I finally decided to go back inside my home.  After I walked up to my front door, I opened the storm door and then turned around once more to look into the sky. When I fist noticed it, I wanted to freak out.  There it was an object floating in on a direct path, It didn&#39;t move side to side or volley up and down. It moved as if though it had a mission or purpose. I was nervous, and scared,  So afraid in fact that I could feel my knees buckling. I guess because I didn&#39;t know what to expect and I wanted to act non aggressive. I though that I was either going to be taken, blasted into nothing, or become part of this things menu. So I! wanted whatever or whoever was propelling this thing to know that I am not a threat. As It approached from the North sky,  It floated down into my yard just above the tree in the center of my yard. Then it lowered itself approximately 7 to 10 feet above my head and stopped for approximately 5 to 7 seconds then proceeded forward ascending above my rooftop. As it was leaving I yelled out &#34;What are You.&#34; it never made a sound, not one sound. It was an unusual color.  A low intensity pinkist to violet light, that was almost hypnotic to look at. When I first noticed it all that could be seen was the front. As it came closer I noticed that it&#39;s body was approximately 20 to 30 feet in length. The body looked as if though it was filled with fluid color. It had no wings. the body also had no real width (I mean that it appeared that nothing living could occupy that space). approximately 1 foot in width, but the front was enormous compared to the body 4 to 5 feet in width. There were! windows or slits in the front that were slanted in opposite d! irection s and were also illuminated. As it elevated higher to clear my house and the trees in the back yard its speed never accelerated. I would guess that it&#39;s speed was approximately 10 to 15 miles per hour until it was out of sight. It should also be mentioned that I attempted to get video of all of this, but upon uploading my camera videos to my computer I noticed that I had nothing. I pushed record my battery was charged and had worked with all other encounters, but not this one. After I went inside I told everyone about this encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Then moving away slowly, over NW Los Angeles County<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the 9 pm hour noticed a particularly bright white light in western sky.  It was strange because it was a hazy night, and no stars or planets were visible, as it was not a clear enough evening.  Not only was this visible, but it was exceptionally bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was stationary, and high in the sky.  I showed my wife who also thought it was strange, because no stars could be seen, but this could.  I decided to stand on my porch with binoculars and look closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to make out any discernible shape, because the white light was too bright.  But it was just sitting still in the sky.  No aviation lights blinking of any kind.  No detectable movement.  It was definitely not a helicopter, or plane.  I watched commercial planes fly by it, and sometimes under it, on their approach to LAX and Burbank airports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mad sure not to move my position on my porch, so that I could keep the lights position in perspective against the visual landmarks I was comparing its position too.  It remained still, lined up in the same spot and  not moving. I judged this by relating it&#39;s position to a palm tree, and telephone lines in my line of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hard to judge how far away it was, because I don&#39;t know how big it was.  It definitely wasn&#39;t close by.  I would guess hovering somewhere between Woodland Hills and Malibu, CA, both due west of my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 mins I was ready to give up, having decided it simply must be a very bright viewing of Venus or something, when it suddenly (albeit slowly) started moving to the north and further away (out towards the ocean, maybe near Thousand Oaks, CA).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched closely, and had my wife join me.  She had been checking it&#39;s location from time to time, during the half hour.  She completely agreed that it had moved significantly off the spot it had hovered, completely still in, and was moving away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt that it also seemed less bright, and possibly even a slightly orange hue, during its exiting the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually it was out of our view.  Too far gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have no explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was in charge of cleaning and closing up the store.  It was getting close to closing time when I went out back to take out the garbage.   On my way back into the store I saw 3 strange red lights flying north above LaGrange road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was one giant craft in the shape of a triangle.  But I waited for the formation to pass under some stars, and when the stars didn’t black out like I had expected, I realized that it was 3 craft flying synchronized in a triangle formation.  I knew what I was seeing because I’d seen the videos before and watched some UFO documentaries.  I may not necessarily believe in aliens, but I knew what I was seeing was unexplained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately ran inside to grab any witness I could.  I was shouting, “Hurry, It’s a UFO come on!  It’s those ones you see on TV!”  Only my co-worker ((male name deleted)) came out to see. He recognized the formation too and tried to record it on his iPhone, but it was dark and! nothing showed up on the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another co-worker of ours came out too, but by then 2 of the 3 red lights had faded away, so it didn’t seem like anything extraordinary to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I resumed closing up the store.  I was quite shaken up and even told some customers about what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes later, I was outside again taking more garbage out, when I saw 2 more red.  These 2 lights weren’t flying in any formation and they were flying much faster than the first 3 I had seen.  They were traveling the same route:  North up LaGrange road curving East over I-80.  It seemed as though the 2 were trying to catch up to the other 3 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I went home, I stopped at the BP gas station located at LaGrange and 191st st.  There were to Mokena police officers in there, and I was so shocked by what I had seen, I even had the nerve to ask the police officers if they had heard about any UFO sightings, at the risk of sounding crazy. They didn’t hear anything and I did get the feeling they thought I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later found out that there happened to be multiple famous UFO sightings really close by in Tinley Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m only now reporting this because I had recently been watching a documentary that put a few more pieces together for me, and I hope this information may be able to do the same for someone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It wasn&#39;t going very fast, and it was close enough to the earth to see detail. It reminded me of an arrowhead in shape; it had three points, a light orange light on each point, and the back end of the craft bowed inward between the two end points.  I rolled down my window but could not detect a noise.  The craft had no noticeable markings and seemed to be made of metal, which was a medium gray. It was not shiny; the outside of the craft had a dull finish to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my husband and I watched it as it continued straight, then made a ninety-degree sudden turn to the left. It suddenly started flying off toward the distance at a much faster pace than it had been going, and it was soon out of sight. My husband and I were talking about what we&#39;d seen when a U.S. Plane that looked like a jet came from the direction that the other aircraft had come from. This plane was loud, fast, and a dark gray to black in color. Where the UFO had made a ninety-degree turn, the new plane turned as well, although it didn&#39;t turn as sharply or as quickly as the other craft had. It followed the trail that the other aircraft had made, zooming out of sight in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if someone else saw this craft in action that day. It was about two in the afternoon in the middle of summer, and the route the air crafts took was along the same route of a popular road in our hometown. This craft was very large and like nothing I had ever seen before, so it was bound to gather attention. I did not hear anything about this craft from anyone else whether through word-of-mouth or media afterwards, although I did look out for more information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There were two or more bright blue lights and it was glowing slightly.  I saw it really close to the freeway (way too close for it to be an airplane), but suddenly I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.

My deck faces north east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just to the left of my deck I have a tree on my property.

During the time the dog was urinating a small sky blue glowing sphere, about 8-9 inches in diameter, came around from the rear of my garage.  It proceeded toward us.  I was standing in the door holding it open for my dog.  It stopped abruptly and paused a couple of seconds, then blinked out.  It simply, suddenly, disappeared.  The dog was finished just then and I rushed him in the house and locked the door.  The dogs back was toward the orb and he did not see it. It was totally silent.  I peeked out the curtains and did not see anything at all.  While it was paused, I noticed that it&#39;s glow was reflecting off of my garage siding.  Our garage is separate from our house and there is a grape arbor about 12 feet away from the side of th! e garage.  It flew between the garage and the grape arbor.

We were out star gazing on a very clear night, when we noticed a strange light out of the corner of our eye.  It flashed exactly every 1.5 seconds and encompassed the whole of the northeastern sky.  Reports claim no northern lights or solar flares occurred until two weeks after the incident.  There are also no radio towers in the area, only national forest.  The light was faint, but continued for more than 30 minutes.  There is an airport about 10 miles south, and the tower light is sometimes visible, but that light swept every 3 seconds.  I have been vacationing here for over 20yrs and have never seen anything like this.

I have seen this phenomenon 5 times by myself over the past two months.  It does not occur every night. It always seems to be around 11:15 pm.  I called my husband and my eldest daughter to see it one other night.  The one time there was only one in the sky my daughter said she thought it was a geo satellite.  Each other time there have been only one or two of these lights in the sky.  They flash red, green, and white and are very high up in the sky.  They do not look like stars because the stars stay white and these flash the colors.  I have driven the area where I have often seen them looking for cell phone towers or RCMP communication towers and there are none in the area where they appear.  The objects are also too high in the sky to be on a tower.  They are too far apart and appeared in the NE part of the sky, SW part and the due W part of the sky.  So it can&#39;t be kids playing with balloons or anything l! ike that.  Besides balloons float upward and these stay stationary and only once have I saw one move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight I saw the one very bright one and thought, it&#39;s back.  I smiled.  I noticed another one.  Then I saw a white light appear and flash very bright it appeared to be three times bigger than the stars nearby and then just disappear just near that bright one that had the flashing lights.  I called my husband.  He came out to see.  We counted eight of them in the sky in various areas.  My husband watched one move very fast and then seemingly disappear. He IS NOT a believer in UFO&#39;s.  I asked him if he thought small time Regina was so exciting that ANY government in their right mind would place 8 satellites overhead this often to observe US.  The google earth image stays daylight and had summer images in the winter time.  See I don&#39;t think we are THAT big of a priority here.  We do not have any special industries.  I just feel that we are NOT a likely target of any sort of massive government interest.  I called my mother in law and asked her to step out onto her balcony from! her place.  She did and she saw them too.  I said alright so it is now confirmed by some people other than me.  I am the only believer and both of you have seen them.  My youngest daughter and her cousin went outside to see what we were up to and they saw them too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still in the sky at 12:39 pm.  The one that flashed the bright light has not reappeared and there are NO stars where it was when it flashed.  Regina does not typically have more than two commercial passenger airplanes at the airport at one time.  WE ONLY HAVE FOUR GATES IN our AIRPORT and only two luggage conveyors.  So it does not make sense that we would have 8 objects flashing red, green and white lights in our skies that sort of sit stationary for the most part and then move really rapidly once in a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night I tried to take a video or a picture of the brightest object assuming it was the closest to me but it did not show up on my camera as it must be too far away.  Perhaps my camera is just not good enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights have now disappeared.  ALL OF THEM.   It is now 1:03am.<n>

At first, I thought it was a weather light then the pulsating stopped and became somewhat constant except for a subtly changing glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The circumference of the illumination would grow and shrink.  There also appeared to be dark cloud-like forms (some were cigar shaped, some shadows changed size &amp; shape) shifting and moving around outside of the halo.   At least ten times these shadow forms moved fast in front of the glow, completely eliminating the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Twice, I heard a plane in the sky and during that time the glow &amp; shadows became very active.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be a seemingly quite credible source.

It was toward the northern sky but more centrally located from all four directions.  My daughter and husband saw it before I did and they reported more activity than I witnessed.  What I saw was a circular blueish-white light that had dark, changing shapes passing in and out of it.<n>

It appeared in the SSE sky,   In a major landing path For Pearson International Airport.  The total visible time of the blue fireball was 1 second or less.  The fireball left some sort of cloud/chem trail that I observed from 2244hrs until 2302hrs.  The cloud/chem trail was at first whitish, not very long in length,and then changed color to orange,   And then streched to 6 times bigger then first left.  I timed it after the sighting.It was a clear night in southern Ontario.I seen the weather satillite image on the news(and the sky with my own eyes).  What I thought was weird and could possibly back up my sighting was that the airplanes waiting to land at PIA,stopped circling in the west sky and started circling over lake Ontario.  The time I noticed that the planes changed their landing pattern! was 2254hrs.If this helps.<n>

At this time a bright, blue toned light caught our eyes, in the Eastern sky moving from North to South.  The object was about 10-15 degrees above the eastern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving very fast, much faster than a conventional craft and traversed the eastern horizon in about 20 to 30 seconds max.  It was a solid bright light, no blinking lights, no trail, seemed to move a bit erratically on path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought at first it could be the ISS, or another prominent satellite but I checked fly overs, times, and directions of fly overs and none of them added up to our sighting.  The only visble fly over at that time and date for my area would be the Genesis II, which would have been to our backs, not ahead of us in the Eastern sky.<n>

I lived on the third floor,The ship was about the size of an egg and shaped like one, it was gold with 5 black  stripes grayish wind screen. They were looking at me through what appeared to be a wrap around picture screen They did not wave or make any movements, I never saw their hands, they stood side by side. The third one on my right suddenly turned to it&#39;s left and they shoot off to my right. There was a stairway 20 feet in front of them when they took off and they dodge it in the nick of time and headed off towards the west! The craft made no noise or had any kind of flame shooting out of it! But it made a gold colored trail as it flew away! I made a drawing right after they left. I would describe them but wouldn&#39;t believe me!<n>

It had more of a gray metallic look, and there seemed to be no wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened rather fast and when I wanted to try to study it more the train passed a few buildings that blocked my view, and when the train passed the buildings, it was gone.<n>

A car had sped past me and I had sped up to 110mph to catch up with him and the other cars.  The drivers around me had taken notice as I was able to see their faces off of the interior lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They slowed and I seen one pointing, the object began to disappear more and more until it was barely visible then vanished.  A couple of minutes later, there were four air crafts with blinking lights that were floating around where the UFO had traveled.  I noticed one to my left at first then another one was flying toward him underneath.  There was also one ahead of us and above.  This did occur near a airfield but the initial craft that caught my attention was unlike that I had ever seen in person, the pulsating lights left me dumbfounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The teenager from the pool continued to explain the lights to the parents as the older brother started back into the house screaming he’d seen a UFO.  Neither had heard the others description but both accounts were the same.  They’d saw multi colored lights on a circular object with load wind swishing sounds.  They said it wasn’t huge; it looked smaller than they would have thought a UFO would be.<n>

I looked over and saw some fairly bright yellow lights in a triangle formation.  They were about the size of airplanes but much higher in the sky and they were only flickering, not blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled the car over to the right side of the road and I grabbed my camera to take a picture but just as a snapped the shot, they moved out of the triangle formation and into a horizontal line and began traveling southward very slowly.  That&#39;s when I switched to video-mode.  I stopped filming after a while because they didn&#39;t seem to be doing anything exciting and I figured they were just going to keep flying at that same slow speed until they made it over the mountains about 12 miles south of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back on the road and kept driving and immediately saw another light in the other direction (Southern Sky) that was much bigger and brighter than the first three and appeared to be hovering right over the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We passed by a patch of trees at that point which blocked our view of that second light and I mentioned to my boyfriend that maybe it was just an airplane tower at the top of the hill and that we were just seeing the light on the top of it.  But as soon as we passed all of the trees, that light has disappeared!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This freaked me out and made me wonder if the original ones were still there or had just disappeared too so I turned around to check and I saw them spiral together and disappear!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are attempting to reach the source of the report, in order to gain more information about the sighting.

The weather is clear, and stars are visable.  I thought the stars might be out as it looked like it would be a clear night, so I went out on the porch to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a very bright, white star very low to the earth in the west, it was just above the trees and about 1000 feet away from where I was standing.  It was hovering in one spot over our marsh in the west.  I went to get the binoculars and went down stairs and outside to get a better look at it as stars are never that low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked and saw bright lights around it&#39;s rim, it had what could be described as feelers protruding from the edges of it.  It was oval pie shaped and danced in one place, tilting up and then down, like if I held a pie tin oval shaped with a point down and then back up level so the pie would not fall out.  The lights danced and dimmed and brightened.  One bright, white, light beam seemed to be directed my way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the lights change color to red but it was muted in tone, soft like, barely noticeable.  By about 10:25 it no longer showed itself.  The funny thing is the west was totally dark as if no stars in the west at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was quite excited to see something so unusual.  I wondered about it.  What is it?  What is it doing over our marsh?  Where did it come from?  Earlier this evening (about 8:00PM) the satellite dish had some interference and did not work.  I called the internet dish company and there was an overload of callers with the same trouble.  I called both the Wausaukee police and the Crivitz police.  I left a message for the Crivitz police chief.<n>

After throwing the valve, I looked up at the night sky and saw an amazing array of lights moving from the southwest to the northeast over our neighbor’s alfalfa field, approximately 400 yds away and only 100 to 200 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four things struck me at once:  this thing was HUGE, slow, low and absolutely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw six white lights in a straight horizontal line, plus there was one blinking, smaller red light above the far-right light.  At my relatively close range, I estimated the thing at two to three football fields wide.  I’ve never seen anything flying remotely as big as this, in my life, or heard of any plane so large.  The whole array was moving very slowly, maybe 15-30 mph.  I had the feeling I was looking at the trailing edge of a huge wing, or perhaps the edge of a disc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved slowly along its trajectory, headed towards town, where there is an airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought:  &#34;If this is a plane coming in to land, it’s gigantic, must be some secret government job, but why is it silent and illegally (and dangerously) low?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved along,  the bulk of my barn blocked it out, so I walked rapidly to the other side of the barn, towards town, and there it was again, following its course, and I watched it disappear over the hill, with no change in the light array.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very quiet, very low, very slow, VERY large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I told my brother about it, and he told his son, who happened to see the same thing, with eight witnesses, 15 minutes after I did.  My nephew only saw four white lights in horizontal array, and guessed it was two craft flying in formation, but like me, wondered why they were so low, so slow, and dead silent.  He said they seemed to meet up with another, smaller, moving, bluish-colored light, and then turned from their course and moved towards the southeast and that when they did, super-bright lights flashed for an instant, like a prism turning, and then they moved slowly out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hold ((deleted)) degrees in ((deleted--arts and sciences)), including ((deleted--multiple degrees)) from the University of ((deleted)), and a ((deleted--advanced degree from prestigious overseas university)).   I have never seen anything like this in my life; it took me aback for an instant, but then I rapidly started to catalog and process what I was seeing.  I have an open mind towards unusual phenomena, and believe that the unexplained represents a major frontier for science.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For what it’s worth, I live within 10 miles of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, now undergoing cleanup, where eight or nine deactivated plutonium production reactors, and one live power-generating reactor, sit in a row along the Columbia River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On another front, the first crop circle in the USA occurred within 5 miles of my house, and very near the flight path of whatever it was I saw.<n>

I kept watching it for a couple of minutes and it appeared to not be moving.  It was very bright.  I mentioned it to my husband to see what he thought about it and he also saw it.  I had my camera in my hand (as is my habit when I’m on vacation) and started snapping pictures through the front windshield.  As we got into Victor, we turned and were rerouted because they had the road closed temporarily (we were headed to the Grand Targhee ski resort to ride the lift)…when we finally got free of the trees and buildings, they were gone!  We texted our friends to see if they had also seen the ‘ufo’, but they had not seen it.   When we got back to the cabin that evening and uploaded the pix on our friends computer we were surprised to se! e that what appeared as ‘rods’ were actually double lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife and I were travelling home from Hot Sulphur Springs, CO to Aurora, CO. While on US Highway 40, it was a cold and rainy day. We had past Winter Park, CO, when I began to take pictures because it was a beatuiful scenery of the cloudy mountain tops. This had happened for just a second.  Through my camera lens, Samsung SL620, I witnessed between mountains through the clouds a gigantic metallic silver building-like top and clicked the snap button.  I shouted to my wife, “Did you see that?!“   But she said “I am driving and watching the road.“  After that she asked me what had happened, but I thought that I had seen a hallucination because looking back at that spot there was nothing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left everything at that. But in my head left an uncertaintey of what was really there. My son put all the pictures into our computer.  Time by time i remembered that moment and looked at the photo. It had been more than a year past.  On the eve of my 47th birthday, I couldn‘t take it anymore so I zoomed in on the photograph on my computer screen.  I called over my wife and son and asked if either of them saw anything unusual on that picture.  They saw the same thing as me.  A huge object in the upper-left hand side of the picture.  So it seems to me that I have yet to go crazy.  We talked it over and decided to send this photo to you guys.  According to the picture it is easy to figure out at what portion of the US highway 40 the picture was taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With regards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date above has been amended, in order to reflect a date in July 2010.

It was mostly white with a little trace of red on one side. It was way bigger than any star or planet or plane I had ever seen.  It wasn’t blinking, and it didn’t appear to be moving.   It stayed in one spot low in the horizon; I’d say about twenty five to thirty degrees up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Baffled, I called my husband who was at home fifteen miles away in Springbrook, WI.  I asked him to step outside and tell me what the big object in the sky was.  When he asked me the direction, I replied, &#34;Don’t worry, you will know when you see it.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It only took a few seconds to see what I was talking about. I asked him, &#34;What is it?&#34;  He replied, &#34;I don’t know.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived at home, he was still in our yard watching it through a brake in the tree line.  We watched for about 5 seconds, and then it dipped down and to the right about an inch in a swooping motion.  I gasped, completely shocked, &#34;Did that just move?!?!?!?&#34;  My husband replied, “Yeah, it’s been moving the whole time.”  We stood and watched this thing bounce around and move.  It dipped and dived and moved in small circles, almost as if we were watching someone flying a kite with a light on top of it, a kite you could see 20 miles away, with no wind.  Several times we had to move a few steps left or right because it would move behind the tops of the pine trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called our friend Dan who lives 8 miles west of us in Trego, WI.  When he stepped outside, he was stunned. When I was sure that we were not the only ones who could see it. I called 911.  I couldn’t be sure that whatever it was, it wasn’t dangerous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 11:00 it seemed to start heading down in the western horizon and it got gradually smaller, like it was going away from us. At 11:05, we couldn’t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night and we could see hundreds of stars and satellites, and even an airplane flew by.  But none of them moved or looked like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really wish I knew a good solid explanation of what the thing was, and every night, I keep my eyes open to see if it comes back.<n>

I could see it immediately.  I took 200 pictures over the next 2 hours of it.  It sometimes looks like a sphere or circle and other times more of a hexagon.  On manual focus I could see it pulsating and it looks as if something in jumping around inside it.  It is colorful but so bright that it looks white.  I was able to see it&#39;s movement by extending the shutter speed.  Each time it formed a different unique pattern in the sky.  It seemed to get closer and farther away.  My niece was with me this time and she saw it too.  It frightened her.  I felt no fear at all. I would love to send my pictures to someone to be analyzed or compared with others who have seen this.  I have never had an encounter before July 8th.<n>

There were about three dark objects on the right and about 5-7 objects on the left of the freeway.  They did not have any lights.  The first 1 or 2 we saw we thought  were clouds, but then realized there were many more &amp; they appeared to be descending and moving at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In looking closer they appeared to look like parachutes. Soon after that, however, we realized that assumption was impossible.  First of all, the objects were traveling at an impossibly fast speed.  Even though we were driving on the freeway, they continued to pull further and further away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another reason that these objects could not have been parachutes was because they never came close to the ground.  Eventually, it seemed that some split off the the right of the freeway towards our house, and some went to the left of the freeway toward the Van Nuys area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we got off the freeway, we started to go up the hill that we live on, and I continued to look for any sign of the objects.  That was when I saw an extremely large hovering, triangular shaped, flat craft above the mountain.  Again, it had no lights, but this time, it was motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home, I looked outside, but at that point, the object was either gone or out of sight.<n>

We saw a bright one come from the west to the east and disappear just east of directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As our friends were getting into their car to leave we saw another light come from the south west headed north. We asked them to hurry up and look because this one was lower in the sky than the others we showed them were.  When the light was west of us for the heck of it I flashed my light at it twice.  I got an immediate response of a flash from this light. It went from a normal star sized light to almost a headlight sized light but very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife immediately asked me to try it again and immediately it flashed again.  The time from the first flash to the second was no more than 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed still in that same place for another 5 minutes and then it just vanished.  It was a little lower and west of The Big Dipper.  I never thought I&#39;d get a response from the light.  I just did it for the heck of it.  It flipped everyone out when it responded, not once but twice.  I&#39;d sure like to know what the heck it was.<n>

The object had a translucent faint orange/gold semi v-shaped leading edge and was shaped similar to a flying wing type aircraft only much, much larger with a transparent look to it.  The object moved in a straight line from roughly east to west, making no sound, and traversed the entire visible sky in less than 30 seconds.  I am very familiar with all types of conventional aircraft having been a plane enthusiast for over 30 years, and this object fit no description of anything I have ever seen.   It had no marker lights and was much too large and fast to be any ordinary aircraft.  Its absolutely straight course, translucent appearance and color, and its shape and immense size would discount the possibility of it being a searchlight, reflection, or other easily explainable source.<n>

It all started around the Mormon Handcart Pageant.  I know I put a date for the event but I actually couldn’t remember the day. I know it happened in July 2010 at around 10 to 11 pm. Now, to the story. It was near the river scene and I was on my break.  I went up to a deck where people cross to sit on the bleachers.  No one of course crossed it because they were watching the pageant.  I looked up at the sky.  It was clear and filled with stars. But suddenly I looked to westward at the sky.  An orange oval object appeared. It was wavy and some parts glowed yellow.  To me it looked like it was on fire.  The object went to fast for a plane but seemed the like the source was also smaller than the plane and the glow made it seem bigger.  I watched the object float or fly across the sky. No one was watching and I didn’t make a sound.  You know how objects seem to go around up past mountains because the earth is round.  Well the object d! idn’t seem to do that. As if it broke laws of physics. I watched it go towards Mt Nebo.  But it seemed to me that it passed it already but I could still see it.  Like it went higher at a steady angle as if I was now looking at the back of the ship. The light started to dim and started to get harder to see. But suddenly it grew and grew brighter and brighter then it disappeared then BAM. There was no sound but a flash of yellow white light showed up of where the object was.  And then it was gone. I was stunned at the event. So you see the object didn’t seem to be on earth or in its atmosphere but out in space. Time passed and I spent time thinking about it. I think it was a space ship or “UFO” but it was in space and something happened to it. And it traveled through a worm hole then traveled some more then prepared to do another worm hole then launched again. To me it seemed damaged.  I hope you believe me. I know this happened.<n>

The object was metallic, unlike an airplane but of similar size to a small plane. It was also illuminated by lights (non-blinking) and traveled at very high speeds. We observed briefly believing the trajectory and speed meant it was about to crash but realized it never did and disappeared once dipping below tree top distance into a wooded area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area where this was observed is within 1.5 miles from our home and one we are very familiar with. In addition, both my wife and I are very familiar with small private planes and military aircraft that use local airports.  This object was distinctly different and beyond our ability to explain.  The only other explanation we can offer is perhaps it was some form of unmanned drone from the local airport although it did not appear to be a plane and did not contain blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I are long term residents of the area, in our late 40&#39;s, and I am a former criminal investigator but would like to avoid public knowledge and any ridicule from the reporting of this event.<n>

7/11/10 21:45|Taneytown|MD|Light|1 hour|I noticed that the stars didn’t seem right. There was an unusual pattern.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a star or planet?  PD))|7/19/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76451.html|354|ndxe201007| Last night (7/10), technically early this morning (7/11) around 1 am, I noticed that the stars didn’t seem right. There was an unusual swoosh pattern, a large swoosh pattern.  The “stars” in the swoosh pattern were blinking in a sort of Morse Code way, as if they were talking to each other.  I went outside a few times until almost 2 am and they were still out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight (7/11) around 9:30pm  I went outside to smoke a cigarette and I saw a bright light above, as I looked up it dimmed greatly and blended in with the stars, that’s when I noticed it was moving fast across the sky, too fast to be a plane and too high.  I made my boyfriend come out and look. He also saw it, it went over my house so I did not see where it went.  I watched the sky and off in the distance over the houses across the street I spotted another one, blending in with the stars, I watched it – every “star” it passed brightened as it was passing it and dimmed again after it passed, I watched it until it disappeared - my boyfriend came out and saw it right before it disapeared.  Since there are street lights out front it was kind of hard to see, so I went out back (about 9:45pm) and kept looking up in the sky.  As I was looking at the stars, suddenly one started moving across the sky and as it was headed straight for another “star”, that star shifted right and let it! go by then it moved back into place. Another “star” that it passed started moving in the opposite direction.  There were greenish light streaks moving a little ways to the left of it.  I watched all of them until they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then around 10:15pm I went out front again and saw yet another one moving across the sky, it did a zigzag then went straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each one of these things were visible for under 5 minutes each before they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is now 12:22 am and I have gone out several times since then and have not seen them again.  I will keep looking and if I see them any more tonight I will post again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else reads this and sees the same thing please post it.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a star or planet?  PD))<n>

I have seen thousands of planes, satellites and shooting stars over the decades but this was different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright white light, with no running lights such as red/green etc.  It was brighter than a plane lights, but what was unusual was it was a light that was whiter than white bordering a chrome color.  It was only going a hundred MPH or so, and only a few thousand feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My opinion was the object was a glowing light, not an intense light attached to the object.  The object was not coming towards me so I can rule out landing lights, which are never this white anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watched for two minutes until object dissappeared behind some trees.  No sound, fading or unusual movements observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor Note: The object was observed on Sunday, July 11, 2010, Not July 10th.  I am resending this report to you with corrected date.<n>

Approx two minutes later another large bright light decended from a Westerly direction.  It was coming toward the earth and it grew larger and brighter very quickly.  So much so that I was nervous that it might strike the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had no shape we could see just a very bright light that was similar in size and brightness to the ISS that had just gone past minutes earlier (from a WNW direction.)   This object was as bright if not brighter than the ISS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly it switched direction back out into space and faded very very quickly and finally dissapeared out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it was not a metorite or other debris burning up because of this change in direction.  I know it was not the ISS as that had just passed two minutes prior to seeing this.  I know it was not a satellite passing by as we have seen those many many times before.  This was not any of these things and both my husband and I  witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for looking into it as we are curious as to what it was.<n>

Our backyard is pretty dark and we can see all the stars at night.  I looked over to the northwestern skyline an noticed a very bright object hovering but slowly moving to the right and forward and then backward?.  The object was very bright and triangular shaped.  Then disappeared beneath the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 25-30 minutes later, my husband went out to see if the object had reappeared.  He yelled for me to come out and take a look.  The object was now moving in an unusual eratic almost zigzag form flying southeast.  We noticed 3 redish orange lights and then disappeared.  I have to say we are both feeling quite dumbfounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the object disappeared from the southwest was what looked to be a star moving in the same direction as the object and then also disappeared.   There was no sound, no lights blinking.  This was not an airplane or helicopter and I&#39;m certain it wasn&#39;t a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We don&#39;! t have too much knowledge on the unmanned military aircraft which I guess could be a possible.  This was by far the oddest thing we both have ever witnessed in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We were sitting in our chairs facing south.  To the south/southwest she noticed a big shing light.  At first we thought it might be a satelite, but after further inspection, there is no way it&#39;s a satellite.  It was not a helicopter or plane either. We noticed numerour helicopters going to the area it was in, one at a time.  I do not know if they could see it.  We took pictures &amp; a short video (a little dark though).  It was a pretty good night to see the stars, but this light was not nearly high enough to be a star.  Plus it had a cleary visible haze around it.  I would be suprised if no one reports this.......it was THAT noticable &amp; unusual.  I do not know if it was &#34;alien&#34;, but it is definately &#34;unidentifiable&#34; to me, making it a U.F.O. for just that reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> C-<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus.

The right of where we were is over Boeing Field. I didn&#39;t drive onto the freeway because these objects were directly over the freeway. The persons in the vehicle with me were telling me to call 911 but what do I say? Officer theres ufo&#39;s over the freeway. Just then I sat on the side of the freeway watching these objects for a total of about 13 to 14 minutes. Then once all 13 objects hovered together it looked as though they were making signes in the sky.I called a friend to tell him what I and the other two people were watching. One of the people in my car said another vehicle pulled over behind us and was watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I saw all 13 objects shoot straight into the sky I waited a few minutes to drive because I didn&#39;t want to drive under those objects. Once a few minutes went by and I felt ok to drive I got on the freeway Interstate I-5 South as the direction my car was facing, I told the people in the vehicle with me to please keep looking up. Within less then a minute they yelled at the TOP OF THERE LUNGS!!! These 2 object one directly over my car and the other to the left of my car. I yelled at the people in my car to shut up!!!  But they wouldn&#39;t stop yelling SO I YELLED SHUT UP AGAIN!!! As I looked up this object was about 20 feet from the top of my car... I was looking at a UFO through my moonroof. Once I got to the next exit there was a SHERIFF driving onto the freeway Interstate I-5 North so I quess there must have been alot of calles to the police station because I heard alot of sirons going off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Because of the distance no detail of the object could be seen but it was stationary and the flashing was very bright and had no distinct pattern as it flashed at random.   The object seemed to at first to be moving higher in the sky and drifting I think in what may be North direction. At this time we debated and rationalized that if it could be a Mylar helium balloon and the sun would reflect off of it as it turned creating the bright flash of lights as it turned into the sun that was starting to set in the west.   Then it got a little more interesting as it started moving ( Drifting)  at a more rapid speed in a completely different direction at first moving closer to us and the! n moving what I think was east.  It made no noise had no characteristics of an aircraft that we could define.  We do not know what it was we saw but  if it was in fact a balloon its behavior was indeed unusual and the  brightness of the flashing seemed too strong and bright to be reflective.   The object moved farther and farther away until we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Some crafts were in a tight formation while other crafts were spread out.  From what I can see, they were too high to be birds and too big to be balloons.  If they were white balloons, they should of been moving south because the wind was blowing from the north this evening at around 10 knots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a one time occurance in my area.  I usually see one or two during my weekend afternoons when I am usually working on my garden, but never thought of reporting it due to the fact that I don&#39;t know what it is.  But this time it was different, I saw 27-30 of this unusual craft moving overhead and the frequency of siting is increasing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am at a close proximity to Oakland and San Francisco airport and see many planes of deferent make and sizes flying overhead.  I know what planes or helicopters looks like even at high altitude from the shape of the fuselage and wings.  This crafts exhibited no known feature of known aircrafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a laboratory manager for a small Biotechnology company and have training in science.  My wife is an Executive Assistance for a high technology company.  We both now firmly believe there is crafts of unknown origin flying through our airspace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to purchase a digital video camera soon to film my experiences so that I can share or present solid evidence to other researchers in this field.  I hope we were not the only people who witnessed this amazing event this evening.<n>

I only saw it appear and dissapear close to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not think it was an object, more like a huge star that had fallen, yet knowing stars are not that big, I then thought it must have been an object of some kind .. perhaps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dogs barked. not sure if they noticed.. but coincidental that they barked at the same time as I saw it.

They asked me to come look outside; that they have seen a UFO. I rolled off the couch and when I looked, there was a bright light, that looked like a star...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The problem?  It was moving in circular, diagonal, vertical and horizontal motions.  It is sort of difficult to see, but if stared at long enough it is possible to see the movement.  Also, it seemed to have smaller red dots sort of behind it, but still part of the same craft.  Not only did we see this moving object but we saw a much smaller, and less dim, object come from the larger UFO and fly through the sky and disappear! I cannot even explain the amazement we all shared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, tonight, I decided to follow up on what I had seen last night and it is there again! It isn&#39;t even that far over in the sky as it previously was before..  Maybe a foot or so from my point of view. Tonight already I have seen about five flying objects around this light. They fly around it and then seem to disappear out of nowhere.  One my boyfriend pointed out and because before disappearing a blue beam of light shot from it.  Please look into this.. I feel as if my family cannot be the only ones who are witnessing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S my boyfriend, a skeptic beyond all belief, even agreed that there were flying objects and that the white light in the sky was moving! I still remain amazed as I write this letter to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, An Interested Viewer<n>

I was taken aback at first, because I know that most helicopters in the area flash and blink lights and more importantly, make a noise.  No planes fly in and out of the area at that hour of the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were travelling at a constant rate toward my home.  As they neared, the lights of each three went out one by one.  I have never seen or experienced aviation aircraft to suddenly turn off any of their lights to the point of complete darkness.  I followed the path of the lights of where I thought they would have been should the lights have stayed on, and in the darkness I saw a faint grey shape, that became slightly larger in size, with no light, no flashing, that you would expect from any aviation aircraft, especially over populated London areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, these orange/red glowing ‘orbs’ and the shape were at the height of helicopters, and completely silent.  It was the silence and the shape that has completely got me baffled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 3:10am, several helicopters came into the area and circled for some time.<n>

It appeared to pulse, getting stronger and fainter about twice a second, and faded and disappeared in about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cloudy night, hot and muggy.

It was approximately 11:55 PM and the weather conditions were mild despite the humidity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had been launching fire works for about 10 minutes when the lights in the sky were noticed.  My wife, who is a paranormal investigator,  was filming the fireworks when she turned the camera and caught  phenomenon on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were all flying in a straight line although at what I would assume different altitudes and all extinguished at the same location in the sky.

The red lights closely resembled cell phone tower lights but were far to high and far to be cell phone tower lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten minutes the middle light started flickering faster and faster until it fell a short distance then disappeared. I continued watching and after about 5 minutes after the middle light vanished the upper most light began flashing and fell.  The upper most light continued to fall until it reached the bottom light once it arrived directly across form the bottom light the both fell rapidly until they went behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Starting at midnight millville pa. put on a fireworks show which was located in the opposite direction of the lights seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately one third of the way through the fireworks show (20 minutes) my girlfriend and I started walking to the car, back in the direction of the stop light where they were originally seen.  I looked to my right and i seen two red lights in the sky much bigger and closer then the first time.  The red lights were moving away from the fireworks going towards their original spot.  The lights were moving horizontally and in a strange fashion.  The one in front would move a bit then stop as the one behind would move the same amount before stopping and the front one move again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement was much like that of an inch worm.  Once the lights arrived back at the place where i first seen them they stopped and just hovered untill they gradually faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that they were nor still but moving in the direction away from earth causing the illusion of stillness and them fading out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a family of 3 and two crossing guards which i know saw the lights along with me and my girlfriend.<n>

As we looked into the sky we saw 3 red circle lights NW of our position.  The lights stayed in the sky not moving.  1 of the 3 lights vanished after a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the fireworks began to the N approximately 4 miles away, 1 of the 2 lights moved downward in the sky to near the horizon and they then both vanished from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, while watching the fireworks, 2 of the red lights reappeared directly behind the fireworks to the N.  They proceeded to move SW from that position very slowly in a somewhat erratic pattern (not like a helicopter or plane).  They moved from the horizon to near their original position from earlier. The 2 lights hovered in the same position for another 5-10 minutes.  They would move closer together or apart from time to time.  They then dimmed and vanished as the fireworks display ended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were definitely not part of the display as or video footage shows, they were separate and deliberate in their movements.<n>

The object was in a stationary hovering position about 1000 to 2000 feet high.  I saw it as I was traveling North on the Palisades Interstate Parkway at the New Jersey / New York border.  As I was traveling downhill I saw a row of lights at what I thought were on the mountains/ hills ahead of me.  I thought it was a new building or athletic field all lit up at night.  As I was descending the hill I realized it was in the sky. All of sudden there was a flash of yellow light and the object was gone.  The flash was just centered around the object.  It did not light up the whole panorama of the sky like a sudden flash of lightning does.  That&#39;s when I realized I had probably just seen a UFO.  I traveled another 15 Minutes on the same road and saw nothing in the way of lightning or flashes in the sky. I am a 55 year old Television Director that lives in Rockland County, New York.! I have a BA degree in History and Art. I was not drinking prior to the sighting and was fully alert.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was nice out so I took a longer route , which was up over a hill  As I was walking up this hill something in my peripherals caught my attention.  I looked up immediately and what I seen was a green line of light in the sky . Not very large and very sharp.  It almost looked like a small LED light.  I stopped to look at for about a minute when I got to the top of the hill, to make sure I just wasn’t seeing things.  I also Noticed a plane in the sky flying by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute of looking at the object. I walked down the other side of the hill to the store to get smokes.  The farther down the hill I went the less I could see it, until it disappeared.  I came back the same way I came to see if I could still see the object.  Unfortunately it was gone and I walked home puzzled at what I had saw.  I think It could be similar to the report on July 19, 2010.<n>

The lights were in a triangle shape and at first we thought it was a triangle shaped craft.  But when I pointed out the object to a few more people with my green laser pointer the lights split apart in different directions in a fast fluid like motion and then disappeared.  The lights were pale white and were not as bright as the stars, they were also not blinking and there was no sound.  Total time of viewing was approximately 8 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3 minutes prior to these lights there was another strange bright white light heading east towards where those 3 lights were spotted, but it changed direction and headed in the same direction as those lights would eventually head.  This light was brighter than a star, it looked to be about as high as a plane but it was moving much slower than a plane and much much slower than the 3 lights that would follow.  Again, there were no flashing lights or sounds with this bright light either.<n>

I dismissed it as a star at this point.  An hour later 24:00 the object had disappeared from that area completely.  This is when I knew something was up. I looked across the horizon and saw that the object had positioned itself to the northwest of me still at the same altitude.  This time I stayed outside and watched it for several minutes noticing that it had moved very slightly to the north.  The third time I went outside it was gone from this area as well.   At this point it was really late and I went to bed.  Throughout this time I had felt feelings of anxiety, these feelings are unusual for me.<n>

I pulled off the highway, took out my Road Atlas to find out what town the ground lights in the distance was.  There were no towns on the map, however, the area in question was shown on the map with the words &#34;Military Reservation&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a half mile further down the road, I came to a very long road going off to the right towards the lights.

We were in two separate cars but close to each other.  We were about 1.5 miles away from where the fireworks were when we saw about 5-6 objects low in the sky.  We first saw the objects travelling down Landry Avenue, toward Kelly Boulevard (in North Attleboro), in the vicinity of the Joseph Martin Elementary school.  They appeared to be travelling north to south (or slightly northwest to southeast).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife first saw them, as I was driving the car.  I looked over and my initial thought was that whatever they were, it was definitely strange (particularly the brightness and the slow movement of them).  I thought it was a constellation for a split second, but then quickly realized they were too low and too bright to be a constellation.  Again, they were very low in the sky and much brighter than any night star or planet that I’ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I should mention that we had a weather cold front move through earlier in the late afternoon that day with heavy rain, so there was still a heavy overcast, although the town fireworks went off as planned.  The cloud ceiling was high enough that the fireworks were visible; no issues there.  There was no rain at the time of this sighting).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We proceeded to drive to my house, which was just around the corner.  My friend and his wife were heading to their house, which was some 30 minutes drive away (Northborough, MA).  As I got out of my car, 3 of the objects were almost directly overhead.  My guess is that they were several hundred feet up in the sky, to maybe a thousand feet.  They were all uniformly reddish/orangish and appeared to &#34;shimmer&#34; slightly.  They had the shape of a small dome, and they were fairly large (you didn’t have to strain to see them).  They were definitely larger than anything in the sky and symmetrical as best I could tell.  My wife and my two boys witnessed the same thing.  I called my friend on his cell phone and asked if he saw them, and he said he had, and thought they looked really strange.  He was puzzled too.  2 of the 3 objects were very close to each other at one point, with the 3rd one straggling behind.  At one point, the 3rd one seemed to increase its velocity slightly, moving sideways, toward where the other two were.   What I thought was really unique is that they made absolutely no sound.  They kind of hovered, then moved slightly.  I watched them for only about a minute, and then they disappeared into the overcast above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local police and they said they didn’t receive any calls; same for the local newspaper, nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> North Attleboro is a town of about 30,000 or so, so we’re not a rural area; others should also have seen this (particularly with fireworks having just ended and a lot of cars on the road).  Landry Avenue is a main route that took people away from the fireworks, which many people viewed at the High School, also on Landry Avenue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also sent an email to several friends that are in my section of town to ask them if they saw anything; I haven’t received responses back yet, as of this morning.<n>

A red/ orangey glowing ball of fire looking object was seen flying across the sky heading west.  At first we thought it was a plane that may have been on fire or a planet/ shooting star.  Then after observing the flight pattern we came to the conclusion that a plane cannot change directions that quickly.  The object  then cut back and flew  south east.  After that it flew straight and disappeared into the sky as it seemed to stutter.  There were no cloud in the sky.<n>

Thinking it was just a satellite, like you can see a star-like object moving at times, but this one got brighter.  When I pointed it out, it kept getting brighter and bigger.  It past directly over us and we kept watching it.  There were no lights blinking on it; just a very bright light that was no longer just a star.  We continued to watch it and it then moved toward the stars and then vanished south of us, where we could not even see a faint light either.  It was topic of discussion all night and I even stayed out longer to see if it came back;  it never did come back.  I wish I knew what it was.<n>

The sky was not completely dark yet.  My sons and I were in the pool.  I put my head back to dip my hair into the water... when I saw a bright red glow approaching from the distance.  One of my sons saw it at the same time, and we both said, &#34;What is THAT?&#34;   It was traveling at the speed of a plane, and as it approached..  my younger son and I saw something behind the glow...  almost like a parachute shape, but translucent looking.  My son said it looked like  a glare on something behind the light.  But then that shape went away, and all we saw was a red fireball.  By this point, it looked like a plane on fire.  My older son called for my sister to come outside.   We stood in shock.. it looked like a plane in flight that was in flames.  We were scared because we thought it was a plane on fire and we were just waiting for it to fall... and my mind was thinking, &#34;How can a plane st! ill fly if it&#39;s on fire?&#34;... but it continued on in the distance until it could no longer be seen.  Once it was gone, we realized that it could not have been a plane because there was no noise, but it was moving in the direction that we had seen planes coming from earlier.  There were NO OTHER reports of this to the local news station when my sister called, and no one else I know saw it.  People keep saying it was a weather balloon or hot air balloon that we must have seen.  Yeah right.  I&#39;ve seen both, and this was neither.<n>

The planet Venus was at an angle of 35 degrees in the horizon due West and the object was about 25 degrees angle from the horizon slightly to the north of Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glow was the same color as the Space Shuttle when it launches at night (I&#39;ve seen about 5 night launches before).  The glow looked like a thin ring on the outside with a solid glowing circle at the inside bottom of the ring.  The object hovered or moved very slowly northwesterly for about 7-8 seconds.  Then it rapidly accelerated and in a perfectly straight line toward the Northwest disappeared past the horizon in about 2 seconds looking more like a small star as it disappeared.   I see planes fly over all the time from Palm Beach International Airport and this object was moving about 50-100 times faster when it disappeared.  The only thing I&#39;ve seen in the sky that moved as fast or had such characteristics was the Space Shuttle when it launched and even that wasn&#39;t moving as fast nor in such a perfectly straight line.<n>

It shines a very bright lite and makes very weird patterns through the night skies.  I have noticed that when vehicles are passing through the valley it will get real dim and almost dissapear so it is not spotted.  After the vehicles pass it gets bright again. It also dims when it is changing its location.  My wife and kids have also seen this.  Nobody seems to know what it is and everything I&#39;ve googled on it in the last week has magically disappeared on the web.  I believe it&#39;s top secret and it&#39;s also a way for the government to invade peoples privacy.  Like a said, everything I&#39;ve read about it just seems to disappear off the web the next day.<n>

When we looked up there was a round, orangey-pink orb that looked as if there was a bright flame at the bottom of the orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb moved from southwest and traveled northeast across the lake in what looked at a deliberate, straight line leaving no tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be at the height that a small aircraft would travel.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got half-way across the lake, it entered the clouds and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes later, it happened again, identical in appearance, height, direction, speed, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t see it the rest of the evening.<n>

It was a nice day with blue skies and white cumulus clouds, no wind.  We were just chatting when for some reason I decided to look up. I saw what looked like a cloud but it was moving  pretty fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it started to change shape, but kept it&#39;s cloud like form.  I asked my cousin &#34;what is that?&#34;.  She looked up  and we watched it for what seemed like 10 to 15 seconds, all the while it kept changing it&#39;s form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually it just seemed to whisp away or just turned invisible right before it would have disappeared behind the branches of my tree had it stayed in view.  The direction it was coming from was East flying West.  It was quite hard to say how high it was in the sky, but I guess it to be anywhere between 150-300 feet in the air.  It didn&#39;t make any noise and it was traveling about 60-80 kilometers per hour.<n>

Looked up and saw 2 crafts.  There was a silver saucer just barely moving.  Below the saucer up in front of it was a red crop duster aircraft. The plane was moving at a normal pace and probably did not see the saucer above and behind the plane.  I ran in the house to my basement to get my camera.  It took me maybe 30 seconds to find camera and run to the back door.  Looked up and saucer was sky in back yard.  Almost like it was waiting on me.  I had my camera so I lifted camera up to take picture.  While doing this I was started cursing the object. I got you, nothing you can do about it.  I am going to get all the proof I need.  The object started to change shapes while I was looking through the view finder.  The end of object started to look like the tail of a plane.  So I lowered the camera to get a better look.  The silver saucer completely disappeared.  Not one cloud in the sky and completely beautiful blue skies! .  Looked around for saucer to see if it might reappear.  No such luck.  Highly disappointed that I did not get a picture of the saucer.  If I get another chance I will be using video mode.  It was as if the craft has changed dimensions.  like changing frequencies morphing and disappearing.<n>

He says that he woke up suddenly which he never does- he is a very sound sleeper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He looked out the window and saw a rectangular object flying over the clearing area.  From his window he was looking at the underside of the craft which was emitting an orange/amber light.  The craft was traveling from east to west and seemed to be moving quickly.  His window was open and he said the craft made a soft noise that sounded like a skateboard on pavement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier that night, sleeping in the front room, I heard but did not see two helicopters passes about one half hour apart moving west to east.  We are very familiar with helicopter noise since we used to live near a large medical center.  These were low and large helicopters and I would estimate they passed between one and two A.M.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both college-educated professionals.  Neither of us has seen a UFO prior to this.  My husband is a healthy 65 and I am 56.<n>

After I throw it, it takes a while for him to find it because it’s dark in my back yard. Why I wait I always look at the stars. I have been fascinated by space since I was young so I stare up a lot I was looking at what I thought were two stars pretty close to each other (I know their far). All of the sudden one started to move. I thought it was my imagination because it looked like it was doing tight circles. Then it darted about an inch over (At least that’s what it looked like from my vantage point ). Then it started doing bigger misshapen circles(as in not perfectly round). While it did these crazy maneuvers it moved very quickly, what looked to me as about a foot. I quickly ran about 25 feet inside to get my phone, which has a camcorder on it. I also wanted to text my sister because when I yelled for her she didn’t answer. By the time I got back out I couldn’t see it. I looked very hard at the ! sky and think I may have seen a much darker light doing the same impossible maneuvers. This I couldn’t swear that I was really seeing because it was faint enough to maybe be my eyes playing tricks, but the first light was as bright as any star in the sky on the clearest of nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was completely sober. I did drink two beers, but it was over the course of two baseball games. They were the ALDS and NLDS. I know technically that’s not completely sober, but I didn’t feel any affects of the alcohol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am willing to submit to any test at any time. I don’t know if it was an alien UFO but I definitely saw what I have described here. Unless there was a test of an incredible new secret plane, This was too fast and maneuverable to be explained as any normal plane. I would love to have this investigated. I don’t know how it could other than observation that is recorded of the area it happened in. Like I said though I will take a test that this is exactly what I saw, and I’ll guarantee I pass No question. At anytime I am willing to take any test i.e. lie detector, vision, sanity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a lot of thin cloud coverage, but you could see through most and they were moving relatively quickly. I did notice that when they passed over stars and did block them for a second as they reappeared they looked like they were moving in the opposite direction of the clouds. However, This was easy to determine that they weren’t moving it was just an illusion. The actual stars were always in the same spot when I focused on them and this thing I saw was bright as a star and left no doubt that it was moving. It also disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was an enormous crowd, so the amount of people who actually witnessed this is undeterminable.  After reaching the other side of the parking lot, I looked up in the sky and noticed two red lights hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights hung in the sky silently.  They would pulsate with one another in a way that almost made you think they would have to be connected.  Because when they pulsed they also moved.  They moved in a way though that I can only describe to you as the way to opposite ends of a compass would move.  In this bending flux.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about  10-15 mins of watching these lights, they changed position once again very smoothly hovering and gliding.  It was almost like they had no gravity to govern the movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As when they started they were parralell to one another the light on the left then came down below the light on the right and once again they hung there just like like for what  had to be 20 more mins.  After a while they changed position again back to being paralell with one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the fireworks show ended and what couldn’t have been more than a min after they began to change color and in an instant they were bright little yellow orbs but it wasn’t so much that they got dim or changed color but more like they got father away from us very quickly.  And just after that happened they ascended straight up into the sky gaining altitude in a way that I’ve never seen anything in my entire life move.  There was no ascending angles or noise from engines gearing up.  They just went straight up and were gone.  We waited for a long time after that to see if we could see them come back but they didn’t.<n>

Prior to the fireworks beginning the lights were in a horizontal row evenly spaced apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we all watched, these 3 lights moved at a very fast speed upward.  They got about a mile up in the sky (which took seconds) the first red light took off into the sky in the blink of an eye and disappeared.  The remaining 2 red lights just hovered there for about 10 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Meanwhile we saw 2 or 3 much smaller red, white, and blue flashing lights come across the sky.  It appeared they were trying to find out what was up there but they also just took off, not up into the sky but, to the left in seconds they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the red, white, and blue aircraft left, the red lights took off, and disappeared into thin air.  The fireworks display began and all of a sudden the 2 red lights appeared again to the right of the display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again they just hovered there in perfect distance apart horizontally as if they were watching the fireworks.  I tried the whole time to get this on video with my phone though the lights could not be picked up on my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do have the video of me trying, and what everyone was saying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the fireworks were over, the lights took off and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This really freaked everyone out, and we would like to know what it was.  They were way too high in the sky and way too fast to be any kind of aircraft we have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These red lights had to have been 3 or even 4 times the size of the smaller red, white and blue flashing lights.<n>

I think it either came up out of the river or just appeared out of no where.<n>

The Big Dipper was almost directly overhead but slightly to the Northeast of me a bit this time of year and time of night. The light then flew southeast turned to a reddish color and when it went directly over me it slowly faded out and vanished. This object had no sound and no flashing lights and I have been seeing these lights for a while now wondering what but something is for sure up there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My 20-year-old son and his girlfriend we taking a walk and enjoying the crystal clear night skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly my son looked to the southeast and to his surprise, there low in the sky, he observed a formation of seven bright orange lights.  The group moved like independent ships, not attached to any superstructure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation was moving to northwest, when suddenly two of the ships in the middle of the group started to orbit each other.  The formation continued on a northwestern course and then they all faded away and were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting lasted around :45 seconds.  The lights were the size of a pea held at arms length.  The light emitted was steady and a hunter orange color.  The formation moved at a slow steady speed.

They looked four times as big as a normal sized star at night time. (There were no stars out at this time.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> She says, &#34;Could they be hot air ballons?&#34;  First off i thought...  Its 11:00PM, what kinda ballons would be out this late.  We drove DIRECTLY under them.   My girlfriend stuck her head out the window and could still see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If they were hot air ballons, the basket would have covered up the flame.  Also, we saw no sign of a balloon above the flame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a hard left turn into the Hilliard Darby High School parking lot so i could get out of my truck.  My girlfriend started praying as i stared the objects in the sky.  Looking into the sky, if you put your fist in between the two balls, thats how far apart they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a 15 second video of it on my phone.  I could see the Orbs on my phone as i recorded, but when i went to watch it the next day, all i saw was a 15 second clip of the black sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After i took the video, i called my dad to give the UFO sighting number.  When he did, i called and left a message on the answering mechine.<n>

It looked like flashes of light in the clouds, blinking extremely fast like a strobe for a few seconds then stopping, at 3-4 minute intervals between flashes.  They seemed to be behind the thick layer of clouds that covered most of the sky.  I noticed that the television screens in my house seemed to become fuzzier during the rapid flashes.  I spoke to my companion who was on the ground floor who had also seen these flashes from her west-facing window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rapid flashes slowly got more rare, and came to a complete stop at around 23:30.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It never repeated the flash.

Then saw a light in the sky focused on it and it appeared to be some kind of ship.  As the clouds went by it never moved.  I was so excited that when I focused on it it was a saucer with a round light lite underneath it that was round. It just sat there at first thinking it may be a bright star.  Not even knowing if at my home at 6000 feet up if it was possible to see a star in the day time.  But with the binoculars even though only 10 time magnification I still wanted to make sure I was just not seeing what I thought I was seeing.  So I layed on the ground found the saucer again I layed there on the dirt driveway for over 3 hours.  To the point my elbows even though on the ground were getting pretty sore.I would look away then go right back and there it was.  Then the clouds getting ready to rain and being very dark.  I thought great now I will lose it.  I keeped watching and it was there under the clouds at this point all thoughts of a star or some form of goverment craft went away.  It was so windy out that if it had been anything I believe we have it would have been blowing around up there.  It never moved.  The light stayed on even in the bright daylight.  I have to say I believe it was watching me watching it.  Just a feeling I was getting.  This was no big giant craft not a triangle no flashing lights the one light just stayed fixed on.  It was the size of a truck maybe a little bigger but not much.  It was awesome .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD))<n>

I was out in my pickup that I keep at my sister’s house, doing some fishing and taking pictures of the scenery.  It was a clear blue sky and I was east of Skykomish at the Martin Creek trailhead for the Iron Goat Trail.  I thought I would head further up the road past the trailhead parking area on US Forest Service road 6710 for some pictures.  (There were two cars in the dirt parking lot).  Further on, I pasted a parked white full size van with a family that had been apparently hiking. I came to a side road that headed up the mountain on my right. I decided to take that road up to get some pictures of the scenery.  I then decided I would drive up as far as I could go where I could turn around safely. I found that spot and turned around and stopped to get my pictures.  From this spot I took 11 pictures, a few east up the valley and a few back down the road I had just come up.  I finally got back in my truck and headed back down the hill.  It was not until after my vacation when I returned back to California that I reviewed the pictures after they were enlarged on my computer at work.  I noticed on three pictures a spot that I thought must have been on the lens. All the other pictures had nothing on them. One was taken up the valley to the east and one to the west. Another at Mount Rainier National Park.  I became very interested when I enlarged these photos and wanted someone to take a look at them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sending a third photo that was taken on Thursday July 15, 2010 at 11:53 a.m. (exact) at Mount Rainier National Park from the east side of the mountain on the road up to Sunrise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In both cases, I heard and saw nothing at the time I took the photos.  I was definitely not looking for UFO&#39;s.....<n>

Heading west towards the bay. By the time I got my camera out it was in front of the sun. it was climbing in altitude and slowly turning north.  It was moving about as fast as a blimp but it was as big as two and a half commercial jets end to end.  Or from my eye view about 2&#34; long. it seem to be about 12000 feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report #2 Last Friday, July 9th at around 1pm, I witnessed an aircraft hovering in the sky for a few minutes while speaking with Evva.  I thought it was hovering at a height much higher than consistent with commercial airliners landing or having just taken to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing at 1390 Grand View Drive in Berkeley and it seemed like the aircraft was directly above us.  The color of the aircraft was dark brown or black and shaped like a perfect cylinder, with neither any tapering at either end or anything resembling the wings of an airplane.  The end of the aircraft looked like the color chrome, but that may have been the sunlight glinting off of it.  Based on the altitude I estimate the aircraft was hovering at, it seemed like it&#39;s size was much larger than a commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes, the aircraft reoriented itself from an original position consistent with the hull of an airplane flying horizontally to one flying vertically, while still holding almost the exact same position in the sky.  I then departed and did not see the aircraft any further.<n>

It was red-orange and looked like a small planet or fireball at first.  When it flew over head, it appeared to be oblong, larger than a small airplane and flying about the same altitude of a small airplane cruising low to land.  The glow of the object made it impossible to identify, almost like an entire plane was engulfed in fire, but holding a consistent altitude.  It’s sound was low, unlike an airplane and resembled a  pulse.   After it was out of view, I ran back into the house and called 911 to see if there were any other reports.  The operator checked with the sheriff’s office and said there was no boat distress flares reported.  I guess, when I described it flying, the operator decided it was a flare since I didn’t describe the size or just thought I was out of my mind  and  didn’t want to be part of an U.F.O. report.<n>

In the following 30-40 seconds its light dimmed to not viewable but several normal military jets could be seen as they had on night flying lights.  Entire event seemed to be above 40,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire event was silent.<n>

I can see planes around that time of night and when they have their headlights on they appear as only one light instead of two.  These were unusual in that I have never seen 4 lights (planes) that close together.  One was ahead and then two, one above the other, and then the fourth appeared to be behind the other 3.  They seemed to be moving fairly rapidly toward the airport and I figured that three of them would have to circle to await their turn to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, the lights appeared to stop moving toward the west so I thought they had probably turned enough toward my viewpoint that their forward progress wouldn’t be visible to me.  Then, suddenly they all four went out.  I watched for awhile longer to see if those four planes landed and I saw at least one other plane go into the landing route and then a second but they were coming from the south and were not anywhere near where I had seen those other four lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it strange that those four planes had not landed and I didn’t see any other lights to indicate where they had gone and since my husband was asleep, I figured I’d tell him the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then Friday night on the 11 PM news the reporter told about some UFO’s sightings in the Vancouver area and the full story would be in Vancouver’s paper on Saturday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That reminded me as I’d forgotten to tell my husband.<n>

At approximately 22:50, while in the car, I saw 3 glowing white orbs hovering just above the treeline very close to the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of each orb was fairly large, I&#39;d estimate them at between 10 and 20 feet in diameter.  The three orbs all seemed to be similar in size.  They made no noise I could hear from the freeway. Each one glowed with pure white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within the span of seconds, the three orbs came streaking from seemingly out of nowhere across the sky, towards us from the north, then came to a complete stop, hovered momentarily just above the treeline, then dashed away very quickly towards the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the orbs had sped away from us, my roommate, who was driving said, &#34;Wow, did you see that too?&#34;   We then had a conversation confirming that each of us had seen the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to submit this report after reading a local news article regarding the same event.  A unique thing about this sighting is that after getting home, I noted the sighting on twitter.com.  That record can be found here:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://twitter.com/josh_bomb/status/18097666402<n>
7/8/10 22:50|Vancouver|WA|Light|1 minute|Saw four orange stationary lights in Southern sky about 15 degrees in elevation|7/10/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76336.html|461|ndxe201007| Saw four orange stationary lights in Southern sky about 15 degrees in elevation<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked outside to get something out of my car (time 10:50 pm PST) and saw 4 orange lights in the Southern sky.  I could see them from my front walkway but not from where I was when I got near my car as my neighbor’s homes were in the way.  They were slightly to the East of due South.  I’d say they were at 15 degrees as far as elevation goes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since there were 4 of them and the color was different than the aircraft I see flying into PDX I decided to look at them a little closer. I held still, trying to discern any movement amongst any of the lights using the roof lines of my neighbor’s home as a reference.  I detected no movement and it crossed my mind that they could be stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I thought about it and looked for other stars in the sky and they were nowhere near the brightness or the color.  As far as brightness goes I would say maybe 10 times as bright as a normal star, and maybe half as bright as the lights I see on the commercial aircraft flying in and out of PDX.  Also they were smaller than the lights of the commercial aircraft appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I go to my car, which was closer to my neighbor’s and just make a note of it in my head in case I hear an explanation on the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming out of my car, I heard/saw my neighbor’s garage door opening.  I was excited so I went to go tell him what I had seen.  But before I could I thought I’d better go back to were I could see them just to verify they were still there; they were gone.  I decided to tell him anyway because he saw me and asked ‘why are you running’?  I then explained what I had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 seconds later tow teen girls came walking down the sidewalk (east bound).  I asked them had they seen the lights and they said yes.  I asked them if they were freaked out and they said yes.  I told them my story and that I didn’t see what happened to them.  They said the 4 lights moved together into one.  I forget what they said about where they went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked to my neighbor a bit about it and then came in and called 911.  They had not heard of anyone else calling in but they gave me the UFO hotline number.  I called a 206 area code number and the gentlemen asked if he could call back in about 5 minutes.  I said yep and asked him if he was busy with the same thing I just saw.  He said yes.  I then called KGW Portland TV news, and asked if they had any reports yet.  They said no but they would contact dispatch to se if anything had been reported.  A few minutes later a gentleman from the National UFO Reporting Center called and said someone else had just called him also and they were filling out a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He then asked if I had internet access and I said I was right next to my PC.   He asked if I’d fill out a report and that’s what I’m doing now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see two other reports from Washington State for the same time.  PD))<n>

It caught my attention due to the shape and intense light and did not look like any plane (I see planes every day from my view).<n> <n><n> <n><n> A second object, of the same shape and size, suddenly appeared next to it.  Then two more objects raised up (from what appeared to the water - Puget Sound) and they floated up in formation to where the other two objects were.  All 4 objects slowly raised up into the sky and totally out of view.  I was able to shoot several minutes of the last two objects with my video camera.<n>

I was driving home from a gathering with friends in Marietta, Georgia.  The time was approximately 10:30 PM and I was traveling west on Whitlock just before Kennesaw Mountain Battlefield Park, when I noticed a large, black rectangular object hovering just above the tree line.  It had one red light on the corner and two white lights on the other corners.  I had the window down and I didn’t hear any noise.  As I reached the park, I could see that it was actually hovering at the tree line on the edge of the park.  What had initially caught my attention was that it was not moving at all.  I turned around after I passed the park to get another look, but the object was gone.  We are near Lockheed, so I thought perhaps it was an experimental craft of some sort, if they perhaps have some kind of silent craft capable of hovering in one spot.  I thought I’d go ahead and report it since it didn’t fit anything I’d ever seen.<n>

I commented immediately that &#34;now you&#39;ve seen it too&#34;. This was in reference to my own observations a year earlier, co-witnessed by my son.  Soon after my comment, she said it was gone. I went for and retrieved binoculars which were no help.  Then, I remembered I&#39;&#39;d brought a Night Owl night vision monocular device.  The device has an incorporated infra-red beam to highlight objects with. It would reflect the white ocean-foam of breaking waves about 150 ft away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After following the light, now only seen with the &#34;Owl&#34;, for about 10 minutes, another red-ish light appeared above it and the two seemed to migrate into one another to form a single light. After another fives minutes I began to &#34;signal&#34; the object with the infra-red beam by flashing it on and off randomly, both fast and slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the object light flashed extraordinarily bright. Not only do I believe that this was in response to my flashing the infra-red beam, I believe it was done to try and blind my night vision device from further operation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another 10 or so minutes, the object(s) moved due North across Emeralds Isle towards the Bogue Field area. Bogue is a now-defunct military air field used for practice take-offs and landings by helo&#39;s, Harriers, and Osprey aircraft. Many of these were visible flying in the direction of New River MCAS, NC to the South of our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the previous year&#39;s vacation, 2009, these lights were seen while we stayed at a beach location several miles to the South of our current place of stay. At that time, several lights, or a couple of very, very fast ones were observed for a very short time. On this occasion, I was able to see them for a much longer time with the aid of the &#34;Owl&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having grown up a Military dependent of a Marine Air Officer, I am very versed in the many types of aircraft current and past used by the Marines, Navy, and Air Force Commands. What I witnessed in July of 2010, and the year before was not any type of known aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not only was this object completely silent, it moved without effort across 35 mile and hour winds effortlessly.  At no time was any shape discernible, only the red-ish light which varied in intensity from very faint, to a brilliant electric arc-type of light that I could not look directly at with the night vision device. The wife and I agreed that the light when its brightest lit up an area approx 300 feet wide and about the same deep. Otherwise, about 150 feet in either direction on the sandy beach and about 150 feet out in the ocean from water&#39;s edge. When dimmed, the red-ish light and light at it&#39;s most brilliant were apparently from the same source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.

The sky was still quite bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A single object was observed flying northward at a high altitude.  I can’t say precisely what the altitude was, but I would estimate it approximately the same, maybe somewhat lower, than the passenger jets I see in the sky at high altitudes which leave the vapour trails in their wake.  I would also estimate it to have been approximately 8 to 10 times the size of those planes.  It moved very quickly and made no discernable sound and left no trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be mostly white in color, possibly glowing or having a shiny reflective surface.  It appeared to be cylindrical or &#34;cigar shaped&#34; with a dark line or area at its center, with brighter areas at each end.  No flashing or blinking lights were observed, though there appeared to be a mild haze around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my son and I observed the object until it disappeared from view.  Once it moved away from us it appeared as just a dot of light in the sky and it eventually vanished.  It flew in what appeared to be a straight line and made no manoeuvres of any kind.<n>

I don&#39;t believe that anyone else saw the object either as it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing with my wife and my inlaws near the village lawn of Mons, France taking pictures with my Canon digital PowerShot.  There were at least 7 other people within 50 yards of us. Neither my family nor I saw the object with our naked eyes, or heard any noises.  I don&#39;t have any reason to believe that anyone else around us saw the object either.  I was the only person taking photos as far as I am aware, and the photo is the only evidence that something was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 photos were taken of the exact same spot in less than a 1 minute time span.  The first photo showed nothing.  The object appears in the second photo only.  We decided it could not be a blimp because it would have shown in the first photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked at the photo on my MacBook over dinner, and discussed all the possible things it could be - pollen, insect, debris falling from the sky, glitch in the camera, etc.  We all agreed that whatever it was, it had to have happened quickly and without much noise, because everyone on the village lawn was oblivious to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Picture is no longer available at the link indicated by the source of the report.

We were heading back to the hotel via Monorail.  I looked out into the sky for a moment and saw an object hovering in the distance that didn’t resemble any aircraft or the shapes in your drop-down menu of choices.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a dull silver, with light from the sun reflecting off of it. It was shaped like a compressed pill.  A cylinder with a dome on the top and bottom.  In the place where the dome forms from the straight side of the object, there was a line that goes straight across the object to the other side. This applied to the lower half of the object as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 45 sec or so of staring at the object, I decide to look away to see if it was an illusion in my eyes.  I look back less than 5 sec later, and the object is gone.  I scan the skies on both sides of the Monorail, but I was unable to see the object.<n>

My husband and I were taking his friend to the store after work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were going down HWY-25 by the walmart, just fixing to stop at a redlight.  When we both looked up at what appeared to be a bright red fireballish orb(approx. size of basketball/soccerball), floating in the air about 10-15 feet above us.  We drove right under it, and then I turned around to look at the red light, and it was no longer there.  As if it just dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing fell from the sky or anything, we drove right underneath it.  It would have hit our truck. There was no one around.  No other cars, nothing.  We thought it could have been a light hanging on a electric line or something, but there was no line and no lights when we looked back and drove by it again on the way home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened in a matter of seconds, and I was in such shock I could barely drive.  Its as though it came out of nowhere, appeared in front of my car, then vanished again.  I didn&#39;t ever see it from a distance driving up to it. Just once I got close to stopping, and after my husband confirmed I wasn&#39;t completely crazy by pointing at it as well.  Its just hours after it happened now and I have a horrible headache, which I felt fine before this sighting, as does my husband.<n>

I watched it for about 30 seconds and it seemed to be moving very slowly.  I saw the green light turn off and the red light came to a stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got close enough that I thought at first it must be a cell tower or something.  I got right next to it and it started moving quickly.  I turned into a parking lot to watch and rolled my window down so I could see a little better and it sounded like it was very low to the ground.  The sound coming from it was very similar to the sound a hair dryer would make but it was higher pitched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it wasn&#39;t a plane or a helicopter because it was too far from a hospital or airport to be so low.<n>

And on July 6th at 11:13 Pm My Husband and I noticed a very strange light in the sky moving to the southeast.  It passed underneath an airplane as it was moving.  We noticed it was no further than a half mile in the air and about 5 miles to the north west of us.  It moved very fast and came right over the top of my house. To start off it was a very bright white light.  But the closer it got it seemed to change from white to orange. As it got over my house my husband and I looked up and the light was so bright we could not see past the light to see what it was.  It made no noise at all, which I thought was very strange due to how close it was.  But then the light seemed to fade and what ever it was just disappeared. It was gone by 11:16 pm.  Only lasted 3 minutes but it has really intrigued me. I am going to go by a video camera because it seems as if these sightings are happening more o! ften in this area.  I will be ready if I ever see another one so I can catch it and prove to everyone I am really not losing my mind.<n>

As we were saying goodbye we looked over to our orchards.  There was a orange orb in the sky we watched it for about two minutes as it was coming near us.  Our first instincts was it was a plane without it&#39;s flashers on but as it came closer we heard no sound and the object was far to big to be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it came over our heads and passed it shot off into the distance (approx) 15 seconds and it glowed red and dissapeared.  There was no sound and it was a orb the sky.  There was no way it could be a fire work or a plane, to low to be a sattilte.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything move so fast.<n>

Completely equal distant from each other and exactly identical in brightness and size appeared in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing and then the two lights at what appeared to be the top of the formation disappeared, quickly followed by the last light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat and questioned what we had seen and tried to logically come up with some type of explanation and the only thing we could come up with was that it was an unidentified flying object or objects.

There were airplanes in the area though and they all had blinking nav. Lights on.  This bright light was going about the same speed as a satellite maybe a little bit faster but much slower than a meteor.   It flew across the entire sky and then was gone.  The light just vanished. This was a very intense light like something from spot light from far away.  I wonder if it was the international space station.  I don’t know.

Hard to explain but if you can imagine the heat effect on a summer day on a hot street then this is what I saw in the sky at night.  The color of this &#34;wave&#34; was florescent green.  It looked to be half the distance from horizon to horizon in a straight line.  It moved from east to west.  It was not the shape of a laser but more a see through green heat wave that distorted the clouds as it passed.  It started out very large and ended in the western sky at a small point of light the fizzled out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is very hard to explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more I think about it, might of been a meteor above the clouds but this heat light took 10 seconds to go from horizon to horizon.<n>

I watched it because it was unusually large and near to the earth.  The object suddenly began to fade away at a rapid speed and then turned red and disappeared altogether. Later that night, I saw four or five other bright objects zoom through the sky at an insane amount of speed.  Some of the objects would disappear and then reappear and others would turn from gold to gray.  At about 3:00am on the 8th of July I saw a brilliant light that appeared to be a golden magnetic energy rise from the earth until about two hundred feet off the ground at which point it stopped emitting the gold light and began to blink in a manner very similar to a commercial jet.  The object then blinked a pattern of red, green and blue lights, turned in my direction and then flew over my head.  I was unable to discern its shape.  It then flew away and as the distance between it and me increased, the blinking lights made the object look like a shimmering star.  But if you scrutinized it closely, you could tell it wasn’t a star, but some form of advanced technological cloaking device.  Then I noticed there were other “stars” in the sky that blinked in a similar fashion.  As I watched these objects, some of them moved slowly through the sky, while others zoomed at very high speeds.  Then they objects would settle down again and mimic the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> July 8th 2010, Dusk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the prior night’s events, I found a good viewing spot (the top of a hill in Wedgewood) and began watching the sky much earlier. From this vantage point I witnessed hundreds of these &#34;stars&#34; crept across the firmament and descended ever so slowly from the real stars to earth.  They moved so slowly that if I hadn’t been anticipating the event and patiently watching, I never would have noticed. But I did notice.  And as the ships reached Earth the sun went down.  But just before it was totally dark, I caught a brief glimpse of one of these ships.  To my surprise it resembled a very sophisticated space-plane. It hummed soothingly.  The other ships then came in my direction traveling slow and low, but keeping their lights in a fashion as to mimic commercial jets.  Occasionally the light pattern would change into a sudden brilliant display of undulating red, green, blue and gold lights.  The ships then circled around Seattle for an hour or so, at which point some of them scattered! out in all directions, while others settled in the sky and mimicked the stars.  I stayed up all night watching the ships that remained.  Some had three lights and appeared to be triangular; others had four lights and appeared to be square. I got some footage with my cell phone.  But the quality is pretty low.  Also, they knew when I was about to take a picture because almost every time I raised my camera, they would change from what they were doing with the lights back to a commercial jet pattern.  I talked out loud and it was as if they could hear me.  For a while nothing particularly obviously out of this world happened. So I said, &#34;Okay, I’ll but my camera away.&#34;  Then the ship nearest me did a good deal of rapid blinking and all of a sudden, to the south, I saw a golden light arise over Capitol Hill.  It neared me. When it flew past, I saw that it was another ship that had just come in.  Then I walked home and went to bed.<n>

Small pinpoints of bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 4th flash of light was a little different than the previous ones in that it was almost like a diffused strobe flash, like when someone takes a flash picture outside at night- that kind of effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was some kind of occillating space junk or debris, and was catching the sun at a particular angle.  I thought that, because it was about the same height as a satellite.  I had seen a couple of regular looking satellites later in the evening, as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest thing about this observation, was that I saw the same kind of flashes the very next night! In the same spot as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only difference was that it didnt do the strobe flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the other 3 flashes about 2 or 3 seconds apart were exactly as I saw them the previous night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wierd.<n>

We live in the Chicago Midway airport area so at first it seemed like an airplane that was on fire.  Suddenly it stopped, it went backwards, then side to side and was hovering for a few minutes, to the point where a plane flew approximately 100 feet below it.  We could hear the plane as it flew by but there was no sound coming out of the fireball looking object, even as it disappeared into the clouds.  When I saw it go backwards I ran inside my house to get the camcorder, while my family stayed outside watching it.  As soon as my husband tried recording, it disappeared into the clouds.  The entire experience was about five minutes long. Soon after it disappeared we heard helicopters near Cicero Avenue and the expressway I-55.<n>

The strange noises sounded as if there were hard droplets, hail, or a large amount of pecans falling onto my roof and sidewalk from trees outside.  Being concerned that a thunderstorm was blowing in, I stood up from the computer and went to the window to look through the blinds to see outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I peeked through the blinds, the strange sounds immediately stopped.  I looked into the yard and into the street across the way to see if rain drops or hail were falling.  Not seeing any drops of rain or hail, I then looked out onto the horizon to see if there were any thunderstorm clouds, and immediately saw a series of strange lights directly south approximately 15 degrees on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, the lights appeared to be three landing lights on the front of a large airplane heading north. What was strange about this apparent airplane was that it was banked downward as if it were about to turn to the west, but it did not move from this position.  The lights were all of the same amber color, with the two outermost lights the brightest, the center light more dim.  The craft stayed stationary as if it were parked in the sky at an angle.  The other odd thing about this craft was that it seemed to be extremely large, and located approximately 5 or 6 miles southward near the junction of the Dallas North Tollway and I-35.  An estimate of the size was approximately 300 or 400 feet across (huge).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, incredibly, another craft of similar proportions (but further in the distance), suddenly appeared to the left of the first craft, and it was banked at a different angle compared to the first craft.  The sudden appearance of the second craft was immediate, as if a light switch or strobe had been turned on.  My immediate thought was that there was some sort of fireworks or laser light show being given near the American Airlines Center near downtown.  Then, incredibly, a third craft, immediately appeared to the right, with the same proportions, but at a different distance than the other two craft.  The third craft was also banked at a different angle compared to the others.  It was difficult to discern whether the crafts were actually moving very slowly, or if they were completely stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, each craft blinked its lights off and on (the three lights of a craft in unison) as if the crafts were communicating with each other.  The blinking seemed to be in a sequence, as if each craft was a separate ornament on a Christmas tree.  The sequential blinking lasted less than 1 or 2 seconds.  All of the lights disappeared as suddenly as they had appeared, but not at the same time (each craft &#34;turned-off&#34; at different times).<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the above took place on the order of about 10 seconds.  I have never seen anything like it before. I have been searching the news sites to see if anyone else saw the same lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

7/7/10 00:30|Northport|MI|Light|20 sec|Gliding white light over Leelanau State Park|7/19/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76514.html|494|ndxe201007| Gliding white light over Leelanau State Park<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in Northport, MI @ Leelanau State Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was camping with my girlfriend and another couple that were friends of mine. In the early hours of July 7th, just after midnight, my girlfriend and I had decided to take a walk to the lakeshore area to have a view of the stars.  We had left my friend at the campfire alone, his wife had recently retired for the night in their tent.  It had been fairly cloudy the previous night and this particular night was much clearer, so I wanted to get a good view of the stars before we were to leave the campgrounds the following afternoon.  We walked to the shoreline area and sat at a bench that overlooked Lake Michigan from a distance.  The bench looking north, over the rocks and weeds that led to the vast waters of the lake.  The sky was fairly clear and it was still night. I remember commenting to my girlfriend on how beautiful the stars were.  My girlfriend was looking for the Pleides constellation but couldn&#39;t remember exactly! what it looked like or where to find it.  As we sat there, I noticed that some clouds were moving in from the northwest and we wouldn&#39;t have much time left with the clear sky.  The clouds seemed to be moving in, fairly quickly.  I turned my head to look at the southern sky and saw a satellite moving across the atmosphere and I pointed this out to her.  I jokingly told her that for all we knew it could be a spaceship disguised as a satellite.  She didn&#39;t seem to want to go along with this joke and she repeatedly told me that it was a satellite.  I told her I was just kidding and told her it was a satellite.  At this time, I began turning my head to look back towards the lake.  My eyes quickly caught sight of a very bright white light coming in from the northwest, almost as if it came out of nowhere. Instantly I stated to her, &#34;What is that?&#34;.   We observed a very brilliant and bright white light coming in from the northwest heading in a slightly southeastly direction.  This light did not pulsate or flash, in anyway.  It was a steady light that moved briskly across the night sky, almost as if it was gliding.  Also, the light or object made no sound.  During its path of flight, it&#39;s altitude did not seem to change.  It&#39;s difficult to judge how high it was in the sky, but it appeared to be flying very low.  Perhaps a 1,000 to 2,000 feet.  It steadily glided past us.  My girlfriend attempting to tell me that it was probably just a plane, but I saw no flashing lights of a plane that I&#39;m used to seeing.  I could make no shape out behind the light.  It was so solid and bright, that if did come from an object, the light completely engulfed it.  This light continued to glide past us and over the treetops of the campgrounds, directly to the south of us.  From this vantage point we could see the back end of this moving object and the light was just as bright and brilliant from the back as it was from the front.  At this point, the object slowly disappeared into the cloud or mist cover that just hung over the treetops, and out of our sight.  As it began to fade into the low cloud\mist cover, the white light began to fade.  I&#39;m uncertain but I thought I saw some solid form to the object, catching sight of perhaps the back end of an object, but like I said I can&#39;t be sure.  I thought I caught view a small orb like object that seemed to be attached to a larger object.  Then, it was gone.  All in all, this episode lasted about 20 seconds, from the time I first saw the object &#39;til it disappeared over the treetops. Most importantly to me, though, was that there was no sound.  This object was absolutely silent.  This object flew very low, as far as plane standards go and I&#39;m still amazed that there was no sound!   I&#39;m completely baffled by the brightness and silence of this object.  I&#39;m left with something that is absolutely mysterious to me.<n>

After a few seconds it would disappear and would reappear to the side of where it just disappeared and would move in another quick, smooth straight motion, then slowly disappear and reappear again to the opposite side.   We both realized it couldn’t be a plane b/c there were no flashing lights, no noise and planes can only move in a straight forward motion, not move over to the left or right.   We weren’t sure what to think but wanted to report it so it was documented.<n>

This could not have been a meteor, plane, helicopter, satellite, or the space station as it stayed stationary for approximately 15 mins.

My job has me walking outside every night and the night sky is usually clear with no light pollution.  So as I was walking I noticed this really fast light in the corner of my eye.  This light had a red hue. Lasting about 5 seconds it crossed ¾ of the sky until it disappeared into the distance.  I know it was not an airplane because it was traveling way to fast with no sound.  It was also not a weather balloon because of this factor also.  The conclusive factor I see in this is while as I was watching this light its trajectory curved.  As it crossed the night sky its path curved multiple times.  The curving was not dramatic but very noticeable and smooth. The curving path of this flying light factors out a meteor and a satellite.  Neither of these objects curve like the way this light did that night.  I also know that this light was not at the altitude of satellites because I have seen many satellites in the past and know they are very hard to see due to their high altitudes.<n>

Good visibility, cloud layer high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly a bright intensely red ball shaped object descended slowly above us and to our front.  Seemed close and all exclaimed: &#34;What is that?&#34;  No noise.  It just continued the descent across a small valley of houses and curved away to the north above the rim of the river valley away from us and seemed to disappear behind trees.  It appeared about the size of a basketball from where we stood and appeared controlled in movement and not subject to wind.   Did not see it arrive.  The light appeared above us and had no characteristic of any firework we had seen.<n>

They continued eastward across the horizon, until my sight was blocked by tall trees and houses.  My first thought was that these objects might be hot air balloons because they seemed to hover/drift like hot air balloons.  Then, I realized that didn&#39;t make sense--they moved much faster than hot air balloons.  Since they appeared to be a fair distance away, I then assumed they might be planes from Portland airport or the military base nearby.  Although, I didn&#39;t know how far away they were, they seemed to be too close together to be planes (I&#39;m guessing 1-2 miles apart).  The color of these objects never changed, and no other lights or anomalies were seen.  Also, I never heard any sounds other than a few final fireworks going off or voices of our guests leaving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Evening sighting.  We have amended the time above, to reflect that fact.  PD))<n>

From a east direction heading westerly.  It traveled in a 20 degree upward angle for aprox.  3 miles, then slowed down headed in a southerly direction and proceeded out of sight.  The object was in view long enough for me to go and get my binoculars and run back outside, however all I could see was an amber light, for another 15 to 20 seconds.  This was not a flare or a firework.  It was traveling as fast as an F18 but made no noise and was approximately 5 to 8 miles away.<n>

I had been invited to my friends new home for a few drinks and some food.  There were seven people there in total.  We were sitting on the back porch enjoying the nice night.  At approx. 11:30pm I noticed two redish orange lights off in the distance to the north of our location headed in a south east direction. Im not positive on their elevation but they were as low as a small prop plane would fly.  The two lights were flying side by side at first. One of the objects seemed to speed up ahead of the other. It slowed down just in front of the other then continued in this formation till they were out of my line of sight.  I told the others to &#34;look at those lights!&#34;  My friend scott looked but blew it off as nothing.  Then as has happened to me before everyone commented on how i was seeing things.  But i know scott saw the same thing i did.  Again, at approx.  11:45 pm a second redish orange light at the same elevation and heading in the same direction as the previous two objects came into sight.  This one was moving slowly at first but seemed to gain speed as it traveled.  This one was by itself.  It traveled in a south east direction and like the other two disappeared out of my sight behind a tree line. I did not mention this object to my friends due to the fact that they refuse to believe even the things they see i guess.  I am aware that it was the fouth of july and people were using fireworks all over the country that day but this was NOT fireworks. Im reporting this because i read that there were many other reports of the same thing.  And i wanted to share my sighting as well.<n>

We had gotten there too late and missed the fires and fireworks (it was probably close to midnight) but decided to hang out on the beach for a little bit anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all just talking when one of our friends, who was lying down, pointed up and said something along the lines of, &#34;watch that weird star move&#34;  I looked up expecting to see a shooting star, or maybe a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance I thought maybe it was a satellite, because it moved slowly and steadily in one direction...then it stopped. That&#39;s when started to really look at it. It was very high up, maybe higher than an airplane, and it looked very much like a star except when it moved, It sort of reflected the star light around it. I was silvery blue light like many stars, but a little brighter and the shine was almost wobbly, if that makes sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement was not of any craft I&#39;ve ever seen, or know of being used publicly by the military. the star traveled left in a smooth straight line, stopped, then went back to the right.  It moved back and forth a few times until it stopped to the right, then started to make a triangle pattern around a single (real) star, stopping at each corner of the triangle.  It did this a few times as well then went back to the left again slowly as it did before, then it suddenly shot up to the left and disappeared as if it shot out of the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four of saw it. I do not know what it was, but it is ingrained in my memory and I would be happy to answer any questions.<n>

I keep looking and when in a straight line heading to south side providence.  This thing was scare it for me and my family my son was crying all night telling me that we gonna die that this was the end of the world.  I can said this light was like a 200 feets from the ground so close that when he tell me watch out i almost laid on the ground thinking that light gonna hit me.  The light disappear in the horaizon.  Its was more like the lights have a vacum at the end pulling the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry if i spell some words bad my first language is spanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n>

When it moved a short ways past me the wooshing sound was no longer audible the object then made a slight arc to the north north east and continued a short ways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was still quite visable when the fireball faded out and turned into a red point of light then went out of sight.  (This happend in a span of about 5 seconds)   The object looked the same coming at me, overhead and going away from me<n>

We were out with telescope and originaly thought it was a firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a minute it looked like it was hovering but it actually was moving from west to east.  The object looked like a tear drop and when it was directly over head it looked like it had a central ring through binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was orange made no noise and definitely was not a plane, balloon, fireworks, or any other known object.  It also did not seem to be a meteor.  This object finally disappeard in the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I find odd is that at the same time exactly a year ago an identical object was spotted from the same area of Pennsylvania.<n>

This object had no motor noise and was moving very slowly and did not change its flight direction.  The intensity of the light would dim and then turn bright orange as it moved across the sky.  We walked out into the yard and watched this light move slowly over head and then out of sight.  The first light went over and out of sight then a second, and third light with the same flight formation (single file) followed behind.  All objects were identical and following same flight pattern south to north across the sky with the same slow speed.  The lights were moving under the clouds and very visible to the naked eye.<n>

It moved from west to east and zig-zagged.  It was pitch-black out at night with many stars to be seen....this one was moving and was NOT a shooting star.  Then suddenly 3 more appeared in triangular formation almost like a right angle, maybe obtuse??   Then one reared off from west to east, other went east to west then turned back from west to east, other one followed zig-zag..not sure of direction.   No color in any of them, just a whitish light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weird part was that we had just seen one previously the night before on July 3, 2010 in Amenia, N.Y. waiting for the fireworks show to start...it traveled pretty straight in a line formation, whitish in color, then suddenly illuminated for 2 seconds then kept flying from south to north...then disappeared.<n>

I noticed one object in the sky moving southeast to northwest at a very low rate of speed.  I am not schooled in aviation, but the object appeared to be moving far below the normal altitude of the everyday commercial and miltary flights that are frequent over my location, for Hartsfield Airport and Dobbins AFB. It resembled a cigar shape/zeppelin,  It made no sound and appeared to have no running lights on the underside, but looked like the top was either on fire or illuminated with an amber-orange haze that surrounded the top half.  It made no deviations in its flight path. I am an amateur astronomer spending many nights with my eye on the sky and this object does not correspond to anything I have ever encountered.  The event was witnessed by at least 7 people in my group.<n>

We like to stargaze and took our recliners out into the pasture where we could get a good view of the entire night sky.  We had our radio.  This was at 10pm  sometime between 10 and midnight we saw three strange flashes.  There were three incidences:  two we both saw and one my husband alone saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first one my husband alone saw. He said what he saw was an extremely bright flash of light, right between the two bottom stars of the big dipper.  By time he said &#34;oh wow!&#34; and pointed, it had disappeared.  It wasn&#39;t streaking like a meteor. He said it just got bright and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A while later, maybe 20 minutes to a half hour later I was watching a satellite cross the sky.  I pointed it out to my husband, &#34;I see one!&#34;.  It was directly in front of us.  We both were watching it. As it crossed, it suddenly got extremely bright. So bright the light from it almost hurt my eyes the way high beams from an oncoming car would. It lasted no more than two seconds and them dimmed.  After it dimmed you could no longer see the satellite at all.  I thought maybe it had burned up in space.  There wasn&#39;t an object to track across the sky any longer.  I thought maybe because of the brightness I just couldn&#39;t see it anymore, but it was really gone!  My husband said that was what he had seen earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a third one which wasn&#39;t nearly as bright as the first one I had witnessed.  The third one happened the same way.  Visually tracking a satellite across the sky, this one was further to our North (our right hand side, our chairs were facing West).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It brightened, then disappeared completely from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After hearing reports on the radio last night, July 6th, about others seeing something unusual, I was compelled to write.  We sat out briefly last night and something unusual again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 10:20 we saw the same thing again.  While tracking a satellite across the sky we saw it brighten significantly and then disappear.  This was not as bright as the first one I saw on July fourth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe 15 minutes later we both saw what looked like two satellites traveling North one behind the other quite close (I have NEVER seen that before).  We watched as the one behind then gradually changed direction heading East as the first one continued North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 52 years old. I don&#39;t drink and I have been watching satellites cross the night sky since my early twenties when a friend pointed them out to me while camping.  I know the difference between a high flying plane and a satellite.  I have watched hundreds of satellites cross the sky and I have NEVER EVER seen this kind of thing before.  I have watched them disappear behind the Earth&#39;s shadow but nothing as strange as this.<n>
7/4/10 23:00|Bothell|WA|Fireball|30 sec|Yellow/Orange Lights|7/10/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76309.html|542|ndxe201007| Yellow/Orange Lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 4th of July at about 10:45-11:00pm I witnesses two orange/yellow fireballs traveling W/NW.  I was visiting my cousins and we were outside shooting fireworks until about 11:30.  These particular lights caught my eye because they seemed to be much higher and traveling much faster (and more deliberately) than anything else in the sky.  I thought they were flares with the usual red color distorted by smoke traveling horizontally dues to a light wind we had.  After reading some of the other area sighting, however, I am having second thoughts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights resembled the video of the Phoenix lights I have seen in luminosity and color.  The traveled though the air, one following the next, at the same velocity and same altitude.  I only saw them briefly and didn’t think much of it at the time and went back to blowing stuff up.  We shot off and watched a lot of fireworks that night but these lights definitely caught my eye due to how unusual and out of place they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night on our way back home to Bellingham I saw a single light, just like the two I saw about an hour earlier in Bothell , in the Marysville area while driving on I-5.  Identical in every way except that it was alone and appeared to be stationary.  I, again, wrote it off as a flare, even commenting to my wife how thick the firework smoke must be to distort the color so much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the other reports I’m starting to think what I saw may have been something else since it resembles what other witnesses report seeing around the same time frame in the same vicinity.<n>

The first object appeared from the s by sw going east by Ne. Elevation 2-3K feet up airspeed 300-400 MPH.  It was red/orange in color with some white light apparent on top. It lit the clouds up as it passed. Flew on a straight line, no sound at all.  As I first saw it made me think of a flying burning car. It had a rectangular shape as it crossed my view.  But all of them appeared to be more round then anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the police and asked if anyone else was reporting what we just had seen and was told no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2-3 mins later the second came in a bit more east then the first.  Looked like the same craft.  I thought it had turned around- It followed the path of the first on.  IE it turned a bit to do it.  Again i called the police and was told no one else was reporting it.  They sent out a officer about 7-10 mins later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While waiting the third appeared this one much more eastward then the previous two.  It looked identical to the other two.  Again it turned and followed the other twos path.  I did whip out my blackberry and start shooting.  Got four shots one bright. the other three show it getting smaller as it went away.  Time between pictures was 5-6 seconds so it was moving rather quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People in surrounding suburbs described the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not lanterns or fireworks flying by.  It was weird how you could see the clouds directly above these crafts.<n>

Another teenager next to him joking siad&#39; The aliens are coming&#34;.   But the first teenager kept looking in the sky.  This grabbed my attention.   I looked out the passenger window and noticed a orange round fireball traveling from north to south across the sky.   At first I thought it was shooting star but it was obiviously on fire and as it got closer to the southern horizon if seemed to get smaller and dying out.  I was pointing out the car window.   Both my husband and mother-in-law watched it also.  I would imaging that the car behind us and people walking on the sidewalk witnessed us pointing up and saw it also.<n>

It was a faint orange red mist like circle with orb of light around it.  It was silent and i saw regular jets in flight in the distance but this was much larger and had no flashing lights.It almost did not appear to be a solid object it looked like a strong light mist and it floated directly over us and what appeared a few miles to the east then turned sharply to the south and out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I, did not think anything of it,until we saw it return from the south and head north at a faster rate.Its movments were usually straight but when it changed directions,it just turned sharp but smooth.

At first, I thought was pieces of the fireworks display, the object began to pick up speed and never touched ground, came floating down from the smoke of the fireworks display, faciing North the object &#34;floated&#34; Southbound.  I was facing NW along the ocean front.  The object was orange/redish color, about the size of a basketball or beachball. It was between 22:00 Hrs. And 23:00 Hrs.  Only one object was observed as it came from the clouds without a sound.  My relatives and I observed the object that night.  I know someone else who saw it that happened to catch it on tape.  It was so cool.  Other than that, we had a clear sky in the night, a little cloudy, no rain.<n>

(more north I think)  No other lights on the object that I could see.   Moving at speed of an airplane but no sound, no “structure” seen, no blinking/flashing lights and if I recall correctly it was just below the overcast/clouds it may have been “reflecting a bit” off of them.   It was definitely low in the sky at height of planes I often see going into O’Hare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time Lapse  Aprox 10-15 Secs.    Aprx. Time: 11pm well after fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing looking around in the sky at the stars, planes etc.  I had a set of binoculars around my neck (which I occasionally do now when observing the night sky).  This object caught my attention as I happened to be looking SW.  I kept looking with my bare eyes as it traveled closer towards me (initially dismissing it as probable helicopter or plane).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I still couldn’t make it out, I took two steps forward , looked down to grab the binoculars and sit (so I could steady my hands) to get closer view…………but, in the few seconds it took to look down, grab binocs and glance back up…while trying to feel for the chair………it disappeared.  No where to be found as I continued to pan the sky and recapture it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I was with one other person who did NOT see the object because it disappeared before I made any comment about it.   Even though I was VERY curious about the object, I  kind of “blew it off”  thinking, no way this happens two years in a row, it must have been legit craft and went into the clouds when I diverted my gaze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 Years in a row?  That’s a weird part of this occurrence.  The same thing happened last year (and I reported it on this site then -you can view it there) July 4th 2009.  At about same time/diff trajectory.  But,  in 2009 the color and appearance was more like a Hazy Orange glowing basketball/orb- more definitively round with an entirely fuzzy glow emitting from the object itself.  Now-In 2010 the object was definitely Red and I don’t think I would describe it as purely “round” NOR as having a “hazy” glow……any ambient glow was more of a steady “reflection off clouds” this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry my facts aren’t exact.  As mentioned, I wasn’t going to post this as I find it rather odd that, (1) It happened on Independence Day when millions would likely be looking to the skies.  And (2) Similar events happen two years in a row?  This does not change what I saw – either year --without a doubt.  But, It makes me suspicious that somebody might be pulling off a big hoax/scam/trick somehow….or, some manmade flying thing makes the same trip every year on the 4th?  There were many sightings last year too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to post my observation after I went into your site to see, by chance, if anyone else saw what I saw and was surprised to see one other Streamwood, IL. report. Plus many others elsewhere.  I hope you can investigate this somehow to see if there is an “earthly” answer.  Next year on 4th maybe you can send out trained spotters in Midwest with good equipment?  Last comment:  I found the July 4th 2009 Orange Hazy Glowing Ball much more disturbing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Someone it seems has gone through a great effort to make and release these balloons on the 4th.  And apparently in alot of places around the country.  I believe it was an attempt to take away any credibility of the July 4th 2009 reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The west pittston, and yatesville Pa reports on july 4th 2010 I witnessed and they were man made balloons.  The one closest was only a few hundred yards away, and I saw it burn out with binoculars. That one was small balloons in a net/mesh with weighted orange long burning flares below it.  It flew toward yatesville.  Was released behind the mountain of west pittston,forty fort. Somewhere I&#39;m guessing around carverton road.  I saw the 2009 objects good.  I am sure this was planned but not very well,there was no comparison to 2009 objects, and 2010 balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just needed to tell whoever needs to know.<n>

Rather it was more of a broken, flaming trail.

We were in the backyard at approximately 2300hrs and one of my friends noticed something in the sky.  When I looked up I seen an object in the sky coming from the west/southwest at a very slow rate of speed.  It almost seemed to be &#34;floating&#34; and appeared to be very low, maybe 1500-2000ft elevation.  The object was traveling towards us, or east/northeast. It appeared to be almost directly above us, then gradually turned back heading northwest.  The object was amber or orange in color, and seemed to be sphere shaped.  There were no apparent flashing lights, it was just one glowing light.  No sounds were associated with this object, it was silent. No other aircraft were observed.  I knew as soon as I had seen it that I was seeing something I had never seen before, beyond a shadow of a doubt.  I have in the past seen objects in the sky and wondered what they were and was able to identify them.  I am familiar with satellites, helicopters and other such various aircraft.  It was clearly none of those.  As for the size it was approximatley three to four times the size of the planet Venus in the early evening sky.  It made no sudden movements and was very smooth and slow.<n>

A lighted object went by.  Can&#39;t be sure of size or how far away or how far up it was.  Sphere was illuminated by steady, flickering, yellowish light.  No blinking, on-off lights. No sound.  It could have been a candle underneath a homemade hot air balloon.  However, we think the flight path was too straight, too fast; and it maintained exact elevation and exact direction during the entire period of sighting.  The wind was blowing in the same general direction, but it was gusting, not steady.  The object didn&#39;t behave like you&#39;d expect a balloon to.<n>

As I was thinking &#34;What is that&#34; thinking it was some kind of large display set up my mother voiced out, &#34;What is that?&#34; and her husband said &#34;A UFO&#34; sarcastically, we pulled in our driveway and I ran back to look again and the huge shape in the sky was gone.  My brother got there slightly before me and said that the lights just faded.  They had an orange color.  Then I looked around and I saw 1 more steady orange light that wasn&#39;t moving. I looked away and it was gone again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel like I&#39;m going crazy.  It wasn&#39;t much higher than the rooftops and the lights weren&#39;t very bright but it was still, perfectly still in the sky and definitely had a square shape between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 minutes later there was one orange light moving pretty fast through the sky, much faster than I&#39;ve ever seen a plane move.  Shortly after that there were two planes going the same route  but slower that were obviously some kind of plane or jet flying through the sky.  I think most people would assume that those planes were the four lights but they weren&#39;t.  The lights were smaller, white, and blinking on the last 2 that I saw that I could recognize as planes, everything else I saw tonight I can&#39;t explain or describe well because I haven&#39;t seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m hoping that these were just some experimental US aircrafts because I am really scared now.<n>

This was certainly something to see as whatever it was was most interested in what had been going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had just got done grilling out and blowing fireworks.  As we were cleaning up, our uncle came over and said, “Look over there! What’s that?”  Seven of my family member’s all witnessed what appeared to be UFO‘s.  These UFO’s were in a single formation. We counted approximately seven of them and viewed them for about five minutes.  They had no blinking lights, they were Orange, and were circular.  What we found odd was that they were all traveling in an equal distance apart and would just disappear.

We were out on the dock facing NNE at approx 22:50 on July 4th, 2010.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Roughly 60 degrees above the horizon, to the NNE, we noticed a large orange orb (mag of at least -8) moving across the sky from a north to south direction.  Looking closer we also noticed an other smaller object, white in color in front of the orange object.  The smaller object was visually typical of a satellite with a mag. of +4 or more, barely visible.  I was intrigued as it was not the space station as it would pass on the Southerly horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mid way across the sky the two object disappeared.

I live very close to the beach in Huntington Beach and the fireworks display at the downtown pier had just finished at 9:30 pm.  My sisters and brother were waiting for traffic to subside before the departed home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 seconds after my brother went to the balcony he yelled my name very loud to come outside now.  I proceeded outside to see what the commotion was about to see him pointing in an easterly direction at an object approximately 300 feet in the air at a distance approximately 3/4 to 1 mile away moving in a northerly direction.  The object was cylindrical with bright white lights on the entire exterior of the craft and a flashing red light at the top of the object.  It continued in a northerly direction for approximately 5 seconds when it banked to a easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object banked you could see the object was cylindrical in shape.  It continued in a easterly direction for 10 seconds until out of site due to the low cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My estimation of the size of the craft would be about 200 to 300 feet in length with a width of 75 feet to 100 feet in width.<n>

He agreed that this was a strange red light indeed.  We live below a flight path of the airport so we often see incoming planes in the distance, but usually the planes we see have many red and white lights that are constantly flashing.  This object had one big red glowing light (perhaps a distant orb but all we could see was a bright red light).  We talked about the possibility of a satellite, but it was so red, and seemed much closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved slowly across the sky.  There were occasional fireworks coming from either side of the sighting, but the object was in a clearing between the two houses launching the fireworks.  The light moved too slowly, too horizontally, and too straight to be a stray firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or two of watching it move across the sky, I ran into the house to get my glasses.  The light was moving slow enough that I figured I would have time to get my glasses before the view of the light would be blocked by the trees.  To my surprise, the red light had stopped completely in its tracks. My husband and I continued to stare at the red light, as it seemed to hover in one spot.  It was completely still.  We discussed the possibility of a distant helicopter, but it was silent and completely unwavering.  We probably watched it for 2-3 minutes before the light got smaller and dimmer and suddenly disappeared.  It did not seem to MOVE away.  It seemed like it just faded into nothingness.<n>

It was myself, a 31 year old female and my five year old daughter, my brother and his two children ages three and five, and my parents who are both in their fifties.  We all live next door to each other  in a very rural development at the base of Green Mountain which is known locally for UFO sightings.  It was about 10:35 PM and we had just finished lighting our fireworks.  The sky was clear and we were just catching one last glimpse of the fireworks being lit by the neighbors and getting ready to round up the kids and to say goodnight.  As we were watching the eastern sky we saw a round object very similar in shape to a balloon appear and it was heading in a westerly direction.  It was mostly red with a bright orange glow on the bottom third of the circle.  At first, we actually thought that it was a helium balloon that someone had lit on fire and set free.  But, ! the object was not acting like a balloon would.  It would speed up, slow down, hover for a bit, change directions slightly and then suddenly veer off.  We watched it for about three minutes over my brother’s house and then we noticed that coming in from the south was another one exactly like the first.  This one was moving very quickly and heading right for the first one.  When it was next to the first one they hovered silently together for about five minutes before they went straight up into the sky.  Needless to say we were very disturbed but frankly we weren’t sure if we had seen a UFO or some strange balloon trick by Fourth of July pranksters.  It wasn’t until last night when my brother was fooling around on the internet and found some reports of sights that we were sure of what we had seen.  I personally have not read any other accounts or seen any videos of similar sightings, but I will be looking at them once I get this report filed to see how similar other sighting ! were to ours.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Did not appear to be a helicopter or airplane....the damn thing looked like it was on fire!   I thought it could be a military jet....but its lack of speed/being a weird bright flashy red / orange.....I COULD NOT EXPLAIN IT!  Hopefully someone else has seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend said later in the evening it appeared again and flew over his house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Scares the crap out of me!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My mother shouted, &#34;what is that? Do you see it??&#34;  We all looked.  It was this bright red light, looked circular from where we were.  It just appeared and then hovered there for maybe a minute, then it slowly started moving and then it was gone.  It was so bright I have never seen any light in the sky that bright.  And no, it was not a firework.  We started hearing they were investigating it and I had told a friend of mine and she says it was a firework.  That they have these disc fireworks that go up and then shoot to the side, and they come in all colors.  This was solid red, brighter than any firework I had seen.  And if it were a firework, why was it hovering?  I also want to point out that it was really high up, and I have never seen a firework that high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I look and see a large orange ball of light.  Then I said: &amp;quot;I don&#39;t know.&amp;quot; Our whole group of 4 adults, and 5 children began watching the object and discussing it during and after. We determined quite easily that it was NOT:  a meteor, a satellite, the space station, a party lantern, a firework, a weather balloon, a remote control toy, a helicopter, an airplane, or anything else that we all would be able to recognize.  We had plenty of time to observe it and determine that it was not identifiable, and therefore as far as we were concerned, a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my description of the flying orange sphere in detail:  It was more of an amber color than orange, with a vibrating yellow edge.  It appeared the size of a silver dollar held at arms length, but this was at roughly 5000 feet altitude, at the base of the clouds.  The clouds directly above it were softly glowing as it flew towards us (from north to south) in a slow bending &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; pattern. It then paused dropped down a little bit, then, at a slightly faster pace, headed west towards Marysville Wa.  The object did not make any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My original report was removed for some reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was checking out similar reports from the same night and noticed that they match what my group saw, and were heading in the same westward direction, in the same region, around the same time.  I don&#39;t know why NUFORC removed my report.  It is as genuine as it gets.<n>

The street we were on ran north and south. A red fireball appeared in the northern skies, directly north of us, and we initially thought that it was a flare someone had shot off.  The red fireball continued to fly overhead and to the south-south-east.  It was definitely flying lower than a commercial airliner but higher that a local police or news helicopter would be flying. Its altitude was more like what the local military jets fly.  Its flight speed was also similar to what U.S. jet would be.  Also, it did not emit any noticeable jet, propeller, or helicopter rotor sounds.  Once it was almost out of site, it appeared to increase altitude and head back northerly along the same path.  We then notice two additional red fireballs coming from the same northern location and travel along the same path as the first.  I ran into the hou! se to get my binoculars and viewed the crafts as small single balls of reddish light; no other shape of the craft was apparent in the dark night sky.  One member of our party took two digital still pictures of one of the crafts with little to no enhancement by the limited zoom.  Before the end or the half hour encounter, four more craft individually traveled overhead from the north to the south.  All craft had the same attributes.  We did not stay out any longer than that due to our lack of fireworks and the night was very cold and windy.<n>

It moved slowly from the east towards the west and then veered to the southwest.   The light seemed to be over the town.   We witnessed the light for about 1 ½ min.  The light appeared to be about 2500 feet above the ground and then seemed higher in the sky as it moved towards the southwest.   We could not hear any sound coming from the light.  In Ipswich, it would be very unusual for light aircraft to fly this late at night and this low, and we would have heard the engine.  We also felt it was not a balloon as it traveled faster than the speed of the wind that night.  We had no explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Trying to explain what we had seen we assumed it had to be a hot air balloon which would explain the fire.  After watching it for about 5 minutes a second and third one appeared to the west of it i think it would be.  I would also like to add that there were about 10 other people that were there trying to figure out what they were as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then decided to drive to a nearby school and ended up seeing 2 more of the &#34;fireballs&#34;.

They were about a half a mile in the air and made no sound at all.  The UFO’s stayed the same distance apart, and really had no formation that I could recognize. This cluster of Red orbs moved out of sight in 5 to 6 minutes.  Then as I watched the sky I saw one single red orb come from the east, moving to the west the same path as the cluster moved.

The date is July 4th 2010, time is approximately 22:00 hrs.  I was taking some long exposure photo&#39;s of the few fireworks the city of Womelsdorf budget allowed, not really looking at what it was that was happening in front of the lens.  I was just trying to keep the shutter open long enough to get a shot of the fire works over the cornfield, into the valley below.  My location is 40 degrees, 24&#39;,39 north x 76 degrees, 14&#39;,31 west.  Photo&#39;s that I have e-mailed to the director were shot at 173 degrees south to 132 degrees south south/east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon viewing the photo&#39;s on the computer about an hour later, I came across some light formations in the sky on the photo&#39;s that none of the kids or my wife could remember seeing  during the short display of fireworks we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The long thin line with 12 red lights and 13 white lights running along the line show up in several photo&#39;s.  Some of the photo&#39;s have 2 (two) or 3(three) of these objects in them.  There are also some strange greenish/yellow swooshes accompanying these objects in some of the photo&#39;s.  There is also a red and a green linear light  below the large linear group of 12 red lights and 13 white lights.  All of these objects show up on the group of photo&#39;s in different locations around the area the fireworks were located.  There is even one photo where the objects are behind the fireworks.  These objects are definitely not a part of the fireworks, since they appear the same, with no change over the 15 to 20 sec. exposure time.<n>

The camp is located approximately half way between Coudersport, PA and Galeton, PA (not too far from Denton Hill State Park).  Sometime around 22:20, we noticed an orange fireball going slowly across the sky.  The fireball appeared to be traveling from North to (SouthEast).  The five of us were astonished.  It did not look like a plane or helicopter.  It was definitely an orange glowing ball.  My husband and friend felt for sure they saw some type of tail at the end of it.  I did not notice it.  The fireball was traveling in a fairly straight line at first.  Then it seemed to change directions (zigzag) several times, almost as though it was losing its course.  After viewing this for several minutes, the glow became less and less until we couldn’t see it anymore.  It did not appear to have traveled out of view, but more like it burnt out.  It was not a shooting s! tar and did not look like a meteor.  Nor, was it ‘The Northern Lights’, not even close.  It also was not part of a fireworks display.  It was extremely high in the sky.  For those people who may say it was just too much July 4th celebrating, our 14 year old daughter witnessed this also.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We left the store around 10:15 pm. My store receipt reads that we checked out at 22:10:13.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the fourth of July and there were many fireworks in the area.  We were driving west.   As we turned south toward our neighborhood, I noticed a red and orange fireball just above the trees to the west.   It seemed to have a red center with a orange misty glow around it.  It was about the height of a street light and from our point of view, the outer glow looked like the size of a basketball.  It was difficult to tell if the &#34;glow&#34; was part of object or due to viewing it through the windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I traveled a block south and turned west on a street toward our neighborhood.   I turned a street earlier than I usually do to get a better look at the object.  When I came to the next intersection, 1/2 block distance, we saw the object above a house to the south.  We turned south.  I told my 11 year old son to keep an eye on it as I drove.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I traveled the length of two more blocks (still going south)  and then turned west again.  The object was now above the houses on the south side of the west bound street.  We drove two blocks to our house.  I pulled into the driveway.  My husband was in the yard with the kids.  I jumped out of the car and pointed it out to my husband.  It was south of our house in the sky at about a 45 degree angle and getting small but still too bright to be a star - and it was orange red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We  watched it get smaller assuming it was getting further away.   It took several minutes before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and the family continued to shoot  fireworks.  I would estimate I was in the house ten minutes when my  son came in and said &#34;Dad needs you.&#34;   When I asked why, my son said, &#34;The orange light is back&#34;.   Sure enough.  In the same spot it disappeared it appeared again  It looked like a very bright orange star.  I watched it for several minutes then came inside.  My husband reported it moved slightly to the west and then grew small and disappeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What drew our attention to the object was the  fourth of July fireworks in our area.   As we were driving home and nearing our neighborhood, we were watching the fireworks.   A large firework in that area lit off but this orange ball didn&#39;t move.   We expected it to explode and it didn&#39;t.   At first I thought it was a street light on fire or a fire in the trees.   Then as it floated above the houses, I wondered if it were a parachute type firework that was on fire and I was concerned about where it was going to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first saw it, it was floating about the height of the street light and below the trees.  It climbed to float above a one story house.  Soon it was above the larger two story houses and when we finally saw it in the distance it seemed to be very high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We zigzagged in a south and west pattern to our home.  The object seemed to move south - southwest.  My vehicle was moving slowly at a 15 mph estimated speed.  The object moved ahead of us and I would assume it moved a quicker speed than our vehicle,  but not much given that it dissected our route.<n>

In the west and northwest there was a band of light-colored sky extending from the horizon upward about 15 degrees.  (Usually at this time of evening at this latitude, the sky is entirely dark.)   At the edge of this band of light the sky turned very dark.  In the dark area there appeared an unusual “disc” of gold or orange-colored light.  It stood out in stark contrast to its nearly black surrounding.  The disc stayed in a fixed position at about 75 degrees up in the NW sky for several minutes, then appeared to “drift” several degrees – perhaps 10 – upward and northward, then stopped again before fading away.  The night sky was cloudy and it looked like the disc faded out, it was not covered up by the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disc reminded me of the symbol for a hurricane on a weather map.  It was round, but had one point instead of the two found on the hurricane symbol.  It was also blurry and indistinct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The diameter of the disc appeared to be between a quarter and a half of the diameter of a full moon.  Of course, not knowing either the size of the disc or its distance from my location, it is impossible to “guesstimate” either value.<n>

There was one object that was a reddish orange looking fireball that glowed constantly. The UFO looked about the size off a basketball.  The object seemed to float from SW to NE and was traveling directly over head.  The time span of this event was approximately 5 mins. Then the UFO just vanished in thin air.  All the spectators in our area saw the UFO.  There was roughly 10 people who were commenting aloud about what they all saw.<n>

There were nearly 20 of us present including several children under the age of 10.  At 22:15 one of us noticed an orange light in the sky almost directly to the east of us maybe a few miles away.  The light was moving above the tree line but quite a bit lower than an airplane.  There was absolutely no sound at all with the light.  It moved slowly towards us then veered slightly to the south and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was translucent with a slight haze around it’s border.  It was traveling around 20 to 30 miles per hour.<n>

I parked my car behind the building and watched the light for 15-20 minutes.  There was a very light thin cloud cover this evening so most stars weren’t very visible and this light appeared to be below the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:32 PM the light suddenly dimmed to a dark blue color and became difficult to see.  It stayed this color for 10-15 seconds and then faded out completely to black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could no longer see the object and I wasn’t able to make out any shape in place of the light.

We saw 2 reddish balls in the sky east of us kind of low. (were not fireworks) (maybe near McDill Airforce base)   They were just there not moving much and one finally flew off towards the northwest.  It was not close enough to see any details of the red globe.  We could not see the other light after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took a picture.  It is not a real good picture since we did not have a high powered camera but there is clearly a round red ball visible.<n>

At first we thought it was fireworks but it just hovered in the eastern sky and came over the top of us.  Then it went straight up in the sky out of sight.  Then we saw it in the western sky. It was much higher this time and it went across the sky and was gone.  This lasted for about 30 minutes and it didnt make any noise.  It was simply amazing the way it bounced around in the sky.  It made moves that unlike any aircraft Ive seen.<n>

We were watching fireworks that the neighbors were shooting off for the Fourth of July, so our eyes were on the sky. I noticed a very unusual &#34;firework&#34; that was higher than the low-flying clouds.  I pointed and asked my boyfriend (we are both over 50 and were not drinking)&#34;What the heck is THAT?!!&#34;  The object we both saw was coming from the east and headed in a straight line toward the west. It definitely looked man-made because it appeared to have flames on the bottom, but it was so high up that it could not have been a normal kind of fireworks.  The fact that we could detect flames even though it was so high up made us think the actual &#34;object&#34; had to be fairly large.  It traveled at a speed that was like if you watch the ISS go over or something like that except that it was much closer to earth than that (the ISS) or even satellites.  We have no idea what it was we saw, but neither of us had ever before seen anything like it.  My boyfriend has! been a novice astronomer for many years, fyi.  We weren&#39;t timing it but I am guessing it took a little over a minute before it faded out of view still flying on course.  There was a top on it above the flames, but it&#39;s been almost a month now and I honestly cannot remember well enough to describe the part above the flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was listening to George Noory last night and heard mention of the Fourth of July sightings.  I had no idea where to report this phenomena at the time, but hope this report will be of help even though it&#39;s approximately a month old.<n>

I told my wife ( former flight attendant ) who was equally surprised at how odd this pulsating light was.  As we walked we both noticed another couple that was looking at it about 20 feet ahead of us.  They were both very excited stating that they had never seen anything like it - we all just stood there and stared at it as it slowly ascended - straight up - not across the horizon, it became smaller and smaller in size and eventually became just a pin-point tiny little red pulsating light and then gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all looked at each other amazed and all agreed that we had seen something unusual - this was a  really strange event, one that my wife and I are still talking about today.<n>

I first looked up to the sky and noticed a light moving across the sky very slowly as if it were an aircraft.  I mentioned that they had a great view of fireworks around the area and my friends looked up. Just as they did the craft made an erratic move then shot across the sky  heading north at an astonishing speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are all in our fifties so we are not young kids making up a story.

I was looking at the sky facing south when my attention was drawn to a very bright reddish light low in the sky. It was about the size of a star, but it was the brightest thing in the sky. I watched if for about 2-3 seconds, before I realized it was obviously moving directly toward my position. It was getting visibly closer and appearing larger by the second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my son’s attention to it, and he also saw it. By this time it was not quite directly over our heads. I got a very good look at it. It appeared to be a round ball of reddish orange flame.  It definitely had the appearance of flames, but there was no visible smoke or sparks. It was completely silent and moving in a straight line, south to north.  I saw no visible structure of any type. There was no noticeable wind blowing at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed almost directly over our heads. I turned around so I could continue to watch it as it passed by me on its way north.  After watching it for a few seconds now from behind it, I saw it make a little series of zigzag movements, right, left, then right left, again.  It then continued heading off to the north in a straight line until it disappeared from my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was impossible for me to accurately estimate the speed, size, or altitude, in the dark sky. If I was going to guess based on my gut feeling, I feel it was smaller (less than 3 ft. in diameter), rather than a large object and at a few hundred feet elevation, rather than higher. It was moving quickly relative to its size.  The total time I watched it was about 20-30 seconds, maybe slightly longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are a couple of things I am sure it wasn’t. It wasn’t a firework, like a rocket or mortar. It was totally silent, slower, and left no trail. It also did not look like any flare I have seen either. It was not smoking, sparking, leaving a trail, or appear to be dangling from a parachute.<n>

We saw the same shape again coming from the south but a little farther east.  This time one appeared then followed by another then followed by another.  Each one was evenly paced.

Actually the red/orange colored looked like more like an aura around a dark center.  It was too fast to be a normal satellite but slower than most shooting stars.  It wasn&#39;t bright like other objects in the sky and just barely noticeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One would have had to be looking right at it to notice it.  It was one of those cases of just happening to be looking at the right place at the right time.  The odd thing was that at one point it appeared to slow down and then speed up again. It never changed its course though.  The trajectory was very straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To give you some background on me, I was a police officer for eight years before being medically retired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw wasn&#39;t a normal satellite like I see in the sky all the time.

I was also moving very slowly and at times not at all. It would be very bright and a few minutes later it would be very dim, and fade to nothing at all only to brighten back up or be somewhere else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on the Carl Perkins bridge waiting for the 4th of July fireworks to start. We first saw it at twilight in the northeast at 50 to 75 feet up. We managed to catch a picture of it as well. We watched it for maybe 10 minutes as it brightened and dimmed and wondered up and down, side to side. The color of the light was orangeish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the show started, the light wandered to the east and parked above the grant bridge (but much farther out). Again it would wander about dim, brighten, ascend and descend. We also caught it on camera a few more times during the show as my Girlfriend was taking photos of the show. The photos was shot on a Sanyo s1070 with iso speed 200, exposure time 4 sec, focal length 7mm, max ap 2.97  After the show, we dumped the pics onto our computer and quickly forgot about the whole thing. We wew on this site looking at a report i had made several years back about spinning stars when i saw the report entitled: 7/6/08 22:00 	Portsmouth 	OH 	Light 	20 min 	More Info on Portsmouth Bright-Dim Lights. 	10/31/08 7/6/08 02:00 	Portsmouth 	OH 	Light 	45 mins 	Bright yellow light would dim and brighten itself. Hovered quickly across the sky back and forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We know the photos are not great, but we were lucky to have caught them in the first place.  When trying to photo it, we couldn&#39;t see it in the lcd view screen and assumed we would be able to capture it.  So she set her camera to a longer exposure and sure enough we caught it several times.  We would ask that anyone viewing the photos understand that it wasnt the easy to photograph due to the nature of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also making the exact location on google earth with photos if it helps.

Yes, I understand that everyone is shooting fireworks into the sky.  However, what I witnessed I do not believe were fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with a group of friends, some adults and some children.  We were firing off fireworks on a dead end street.  Lots of people in surrounding areas were doing the same. We had just fired off the last of the fireworks and things became quiet for a few minutes.  As I walked into the street I heard one of my friends say, &#34;Hey check out thos!&#34;  As I looked up into the sky, I was expecting to see some more fireworks exploding, only these did not appear to be fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw in the sky that night were small, round, what I considered to be balls of light.  They were a yellowish orange color.  At first there were only 2 that I could see so I continued to watch them.  They were moving constantly at the same speed from the south to the north. These objects were moving horizontally not vertically.  Everyone in our group became fixated on these things. Within seconds we saw more balls of light following. I really started to pay attention at this point.  I asked my friends if they had any idea what they were, although no one had any good ideas.  These things just kept coming from the south and fading off to the north.  I started to take some pictures on my phone because I had no idea what these were.  I don’t have a video phone so all I got was still pictures. I wanted to narrow this down to somehow explain this.  These things were not making any noise that I could tell, they all stayed in the same position as they moved by, and they were not moving! fast.  From the time you first saw one it would take at least 1 to 2 minutes until you could not see it anymore.  There was no smoke or con trails behind these objects.  They did not flash or have any lights on them.  These things were round in shape but you could not see any “hard” lines on them.  They were on what seemed to be a straight line path going from south to north. I did not count them because of the sheer volume of these things.  There had to have been over 100 of these.  They all trailed pretty close behind one another and just kept coming, yet they were not in any pattern or formation.  I would guess that these objects were trailing across the sky over the distance of at least 5 to 10 miles.  From start to finish we watched these things for every bit of 10 minutes. I actually called my girlfriend to ask her if she could see the same thing in a neighboring town, she could not see what we did.  I talked to other friends that were just about 1 mile away from us and they ! said they saw them but thought they were hot air balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends did not seem to be concerned about this and were saying that there was probably an explanation.  I myself was not satisfied with this. When I got up the next day this was all I could think about.  I started to look on the internet for answers but got none.  I have lived next to an air force base all of my life and have seen many aircraft in the sky yet what I saw that night I cannot explain and I wish I could.  I actually thought that since this was such a huge thing going on in the sky on the 4th of July that it would be all over the news and in the news paper, yet there were no news stories.  I believed that thousands of people had to have witnessed this also, there has to be video of this somewhere, and credible people had to have seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I witnessed that night I still can’t explain and I am still looking for answers.  I do not assume that these were &#34;UFOs.&#34;  However until I can find out what they were; they are still UNIDENTIFIED!  I remember clearly what happened that night and I am willing to tell anyone, I just want some answers.<n>

Then a friend said to look up to the sky and see the large bright light.  It was the same ball of light only much larger and closer now.  I continued to watch it as it got smaller and then suddenly disappeared from the night sky.  It was silent, not a helicopter or a plane.  No blinling lights and no noise.  It  had flown on somekind of path around the house....seeming to circle the house but could not tell the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This is about 8 miles North of Omaha, Nebraska.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of the fourth of July, I was standing out at the end of my driveway taking pictures of fireworks with a Canon 40D SLR with a digital image stabilizing lens that is 70-300mm zoom.  (About $3000.00 worth of equipment). I was not using a tripod, but hand held so I could move around to catch the fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The front of my house faces straight West.  The night had a broken cloud base, more open than clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:55 pm I noticed a reddish orange light to the South, South west from where I was standing about 2 to 3 miles away coming from the Bennington Nebraska area.  It was moving very slow to slow to be a plane and heading almost straight North.  It had no blinking lights at all. It was just above the cloud base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my camera set on manual mode and was running the shutter speed between 4 and 8. I took a few pictures of the light and after zooming in on it I could see that it wasn’t one light, but three real close together.  We have had helicopters come by and at about that distance before and we could not hear a thing when normally we could.  After watching it for about 5 minutes, I went back to the house to get my wife and show it to her.  Of course she saw it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued to travel North until they were just South of my location, then took a 90 degree turn to the East for a very short distance (guessing ½ to 1 mile) then another 90 degree turn back to the South.  Looking at the night sky it would be like the directions of the eraser end of a new pencil.  After watching them head back South about ½ the distance from when I first noticed them.  It was like someone threw a light switch and the lights went out.  Gone.  Way before they would have flown out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 to 15 minutes later I saw them again straight in front of my house, looking West.  They looked to be about 1 to 2 miles out.  There were different times that through the camera I could see that they didn’t stay in a group, but would spread out in a line.  If it was one object I would see a leader and then a trail, with the lens settings I was using,  However you can see the trails, but with three balls in the trail.  A leader, one in the middle and one towards the end.  I took 55 pictures of them in all.  They kept heading in a Northern direction and it looked like they would have gone just North of Blair Nebraska.  Some pictures came out pretty good, some not, due to the speed of the lens or my movement.  The entire time that they were visible was about 20 to 30 minutes.<n>

Animated movie from prior sighting of 1997.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We call this event &#34;The July Orb&#34; because we have witnessed this twice before, all in July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event this year, 2010, was over Bothell, WA.  An orange, glowing orb silently and smoothly cruised from North to South in the same way a satellite would move, but was only as high up as a helicopter would fly. Myself, two other adults and two children also saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My camera was at the ready to photograph our fireworks and to pause light in the sky, and I was able to take a photograph!  The camera zoom is a 12x.  While the photo shows a tail, this is only due to the shutter being open as the orb moved.   The falling tail in the photo is due to me trying to find it to focus. Perhaps someone can figure out the size of this orb and it&#39;s speed based on these details!  Our neighbor came by and as I showed him the picture and explained what we saw he asked &#34;Do you mean like THAT!?&#34; Pointing up, there was the same thing, moving in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HISTORY Event 1: I first saw this same orb over Bothell WA, July 1997, and called Mr. Davenport to report it. I was so amazed that I created an animated version because it was hard for others to believe there was no other way to describe it other than a mystery object.  It also moved North to South, slowing and silently gliding.  However, the object was closer than the described 2010 event as I could see it pass behind trees in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event 2: July 2009, Couer D&#39;Alene Idaho, 11 or 12 pm. My husband and my sister witnessed this same orb while sitting on the dock (south and west end of the lake).  However, it raised vertically from behind a home on the same cove about 6 or 7 houses south, or the trees behind it.  It glided silently and smoothly up, then past them and over the lake and then just disappeared.  The next day they went door to door hoping others had seen this, but no one had.<n>

7/4/10 22:00|Deer Park|OH|Changing|45-50 minutes|Looking NE there was a bright round/triangular object hovering in the sky and moving sporadically; changed in shape, size, & brightness|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76167.html|624|ndxe201007| Looking NE there was a bright round/triangular object hovering in the sky and moving sporadically; changed in shape, size, &amp; brightness<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night on Sunday, July 4th, 2010, in Deer Park Ohio (just outside of Cincinnati) at around 10:00pm my mom (medical field), her boyfriend (ex-army officer) and I (student) went outside to look at fireworks.   After a few minutes, my mom&#39;s boyfriend  looked North East and pointed at a bright object in the sky.  At first he thought it was a star of some kind, but it became apparent after a few minutes that it was too large and bright to be a star.  The object appeared to be a ways in the distance, though I couldn&#39;t say the exact miles.  At first it looked rounded in shape and a bright white, though after time it would change in shape and also brightness.  The shape would change from round to almost triangular, would dim and brighten, and would also at time get smaller and the stretch out again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the three of us arguing about what it could be (approx. 15 minutes later), I noticed more and more that it seemed to be hovering rather than still standing.  From the time we first spotted it, to around 10:20pm it had moved (in comparison) from one end of our house to the other.  After more speculating, I went inside to grab my moms&#39; phone camera and also a small pair of binoculars.  Finally, now having a better view of the hovering object, I honestly cannot tell you what it was.  I&#39;ve never seen any star, aircraft or anything of that sort like that before in my life; both my mom and her boyfriend said the same.  Using the binoculars the object appeared triangular but seemed to have a faint rounded halo around it.  It was bright with in the center but also had small blue/green &#34;lights&#34; (quotation because I don&#39;t know how else to describe them).  Every so often it looked as though there were bright red streaks that would flare out from the object almost like what you wou! ld see on a jet of some sort.  After watching it more closely we started seeing it move sporadically up and down, and to the left.  The movement wasn&#39;t big, but enough so that it was clearly noticeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time now was around 10:30pm, and while myself and my mom were still watching it, my mother&#39;s boyfriend got bored and went back into the house.  I really wanted to see if we could get a better view of the object, so I talked my mom into driving closer toward it.  We went down streets and back roads and were able to follow it for quite a ways.  We got a little closer to it, but in the end it was late, and we were too tired to keep driving.  I last saw the strange object at around 10:45-10:50pm when we turned around back toward home.  Once we arrived, now around 11pm, we searched the entire sky around us, (of course including where we first spotted it)  but saw no trace of the strange bright object any longer. It&#39;s as if it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even thinking back on it now, It was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before... it was so brilliant and brightly colored, even more than the tiny specks of stars around it. But the shape of it is unlike any air craft I know of. It was and still is incredibly fascinating. Though unfortunately, my moms&#39; phone camera was all we had at the time... So the few pictures we took came out unclear and did not do justice to how amazing it looked with the binoculars aid.  A few photos we did take however, show the relative size as well as it moving (you can clearly see a &#34;tail&#34; or steak behind the object.) If you want the photos I will gladly send them to you. And also, any information you may have as to what this object could&#39;ve been or even if someone around our location reported something similar, we would be most grateful. Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We had been watching fireworks from his rooftop.  His house is in the most elevated part of the city, so we could see fireworks going off from all different directions.  Neither of us had done any drugs or drinking that night, so we know for sure what we saw.  Once the fireworks had ended, we stayed at the roof to look at the stars. All of the sudden, 5 orange lights, in a triangular formation, rose straight up from the ground in the far distance, but close enough for us to clearly see. It did not rise on an angle like a jet or plane would.  It &amp;quot;hovered&amp;quot; for a few minutes while we watched in awe and wondered what it could be. It was clearly not any type of flare or firework because it has risen very slowly and did not descend.  Quickly, it took off across the sky and made no noise.  I have never seen an object move so quickly and it was clearly not a jet.  To this day we still talk about it and regret! not trying to take a video!<n>
7/4/10 22:00|North Bend|NE|Unknown|Minutes|"Burning" flying object passes at least 3 times east of North Bend, Nebraska, USA|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76165.html|626|ndxe201007| &#34;Burning&#34; flying object passes at least 3 times east of North Bend, Nebraska, USA<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object sighted:  Yellow-orange flying object which appeared to be &#34;burning&#34; from the quality of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location:  North Bend, Nebraska, USA<n> <n><n> <n><n> Direction:  East<n> <n><n> Angle of view:  Approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family and I spotted a flying object flying almost exactly north, in the sky east of North Bend, Nebraska. The sighting took place on July 4th, 2010.  My wife and I were lighting fireworks in the back yard of her parents&#39; house when suddenly the people at the house started talking and pointing to the east.  They called out to me, &#34;What is that?&#34; I saw a light moving far in the distance. Initially I thought it was a helicopter because the light seemed to flicker, like the flame of a candle.  However it was high and very fast and the light seemed to be one of burning, and not an electric halogen bulb like you see on modern aircraft.  Additionally, there were no red and white strobe lights that are standard on regulation aircraft (we could clearly see these on commercial aircraft passing at cruising altitude high overhead).  It continued north (it had first been spotted to the southeast of us), and the light didn&#39;t really change as our perspective of it did as it passed (i.e., there was no dimming effect like you might get from headlights passing you as the craft eclipses its lights, etc.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying quickly, at least the speed of a large helicopter or a plane. After a minute or so it was across the sky, and northeast of us, when it rather quickly faded out of sight entirely. This was surprising to us because we were seeing commercial jets far over head and could clearly make out their blinking red and white lights over an altitude of at least 15,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object (or a second one, identical to the first) appeared again about 15 to 20 minutes later, again in the southeast.  It followed the exact same flight pattern as the previous, vanishing again in what we can say at best was the same spot as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A third and identical sighting took place roughly an hour after the first one.  By the third time it came around, we had gone inside to get some binoculars. The object was difficult to focus on, but the characteristics of the light coming from the object was more akin to the flame of a candle than the steady shine of an electric source.  I&#39;d say it was about 10 times brighter at least than the brightest star in the sky at that point, and perhaps three times the diameter of any of the stars.  My father in law was able to track it in his binoculars, and describes that it seemed like a round object, like looking at a disc on its side or perhaps a sphere, with the burning light coming from around the perimeter of the circumference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All in all, the sightings took place between 10:00 pm and 11:00 pm, US Central time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 6 adults and 2 young children at that house, and we all saw it each time.  After the third one, my father-in-law and I went next door to see if the neighbor had seen the same thing.  She and her two grandsons had seen it during one of the fly-overs.  She thought at first that it was a basket from a hot air balloon, saying that the light&#39;s quality made her think of the hot air generator present in such balloons. But she quickly realized it was moving far too fast to be a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object&#39;s trajectory was more or less level across the sky, parallel to the ground for an apparent distance of several miles, except at the end it could possibly have been increasing altitude, but hard to say without any precise measurements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day (July 5th), we communicated with some family who live in Wichita, Kansas, and they saw the same object flying in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though the light was the brightest thing in the sky (the moon was not visible at this time), we heard no sound from the object on any of the three passes, only the sound of fireworks across town.  Also there was not much wind that day, so the object(s) appeared to have had to be flying under their own power.<n>

It followed our car for quite some time, though when we stopped, it did keep moving, then it faded out until we started moving again, it would become illuminated again.  We were all scared and decided to head home.  I&#39;ve never seen it again, but looking through this site, thousands of others saw this around the same date.<n>

7/4/10 21:55|Polk City|IA|Other|5 mins total|I was walking my dog before the 10:00 news, looked up at the sky and saw an orange glowing object.|7/10/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76348.html|633|ndxe201007| I was walking my dog before the 10:00 news, looked up at the sky and saw an orange glowing object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting occurred on Sunday July 4, 2010 at approximately 9:55 PM.  This was at Saylorville Lake in Polk City, Iowa, at Prairie Flower campground, Coneflower Loop.  I was taking my dog for a short walk and glanced up at the night sky, as I always do.  It was overcast, so I didn’t notice any stars, but there was a glowing orange object.  I had to stop and stare at it as long as I could see it, which was probably 2 or 3 minutes.  It looked to me to be kind of a disc shape, with an oblong oval shape up through the middle.  It was glowing orange.  It looked like it had a red light on top momentarily.  It didn’t have a real crisp shape.  I’m not sure if that was because it was glowing or what.  I was facing the West and looking up at about a 30 degree angle.  I’m not sure if that’s right, but it wasn’t directly overhead, but slightly down.  In relationship to the size of a full moon, I would say it was about ¼ that size when the moon is high in the sky.  I was! n’t sure if it was above or below the clouds.  It didn’t move, but faded away.  I wasn’t sure if clouds just blocked my view at that point or what.  A car drove up, so I moved to let them by.  They commented on how strange the sky looked earlier.  I agreed and told them I was looking at my first UFO.  I was thinking they thought I was crazy, but the lady stopped me the next morning and said she saw what I was looking at after I had walked on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes after my initial sighting, just up the road a bit, I looked up and saw it again!  I watched it for a bit longer this time.  It was in the same area and looked the same, except I didn’t notice the red light on top this time.  It did move slightly back and forth and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn’t frighten me.  It captivated me!  I have looked at and admired the night sky all my life and have never seen anything like it!  I have even lived in the Mojave Desert, where there are no city lights to interfere, and other than the moon and stars, have only seen planes and the occasional satellite.  I wasn’t thinking of UFOs or even looking for one when I saw this.  And no, I wasn’t drinking, and there were no fireworks nearby.<n>
7/4/10 21:50|Derby|CT|Fireball|2-3 mins|Fireball moving across the sky|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76116.html|634|ndxe201007| Fireball moving across the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just before 10pm on July 4 in Derby, CT, and my girlfriend and I had just gotten to my house.  I had ran inside real quick to turn on the air conditioner and neighbors were setting off fireworks and an orange ball of fire came from over the trees near where the neighbors were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend yelled to me from outside thinking it was one of the fireworks headed for the house and when I finally got outside to see what she was yelling about, the object continued across the sky from West to East at a constant speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was a plane on fire, but it wasn&#39;t exactly a &#34;flashing light&#34; that you would typically see on an airplane, it really looked like something on fire moving across the sky.  It looked like it was about the size of a plane, but it was flying far to low.  We lost sight of the object after it went over my house, and when we walked around the house to track it, the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could have possibly been a missile launch, it definitely was not fireworks.  I&#39;m not sure how many people witnessed this event other than the two of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m hoping that we weren&#39;t the only ones.<n>

I thought it was an airplane.  My family and some friends walked south down our street to 34th Ave and Stone Way in Fremont to watch the fireworks show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then approximately 9:50 pm and I noticed the same light in the sky.  This time the light was in a southwest position near the Aurora bridge and possibly 2 miles high in the air, I would say equal distance above Lake Union between Queen Ann hill and Fremont.  It seemed to hover in this area for 5 minutes and was much larger than an airplane light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family and friends commented on this orb of light with some other people waiting to see the fireworks show.  This was definitely not fireworks or other aircraft.  It stayed in one spot for 5 approximately mintues and then moved straight up in the sk! y.  The light was so bright it could be seen through the light clouds and was gone in about 10 seconds maybe less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light orb did not travel in any direction, just straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see the light again.<n>

In my career I have seen many strange things, but this observation clearly tops them all as far as being unexplained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 4, 2010, at approximately 2145 to 2155 hours, I was sitting near the bank of the Missouri River on the 300 Block of River Drive North in Great Falls Mt.  I was sitting with my family waiting for the city fireworks display that was set to start at approximately 2200 hours.  We were sitting on the east side of the river facing westbound where the fireworks display was going to be launched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were waiting for the show I noticed an aircraft flying eastbound over the city (Est. elevation 10,000 feet high).  Normally this would not be note worthy because we were sitting under the flight path of airplanes landing and taking off from the Great Falls International Airport.  This particular craft caught my attention because it appeared to flying too high to have just taken off from the runway.  Normally, I have noticed flights that don’t land at the airport fly on the outskirts of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I noticed an extremely large glowing yellow/reddish color light underneath the aircraft.  The light took up the whole diameter of the craft.  The light appeared to be the approximate size of a Boeing 747.  I observed no red or green tail or wing lights on the craft.  There was no apparent spotlight shining in front of the craft.  I also could not hear the craft’s engine.  It should be noted it was extremely windy and this could have had an effect on the sound waves reachi! ng my location.  The craft also appeared to be flying slower than a jet craft would have at that altitude that was not planning on landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, I pointed the craft out to my wife.  At the same time we both said we have never seen an airplane or helicopter that looked like that.  We debated over whether a satellite would have the same characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time there were approximately 15 people that were sitting near us on the riverbank.  Several of them were watching the craft also.  Some of their conversations were similar in nature to ours (Unknown names of the other witnesses).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the craft as it continued eastbound until I lost site of it as it headed east past the city.  Great Falls has Malmstrom Air Force Base, Homeland Security Base, and the Montana Air National Guard.  My job has allowed me some access to these bases on occasion.  To my knowledge, none of the aircraft they fly looks like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After hearing about similar related sightings of this nature on July 4th on Coast to Coast, I felt compelled to pass on my observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this information will help, I just wish there could be an explanation for what we observed.<n>

I was looking east at about 9:45pm when I noticed what looked like a lantern with orange flames in it up in the sky.  It was slowly moving NNE.  Then I noticed that there were 3 &#34;lanterns&#34; in formation moving NNE at about 20 mph.  I thought they were part of some type of airplane until I noticed that I could see distant fireworks within the triangle formed by the 3 objects. My father&#39;s eyesight is not as good as mine and he did not see the objects clearly.  He did report seeing &#34;dim lights&#34; but nothing clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were moving in the exact same direction and speed.  One object was in the lead and the other two were at the same altitude following.  All objects appeared to be like flames – orange and flickering. It appeared that the &#34;flames&#34; were encased in rectangles.  The objects were bigger than stars but much smaller than the moon.  I would estimate the objects to be 20 feet high by 15 feet wide, at about 500 feet altitude, approximately a half mile away.  The objects continued to move NNE until they were out of sight.  There was no sound coming from the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 50-something homeowner and have an MBA.  I have never seen nor reported anything like this before.  My eyesight is good for distance and I was not under the influence of any intoxicants.<n>

The lights were stationary and stretched from the horizon to well above a 45 degree angle in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There appeared to be a faint string connecting the lights, maybe 30 of them in a line that was crooked at intervals, as though they were being towed by a plane (probably moving south as they appeared stationary).<n> <n><n> <n><n> No it wasn’t fireworks. They stayed lit and then with I circled back within several miles they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t believe it was an alien UFO.

I was in the park with my family for the city of Franklin fireworks display. As usual, there were small aircraft occasionally flying overhead and several private fireworks displays going off nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed out to my wife a steady, orange light in the sky, slightly smaller than Venus, in the west. The object was moving at a steady rate from west to east, unblinking, without changing apparent direction. After watching it for about 5 seconds, the light &#34;winked out&#34; and very briefly returned to view, continuing its course, before &#34;winking out&#34; again. The sky was not yet fully dark, but the light source of the object was distinct and bright. The &#34;winking out&#34; seemed to be consistent with a 90-degree turn along the plane of sight, but there was no continuation of sight after the second &#34;winking&#34; episode. The light did not flash, nor were there any standard airplane colored lights (red, green, or white) associated with it. I am unable to judge the distance of the object or its actual size. In shape it appeared to be circular, perhaps because of distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have taken courses in astronomy and have seen many satellites and meteors over the years. This object was too bright to be a satellite; it was not yet dark enough and the ambient light should have been sufficient to block a satellite from view. The sudden &#34;winking out&#34; was inconsistent with a satellite. It moved too slowly to be a meteor.<n>

They lit up like missiles and they traveled as fast as a shooting star.  It lit up like a reentry vehicle trailing fire behind it.  The color of the red lights were very faint like the lights weren&#39;t meant to be noticeable.  They looked like dull red comets I looked through my local news and researched but i guess no one else saw/reported it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was getting dark, but it was still light. I got the ladder out so we could get on the roof and watch the neighbors shoot off fireworks. After my wife and I got on the roof, we both saw a fireball streak across the sky, from the south heading what looked to be due north.  There where clouds also that night. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed.  The fireball was bright orangish and was directly to the west of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see it as it passed in and out of the low clouds, reminded me of the flame coming off a missle. But, I didn&#39;t think it was.  A few minutes later we saw another one.  Same type direction and so forth.  The Fourth one though, came out of the south and flew directly over head at which point I could no longer see it for the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had gotten a real good view of it. It was just a fire football shaped traveling very rapidly.  Jets fly over all the time but it was going at a much faster rate.  And it seemed to be heading North by Northwest.  It didnt leave trail of any sort and it wasn&#39;t any sort of fireworks.  I am in my 40&#39;s. I honestly dont know what it could be.  I am submitting this upon the request, of the UFO REPORTING AGENCY asked that anyone who saw anything to send in your report.

7/4/10 21:35|Danbury|CT|Teardrop|25 Seconds|triangular/teardrop shaped orange light with a slight flicker to it rocketing across the sky with no sound|7/10/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76349.html|645|ndxe201007| triangular/teardrop shaped orange light with a slight flicker to it rocketing across the sky with no sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:35 PM Sunday July 4th, Danbury, CT (nearest cross street Belair Drive and Kingswood) I saw what appeared to be an orange teardrop/triangular shaped flame (not a perfect triangle but more triangular than a teardrop) arching overhead.  I first noticed it at 35 degrees WNW from my location.  It continued up overhead to about 85 degrees (almost directly overhead) and gradually faded out of view as it got smaller and smaller ESE at about 10 degrees above the horizon.  It took about 25 seconds to move this distance.  I did not hear a sound coming from this object so I would say that it was above the Earth’s atmosphere but not as high as the International Space Station (ISS) as I’ve spotted that a few times on separate occasions and on one occasion I saw the station also pass almost directly overhead like this object.  I cannot be certain how high the object was but that is my impression.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be a flame although it was different from a typical rocket in that although it remained relatively constant it had a slight flicker to it like the flickering of a candle only a more rapid flickering with more of a sustained luminescence.  The flame appeared to have an edge on the forward side and came to a point at a length of about twice its width.  I could not discern a physical object in front of the flame as I was looking for something in front thinking it was perhaps a missile or the space shuttle.  The light of the object was about half as bright as the ISS at its brightest when I had seen the ISS at about a year ago passing directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw only the one object and it’s motion was continual and followed a straight path and it was moving at least twice as fast as the ISS (or perhaps the same speed but maybe half the distance?).  This object literally appeared to be rocketing across the sky.  It’s size from my perspective was about 1/8th the size of a full moon as it passed overhead.  There were 4-5 other witnesses across the street about a 100 feet away from me.<n>

It kept a steady straight pace.  It almost looked like a plane that was on fire, however, there were no noises (engines) and as it flew further away from us it dissipated.  It was flying west.  If I were to compare it to the moon, I would have to say it was about the same size.  There were four of us shooting off fireworks at the time.  It just &#34;disappeared&#34; after about 5 minutes or so<n>

This light was in a perfect line going across the sky. It moved slowly at times, and few times picked up a little speed. I told my girlfriend to take a look and she began observing as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later, the second light emerged and started a similar path, never moving up or down. The light was a bit dimmer than the original 5 cluster sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The top one moved a bit slower, while the second one looked as if it were catching up to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A 3rd light came out, and went across the sky about half way towards the 2nd and then seemed to almost stop in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept watching the 2 lights that had appeared first. The first moved slowly across the sky. The 2nd faded away, but then seemed to get a bit brighter and literally reappearing.  This happend about 3 times, before staying away, while the first continued across the sky until going behind a patch of clouds, and our attention being redirected to the fireworks beginning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time, the lights varied in distance from each other.  We saw planes going across the sky, and were much faster than these lights, so a plane is out of the question.  You could have drawn a straight line across the sky like a ___ and the lights would have never varied from the paths.<n>

At first I thought that their house was on fire because the object had the color of a campfire, rather dull, and pulsated slightly, as a flame would.  Then as it crossed the sky, I realized that the object was moving rather slowly and without sound. It was too low to be an airplane and too slow.  It was about 300 feet in the air and traveled at the speed of a hot air balloon until it disappeared over the tree line.  It was traveling SE to NW, and I observed it for about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Private Duty Pediatric Nurse, and I care for patient in her home.  I was at work at the time, and saw the object out of my patients room, then went outside to further investigate the object.  It was around 9:30pm.<n>

Up and down than would disappear. than would re-appear 3 miles or so in the opposite direction with only 1 of 4 lights on which were eratic in sequence , red, green,orange, and the 1 bright light. than it would hover and shoot straight down at a speed no aircraft could do at an angle than stop and hold position, than the smaller colored lights would be off than the xtreme bright light would re-appear. example: think as if you were in a corner of a dark room with a flash light moving it around and turning it on and off and moving the flash light within a certain perimeter left to right up and down. Than the fireworks started, thats how! i could guage the distance of the craft, in the clouds and distance from me and what it was doing. based on the height of the fire works and the mountain range behind it. The 1 very bright light had to be at least the size of a 2 car garage, doing meneuvers and changing lights at least 1 mile above ground and not breaking the boundry of a 3 mile radius in either direction, the craft was not visible other than the strobes and the bright light. After the fireworks started, the display of activity became more pronounced and the only word i can think of is aggitated. it almost seemed like, the bright light would shut off, and almost immediately be in a totally different level and area at a triangular descent than the other lights would be on, the craft was consistant in this fashion with the lights, almost as if the lights were for identification or communication. Note: i live in a canyon and at this distance you can hear helicopters, jets over head, and re-con planes, that fl! y even higher over everyday noise, this craft was silent, not ! a blip o f nothing. I am use to seeing all sorts of aviation fly over my neighborhood, this craft wasnt made on this planet, it had xtreme responce at angles impossible for any pilot to endure and at speeds i have never seen. it was consistant, i actually got so tired of watching i just went back in the house. I told my chef buddy at work the next work day about it, than he heard about the reports on coast to coast and informed me, that is why i have come to youre site. lets hope it is not demonic .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We all just sat there and looked at it and didn&#39;t think alot of it, because we just assumed it was some new firework thing that someone had.  It was pretty  high up, and traveled at a medium speed overhead.  I took pictures of it, but they just kind of look like a light to me.  I was very puzzled about it all night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I guess it was two or a few times brighter than Venus, and seemed to be stationary, maybe moving a little bit.  My guess was that it was a helicopter less than a mile from me, coming in to the hospital - except that it never came.  I watched it for a few minutes, maybe 5-10, but it didn&#39;t change appreciably in any way.  Then it just kind of disappeared.  I assumed it was a plane or helicopter that turned a different direction, but I never saw one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed a little strange.  I assumed (and still think it&#39;s likely) that it was a plane or helicopter, but considering the numerous reports that night, I have decided to make this report.<n>

I observed this at approximately 9:30 pm CDT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in an area where air traffic is common (near Forbes Field) where the 190th Air National Guard Refueling is located.  It is not uncommon to see Refueling aircraft fly over, as I live close to the flight path.  I know what an aircraft looks like at close range and what I saw was not an aircraft (plane or helicopter).  I first observed this object and quickly noticed it was unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it appeared to be a meteor. I called to another family member to come see this object.  It was a bright orange and appeared to be somewhat triangular to diamond shaped.  It was hard to distinguish an exact dimension or shape because it appeared to be flying in a haze or smoke from fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our weather that evening had been stormy/humid and there appeared to be some fog or haze in the sky.  However, the object was first vis! ible many miles away, and was clearly seen, so I am not sure why there appeared to be this &#34;haziness&#34; to the object when it was overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stated earlier, the object was moving from due west to due east.  It flew directly overhead.  It was hard to determine its height, because I really couldn&#39;t determine its size and make a relationship guess, but it appeared to be 800-1000 feet high.  Again, because it was difficult to determine size and height, its speed is only an estimate...approximately 300-400 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I watch aircraft coming and going from Forbes Field (mostly shortly before landing and after take-off), and I&#39;m judging the speed of this object in relationship to those observations.  I heard no sound from the object at any time.  I observed the object for 30-40 seconds, then went to a different location and watched it continue moving east for another 15-20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to go into a cloud bank because it disappeared quickly and somewhat unexpectedly. ! It didn&#39;t just fade away but disappeared abruptly, either int! o a cloud bank or whatever.  It did not quickly change directions...just disappeared suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first observed it, I thought it might be a meteor.  It&#39;s speed, however, was too slow and it was relatively close to the ground.  There was no tail or anything that trailed behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My immediate impression was that I had seen something I couldn&#39;t explain.  I thought, because so many people were out with fireworks that evening, that I would here something about this on the local news that night or the next day.  I&#39;ve heard nothing...until out of curiousity I &#34;Googled&#34; it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been thinking that all those drugs as a kid finally had taken its toll and I was seeing things..lol.  Anyway, I was somewhat releived to see that other shared the same experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hopefully this description will help you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me and I will try to better explain my observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Good luck.....<n>

There were three distinctively orange lights in triangular formation, but moved in a oscillating fashion.

It was approximately 9:25 pm or so when I sat down at the table and I was watching the neighbors down the block blowing off some fireworks in the distance.  I got up and walked to the back of the yard so I could see if I could see any other fireworks going off.  As I looked over the front of my house, I seen this object coming toward me. It was orange in appearance, and was almost like glowing, like an aura around it or something. It made no noise what so ever.  It was almost silent, but looked almost like it was spinning the body part of it, but was just moving forward.  It was the strangest thing!  I started freaking out, and yelled for my boyfriend.   As he came over it was now almost right over the front of our house. It wasn’t very high in the sky maybe a couple hundred feet above our trees.  He ran into the house, and tried to grab the camera, but by the time he came back it was alre! ady over our neighbors house, and hidden by their trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching in the sky, turning in circles hoping I would see it again.  Maybe 2  minutes later another one appeared in the same direction the first one appeared to of come from.  This one was way up high still in the sky coming down from the clouds.  It seemed to stay up in the clouds as it moved along heading toward my direction kind of diagonal though along my fence line.  An airplane was coming in the sky toward it I believe it was maybe like 9:28-9:30 pm or so by now not sure. As the airplane headed toward this unidentified object it went back up in the sky, and the lights seem to disappear, or go off.  The aircraft then was over the spot where this craft was, and went passed it. I thought it was gone but then it came down out of the clouds but behind my house in the sky.  This time the craft came down and had it’s lights out and seemed to be a bit bigger than the other one that went over my house.  I could clearly see this space craft because of the street lights behind m! y house in the court. It was clearly a flying saucer, disk shaped.  It was grey, silverfish looking,  and was flying quietly. It was moving very slowly like hovering, or scoping things out.  Then it began to speed up and looked like it was coming down.  It was flying like it was looking for a place to land, or  something . It disappeared on the other side of the block past the trees where I couldn’t see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t report this to Local police department. I know how people get treated, when they report these things to police departments, and say they see UFO’s. I know what I saw, and it wasn’t no airplane, fireworks, none of that. I got a good clear view of these objects, and I am positive about what I seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There has to be others here in town that seen this. I don’t know if anyone else might of reported this here in town. They didn’t say anything about it in the local papers, but that isn’t surprising where we live. I just want to report this, so if others have seen anything, they will know they aren’t the only ones, and it is documented!<n>

It was not an aircraft because it had no flashing lights indicative of an airplane or helicopter.  We have two airports in close proximity and see air traffic regularly, and I&#39;m familiar with the appearance of aircraft landing lights in foggy or cloudy conditions.  Additionally, landing lights would not appear the color of this object, nor would they form a clearly defined spherical shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a glowing orange/amber sphere or &#34;orb&#34;.  It maintained a constant speed and altitude, while traveling on a flat trajectory from south to north.  It left no trail (contrail or smoke) and made no sound.  The object remained visible for roughly one minute, leaving only enough time to grab a digital camera from our kitchen and take one picture before it moved over the north horizon out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cloud cover reported at Lambert International Airport (25 miles away) was cloudy at 7,000 ft and mostly cloudy at 15,000 ft.  The object must have been below 15,000 ft in order to have remained clearly visible.<n>

My family and I were watching fireworks and there appeared to be one that seemed to be continuing.   Eventually we realized it was not a firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overhead we do have a general lane where airplanes are constantly traveling.  This seemed to be traveling in this lane, at a much faster pace.  The object from tip to tip seem to be as wide as the lights on the tips of an jet.  The object that we saw was orangeish in color. It was bright, but not overly bright.  The sun had setted.  The object did not make any noise, but seemed quite high. The object to me appeared as if it might have been a plane, but enshrouded in fabric, such as a balloon and lite up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not appear that it had any light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife said it looked like a fireball, without a streak.  She said it was white in the center,  with yellow around it and red around that, but blended.<n>

Note that what I am reporting as &#34;fireballs&#34;, &#34;glowing lights&#34;, or hovering spheres, are not the likes of any firework which I am familiar with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 9:15 p.m., a friend and I sat on my back porch watching fireworks displays from various neighborhoods around us.  We set off a few of our own, but nothing big.  Neither of us had any alcoholic beverages that day or night, nor do we do drugs; our states of mind were as sharp and relaxed as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When looking south, during a lull in the fireworks, we both noticed (and promptly pointed out to each other) 4 objects in the dark sky.  We were looking at about a 35 degree angle of elevation.  The objects seemed to hover in place, making only minuscule adjustments to hold formation due to strong winds.  They glowed with an orange-red light, the closest approximation of which I can make is the HTML Hex code #CC1100.  It was not an extremely strong glow, in that I could not see it illuminating any objects on the ground, trees, or even that much of the smoke present from the fireworks.  However, it was clearly bright enough (or close enough) to reach my friend and I with no problem.  They were arranged in what looked from our viewpoint to be the shape of a rhombus or diamond shape, but I cannot say for sure due to our angle and imperfect depth perception concerning their distance from one another.  They seemed to act together, as though they were all present for the same cause or of! the same force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other similar formations could be seen from the front of my home looking northward; one directly north and one in the north-northwest.  The latter formation was at a greater distance from us, causing the glows to appear smaller and sort of blend together, creating uncertainty on the number in that formation.  We could only assume that there were also four there, as this is how the others were arranged.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation to the south was still closest to us, and we mainly observed it.  It remained still, emitting no beams or objects, but the objects seemed to alternate positions every 45 min. or so.  About 5 min. after a rotation, the object closest to us (on a the point of the rhombus) darted towards us significantly. It hovered now above the pond directly behind my house.  It faded in color and luminescence as it neared, becoming completely matte black by the time it reached us.  It hovered there, and had it not been for fireworks on the horizon and city lights illuminating the haze, it would have blended easily into the night sky.  We had a Nikon D5000 with an external flash and telephoto lens, and immediately started fumbling for it to try to capture it on camera.  The camera would not boot up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It usually takes about half a second to turn on and become ready to shoot, if that.  But it wouldn&#39;t. The battery was charged, for we tried two of them, both of which had been charged that day.  It was in the right way and there should have been nothing to interfere.  In the dark, I tried to use my lighter to see if there was some fault or something that could prevent it from working.  It was a push-button or electronic butane aerosol lighter, where one clicks a button down, creating a spark, and igniting a jet of butane fuel.  The fuel came out as usual when the button was depressed, but the spark would not work. Neither would my friend&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took this to mean that after going into some sort of less detectable mode, it also activated a device that shut down certain electronic capabilities within a reasonable proximity.  Unable to capture it, we could only stand in awe.  It looked to be about 15 ft. in diameter, and rotating a bit in one direction before reversing its spin. It spun fairly slowly, almost like it was just drifting there.  After about 3 min. of suspension, it flew back to its formation.  It did not change color, but by the time the craft got back, the formation was then the same shade of matte black.  It was unbelievable how...black it really was. It seemed to just suck in all light.  There were minor indentations around the craft, visible when not luminous, around the &#34;equator&#34;.  Just short dashes, impressed into the material. This allowed us to notice the rotation before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reforming, the formation flew northward at unnatural speeds.  There was no time for acceleration. It was just...going.  It went from a stop to its desired speed immediately and remained steady at that speed until arriving near the northern formations.  They joined to form a loose squarish shape. This larger formation flew northward while gaining altitude at a steady pace.  I can&#39;t imagine why only the one formation would go into its &#34;undetectable&#34; or stealth mode while in the larger formation, but it remained that way during its exit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend has done no real research into ufology or related fields, and previously was just oblivious.  He had no opinion.  He always took a tolerant, but non-believing, attitude towards matters like this. I have read numerous books, online articles, and viewed a vast amount of serious multimedia on the subject, including photographs, video recordings, and audio clips.  I don&#39;t consider myself to be a serious researcher by any means, but I do take matters of this nature seriously.<n>

The object seemed to be moving faster than a typically seen light aircraft in the area.  The object was seen in a southwesterly direction from the city of Mulberry, Arkansas (Western Arkansas).  The object moved north then turned and proceeded west.  There was some dusk light on the horizon.   We dismissed it as an aircraft, but the appearance simply didn’t fit with typical marker lights of a light or even higher flying jet.  I  and my family live near an airport in Fayetteville, AR, and are airplane observers.  I have been involved in identifying aircraft and have made a hobby of learning about airplanes for over 30 years.  I am a science instructor as well.  The objects main characteristic was the orange color and was very strange as an observer looked at it head on.  The orange color did change somewhat as its direction changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dismissed this sighting until I heard that many others throughout the country had seen objects on the same night.  (What we saw was not a fireworks display.)<n>

We did see a plane at one point, as well as a helicopter.  Then, seemingly appearing out of nowhere, my mother and I saw an orange-red orb flying towards our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it might be the lights on an airplane because it was flying so smoothly, but as it moved closer we speculated it might be a flare or firework of some kind.  However, it was moving slowly, and the light wasn&#39;t diminishing in intensity at all.  There was no trail behind it--it was an entirely self-contained light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it flew over our house, we both noticed smaller lights that seemed to be circling around the larger light.  The smaller lights, to me, looked to be pink and green in hue (among other colors.)  I only got a clear look at it for a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran to the back of the house, out onto our deck, and watched as it flew slowly over the pine trees and over the neighborhood behind us.  Again, it didn&#39;t explode or diminish as fireworks might. It made no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran inside and downstairs to inform my father, then ran back upstairs to watch it circling around and taking a similar path over the house for a second time.  I ran to get my camera, but the battery was dead.  I hooked up the family camcorder quickly so that it was pulgged into the wall and not running on a battery, but it was behaving strangely and kept shutting off.  We watched as the object disappeared over the house a second time.  I went to charge the other camera while my parents watched the object take its route over the back of the house again.  My father initially suggested it might be a flare, and then admitted he had no idea what it really was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I are confident we saw something out of the ordinary.  It was the moment when it was almost directly above us and we saw the smaller lights around the object that conviced us this was no typical 4th of July experience.<n>

It traveled in a linear fashion and was moving at a fairly rapid speed.  Initially we thought it was either a balloon or some sort of firework, but the object was too consistent in speed and moved in a perfectly straight line.  It flew fairly low in the sky as well.  We continued to watch it move north, at which time it appeared to change color, to a darker grey/silver color.  We continued to watch it until it was no longer in our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I are both very objecive, skeptical people and were hesitant to report our sighting, in lieu of the holiday fireworks.<n>

The group was sitting against the house on lawn chairs as the fireworks began.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:08pm A person pointed at a light heading from the SW to the NE.  We could all plainly see in the distance. It was a steady, orange glow.  There was no noise.  It didn&#39;t have any blinking aircraft lights (we watched aircraft fly over the area most of the evening).  It was below the clouds. It was moving at a steady speed.  From what we could tell it didn&#39;t change direction and for what I could tell went with the wind.  My wife mentioned that she and some other people saw the same light earlier in the evening in the same approximate path but didn&#39;t mention it until the second sighting.  I was videotaping at the time it was sighted the second time and managed to get some video of it.  It&#39;s not great video as I had to remove a lens from the camera I was using to shoot the fireworks and struggled with the focus as it had been set to manual for the fireworks setup.  Some of the video is crisp enough to at least see the object clearly for a few moments at a time.  I&#39;m fairly certain this was probably something terrestrial but it didn&#39;t resemble fireworks, aircraft, or balloons i&#39;m familiar with so I figured i&#39;d submit this and see if anyone else saw it as well.  The observers ranged in age from 13 to late 40&#39;s.  Blue collar to white collar workers.  Most reside in Indiana.  Several are from the Chicago area.<n>

My two nephews and her fiance were on their way out the door, but they weren&#39;t quick enough to see it.  I saw it at first, to the left of me just barely visible above a house, a red ball of light that just seemed to fly through the sky.  I guess the best way to describe it&#39;s movement would be to imagine as if you just blew up a balloon and then let the balloon go to just fly through the air. That&#39;s exactly what the ball did.  My sister and I watched as the ball circled through the sky, hurtling in it&#39;s movement but still in some eerie way it&#39;s moves appeared deliberate.  It continued to move like this through the sky for about another minute, and then it disappeared behind some houses in the southeast.  Moments later, a woman walking by asked me and my sister about the incident, asking if we had seen it, and asking where it had went. I poin! ted in the direction, and she followed it off until she was gone too.  There was definitely something strange in the sky that night.<n>

You could see aircraft in the distance diverting south on approach away from the objects to Nashville which is not their normal approach path.  Also 5 police boats on Old Hickory lake all shined their spotlights at them with no reflection of spotlights on the objects.  3 more objects appeard moving in the same direction.

It had no smoke, no sound, and this protruding thing swung around the top of it only randomly and very slowy while the bottom of it did not spin.  The best way I could describe the protruding black thing was that it looked like a large tel! escope with a dark shiny window in the center of it.  I say it was shiny window because you could see light reflecting off of the center of it, but the rest of the telescope thing itself didn&#39;t reflect light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire object was pyramid shaped, but the top of it spun around slowly while the bottom of it seemed to remain stationery.  A glowing orange ball was right in the center of the bottom of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were at least twenty five other people around us who looked up with us and watched this thing as it slowly flew by.  I have never seen a ufo before, but I have never seen anything like this thing that we saw tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened at around 9pm at Lakeville North Highschool, about an hour before the fireworks began.<n>

Of course the beach was packed with people who were there to watch the fire works that were to be shot over the lake for the 4th of July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many people made comments about it as it was getting closer, then it turned and looked like it was going south east  but straight up into space and then it disappeared!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the fire works show it might have been around 22:30 or later, but all of a sudden two more lights that looked the same as the first, came from the south going north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In both cases there was no sound, no blinking lights that would indicate a human flying plane or helicopter, so I am sure it was UFO’s!!!<n>

I went to the front yard to get some photos of the fireworks behind the house.   When I looked to my left, south east of the house, I saw an unusual light in the sky between the two hills.  I went to the back yard to show my brother the pictures I took.  He ended up deleting the photos of the object because he thought they were bad fireworks photos.  I told him about the object.  The he told me he saw it from the backyard and our mom, who overheard us talking, mentioned that she saw it from the back porch.  She thought it was a tower light until she realized there is no tower there.  By the time we looked up in the sky again, it was gone.  I guess it was there for about 5 or 10 minutes.  I’m not really sure.  I saw it twice from the front yard and it hovered in the sky long enough for me to snap the photos and walk to the back yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was really just an orange-red glowing ball that did nothing but hover in the sky.  It seemed larger than a star but not as large as the moon.  Nothing weird happened, nor were there any strange feelings or happenings associated with it.  There were lots of fireworks going off all over the neighborhood.  Seems like whatever it was, was just a part of the “show” or enjoying the show, like the rest of us.  My mom and I are not believers in UFOs or Aliens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom, brother, and I just chalked it up as a strange phenomenon.  I wasn’t going to report it until I saw on your website that dozens of reports were made the same day.  I just think it’s strange.  I don’t really have any more details than that.<n>

Of course we found plenty and as we were driving I noticed like a dim orange constant shape in the sky.  It was much higher than any of the fireworks and it was either very slow moving or just hovering.  I believe it was very slow moving.  I pointed it out to my wife and we watched it for a few minutes ..  But then went back to gazing at the fireworks with my family.  I saw it again upon returning home.  There was no flashing lights and no sound that could be heard.  I saw some people discussing seeing this object on the gossip website topix.com<n>

There was a thick cloud cover that night so the object obviously wasn’t a satellite or the light from a plane because it was below the cloud cover.  It was about 10X the size a star would appear.  We all watched as it moved steadily toward the south before disappearing over the trees to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as the first light moved out of sight, the second one appeared.  It moved the same speed and direction as the first one before disappearing over the tree tops.  Each one took about a minute and a half to two minutes to move across the sky.<n>

It slowly moved towards us.  As it got closer I went and turned down the music and we heard nothing.  At this time the object was around 500 feet above the ground.   I know helicopters you can hear pretty good and all aircraft have to have blinking lights.   This thing didnt and was moving very slow.  It covered maybe a mile in a 2 minuted time frame. It looked like a burning orb maybe 20ft in diameter.  As i went to get my camera it slowly dimmed to nothing over the hilltop.  It came back for about a second then dimmed again.   It&#39;s pretty crazy i know but if my mother and sister and friend didnt also see it i would think im going crazy..<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else seen this please post about it<n>

I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.  I&#39;ve read about weather ballons with lights, but I assume those would change altitude, right?  My girlfriend, myself and two friends were watching fireworks in our neighborhood, it was before the show at dusk.  Unknown if anyone else saw it, there were hundreds of people in the area.  My friend took a video, I&#39;ve been trying to get him off his butt to transfer it to the computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were having a lovely evening and playing cards and had not decided to go watch fireworks.  When the fireworks began, we decided to take a break and hustled so we would be able to see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the back seat of the car and looking out what I believe to be toward the northwest.  I saw a golden globe hovering in the sky, not very high but not low either, like the height of fireworks.  I asked if the fireworks were over that way.  They were not in that direction but in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked and saw it again.  I mentioned to them that I think I was seeing a UFO but since it was 4th of July, I chalked it up to possible fireworks.  I did mention it again on the way home it had left an impression.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was gold, not bright gold but pale yet had a definite brightness that seemed to be contained in some way.  I had some sense that it may have been spinning.  I felt it had some purpose and that it was doing something. It continued to be on the back of my mind throughout the evening.<n>

It took place a Balloon Fiesta Park with 50,000+ people there for the 4th of July fireworks display which started about ½ hour after my sighting.  The light was not flashing, but was constant.  The size is hard to determine, but I’m estimating the height of the light to be 10,000 ft, moving much slower than a commercial jet which I could see much further to the west.  I didn’t mention this sighting to anyone, because only in retrospect did its strangeness sink in.<n>

It wasn&#39;t completely dark yet and we were looking up because of fireworks and helicopters.  I saw a light above that was a circle shape, the light was white.  It was very high in the air, way too high to be a helicopter with a spot light on, and was definitely not a plane.  I don&#39;t know the exact direction, but it came from the inner harbor area, and went over Patterson Park.  I asked everyone to look up at the light and everyone agreed it was definitely not a helicopter due to how high it was.  It seemed to be in the height of where commercial planes fly, but it was definitely not a plane.  It was about a pen cap size, definitely bigger than a star or a planet you can see with your eyes.  It moved slowly, it didn&#39;t zig or zag, just in a slow fluid way.  Then, towards the end, it was hard to see as it was like it was shimmering out of sight.  You really had to look for it to find it towards the end, then it just disappeared.  It was a clear night with barely any clouds in the sky so it wasn&#39;t like it disappeared behind a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light, was very solid in the center, then it was like a very slight black ring, and more light, almost like a halo around the center light.  I hope that makes sense, I feel like I&#39;m having a hard time explaining it<n>

It looked like a round orange fireball and was bigger than any star, but smalled than the moon.  It was about 5 times the size of Venus.  It moved very slowly around the sky, both with and against the wind.  It did this for about 45 minutes, then just faded and disappeared, almost like it took off straight up into the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later, it reappeared.  This time lower in the sky and behind some trees.  This second appearance lasted about 30 minutes and then it slowly rose up and then took off just like before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reappeared a third time, just before 11:00 PM and we decided to call it a night, because it was very unsettling. I&#39;m an amatuer astronomer and have spent many nights looking at the sky, but I&#39;ve never seen anything like that.  It was definitely not a firework, they couldn&#39;t remain lit that long.  It wasn&#39;t an airplane, helicopter, or balloon.  It also wasn&#39;t any natural phenomenon known to science.  I didn&#39;t believe in UFOs until that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll be spending even more time outside looking up now.<n>

Grabbed my binoculars and had a clear view of them as they passed overhead.  Almost looked as though they were engulfed in intense orange flames, more brilliant in color than any orange you can imagine.  Totally silent, no strobe lights, no white lights, just two huge objects engulfed in a glowing brilliant orange flame-like color.  Afterwards huge military aircraft were seen flying thru the skies as though patrolling the area but the objects were long gone by then.<n>

After flying for a minute or 2, the flow stopped and the only way I can describe it is a can of chewing tobacco dark in color flying through the sky.  It disappeared behind some clouds.  10 or so minutes later I and my entire family on the boat saw the same thing, but now there were 3 of them.  This time they did not stop glowing orange.  This went on for 5 min.<n>

It was a somewhat chilly night for July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in the grass next to the lake and a playground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7 of us in my family saw a bright orange fireball moving across the sky from the south to the north about 3-5000 feet above the ground.  There was a lighter foggy border around it but all you could really see was fire underneath the object, which was unseen due to the dark night sky.  It was about the size of Mars when it&#39;s closest to the Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was seen for about 10-12 minutes and then went behind a cluster of trees and wasn&#39;t seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We discussed a hot air balloon, an airplane and a blimp as answers, but none of them seemed to be the right fit for a description of the object we saw.<n>

At first we thought it might be an airplane, but then we realized that it was stopping and starting periodically.  The light moved toward us as the fireworks began.  It seemed to hover over the area for several minutes and then slowly moved behind a patch of broken clouds.  Once the clouds cleared, the object was gone.  We did not see it again that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were four people in our party that witnessed this strange object.  We watched it carefully, hoping for some logical explanation (airplane, helicopter, etc).  One member of our group firmly believes in UFO&#39;s.

There was absolutely no sound being emitted from the illuminating sphere.  We watched it for about 5-10 minutes as it passed over our neighborhood and then got into our car and drove to the gas station at the corner of Martin and Zerdt roads.  We could see fireworks off in the distance so we sat in the car for about 15 minutes and watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove home heading west on Martin Road, we saw a formation of 3 glowing orbs.  This time I really thought, hey these things are extraterrestrial and I want to make sure there not hot air balloons or helicopters.  So we slowed down to almost a complete stop, rolled down the windows to see if we could hear helicopter blades, but there was no sound at all.   And they were not hot air balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had traffic behind us, so we had to move on and we are not sure where they went, but assume they continued to move northward as did the first one.  We were sitting outside and then around 10 pm we saw one more solitary glowing orb, but at a higher altitude than the others and this one was either blinking, or something behind it was blinking and we watched it move northward as well, then the dog barked, we looked away and when we looked up again it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 15 minutes later my boyfriend said, look at that satellite.  And I said, where?  Then I exclaimed, Wow, did you see that?   He said I sure did, wow!   We saw four distinct bright lights that looked like stars that were in a cluster which was kind of vibrating and then they formed into a line and just zip off into space on at a time very quickly.  It made warp speed seem slow, they just zipped up and off into space and where gone! in an instant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of us had ever witnessed anything like this before.  We believe that since the orbs were so slow moving and close to the ground there must have been a number of others who saw the same thing on that clear 4th of July night in Huntsville, Alabama.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the skeptics, I looked up sky lanterns and balloons on-line and just wanted to let you know that there was no way the first one or the second set of three that we saw were in any way sky lanterns. These illuminating things  were huge.  They moved steadily and with a purpose.  Not anything similar to a sky lantern and we were close enough to tell that they were not hot air balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend thinks they were as large as a VW bug and my estimate is a bit larger.  They did not flicker and produced an energy glow that was supernatural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have ever looked at a ufo site and ever posted any such thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both of sound mind and we were not under the influence that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d like to know if anyone else has seen large orbs so closely?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n>

It appeared coming in from the South West at a very fast speed, than slowing to 150 mph or about the speed of a small plane.  Its altitude was approximately 3,500-4,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the object was approximately the size of a blueberry or the end of your small finger and was glowing orange with a plasma haze around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was consistent with its trajectory vector and color as it traversed across the sky.  Than it abruptly turned and accelerated in speed, going South East over Portland, OR, at a gradual increase in altitude until it was no longer seen.  The sighting lasted approximately 2-3 minutes.<n>

It was nearly dark out.  I had my car windows down as it was comfortable in the lower 80&#39;s or so.  I happened to see a very intense light, shaped like a diamond, flying horizontally to the south of me. It was headed East.  I was driving and could not pull over and only caught a few glimpses of it.  It was flying at what seemed to be a low altitude and was totally silent.  It was much brighter than any airplane or helicopter I have ever seen.  The light was yellowish about the color of the sun.  Not quite that bright but in any event probably the second brightest thing I have ever seen in the sky (2nd to the sun).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was positioned due east of the condo and was just coming into our field of vision to the right of the condo building on our left.  I rushed to the video camera and by the time I was able to get it on and open it disappeared.  That video is also available.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 22:15 July 4th 2010 while standing on the 8th floor balcony of the Tradewinds Condos in New Symrna Beach the orange orb again appeared.  Myself and &#34;L&#34; were observing fireworks when it was noticed moving at a high speed from 9 o&#39;clock to 12 o&#39;clock.  When the object came to 12 o&#39;clock from us, due east, it froze and remained there.  At this point I ran back into the condo to tell our other friends and to grab the video camera.  I began filming as soon as I returned to the balcony and attached is that film unmodified.  The orb was due east over the water and far higher than the fireworks that were being launched from the beach.  If I picture my body sideways looking out to the east as the hands of a clock positioned at 6 o&#39;clock, my head as 12 and my feet were 6; raising my left arm to point to the object placed it to be at the 2 of a clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was oval in shape with a circular center of brightness in the distal 1/3rd of the oval.  The color that it was emitting was orange in the proximal 2/3rd and bright yellow orange in the distal 1/3rd.  The distal 1/3rd of the object was pulsating with light and at times appeared brighter yellow to white, and pulsed back and forth to yellow orange.  In order to get a close reference my friend &#34;S&#34; stood in front of me while filming approximately 1 and a half feet from the end of the camcorder.  At this point the object is viewed directly over her head and behind her toward the east over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed this oval orb for about 1 minute with our first sighting and for approximately 3 minutes during our second sighting.  There was only one orb spotted during each sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I myself am a University of Miami alumni with studies in Science and Physics.

I live by Louisville international airport and this is was no plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had only one &#34;running&#34; light as where the planes have at least two on each wing, where as this light just looked liked a ball.  The light made two or three different passes.  Each time it would go south and disappear into the clouds and then appear to be moving east to north kinda like it was circling around and then back to the south where it disappeared into the clouds.  The police did have their helicopter out but the helicopter lights were blue and white.  This red light looked like it was to high in the sky to be a regular civilian helicopter.<n>

A concert was going on and fireworks were to be expected later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happened to look up and noticed a craft that was unexplainable.  I studied harder and harder, as did my boyfriend and human aircraft was not coming up as a logical option.  It was traveling very fast but you could tell it was so high that it wasn&#39;t going from point A to B in a snap, as others describe sightings often.  It was the type of thing that when you looked away for a few seconds, and tried again to sight it, it would be much further east.  (Kentucky facing Indiana).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually it got to be at such an elevation, it was hard to keep up with and make out anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments later, I noticed even further southeast, it seemed to have two other identical objects waiting for it.  As my boyfriend and I were making our way to the port-o-john&#39;s, also in their direction, we looked up and all three were gone.  He said others around us were pointing and had also noticed.  This would have been a great time to discuss it with others had it not been for the loud music.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so perturbed, I came home and &#34;googled&#34; it instantly and found that someone else on www.godlikeproductions.com had witnessed the same thing as well as his wife.  He remains anonymous, but I suggested that it is okay, I saw the exact same thing, and he and I both captured it with camera.  I had seven still photos, and am regretting not video taping it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been intrigued by extra-terrestrials as well as government cover up and am excited and feel betrayed at the same time.

They always have great fireworks out there so we always take the boat to the middle of the lake and watch them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This year the fireworks were not the center of the festivities, shortly after the fireworks started we noticed a strange shimmering red to orange to blue light in the distance.  When it started we just thought they were fireworks or those candle lanterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started getting closer the more fireworks went off, it then sped way up and was about a half inch in size in the sky.  At this time it was at the edge of the Lake and would go toward the fireworks as they were being displayed at all edges of the lake from surrounding houses and boats on the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Object then sped out at a great speed till it was gone, after a few min. 3 more showed up from the south side of the lake and 1 from the East side slowing growing in size as they would get close and then moving very quickly in all directions and they look to be flickering like a flame. It resembled a fire ball.  They would then have smaller ones that popped out of the first ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They too would grow in size and resemble the same as the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the fireworks would lull and die down they seemed to get bored of checking out the fireworks and would start to leave and get smaller and smaller off to the distance, as soon as they started up again they all would return.  They would come back; this went on for almost 2 to 3 hours.  After the works were all done they would dance with each other over the lake as if they were playing with each other and zip back and forth the lake so fast they left streaks as they moved.  Eventually Very early in the morning hours they all each one would eventually slowly seem to burn out and disappear, until they were all gone.<n>

No!  NOT fireworks... they we&#39;re moving very fast one in the front was in a straight line and the one right in back was, what seemed to be bouncing up and down behind it.  My husband saw them because he noticed my neighbor looking up with his mouth open.  When my husband saw what the guy was looking at, he called me... he was in awe!  The lights went accross the sky, never faiding and they would take turns going straight and bouncing up and down.  I tried to get my video camara, but the image was never captured.  The 2 red lights were too far away for my low pixal in my cam to capture anything. Not sure what they were... but it was not normal, that much I can say.<n>

I went outside and saw 2 what appeared to be F-15’s, due to the dual vertical stabilizers on the tail, flying at a rather low altitude.  They made two rather large circular passes at (not more than a few thousand feet up) and then proceeded in a south westerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw a C-17 flying a couple hundred feet level over the old Norton Air Force Base at the same time.  I lost sight of both aircraft (C-17 and F15’s) due to the trees near my home.  This lasted maybe 5 minutes in total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am born and raised in this community and have not seen anything like this since the Air Force Base was an active military facility some 15 years ago or more.<n>

Fireworks had begun in the distance; however over an unpopulated area, a bright glow was evident.  Note that it was just beginning to be dark and landmarks were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was North West of my position; about 70 degrees above the horizon.  The color was bright red along the color of a road flare.  The size I estimate was close to the size of a van or small moving truck.  The object was round in shape and a constant glow that was very visible.  I do not believe it to be a firework product since no others were seen anywhere or anytime during the 4th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was stationary for 30 to 45 seconds and went out instantly.  No smoke was observed in the area of the sighting.  I was shocked to read about this in several publications and decided to file this report.  I cannot identify the origin of the object but I will confess it struck me oddly at the time; and to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note I am very sincere about this happening since it occurred near a Navy Air Base.<n>

Ohio<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside as I am every night stargazing and enjoying the summer here in NE Ohio, and happen to catch a far off neighbors firework display off in the distance (Due South).  During the show (they were small fireworks) a orange orb of sorts was hovering right above the treetops off in the distance as if it was watching the display.  It was still, pulsated orange/red (I thought it was a cellular tower at first but then I realized that HEY we are out in the country, there are only trees out that way)<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved slowly westard, sat another few moments, moved eastward, sat a few moments, faded out, reappeared slowly 2-3 minutes later, sat about 2-3 minutes, and slowing faded out of sight.  I would be shocked if the party people did not notice it, but you never know, the wiskey runs a little freely around the 4th).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen this particular orb/UFO three other times over the past 2 months with the same mannerisms.  My honest opinion about this particular episode was that it was indeed watching the fireworks display.  You can almost tell it was intrigued by the display as if a small child was peeking around his fathers legs to check out a large dog.  It is so exciting to see our alien friends coming out of the woodwork, every night is a new adventure when darkness falls on NE Ohio!<n>

We kept walking and walking and walking until we got up to a neighborhood right next to the river, and we couldn&#39;t walk any further.  There were a whole bunch of people sitting on their front porches, sitting in their front lawns.....etc watching the fireworks.  There was a middle-aged man on the sidewalk with a pet boa constructer, my 19 year old friend was wearing a cute, white sun dress, and she (being the daring type of person that she is) asked the man if she could touch it.  It weighed about 70 lbs, and she was tiny herself, so I was very surprised and completely distracted when the man said, &#34;Sure,&#34; and instead, draped the gigantic snake over her shoulders, and she was totally freaking out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was kind of giggling and no longer paying attention to the sky and the fireworks when I suddenly noticed everybody walking out into the streets like they were mesmerized or something.  I didn&#39;t understand what could&#39;ve been so wonderful about the fireworks, because I was getting bored with them and paying attention to my friend&#39;s nervous reaction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suddenly turned to my husband iand asked what the big deal was to notice that he was in a daze staring at the skies as well.  He pointed and said, &amp;quot;Look&amp;quot; while still partially in a trance.  I looked up, and there was this small, but distinctive, ball of a red-orange light that looked like it was far in the distance and getting bigger and bigger as it seemed to be quickly approaching.  I felt like I was dreaming but looked around to realize that everyone else was still looking at it too, which made me realize that it wasn&#39;t even close to my imagination!  As I looked back up again, I noticed that it was gigantic. Granted I di! dn&#39;t have my prescription glasses on at the time, but to me,  it somewha t resembled a small planet or something, and it seemed like it was so close that I thought that it was going to hit us.  Instead, it seemed as if it was hovering a little bit higher than a high helicopter right in front of everyone in the neighborhood, but over the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered over there for a long matter of seconds, and suddenly (out of nowhere), it quickly darted off almost directly right and disappeared in a split second almost as if it never was really there.  Once again, I thought that I was imagining it, and realized that everyone was still standing around looking up at the sky for a couple of seconds after it disappeared. I mentioned that I wished that my son was there to see it as soon as I came to, and I looked back at my friend who still had the snake draped over her as if the snake was barely even phasing her anymore until she &#39;came to&#39; again, and finally asked the guy to get the snake off of her.<n>

We described it at the time as resembling a balloon on fire.  It was probably several miles away. It was in the eastern sky and was moving toward the west quickly.  As it got closer it really looked as if there was a large flame.  We continued watching it quickly took a 90 degree turn to the south and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke with another neighbor on August 7, 2010 and brought up what we saw.  She said she saw it too and didn&#39;t mention it because she thought it was a UFO and felt uncomfortable talking about it.  That changed immediately when we brought up what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They made no noise.  Three of them constantly circling what seemed to be at least half a mile away.They would fade completely away at times,usually one at a time. Then they would reappear again in an instant,but would be nearer to us. As they got farther away each one would diseapear at a certain distance,then it would reappear back where it started from.  Each one would do this,the one farther away would diseapper and reappear at what seemed to be the same spot nearer tus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the fourth as we sat on the deck of our houseboat we talked to our friends that were moored beside us on their houseboat.  The subject of the lights came up. They to had seen them too.As we talked they again appeard in the sky.  We watched in awe as the noiseless crafts flew the same pattern as the evening befo! re.Fireworks were going off again and thinking that everyone else was surely looking up and too were seeing these lights. Then in an instant one fireball broke away and in an instant was hovering above us.  The thing stopped nearly above us.None of us could make out a shape or determine the altitude of the craft, but it was there and both scary and intriguing.  Before we could get a camera or video recorder it went from hovering to an unbelievable left turn.It took only a millisecond and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Norris lake in Tennessee we saw something unexplainable on July third and fourth.  There should be other eyewitness accounts,many were looking up at fireworks and should have also seen these fireballs.<n>

It was traveling very fast, faster than commercial aircraft flying through the landing patterns to Greater Pittsburgh International Airport (which is a common occurrence in our neighborhood).  It was on a straight flight path the object stayed on the same path and did not divert from the path nor did it slow down or speed up - it remained constant.  Looking with naked eyes, the object appeared to be a very fast moving hot air ballon as it seemed to be glowing orange.  There was no sound that could be heard as it passed overhead.  It did not appear to have a wingspan or any type of other lights you would commonly see on commercial aircrafts.  The object passed over our group twice in the same exact pattern within a matter of 15-20 minutes.  I checked NASA&#39;s website for ISS viewings and there were none listed in our region for that night.  I don&#39;t know what it was but I believe ! with all of my rational being that it was not a manmade aircraft, a comet, a reflection, or a firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Approximately 600 feet behind my house is a ridge and trees.  Behind the trees is a large field.  As I was standing there, I saw a bright orange/red ball of light appear above the trees, travel rapidly in a wavy motion, then disappear behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are no lights or houses on this small ridge.  I would estimate that the light was no farther than 750-800 feet away from my house.  I would say that the light itself would be about the size of a softball judging from the distance it was from the house.<n>

Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on the couch watching TV, when my little brother came storming down yelling for me to follow him outside,   So I got up and ran with him to the back of our home, and he told me to look up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were looking at what appeared to be some sort of object crossing the city horizon, it looked as big as the space station on a clear night when the station almost looks like a big star, and it was a faint orange color.   As I stood in awe,my little brother ran and got my dad, he too witnessed the object.  It was heading due east, almost appeared to be following the clouds which were heading in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, when i noticed this thing in the sky, it came fast but then it was almost like it noticed us, and kinda slowed down, then stopped completely only for a few seconds then slowly gained momentum, and continued on east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This isn&#39;t a hoax, I truly believe these things have been observing us for sometime, back in the 90&#39;s not sure what year, I witnessed a triangular object much like those been described countless times with the 3 lites on each point.   I never told anyone about that, anyways, this thing was like Just over the house.   Hovering, again i just recalled this, it was cloudy?  I wonder if thats a coincidence.  This Object headed North, I can remember this because it was across from my old elementary school, and I remember watching this thing glide to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this was what u wanted, I needed to get this out there, and share my sighting with whom ever wanted to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Happy findings, and good luck.<n>

We just thought it was a cop making sure everyone was behaving and not loitering outside the store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to get up and walk down the block for whatever reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About seven minutes later, we heard a very faint noise above us and saw the &#34;strobe&#34; light again as we were still walking towards the boardwalk.  From what I recall, the light was white-colored (it was sort of like what a helicopter beam light looks like when they&#39;re searching for someone).  The beam of light went over us and we all saw it touch the sidewalk.  After this the ufo or whatever it was started to take off slowly then reached a faster speed as it flew off into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keep in mind that all of us were completely sober when we saw this.  Also, when we looked up we couldn&#39;t really see what color the actual flying object was, but it had a green square colored light on the bottom of it.  Behind the green square of light was the weird white-ish strobe light thing that would actually reach down and hit the sidewalk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, I later found out that my friends from Rockport, MA, saw the same exact thing!  It freaked me out a lot that night, but I think it was quite the experience to see something so cool in the sky late at night like that.<n>

In total there were four objects over the course of approximately four minutes, all one after the other in the exact same path.  It crossed the sky in a similar speed or fashion to an airplane, however there were not any blinking lights or white lights.  Airplanes are a very common site where I live, and this was no airplane.  There were three other adult witnesses sitting with me on the deck.  It was very bizarre, as it looked like a giant roman candle shooting slowly across the sky, but it would have been impossible for it to have been a firework, due to the fact that it crossed several miles of sky with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Then to my amazement I noticed this large bright light had a dimmer/smaller companion light trailing behind and slightly below it. The larger light was similar to the brightness of Venus on a clear night. The smaller light more consistant to the brightness of a typical satelite.  I ran inside to get other witness&#39;s,apon returning we all watched them fly completly silent and in a perfect straight line almost directly over our home.  I took note that the stars where visible between the two lights as it flew giving the impression of being two objects, although these two lights stayed in pefect unison untill roughly 3 minutes into the sighting roughly (1 mile past our home) when the trailing-smaller light slowly moved and to the lower right of the bigger light.  It&#39;s very possible if the two were connected-the object could have been tilting to give this effect.  The object made no sound whatsoever. Nobody felt paranoia only exitement and extreme wonderment.  We watched it untill, at about a quarter at arms length from the horizon, it suddenly (not instantly) both blinked out out.If these two lights were connected it would have been absolutely massive, football stadium sized would be an understatement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (A recreation image can be sent if needed)<n>

It was very bright, as bright as a planet I would say.  Certainly not as bright as an airplane might be.  The strange light moved away at a steady slow rate and we lost it.  We walked for minute more and then suddenly we saw it again!   It was coming back in the opposite direction!  We were so stunned by this we stopped to look at it and we definitely though this light was odd. It was glittering, bright orange and sometimes reddish in tint.  We just stood there and watched it move silently, and slowly.  It&#39;s flight was somewhat wobbly, even though it moved in a straight trajectory.  After about a minute it became very dim, only a pinprick of light and then it vanished completely.  Whatever it was, my sister was overjoyed she&#39;d seen a ufo but I on the other hand was pretty shaken up.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like that before!<n>

It was the night before the fourth of July in 2010 some of my mother and father in laws neighbors had started letting fireworks off already. We had a small fire going and were sitting around having a drink with the neighbors watching the fireworks. I happend to look up into the sky and saw 3 lights in the sky. They were orange and looked like they were on fire. I was in the military for six years and knowing all aircraft has strobes on them in prominet locations i started looking for them before notifying my wife, in laws and neighbors. The lights were extremely high compared to the other aircraft in the area and for as high as they were they were traveling at an extremely high rate of speed. the three lights were in a triangle shape or formation they kept the exact same rate of speed is the reason i think its a single craft but ! it could be multiple. One of the neighbors suggested it could be several misiles due to the look of the lights as it looked like fire that would come out of a jet engine. I disagreed with that explination due to me being in the military if anything of that magnitude had hapend i would have been called and put on alert. Even as fast as the object was moving we all could watch it for about five to ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/3/10 22:45|West Bloomfield|MI|Light|Approx 15 minutes|Groups of bright orange/amber lights in the evening sky July 3, 2010|7/28/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76732.html|748|ndxe201007| Groups of bright orange/amber lights in the evening sky July 3, 2010<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday, July 3, my mother and I had been watching the local lake association&#39;s fireworks display from the comfort of our living room.  Our west window had a perfect view of the fireworks that were launched over the lake.  After the &#34;grand finale&#34; at about 10:40, I got up to put the dog outside one last time for the night, and went our our back door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up towards the western sky and saw several pairs of bright orange lights moving from the WSW horizon (roughly the &#34;8:00&#34; position) in a NNE direction.  The lights were each at least as bright as Venus, which was still visible in the western sky at that time.  They just immediately struck me as very odd due to the orange color -- had they been the traditional white/yellow light of airplanes, I would have just assumed it was a group of planes traveling together in some sort of formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called out to my mother &#34;Quick, look out the west window, there are UFO&#39;s in the sky&#34; -- only half jokingly, because the lights were just so wierd.  At the very same time, my mother was calling out to me &#34;What are those lights?&#34;  They struck her as very odd, too, her comment was &#34;are we being invaded?&#34;  I went outside to get a better look.  Over the next roughly 10 minutes, there were probably a total of 8 to 9 pairs of these orange lights, traveling from the 8:00 position on the western horizon to the area of the Big Dipper constellation, which was in the northwestern sky perhaps 3/4ths of the way up from the horizon.  The lights appeared on the horizon generally about every 60 to 90 seconds, and at most times there were probably 2 sets of them visible in the sky.  It took each pair of lights perhaps one and a half to two minutes to move that distance -- they appeared to be rather slow-moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the lights got quite high in the sky, most of the way towards the region of the Big Dipper, the lights dimmed and then finally went out entirely and the objects were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At perhaps 10:50, about 10 minutes after the first objects appeared, there were no more to be seen, and I thought they were gone. After about 5 minutes, another 3 or 4 pairs of objects appeared following the exact same trajectory.  The last of these disappeared and I waited another 2 or 3 minutes and went inside -- I noted it was 11:03 pm when I came inside at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea how high or how far away these objects were.  When the lights first appeared, I should also note that I could see at least 3 planes in the sky in the same general region of the sky as these lights.  One of the planes was very low, with a single white light and moving from SE to NW, possibly to make an approach to Oakland Pontiac International Airport about 3 or 4 miles to the nother.  The other two planes were probably commercial passenger jets -- higher up, and flashing white, red, and green lights, one traveling from the NW to the SE, the other very high and traveling almost due west to due east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The unknown orange objects may have been low enough to be at the altitudes that small private planes fly at, or, for all I know, they may have been in orbit.  I should note that it was a very clear night, and even at that late hour there was still a glow of twilight on the western horizon, so it&#39;s possible, I guess, that if these were objects in orbit the light may have been the last rays of the sunlight bouncing off the objects.  I have seen the space shuttle in the International Space Station before, and those actually move in a similar manner to these unknown objects, but on those, when I saw them, the light was a very yellow light similar to Venus, not orange.  So, still kind of odd in my opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t detect any noise from the objects, but as I said, I have no idea how far away from them I was, and also, it was a very noisy night, with a lot of fireworks and firecrackers still going off, and a noisy party somewhere a street or two over with rock music playing on a p.a. system and people laughging and hollering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I find it hard to believe that a lot of people would not have seen these objects.  Since it was Saturday July 3rd, a great number of people were having parties and get-togethers, and it was a perfect, warm, clear, beautiful evening, and there was a lot of activity in the area, a lot of cars on the road, and so forth.  Since over 1.2 million people live in Oakland County, Michigan, I find it really hard to believe that a lot of people wouldn&#39;t have seen these lights, and I find it even harder to believe that they wouldn&#39;t have struck others as odd, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I truly don&#39;t have a clue what these objects may have been -- some kind of squadron of old planes or ultralites traveling to an air show?  Military planes?  Had the lights been white/yellow, I would have thought so. I did ask my brother-in-law, who was a cargo pilot in the airforce during the Vietnam era, and who still is a private pilot, and he stated that planes would only have white/yellow lights, plus the blinking red and green wing lights on larger planes, but I suppose even he could be wrong.  Satelites?  Any that I&#39;ve seen reflecting the sunlight were a more white/yellow light as well.  So, what they were, I truly don&#39;t know.  I just know I haven&#39;t seen anything that color before moving like a plane moves, and definitely not in pairs and groups.  I carefully watched the local news that night and for the next few days, checked the local papers, and looked online, because I thought this might be a newsworthy event, or at least someone might offer an explanation of these lights.  Since then, I&#39;ve done a lot of searching online, and I haven&#39;t found any references to this event.  It still baffles me because the lights were just such an odd color of orange, so unlike any aircraft I&#39;ve seen.<n>

The sky was clear, with stars, satellites and aircraft visible.  A dull orange colored orb suddenly &#34;switched on&#34; about 30 degrees above the southern horizon.  It was large in comparison to the stars and planets, I would estimate it was the size of a pea at arm&#39;s length.  It was moving quickly in an arc heading towards the northeast, faster than any of the aircraft that were visible but too slow to be a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb had an appearance similar to a circular charcoal briquet, with the center slightly flickering as it moved.  It was not very bright at all, as a landing light on a plane would be, and its circular shape was sharply defined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not leave a trail of any type or make any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it until it disappeared behind the roof of my house.  I ran to the front yard, but was unable to locate it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot say how high it might have been except that it did not seem to be as high as a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were numerous commercial and general aviation aircraft in the sky at the same time and I could clearly hear the sounds they made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A lot of neighbors were shooting off skyrockets, but the orb was clearly not any type of firework.<n>

I saw a large light leading a small light (Like the large light was towing the small light).  This caught my attention because it wasn&#39;t emitting any sounds. I watched this object travel across the horizon at a constant speed till it was behind the mountains.  The leading light was much brighter and the trailing light was smaller and dimmer with a few different colours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  International Space Station over flight, followed by Russian re-supply capsule.

The lead light was brighter than the trailing light.   After approximately two minutes, we lost sight of it behind the trees on their property.  The distance between the two lights when measured in inches, was about 1 and a half inches.<n>

Just as I thought I&#39;d get a really good look at it, as I knew it wasn&#39;t an airplane, as it was just a bright golden yellow flaming light, as it drew almost directly above me it made ! an abrupt right angle turn towards the east and quickly disappeared. It did not steak off to the horizon, but faded rapidly and disappeared. There was no sound or other evidence that I noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Im not sure how serious she thought i was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had a solid minute looking at the objects before we had to turn into our neighborhood.  We got home a few seconds later and walked out front in the road to see if we could see them from our house. Then we saw a aircraft coming over head silentley that displayed 4 lights. green, red, blue and white.  It looked to be coming down heading north towards D.C. then it turned into one solid star like object and started going upwards never changing course.  Then to my amazment we saw 2 triangular objects with bright white lights in each corner coming over head silentley, slowly, and pretty low also heading north. They were both low enough that i could confidently say that it was a dark metalic looking aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With in a 15 min. span we saw over a dozen aircraft flyin north almost like they were giving chase?

I was walking toward a pile of wood, to light the bonfire.  I was walking north, when I just happen to be looking at the clear, beautiful night sky, and all the stars, when a huge fireball started streaking downward from about the middle of the sky, to just below the tree line.  I started telling everyone there, mostly family, to look at this thing.  I pointed and said &#34;what is that?&#34;  Of course nobody had an answer and we just watched it burning up the atmosphere.  I was waiting for an atomic mushroom cloud to light up the night sky, but the fireball just faded out after about at least a minute of watching it burn toward the Earth.<n>

At first, I thought it might be some kind of a fireworks rocket that was ready to explode as it was the 4th of July weekend.  However, it started moving in a north westerly direction.  I followed it until it was no longer in my range of sight.  It appeared to have red lights that did not blink in the shape of a horseshoe and from I could gather there were seven lights.  I was high in the sky and I did not hear any type of engine noise.<n>

It was about 935pm.  There were scattered fireworks going off to the south and the northeast but I think it was still a little too light out for people to start setting things off in earnest.  The sky was clear or had a few clouds.  I was looking at and scanning the tree line with binoculars for perched owls when I saw this persistent orange-yellow light in the sky south or southwest hovering in the same spot at maybe 45-50 degrees above the horizon and not flickering.  The light was maybe 2 or 3 times larger than Venus in the sky and certainly way smaller than the moon.  I had no idea what it was but eventually figured it was either a) some kind of firework b) the back of a distant plane/jet or maybe c)the launch of some kind of rocket or something since the last weird thing I saw in the sky, that was kind of similar to this event, was part of an NSA Atlas rocket launch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes of shining in exactly the same spot in the sky, the light stopped and I saw this gray, blurry object slowly arc a very short distance east from where the light had been until it faded away or I just lost track of it in the increasing darkness.  The gray object, which I figured was the emitter of the light, was roughly the same size as the light or maybe slightly smaller and possibly top-like in shape.  I watched the whole sequence with and without binoculars but don&#39;t recall the binoculars giving me a much better view of the event except that they more clearly revealed a non-flickering light.  The light was shining for a few minutes and I saw the gray object for probably less than 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it actually was but still think it could have been one of the things I thought it might be.  If it was a firework, I&#39;ve never seen anything exactly like it before.  The light looked sort of like a Roman candle if there was just one flare, no smoke trail and the flare stayed in one spot in the sky instead of moving in an arc.  If it was a plane, there should have been blinking lights on the object after the light, it should have moved in a more direct way and I should have heard some sort of sound.  I don&#39;t recall hearing any sounds that I could attribute to the light/object.  And if it was some sort of rocket, it didn&#39;t seem to leave Earth&#39;s atmosphere and was a little different than what I saw before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had actually completely forgotten about this until Peter Davenport appeared on Coast to Coast AM and am submitting this report per his request.  And I&#39;m not looking at any of the other reports until I submit mine.<n>

We were watching fireworks around the lake from the dock.  We saw 3 separate sightings of similar UFO objects about 15 minutes apart-they were NOT an aircraft that anyone could identify-no flashing lights typical of aircraft, movements were not typical of planes, and no airplane noises were heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects sight came from the horizon at the south-west (the first object came from a point furthest to the west compared to the other two) and traveled northerly up the lake pulsating a orangish/red glow. Their sizes at their largest point was about twice that of Venus, which was visible just above the western horizon and at least as bright if not brighter.  Each time, their altitudes were at least a few thousand feet (guessing-based on the height of the surrounding hills from the water).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of their movements were similar in character to each other with erratic speed (fast then slow) and motions -veering off to one side or the other, sometimes instantly reversing their direction - sometimes appearing to stop or hover along their mainly northern route before continuing. None of the movements were super-fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three sightings ended similarly in that they appeared to stop in about the same location to our south (distance unknown and very difficult to even guess) although their routes to get to that area were slightly different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After being stationary a few seconds-they got brighter and brighter then began to move south and upward slowly (in relation to our position) as their light dimmed and then vanished.  The second object re-appeared briefly (and dully) after a second or so of turning south disappearing, remaining visible for one or two more seconds again - which helped to verify that it was still moving after we lost sight of it before it then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first sighting was approximately 5-6 minutes long, with the second and third being a little over 4 minutes.<n>
7/3/10 21:25|Waynesboro|PA|Circle|1-2 minutes|Red, circular object sighted in night sky before fireworks display|7/19/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76594.html|768|ndxe201007| Red, circular object sighted in night sky before fireworks display<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of Saturday July 3, 2010, myself, my husband, sister, and young son attended the Waynesboro Fireworks display.  The fireworks are set off in a field located behind and to the left ( if you are facing the front of the school) of the local high school, and to the right of the middle school and were slated to start at 9:30 PM, but in the end were not set of until around 9:45.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family and I decided to take seat in the field which is across the street located in front of the high school to view the evenings display.  There were many people around us.  Just to include some background info, they had already set of several &#34;test&#34; fireworks at around 9:15 PM.  Again these fireworks, when viewed from our orientation, were located behind and to the left of the high school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were waiting for the display to begin, at around 9:25, I was looking at the sky and noticed a red, circular object, with a kind of haze around the outside edges.  It lined up with the left corner of the high school, however much farther south than the school was, and was just floating there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I alerted my husband and sister to the object (my son is 2 and took no interest), and it began to move in an east to west direction, but could also have been moving away in an east to south-west direction.  From our viewpoint it seemed to travel the length of the school (east to west).  It was also slowly climbing in altitude, which quickly made us realize this was not a flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object also seemed to be pulsating, as in the light would grow smaller, get bigger, and grow smaller again,but was not blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it reached about the middle of the high school, as it was climbing very slowly in altitude it began to disappear. It would flicker out, then reappear and flicker out.  It did this very slowly.  Eventually, it either shrunk and disappeared or flew so far that the light was no longer visible.  This object was visible for between one and two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have tried to calculate the distance away and altitude just now, but find it hard to triangulate it without going back to the site and using proper tools, less I give and improper estimate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing the object, we were all puzzled as to what it could be.  There were people behind us whom I know noticed it, and were confused also because I heard them saying, &#34;What in the world is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not discuss the matter with them, however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was in no way a plane, helicopter, flare, or firework.  It moved too slowly to be a plane or helicopter, and was like no fire work I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also did not originate from the area where the fireworks were being set off at, and it went in a direction against the wind.  I am able to remember this because the fireworks were being blown toward us to the north, and the object was moving to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to just appear all the sudden, also. I would have though it was possibly a flare, being happy to arrive at a known solution; however it traveled in a direction, and lasted an amount of time uncommon for a flare.  Usually a flare will still be lit after it travels upward and begins to fall to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object at no time fell in altitude, it rose. I have seen flares before, and this was not a flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am at a loss as to what this object was, and it has bothered me since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this report was of service, and if there are any further questions, feel free to contact me.<n>

I am putting this on here because I have seen previous UFO&#39;s before in Rockford and am very keen of things that aren&#39;t normal around rockford skies and this was one of those cases.  It&#39;s not the first time Ive had intuitive experiences to look up and see quite abnormal things around rockford skies but this was the most recent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And for validity I put this sighting up as soon as possible, thank you and I hope someone else was keen enough to see it and come forward and rule out fireworks because if you saw it you would! agree that it wasn&#39;t.<n>

Object stopped in the distance then returned to original location when fireworks resumed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Remarks: My son another, and myself were watching the fireworks display when my son pointed out an object that appeared to be hovering in the air. I looked up at it and it was unusual in both color and shape. The ambient noise made it impossible to determine if there was any associated engine noise, but the object was indeed unusual. For the time that we observed it, it moved several times. The impression was that it was demonstrating an interest in the fire works, and we discussed the possibility of it being a helicopter or balloon/dirigible observing the firework display.  My son pointed out that the lighting was not correct for either.  Upon conclusion of the firework display, the object traveled quite fast to the east where we lost sight of it.  We then walked over to a local dinner approximately a 15-minute walk.  Before entering the dinner, I looked back in the direction of where the object had been and it had returned.  This coincided with the start of another towns’ commencing of! a fireworks display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several weeks later, I check with the Parks Department of Red Bank for any information concerning the possible photographing of the fireworks display from an airborne platform.  The individual that I spoke with was unaware of any photo operation.  The location of the event is several miles from a naval weapons station, so I guess the possibility exists that it might have been some security operation.<n>

I have four bats that come out at night and was watching them eating insects.  Something caught my eye and it looked like it might be a half mile up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not exactly oval shaped, but not really cigar shaped, but rather like a capsule. The back half was lit, but not with a light bulb.  The middle section was dark, and the front was identical to the back half lit, more glowing.  There was no sound, no wings, no gondola, and it appeared to be moving as if by equipment, and not the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for approximately 4 minutes.  This object was going from approximately north to south. It disappeared by just going away in the distance. Also, it the light was not brought on by the sunset, as the sun was already down for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To give an estimate of how large this object may have been if on the ground it is hard to say, but my estimate would probably be in the 25-30 feet range, the height maybe 8 feet or so.  My neighbor asked me, when I told him of this, wanted to know if there were any smaller lights on it, such as what airplanes use, and there were not.<n>

The distance between the show and the orb was at least ½ mile when we spotted it.  (Judged buy the distance across the bay.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first light passed into the tree line, completely opposite direction of the show, another orb of light came from the horizon behind the fireworks.  It also passed in the opposite direction of the display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then on July 6th, at apx. 11:PM, my daughter and I saw the same type of light while sitting on our porch; apx. 5-7 miles from the area of the fireworks show on the 3rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three orbs were deep yellow to orange in color.  Their luminosity was steady, no pulsation, no fireball or comet-tail appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They passed at about the speed of an ultralite, from one horizon to the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m judging their height above the ground to be roughly the altitude a search plane might fly.  They definitely did not fly as high as a  passenger plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us could hear a sound coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three orbs appeared to be about the size of a pea, held at arms length.  So what size that might be, relative to their apparent distance, someone with a degree in the sciences will have to calculate; I am not well educated in that area.<n>

However, I beg to differ because this ring shaped object was PERFECTLY round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the ring was moving at a very fast pace. The wind was very very still at the time.  Since this occurance I am interested in&amp;#65279; what it was or may be.  Like I said before, I did strongly not believe in Aliens/UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this time I was very quick to doubt it was smoke from the fireworks. The reason being is when someone makes a ring of smoke with their cigarette the ring will gradually get bigger and rise.  Whereas this CLOUDY like ring was moving across the sky.<n>

We were both looking  at about &#34;10-10:30 o’clock&#34; out over Long Island Sound and simultaneously we caught sight of a very fast moving light that blinked and zigzagged and then disappeared.  It was probably in our visual field for no more than 3 seconds.  It was quite out of the ordinary and we both commented on it at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While similar in brightness to a high flying airplane or satellite, it didn’t resemble any airplane or satellite I’ve seen before.  And neither of us thought it was a shooting star.  I’ve never seen an airplane or satellite or shooting star zigzag like this object did.  Because it moved in a fast, but measured, geometric pattern it seemed much more like a mechanical object than a natural phenomenon like a comet or shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw it a couple of weeks ago and I am still thinking about it, wondering what it is we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The object was not moving too fast that I could not make out what it was.  After about thirty seconds the oval light split into what appeared to be three sections and was rotating in a clockwise direction.  There was also a smaller red dot light above it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving slightly north and coming from the south.  It then began to move to the west and slightly to the south again.  After about three minutes total it was too far for us to see anymore because there were trees in the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I compared the object to air planes and helicopters around the area after the sighting and it was larger and not comparable to the lights of our aircraft.  If you can look at a full moon and picture a sliver of the middle and slightly smaller, that would be about the size of this object.<n>

At that time I arose and looked due southeast toward the Poteau Mountains where he had pointed.  There was a white light glimmering from the top of the Poteau Mountains and stayed there for at least 5 minutes or more.  We thought it was a fire on the mountain but soon discovered it was not producing smoke, the fireworks show started and we forgot all about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today I was going through photos and remembered the light.  Not sure what it was but know it was not a fire (lack of smoke) and not fireworks because it was there for so long. I tried taking a picture of it but the stratus clouds coming in would not allow me to focus it in, plus the light and Poteau Mountains had to be 10 miles away.<n>

7/3/10 20:30|Addison|TX|Fireball|2-3 minutes|Two bright orange circular-type objects appearing at edge of a city park during 4th of July festivities|7/10/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76286.html|779|ndxe201007| Two bright orange circular-type objects appearing at edge of a city park during 4th of July festivities<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date:  July 3, 2010<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday, July 3, my friend and I went to &#34;Kaboom Town,&#34; an annual fireworks party in Addison, TX, on the north side of Dallas.  It is several acres of park ground with an outdoor stage for concerts, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were seated in lawn chairs on the west side of the park/stage area.  A few feet to the west of us is a street, on the other side of which is Addison Airport for small planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As part of the festivities there were flyovers by vintage war airplanes, circling the park area.  The wind section of the symphony was playing music on the stage as the vintage planes occasionally circled the park.  Our chairs were facing the stage, a few yards to our southeast, with the airport behind us.  I do not know the time, but it was still light, approximately 8- 8:30 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happened to notice and began to watch something bright orange, somewhat circular in shape, approaching from the behind the stage (from the south) travelling in a straight line to the northwest, crossing over the Addison airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to my friend and we both watched as a 2nd object appeared behind the first one.  The two objects flew silently in a straight line from south to northwest.  There was nothing unusual about the flight pattern, only that they were bright orange and that I had never seen anything of that color before, and that they were somewhat circular in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vintage planes had been flying at a lower altitude where you could clearly see their shape.  The two orange objects were a lot higher in the sky, but low enough to appear an approximate 4 inch diameter as we viewed it.  They moved quickly.  Our line of sight was about a mile, and it took a couple of minutes for them to disappear from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched and commented about it. I made a joke that maybe it was ufo’s for our 4th of July festivities. They were definitely not airplanes as we know them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen any kind of ufo before and I didn’t think any more about it until I heard your report on Coast to Coast that there were many such sightings on July 4, and I mentally noted that we had seen these objects on July 3, but at a July 4 celebration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several hundred people at the event, but I only know of my friend and I who actually watched these 2 objects.<n>

The veiw over Puget Sound was amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after sunset, yet not quite dusk, I noticed a brite yellow-white fireball streaking across the sky from the direction of the space needle toward the south west.  I know this was not a plane, it was too fast, and strobes were absent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also know it was not a sattleite, because it was too fast.  It&#39;s size was too large to be a hellicopter yet too small to be a plane.  It was missing wings and/or rotar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other thing that sets it apart is it was silent.  There were no fireworks going in the area muchl ess in that direction at that time.  The height in the air that it was flying was equivalent to that of plane not preparing to land. This fireball object was moving way slower than a meteor/falling star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this because I couldn&#39;t identify it, even with a military background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am truly stunned.  I will not forget it..  This is my second sighting in my life.<n>

It was approx 1945 hrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and was amazed to see a &#34; Circular shaped object, deep red or brown in colour with a fiery yellow and orange glow at its base.&#34; I immediately called in my fiancee to view the object also, which she did. It was travelling at speed from a Southerly to a Northerly direction and seconds later, it was over the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then both ran to the back bedroom window, and noticed that it had already passed the building, zipping through the sky at speed, leaving no trails behind whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also noticed that it was unusually low, standing out from what was a clear blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed the object darting speedily through the sky, stop dead in its tracks, hover, and then seem to fall straight down a few feet, stop suddenly once more, then shoot away, fading to a small pin-prick size, eventually disappearing altogether from sight. All this happened in the space of around 1 to 1 1/2 mins approx.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came as a big surprise to us that no news of the sighting was neither on the television nor in the newspapers the very next day, as we were sure it would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object is definately the most curious and unusual thing either of us has ever seen. Absolutely AMAZING !<n>

It appeared quite low to the ground with a yellow center and a red flame type appearance surrounding it.   As I was in town, I first saw it in a block where there were no buildings and then twice more when looking down the alleys as I drove by.   I was then in a turn lane and forced to turn north, away from the object.   It was a clear day with little to no clouds.  The time in this report is approximate.   I went back to try to locate it again.  However, the way the town is set up, I had to go quite a way around to return to where I saw the object and it was gone when I returned.   I had planned on attempting to get a photo of the object but was unable to do so as I could no longer catch sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were moving kinda fast but not to fast, pretty close also. I knew it was odd so I watched untill they went into a cloud and never came out the other side.  I wanted to tell the tow truck driver but, I could not keep my eyes off these objects.  When it was over and the objects were gone I did tell the the Tow truck driver.  He thought it was an air plane untill I said the lights were following each other with a faster then normal clip.  He thought that was strange.<n>

At first glance I thought it was firecrackers, but the objects moved directly towards the interstate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I notice that the objects were flying in a V-formation.  As the objects passed directly over me, they changed formation. I looked upwards and notice that there were about seven of the unidentified objects.  On the bottoms of the objects were stripes of red in which each stripe would appear brighter as a light alternates across each stripe.  I also noticed that the objects had a rotational spin as they continued to move toward the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Once again, the two lights, with the first being brighter than the second, moving silently from West to East, and in-line with one another.  However, the two lights appeared closer this time, and the lead light appeared much brighter than the trailing/follow light.  Before disappearing completely, the trailing light went out, and the lead light began to dim and changed to bright red.  The size of the object during this second sighting, when measured in inches, appeared to be approximately 2 and a half inches in size.  Larger by nearly half that our sighting approximately two hours earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BTW, if I stated in my previous report that the object we saw at approximately 10:30PM was moving from East to West, I apologize. It should have stated West to East.<n>

As the object got closer to the bridge, I could that it was a very large pitch black triangle shape that was moving in a north westerly direction.  It looked like a triangle shaped black hole against the night sky and clouds.  It at first had one bright white light then changed into 3 dim yellowish lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still out over the water as I traveled on and out of sight.  It was a really dark night with rain and some lightning.  The black triangle shape really stood out against the low clouds over the river.  It was more than a hundred feet long and a couple of hundred feet from the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very odd, kinda freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The skies were clear so we could easily see the stars and had been looking up pointing out which constellations we knew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time I was looking up at the big dipper and noticed an extra star in the middle of the constellation which through me off for a second.  It was the exact same size and brightness as the other stars in the constellation but was moving.  I pointed it out to my wife because it didn’t look like a plane since usually a plane would have multiple lights or flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it move from right to left at a 45 degree downward angle over the course of about five seconds as it crossed a distance about equal the size of the constellation.  As it moved downwards the light began to fade until we could no longer see it.  This was also odd because there were no clouds for it to disappear behind.<n>

It&#39;s hard to judge altitude of things in the sky but they were not as high as a commercial airliner flying transcontinental and not as low as air traffic around O&#39;hare, my guess is between 7 and 10 thousand feet.  The Objects appeared to be sphere shaped, orange light with possibly red at the top of the object, the lights did not blink, steady but not brillant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the first 2 came toward us we saw anothe coming up from the southern horizon in the same path as the first 2,they were about 10 to 15 seconds apart and took about 1 minute to come into view and then disappear to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then saw a fourth then a fifth coming in exactly the same line as the others, then came 6 and 7 coming but these 2 were side by side going exactly the same speed staying even with each other all the way across the sky. After those two the last 3 came at a longer intrevals but all in the same line of flight as the others appearing to move slow then gaining speed as the were over head. the last one made a small arcing move to the west then corrected and went north northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to video the event but I didn&#39;t realize that my girlfriends video was set on multi media so I only got 27 seconds of video of me trying to locate the objects in the veiw finder. The later objects I located but alas no video running at the time. I&#39;m hoping somebody else saw these objects like we did and can help shed some light on what they might be.<n>

My daughter went to get the dogs from outside to bring them in (she&#39;s 15) and she ran screaming &#34;get out a plane is going to hit us&#34; &#34;run&#34; and she was hysterical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me my husband and my son went running downstairs and my husband went to the backdoor (running) to investigate because my daughter is very meek and quiet and never screams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I know my husband is yelling &#34;run&#34; &#34;its gonna hit us&#34; and he started praying to God that we lived and if not take us to Heaven.  We ran straight out the door as fast as our legs would go.  Myself and my son never heard or saw anything we were just running for dear life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband told us to stop behind the trees because he thought at any moment it would hit and we wouldnt get much father and we live in the country so its all mostly open space.  When nothing happened he told us to keep running as I horrifyingly saw him turn back toward the house.  We kept going as we went trying to call our dogs that had escaped with us.  My husband returned in his truck to state the object simply vanished he had no idea where it went but it never hit our house or flew over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we continued the search for our dogs however one was struck by a car and killed.  Later when I spoke with my husband and daughter I was informed it had 2 bright lights and was up in the sky they could see the back neighbors house below it and it made no sound and teetered a little back and forth but the lights were always horizontal to eachother.  This object made no sound what so ever and my husband said he saw the silhouette and it was as big as our back pasture across and very dark.  I am very saddened but wanted to report this because weird things have occurred before.  Like our laser lights we would play with our dogs with when we would point them in the field they would disappear at some points but would be seen all the way to the orchards at other points and we! always laughed that it was like something invisible was sucking up th e light at that spot. Im scared and wanted this reported in the case something happens to us.  Now it is time for me to grieve.<n>

It was a glowing orange ball (orb?) heading on a north by northwest trajectory and was about 200-300 feet in the sky.  It was totally silent, was going very straight and swift, and was quite bright.  The light intensity was steady, never flickered or changed intensity at all.  It never deviated in elevation as it came overhead and passed over us. We were almost under it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My one daughter was actually crying it was so odd.  The thing that baffles me most....I never saw anything like it before.  I really wanted to say it was a Chinese sky lantern or a homemade hot-air balloon....but I never saw one ever like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used to make and fly model hot-air balloons....I even sold plans on how to build one in the classifieds of a particular magazine.  I&#39;ve made them out of clear dry cleaner bags and tissue paper, etc.  I&#39;ve flown probably 60-70 model hot-air balloons in my lifetime (I&#39;m 43) and never seen anything like what we saw on the night of July 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my wife are avid sky watchers and definitely know what meteors, satellites, planes, ISS etc looks like. This defies explanation to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw, and we were CLOSE to it.... was a bright round orange light inside what seemed to be a perfectly round glass sphere...  I guess that would be my best description.  I would guess...and this is just a guess based on my experience...to be around 7-8 ft in diameter.  Perhaps what seemed to be a glass sphere surrounding the ball of light could&#39;ve actually been just the &#34;flare&#34; effect of the bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also.... we had a county fair going on that night.....but this came from a direction that it couldn&#39;t possibly have came from the fair...I&#39;m puzzled to explain it.<n>

Westover Air Reserve base rotating beacon is easily seen on the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed 3 orange lights to the right of the highway in a triangular formation. They appeared to be independent - (not connected to one another). They were to my right and forward of my position.  They were roughly 600’ high and clearly visible.  There are several airfields in this area, so at first I thought little of the lights - but the color was a distinctly different orange color, very different from any surrounding lights in the area. They were about as bright as a small plane&#39;s landing light.  There were no aircraft strobes, tail beacon, or nav lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 3 lights were approximately the same distance apart, with 2 in front, and 1 in the rear.  They appeared to be moving together very slowly in a north, north east direction - very smoothly.  My view became obscured momentarily due to a line of trees on the right side of the highway. Once past the tree line and the lights were back in view, the rear light appeared to just go out.  I fully expected to see some kind of craft (airplane, balloon, etc.) where the rear light had been, but there was nothing.  I then lost sight of them since I had past them by then.  The sighting was approximately 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was only the odd color of the lights, and the numerous reports from the 4th of July weekend that prompted me to submit a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

For about the next five mintues we watched them fade out or break off until they were all gone.<n>
7/2/10 20:30|Aurora|IL|Oval||UFO Sighting Over Aurora, IL Two Witnesses Involved|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76107.html|811|ndxe201007| UFO Sighting Over Aurora, IL Two Witnesses Involved<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I Live In Aurora Illinois &amp; On July 2nd, 2010, At Around 8:30 PM My Mom Tells Me To Take Some Formula To Sister For Her One Year Old.  So On My Way Heading Southbound On Montgomery Road I Just Decided To Look Up At The Sky While Driving Because People Where Using Their Fireworks.  So As I Was Passing The Cornfield By Copley Hospital. I Looked To My Left &amp; I Saw A Aircraft Flying Very Low.  At First I Was Shocked &amp; I Looked Again To Make Sure It Was Not My Imagination Or My Mind Playing Tricks On Me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Quickly Got Out My Cell Phone To Take A Pic But It Was Too Dark To Do So.  Anyways What I Saw Was A Huge Craft Darkish Gray Color With A Bunch Of Red Lights Going All Around It.  It Was Oval Shaped I&#39;d Say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Called A Friend Of Mine To Tell Him What I Just Saw.  He Told Me To Call The Police So I Did.  I Called The Aurora Police &amp; Told Them What I Saw.  I Told Them To Take Me Seriously &amp; That I Was Not Joking.  The Operator Just Said That She Would Send Someone Over By! The Direction I Described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So When I Got To My Sisters House Which Is About 5 Minutes From My House By Car. I Told Her What I Saw. So On My Way Back Now Heading Northbound On Montgomery Road.  I Was Looking For The Craft Again.  I Could Not Find It.  I Get A Call From My Mom To Pick Up Some Medicine For My Little Sister At The Walgreens That&#39;s On The Corner Of Montgomery Road &amp; Ogden Ave. So I Get The Medicine In The Drive Thru.  On My Way Out I Saw The Craft From Earlier Flying Now Several Hundred Feet In The Air.  Going Towards My Neighborhood. So I Call My Dad On My Phone To Go Out Side And That I Will Be There In Less Than A Minute.  I Had Already Called Him Earlier &amp; Told Him What I Saw. As Im Pulling To My House I Tell My Dad Who Is Outside Now To Look At The Craft.  I Swear I Have Never Ever Seen A Craft Fly Away So Fast.  It Was Zig Zagging &amp; I Got My Father To See What I Saw.  The Red Lights Made It Possible For Us To See It. &amp; Just As Fast As It Was Going It Was Gone.  Not To Be Seen Again. Because Of This Now When Ever Im Outside Either Driving I Will Pay Attention To The Sky.  I Truely Believe I Saw A UFO.  There Is No Way A Huge Craft Like That Can Be So Low By The Corn Field By Copley Hospital With Out It Making Some Kind Of Noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Wish I Could Have Tooken A Picture. Sorry Guys.  I Looked On Line &amp; For Army Aircraft &amp; None Of Them Look Like What I Saw That Day. So I&#39;m Convinced What I Saw Was Not Of This World.<n>

I have seen this one bright light in the sky about two to three times a week for the last month.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light will show up around six at night when the sky is still blue.  When I first saw it, I thought maybe it was a satellite, but i have seen satellites, and they are usually not visible when it is pure day light.  They also blink to some extent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the night of July 2, 2010 this light did something it has never done before.  That night there was a baseball game in my hometown.  The light has always been a really bright white light, but this night it changed from a really bright white light to a orange reddish color light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But along with me that saw this light, there was my old junior high school science teacher, someone who has seen an UFO before, or he thinks.  He is a father and grandfather, and he claimed he saw an UFO while watch the Northern Lights as a teenager.  There was also my old library teacher along with her daughter.  They all said it looked like it had moved two or three times.  So I went back to watching the ball game and when the game was over the light was gone.<n>

There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It fell behind trees, and there was no impact light or blast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were other cars around me that slowed down, possibly because they saw what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anybody else in the area see it?<n>

I exited the building to further investigate the light; the light was brighter than any other feature in the sky apart from the moon which was directly to the east of my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the light I noticed the familiar flashing lights of a plane also travelling toward me from the west but not directly, the plane quickly closed the distance as the light passed my position and now moved eastwards to the south of my location.  The light quickly grew dimmer until I could not see it, as I was looking south at the light I noticed the familiar flashing of a planes lights in the horizon travelling from south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and waited for the plane to pass over and as I watched I noticed another light, this light was no brighter than any of the stars in the sky and was also travelling from south to north.  I followed the second dimmer light and it passed directly over my position and then continued to travel northwards, as I turned my head back to look at the plane I noticed a shooting star fall somewhere behind the plane to the southwest of my position.  It was not a usually shooting star and appeared like magnesium burning, or bits of it dripped of the main object until it completely disappeared.<n>

We thought it might have been some kind of nuclear weapon because there was no way that it was lighting it lasted too long.  Then about 4 or 5  minutes later there was a white flash in the middle of the sky and a object with a red light rotating going right to left and below it there was a white light going the other direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we noticed another object that was sitting in the direction that the first one was moving in.  The second object was moving from left to right in the sky and then it just stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it continued to move across the sky and speed up and move up and down and stop more and go from left to right and stop more then we were looking at it and it just went dim and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was such an amazing thing to see we were all shaking for like 5 minutes.  I was not a believer in ufo and we were talking about it earlier that day and i am now a 100% believer.  Please read this and believe every word i have told you is the truth.<n>
7/1/10 23:30|Blue Springs|MO|Light|15 seconds|MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP REPORT:  Noted a single light in NW sky traveling from my south moving NE.|8/30/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77472.html|817|ndxe201007| MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP REPORT: Observed on west side of Blue Springs, MO - Sitting outside facing west watching the night sky, noted a single light appear traveling from my south moving NE, approximately 70 degrees to the horizon. Initially thought it was a satellite (have seen many and usually follow them across the night sky) as this was a small, dim blueish-white light. Object was moving very fast in a straight line with no deviation (direction of downtown Kansas City, MO), however it seemed to move faster than most satellites I have seen. No sound heard. Light then slowly turned red for 1-2 seconds (slower than a strobe light/anti-collision light on aircraft) and then back to blueish-white. This occured 3 more times before object became too difficult to see (distance and city lights in the distance). Light appeared to dissapear twice, as if passing through or above clouds (skies were clear from what I could tell, may have been very thin, high cloud! s in the area). Possible sources could have been satellite (was very similar in color, size, and altitude but this was traveling faster and I have never seen them emit red light), meteor (no tail, trailing light, or change in intensity), or military aircraft/fighter (have seen these before with a single, fast blinking red light, but to the best of my knowledge these do not emit a dim blueish-white light when moving away from viewing position).<n> <n><n> <n><n> MIG: http://ufomig.bravehost.com<n>

I was looking west over the Schuylkill River. The objects were flying south, possibly southwest.  At first I thought they were incoming planes (like when you see a row of planes following the same flight path) but there was no blinking light, only a solid red light for each object with no discernable flight pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were in no particular formation, they were randomly staggered to describe it best.  From my view they approached from the north making their way into my view from my building which blocked that part of the sky.  They were approaching my next visual obstacle, a tree, when one light seemed to disappear in the distance as if it went straight into the sky or due west away from me.  The other three lights then passed behind the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited for them to reappear, but only one came out on the other side and then it too disappeared.<n>

It look like a 3 red lights (solid) arrayed in a triangle with one BRIGHT pulsing light (slow pulse and very bright not like that of normal passenger aircraft seen around the city).<n>

Each tale was so long that looked like a drawing of a flower with lasers. Each satellite travelled in smaller circles until they all disappear.

It moved slowly south east, again, flying low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound or left any trail.  It lasted long enough that my partner and I could move to the driveway to get a better view.  It continued on its path until it was too far away to see anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was seen by a university professor and a university staff person.<n>

No discernable pattern in their positions.   I was heading southbound towards Milwaukee on I43, south of Grafton, passing Cedarburg, and approaching Mequon.  I saw about 20 lights to the east in a place where I had never seen lights before.  Seemed to be too high in the sky to be towards and too spread out.   I was focused on the road, but they appeared to be hovering.  No specific shape other than lights in the sky.   I kept glancing back as I passed and they remained. I took the Mequon exit and doubled back to head northbound again towards Cedarbug.  I saw that the lights remained.  I had my Iphone set to video mode, but had not begun to record as I wanted to pull over first.   I took the Cedarburg exit eastbound and pulled over and noticed 3 other cars pulled over as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I was hesitant to, I called 911 to explain what I had seen, tried to switch to video mode on my Iphone, but could not.  By this point, I noticed closer to 7 lights slowly moving in a northbound direction, all lights still spread out in no specific pattern.  Got disconnected from the 911 call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A woman with her two teenage kids came up to me and mentioned that they could not get their Iphone to videotape this either.   As we were visiting over a couple of minutes, the lights were moving away and then just faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sheriff called back, and asked that I wait to talk with one of their officers en route.  No one else had called to report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I indicated 7 witnesses.  I believe there were more than likely over several hundred passive witnesses driving both northbound and southbound while this was occurring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights may have been in appearance for far longer than I had estimated.  I was driving on the highway and only noticed them when I passed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never witnessed anything like this before.<n>

It was just about 10 PM and the sky was very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At Port Washington Rd and and Pioneer Rd we looked east and we saw many floating or hovering orbs maybe 100 or so in in the east sky in a long line of succession heading from the lowest part of the horizon in the south east graduating higher and higher in the sky to the northwest.  We pulled over on Pioneer Rd East of  I43 and saw several other cars who were also stopped to witness this very unusual site.  We all watched and shsrugged to each other as if to say we didn&#39;t know what we were seeing.  We watched for about 5 minutes then continued east on Pioneer Rd 1/2 mile towards Lake Michigan to our home and parked in our driveway to watch the light show overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we turned off the engine and opened the sunroof the lights continued to rise from SE to NW with absolutely no noise.  They see! med to rise higher and higher into the sky above Cedarburg or north of that. I suggested that that they needed the shoreline to navigate south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do have a short video on my blackberry phone showing the glowing reddish lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We discussed what they could b:e maybe hot air balloons but it was way too many and way too silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They kept coming for 20-30 minutes and finally disappeared into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a short video on my cell phone showing the orbs heading up in the NE sky.  We watched the paper and the news for a report of this sighting and there was absolutely nothing  written or reported on TV.<n>

At first I thought it was just a star.   A few days later I noticed how bright it was and how low it was.  Planes flew above it several times.   I used binocluars to make out the shape.  It&#39;s really bright and teardrop shaped.  This started June 10th and had accured every night since.  Only one night did I see it move.  Thats when I decided to report this.  That really spooked me a bit. 6-29-10 was the only time I saw it move.  I jumped in my car and followed it.  When it was flying I heard no sounds at all and the light seemed to change to a strobe looking light in the middle and appeared to have solid lights around the perimeter of the craft.  It appeared to stop at  times and change direction fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed it down to main street in Norristown where it appeared to hover for a while.  It also appeared much lower in altitude once it reached main street.

It was hard to judge the size because we did not know the distance away of the object.  It travelled slowly south southeast at an upward angle from the horizon of only around 20 degrees, maybe less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do not know the visual origin of the light as it only caught our eye when already in the sky.  We watched it climb and cross the sky and then it just disappeared.  It was orange and circular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was observed by myself, a 43 yr old man and my 2 children, 13 and 10 yrs old.<n>

After that it gradually went down towards the west behind a tree. shortly after we saw three more lights starting to hover between the trees.<n>

The objects seem to switch directions, heading north and formed a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were beginning to lose sight of them behind other houses so I ran to the back yard while my friend and daughter stayed on the street watching them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each one just started to disappear but the last one looked like it switched direction again and began fading as it headed East again.<n>

All this took place between 9 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. local time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 9 p.m. I went out for my evening star gazing and watching the satellites go by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the start I saw what I can only describe as flashes of light in the sky.  The flashes of light looked like a flash from a camera.  Then I observed what I thought was a satellite until the satellite went from moving from a northern to southern direction to veering to a southwesterly direction.  Satellites do not normally change their directional course as they cannot.  They always move in the same direction without veering off course.  This satellite seemed to be dark gray in color and was silhouetted against the night sky. I saw this with my naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw the similar flashes of light again.  After this I saw another &#34;satellite&#34; that was moving across the sky.  This time the satellite stopped, then let off a &#34;pouf&#34; of periwinkle to white color, then moved again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed through binocs what seemed to be a lighted object with periwinkle and white lights.  This satellite then moved and faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately a half hour later this same satellite reappeared towards the southwest portion of the sky and repeated the same set of movements and colorations before fading out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the flashes of light each time before the bluish white satellite reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was also seen by another witness who was with me.  This witness would like to remain anonymous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked Heavens Above and could find nothing that might fit what we saw.  Perhaps you can find something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of this stuff was close. It was all probably just inside the earth&#39;s atmosphere at a good guess.<n>

The color was like aluminum foil but more of a plastic look.  It changed color shape so couldnt tell the shaped of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many aircrafts, balloons, gliders but this wasnt neither.  But as the birds were taunting the UFO it flew higher into the sky and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really believe now so shocking.  It was like it was hiding...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was taking in the warmth and sunshine on the beach and sometimes watching the high overhead airliners inbound and outbound from Jersey and Philadelphia airports.  I then spotted a very shiny cylinder inbound towards the beach and almost directly overhead.  As I watched the cylinder I could not see any wings.   Then bang, the cylinder was now moving 90 degrees to its right and parallel to the beach.  Then the cylinder disappeared suddenly yet, the sky was clear and very sunny.  I said to myself, this was no ordinary aircraft.  I was at Cape May for two weeks and saw many aircraft inbound and outbound both during the day and evening  but nothing like this shiny cylinder.<n>
7/1/10 15:30|South San Jose|CA|Unknown|5-7 minutes|High Altitude Object - in San Jose CA July 1st 2010 small whte dot w/red and silver|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76147.html|840|ndxe201007| High Altitude Object - in San Jose CA July 1st 2010 small whte dot w/red and silver<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend was at our townhouse complex hot tub the previous day and said he&#39;d seen something really strange.  He was looking up in the sky and noticed several sea gulls flying in circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then he noticed a small white dot in the sky that looked like a gull but that was way higher in the sky.  He watched it for awhile and it didn&#39;t move.  It just hovered maybe 50-60,000 feet for awhile and then just dissapeared.  I thought he was just seeing things or that it was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, I go to the pool with him and he shows me where he was looking in the sky and I was giving him a hard time laughing about the possibility that he saw a UFO when I notice there are a bunch of gulls flying around again.  As I&#39;m looking at the birds, I notice this little white dot VERY high in the sky, definitely higher than commercial aircraft fly in the area.  It was so high it was really hard to tell what it was.  It wasn&#39;t moving at all which was creepy..  It was just sitting there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back to the house to grab my camear and binoculars.  When I came back, the thing had moved a little to the east.  I was able to see it in the binoculars but it was still super far away.  I could make out white, silver and a small glint of red.  I tried to zoom in with my camera and take a pic but when I switched from the binoculars to the camera I lost the object in the sky and couldn&#39;t find it again.  It totally dissapeared or just got so small on the horizon I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m totally baffled.  I somewhat believe in UFO&#39;s but I&#39;m wondering if this was more like a government craft, the space station or some other explination but we&#39;re researched and the space station was nowhere near this area of the sky that day and there were no other reports of this sighting, except for a very similar post in San Jose July 2009 on this site.  Same description..  I&#39;m still spooked and want to know if anyone else saw this?<n>
