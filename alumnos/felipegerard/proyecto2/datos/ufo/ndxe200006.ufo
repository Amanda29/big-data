It also seemed to change size and got so small and so close at times it looked like a model of some sort, but then it would get very large and shoot back out to what looked to be about 1-2 miles and hover again right out out above all the incoming jets coming in to Honolulu International airport.  I happened to be on a first date and it litterly scared the girl I was with, that she went running back to the car at one point.  It would seem to hover and travel slowly across the sky and then come in directly at us from time to time, thou always getting smaller when it would approach.  Then towards the end a red ball came out of nowhere and seem to meet up with the triangular craft then shoot away then come back, then both dissapeared.  Iheard the next day that there was joking about it on the radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

When I was about a block away from my house there was this oval shaped thing hovering just in front of me.  I stopped my bike a few feet away and just watched to see what it would do.  I&#39;ve always been into UFO&#39;s ever since I was really little and my favourite show is the X-Files.  Well anyways, while I was watching it I kinda of was hypnotized and the next thing I know these little metallic looking people are sticking me with what looked to be like a rake.  I don&#39;t remember anything that happened after that. And I don&#39;t remember how I got home.  Actually there is a lot of things I been forgetting lately and sometimes I have this weird feeling that something is controlling me, making me do things. That&#39;s my story if you have any Questions e-mail me at ((e-address deleted)).com. Thannk you for your time, ((name deleted)) (AND I&#39;M NOT CRAZY!)<n>

When I first sighted this object it was glowing bright white, Then suddenly change to a dim color.. could of been a satellite, but when i kept my eyes on the object i could see a dim outline around it of something bigger that wasnt lit.. got on the net right after i saw this , writing this 10 minutes after sighting... thank you.<n>
6/30/00 22:30|Paso Robles (Lake Nacimiento Region)|CA|Formation|I watched for several min|"Small, Satellite-Like Formation of 3 Lights, Performs Figure-eight Movements Around One Another in Night Sky"|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13259.html|4|ndxe200006| &#34;Small, Satellite-Like Formation of 3 Lights, Performs Figure-eight Movements Around One Another in Night Sky&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is now the 2nd night I have had to report an unusual sighting in my area....I submitted a report on 6/29/00 concerning a color-changing ball of light that would move.... However, tonight, again as I stood out on my back deck waiting for my dog to come in from defecating, I looked to the area over the foothills (approx. 1/2 mile from my house) where I had witnessed the light phenomena last night.... I did NOT see the light at this time, however it was 2230 hours, and I had visualized the phenomena at 0100 hours on the 29th.... However, as I scanned the night sky, almost directly overhead i observed what i immediately thought to be a &#34;satellite&#34;..I am familiar with satellites, in that I have witnessed them as a very small, non-blinking white light that moves in a straight path across the sky... It is my opinion that it is almost HARD to actually get the chance to SEE a satellite, as they are small and are not always in your area of the sky... However, I witnessed this small, white, non-blinking or color changing light fly overhead north-east to a south-west.  I verified that it was flying east-west via (3) methods:  #1.  The foothills I have spoken of seperate my region from the coast and the San Simeon/Hearst Castle area of California..The foothills are thereby to the west of me.   #2.  I have an online map program that verified MY address and located San Simeon to be (as the map verified)to my exact West...The object flew overhead and to the south-west slightly....Within about 20 seconds I saw a second, identical object fly in the same trajectory as the first (as if following it)...and within about 30 seconds, a third, also identical object passed along that same path/trajectory... I immediately thought that this was unusual because satellites do not tend to be so close together....For the next few seconds I did not watch the objects, but then when i looked above to approximately the same area i had first observed the first object, I noticed that there were now (3) objects (I believe them to be th! e same a s the objects I just mentioned), that at first came together (As if they might collide) then they began to do what i call &#39;dance&#34; around one another in a figure eight type or elyptical pattern... I watched the objects about another 30 seconds (I had already been out watching them several minutes TOTAL by then), but I began to become a bit frightened, as I had NEVER seen any planes, etc. perform circling/figure-eight type movements around one another...I went back inside and tried to inform my husband, who, again, was unable/unwilling to confirm my sighting.  I made an immediate call to your report line, and this written follow-up is consequent to that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at some length with the party who submitted this report, and we found her to be an exceptionally good witness.

I was laying on our bed in master-bedroom just gazing at the stars as it was a still/quite night.  We have a sliding door from the bedroom and the kitchen area leading out to patio.  I noticed a bright white, round object.  What made me aware/alert that it was not a star was that it was Number 1:  Making itself WINK in and OUT.  2:  It made itself GROW LARGE &amp; then GROW SMALL again repeatedly.  This went on for awhile.  3:  I decided to call a close friend of mine that I had worked with in the Aerospace Industry locally years ago to come over and see what I was witnessing.  So she came over with one of her brothers to see the object.  We went into the Kitchen and started to watch the object from the sliding glass door inside the house in the kitchen area as it was cold outside.  We witnessed the object continue to WINK IN AND OUT and Change Size.  Then we watched it do MANUEVERS at HIGH SPEEDS across the Sky then stop and then REVERT BACK to the original area it first was seen.  We got excited.  We also saw a Small Commerical Airplane in the area and that Airplane took off as fast as it could when it saw the OBJECT we was seeing.  It got the heck out of the area as fast as it could.  We all laughed together because we all thought gee we are glad we ain&#39;t up there with that strange object in the sky.  My friends brother however after awhile he was in denial of what we was seeing so he made excused by saying it had to be someone pointing a flashlight in the sky playing tricks outside.  I never bought into that theory as you would have to be an idiot not to realize the object we saw a flashlight could not perform that kind of manuever nor that high up in the sky as well as blink in and out and disapear from the naked eye and then reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night I decided to borrow my friends husbands Binoculiars to view the sky and see if the object would reappear.  This time it was ANOTHER object far up into the sky it was Triangle Shape in size with Three round objects underneath on each point of the craft.  It was stationary.  I placed a call this time to Nasa up in Palo Alto/Sunnyvale area in the Bay Area.  A lady got me in touch with a well-known Scientist, book author who studied this type of stuff.  He was a member of Mufon he and his partner came and interviewed, video-taped me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several years after these events while I was out in our Hot tub in the backyard I witnessed a Light PINK Translucent UFO that was able to Appear out of no where and it was almost in the shape of a FLY just to give you an idea of the SHAPE.  It somewhat flowed and then disappeared.  It was most incredible to have seen out of all the ones I have seen over the years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So far I have seen 2 Orange Round Objects, 1 Triangle Object, 1 round Object, 1 Pinkish Translucent Object shape of a Fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Immeditaly my mother and I knew something was wrong because the object was hovering above a bunch of trees and slowly spinning in a circular motion. This made us look at it closer. We then noticed that it did not have wings of any kind, it was a solid traingle with bright white lights in each corner and a few little red lights in the middle of the object. I think what was weirdest about the object is the way it was hovering...I can&#39;t really explain it but it was like nothing I had ever seen, it was so still and moving in a perfect circle...the lights in the middle of the craft were moving in a circle also but at rapid speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for a bit and the more we looked the more freaked out we got and my mom decided that she wanted to drive away. We had never stayed to see what it would do next and to this day I get chills talking about it. It was really really weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary date above, which corresponds to the statement by the witness that the event occurred &#34;about 6 years ago.&#34;  PD))<n>

My home is situated on almost six acres of woods near  the Ward Pound Ridge reservation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suddenly noticed a bright, bluish white, xenon light streak into view and stop. It began to zig and zag, stopping briefly at the end of each zig and zag and going from one skylite to the other. Almost as if it was looking in.  I screamed to my husband to come see and he ran from the bathroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran to the north facing windows of our room and observed its zigs and zags over the tree tops, in the direction of the reservation, for several minutes.  It moved laterally, diagonally and horizontally  and always stopping briefly at the end of its movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its size, as we observed it streaking over the treetops, was similar to a small plane&#39;s from that distance.  It struck us as very similar to a firefly and we wondered if it might have been a firefly but later we saw real fireflies and they had softly green glowing bodies, clustered around each other, and did not move like this bright bluish white light did.  Fireflies also did not suddenly streak off into the sky at the incredible speed that this bright light did when it was done doing whatever it was doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light returned two nights later and we were able to observe it once more, now really amazed and acting like children we were high-fiving each other and yelling &#34;we saw a UFO! and it came back to visit us!&#34; The incredible speed that this light/object was moving at was truly unusual.  We&#39;ve watched planes go by and I&#39;ve even spotted satellites at night moving slowly  along the sky, meteorites, comets, etc, nothing moved like this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is a successful advertising executive and has met and worked with many prominent individuals, including Buzz Aldrin and Jane Goodal.  I&#39;m an artist,  with BA in Anthropology and Sociology (magna cum laude) and mother of three and studying to get Masters in Education to teach Social Studies to adolescents.

I followed it from that check point til i came to one of the other check point ill call it check point 56. I stood outside the truck looking up to get a better look it went directly over me it was triangle in shape with the pointed ends wedged ( they were not pointed ) they had a white light at the wedged ends. there was no sound when it went over me, i seen what looked like a matalic triangle center or it was hollow i couldnt really tell all i know there was stars or a reflection of stars on the bottom that is why i said matalic there was also several lights along the bottom of the craft. then it excellerated that is when it made a noise like engines, and tilted to the side as it as it started moving away from me. I noticed several of what looked like windows in one of these windows was somthing that looked like a small being. I went back to my partner i had that night to see if he seen anything he said he didn&#39;t i also checked with the airport in the area they said there was nothing on the monitor bet i could make a report i felt very dumb and i was too afraid to make a repot at the time. a few days later i was dianoced with uveitias in my eyes wich made them both very light sensative there was no explination as to why my eyes became light sensative all i can think of was the sighting i don&#39;t know if there was a connection or not.it has bothered me ever since for some reason i can&#39;t get it out of my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting in 2000 is approximate.

The two of us and my mother were walking to a nearby friend&#39;s house a few blocks away at anywhere between 9-10 because it was a dark summer night so it was quite late. Me and him were looking up at the sky and we noticed a v formation of orange objects. They were very hard to see since they were so high up. We had problems just trying to follow them. They didn&#39;t keep a strict v formation though. It was very much like birds migrating. They tend to stick in a v but every now and then one would move over to the side or so. We knew they weren&#39;t birds since the formations were so extremely high up and glowing orange. My mother couldn&#39;t see them most likely since she shrugged it off as child play. We watched the slow moving objects as closely as we could until we got to our destination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

As we sat on the porch facing east my husband was identifiying birds flying along the lake&#39;s inlet.  There were jets flying to and from Austin&#39;s airport, formerly Bergstrom Air Force Base, and even light planes were flying over us intermitantly. My eye was drawn to a very bright white object which suddenly appeared to the right of the area we had been watching.  It was flying rather quickly to the southeast at four to five thousand feet. The western sun reflected on the object and we were able to see the side of a large cylindrical object with a very distinct round, flat rear end, also bright white.  We were not able to see the front of the craft from our vantage point.  After about thirty seconds we saw the round rear of the craft enter the only cloud in the sky and we lost sight of it altogether.  There was no noise made by the craft.  The two areas in which my husband and I disagree is the angle in which the object flew, he says at a tilt and I say parallel to land, and what the front of the craft might have looked like.  My husband believes the front was flat and I just couldn&#39;t tell because the object appeared suddenly and was past our point of determination.<n>

This first craft was in the shape of a v, it made absolutely no noise, which is what made me look twice. Usually you hear a loud noise with a plane. I watched it fly out of site; it was about the same speed as a plane I would guess. I stayed outside a while longer looking at the sky and about 1 min later I saw another one. This one was much different from the first. As with the first, it made absolutely no noise. This one was long and was thin compared to its length. It was huge. I stared at it as it crossed the sky and when it went over my head, I could see two very bright lights on the bottom, which almost seemed like they were pointing directly at me. This one went about the same speed as the first. One really odd thing about this second craft is that it almost seemed to move, kind of like a snake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no photos and so cannot prove this but I thought I would let you know. I will carry my camera with me always from now on!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I&#39;m 26 year&#39;s old with two little girls....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t really know who to tell my story to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve had these strange sorts of events happening to me throughout my life.  They were coupled with different feelings... confusion, fear, disbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of it really made sense until I saw in detail what I&#39;m about to tell you.  I knew that everything I had questioned before was no longer questionable.  It was undisputed in my mind.  It has been going on my entire life and now there is finally an event that proves (to me) that this is real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll start by telling you that my cousin ((name deleted)) was with me when this happened...  He has been in the navy now for about 8 years.  He is a trustworthy person and his word means a lot to everyone that knows him.  Not only is it me telling the story, but he can verify that what I&#39;m telling you is true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin and myself were sitting on the back porch of my house (which was also my bedroom).  It was my bedroom at the time because it was a room enclosed with glass walls.  Some of the sections of the glass had been removed and either had screens remaining or nothing left in them at all.  Since it was summer, this wasn&#39;t really a problem.  I actually loved being in a room that allowed me to look outside at nature and even the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had a couch-bed in the room that was unfolded at the time.  It was unfolded for most of the summer so that my cousin could sleep over and &#34;hang out&#34; with me.  The backside of the couch-bed was placed against the glass, so the unfolded bed occupied the space in the room facing the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were laying in bed trying to sleep but we spent most of our time talking instead.  Then, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a red glowing orb that came into view from behind the house and was slowly moving across the sky.  *See Attached Photo*  I got ((name deleted)) attention and we both watched the orb move across the treeline that was north of the trailer park.  It seemed to not be as far away as a plane should be.  It look to be about the size of a basketball approximately 50 yards away.  I then realized that it was getting closer and that it clearly was not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved across the sky, we watched as this incredible UFO was slowly moving toward a treeline where we assumed it would disappear out of our lives forever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But instead of disappearing into the sky... I could still see it through the trees moving towards the ground. I could clearly see it flickering through the trees and I would estimate it to be approximately 10 feet off of the ground as it entered the field on the left.  It had clearly made a 90 degree turn. At this point in time I realized that it was probably in the field that was on the other side of the treeline.  (Treeline: small patch of woods separating the trailer park and a field.)  It traveled the length of the field before I could not see it through the trees anymore.  I would estimate the length of the field to be about 200 yards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin and myself sat in awe even after we could not see the UFO anymore.  He turned to me and said &#34;let&#39;s go check it out!&#34;  I sternly answered with, &#34;hell no! are you f**king crazy??&#34;  I was not sure what I had just seen but I had a gut feeling that I did not want to find out. So, we waited...waited... two young boys waiting to see something else as amazing as what they had just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it happened...<n> <n><n> <n><n> A flash, as if someone had taken a picture from a camera, appeared at my friend ((name deleted)) trailer.  It was on the other side of her trailer, preventing me from seeing the source of the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately two minutes later, another flash... this time, from the side of her trailer. I still couldn&#39;t clearly see the source of the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, my cousin and I were starting to think something strange was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few moments later, another flash. This time, I could clearly see the source of the flash... nothing.  It appeared as if the flash was angled towards ((name deleted)) house, although there was no source of the flash.  There was absolutely nothing visible to the naked eye that created this OBVIOUS flash.  Bud and myself both KNEW that flashes that are that distinct do NOT come from NOTHING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited about five more minutes still staring out into the trailer court through my glass room.  We were now more worried about what was in the court than what we had seen earlier.  Without speaking to each other for what seemed like five or ten minutes, another flash happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time it was at my friend ((name deleted)) house - directly in front of my house.  The flash was on the other side of the trailer and appeared to be aimed at his mothers bedroom.  Again we waited... wondering what the flashes were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another couple minutes had gone by.  Another flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time, it was clearly pointed at Tommy&#39;s window and there was NOTHING at the source of the flash.  In my mind I could pinpoint, to the INCH, where the flash had started, yet there was nothing there. ((name deleted)) looked to me and said,  &#34;what the hell are those flashes?&#34;  I had no reply.  I wanted to remain silent and hidden from whatever had been making the flashes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again we waited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About another five minutes passed when there was a flash on the other side of Mr. Wilson&#39;s house.  (That wasn&#39;t his real name, but we knew him as Mr. Wilson in the trailer park.)  So, we waited what seemed like forever.  In reality, it was probably 15 to 20 minutes with no sign of flashes or anything similar to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quite suddenly, Bud looked at me and said &#34;well, I&#39;m getting tired. wake me if anything happens.&#34;  He then put his head right down on his hands where he was sitting (propped up on his knees on the backside of the couch bed).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said, &#34;okay&#34; but wondered how anybody in their right mind could just fall asleep that fast after witnessing what we had witnessed. In my mind,  I would not go to sleep until the sun was up and people were awake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to get the strange feeling that the happening wasn&#39;t over.  Then... I started piecing things together that were quite simple and obvious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. ((name deleted)) lives with her mother and father.  There were 3 flashes at her trailer. (aimed at their bedrooms… )  2. ((name deleted)) lives with his mother. There were 2 flashes at his trailer. (aimed at their bedrooms, also...)  3. Mr. ((name deleted)) lives alone. There was one flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured that if they had gone through flashing every individual, as they went around from left to right in the court, since Wilson was last they had to turn around and come up the other line of trailers...starting with mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I almost panicked as I came to the realization of what I believed was true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my head in the direction of where I believed the thing causing the flash to be.  As I turned my head I could clearly see out my window (one that did not have glass or screen in it - open - nothing obstructing my view) an alien.  I had turned quick enough to spot him before I saw a flash come from, what seemed like, his forehead..........<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the flash hit me, he disappeared and I realized I was completely paralyzed.  As I tried to move my limbs, I looked around to realize that I was no longer on the same part of my bed that I had been during the flash.  I was, in fact, at the foot of my bed on my knees staring at the open window as if nothing had happened. Instantly, the numbness was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed the back of Bud&#39;s leg (because he was in the same position that he had been in when he laid his head down...)  It appeared that he had not moved at all.  But somehow I was at least 4 feet away from where I was when I had seen the flash...?  When I grabbed his leg I screamed extremely loud &#34;BUD! wake up!&#34;  His head came off of his hands with his eyes wide as if he knew something wasn&#39;t right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t have to say anything to each other as we both jumped up and ran into the kitchen.  We each armed ourselves with butcher knives, not knowing how much time had gone by or if the threat was still around. He asked me what had happened.  The only way I could really describe it to him was &#34;I was flashed..&#34;  Bud KNEW what I meant by that, which told me that I wasn&#39;t just seeing things and that I wasn&#39;t alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about two minutes of silence.. waiting for something else to happen.. we finally laughed at the fact that we were standing armed in the kitchen with knives... waiting for aliens to come.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed ridiculous to us.  Although it had clearly just happened, we couldn&#39;t really wrap our minds around it.  So, we laughed it off and this time we went to bed INSIDE of the house, instead of the room surrounded with glass windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (This event has made me realize that more than one time in my life - for a split second - I have seen aliens and &#34;the flash&#34;. I have seen them in my bedroom window... I have seen them outside of my tent while sleeping in the woods* the same woods that are between the trailer park and the field I described*... I have had many occasions where, just for a second, I believed that I had been part of an alien abduction. Seeing what I have seen and the fact that I have witnessed a UFO, I have seen that UFO land in my field, I have seen something flash friends and neighbors, and I have been flashed by something that came from the sky... this is not your ordinary alien story because to this day I cannot say that I fully remember ever communicating with an alien or being aboard their &#34;crafts&#34;. But that doesn&#39;t mean that I haven&#39;t seen, felt, or experienced something extremely out of the ordinary. My cousin was there as a witness to the UFO and to all six flashes... (the seventh, of co! urse, being my own) I have no explanation as to WHAT exactly the flashes are or WHAT they do to people, but I do think that they were meant for individual people... and to somehow make a person &#34;unaware&#34; that something is going on... whether by putting them to sleep... paralyzing them... or wiping out their memory... I don&#39;t know for certain. What I do know for certain is that I have had many encounters with them and I believe that I truly know how they arrive. To put it bluntly, I&#39;ve caught them in the act of flashing people. I believe that they were completely unaware that I had spotted them, until it was too late. I feel as though they knew that they had made a mistake. I had witnessed their mistake and I almost FELT the reaction of the alien as.. panic. For the instant that I saw him, I knew in my gut that he was as scared of me as I was of him. I knew that their &#34;routine&#34; was not supposed to have been witnessed by anyone. We are supposed to be dazed and unaware by the ! flash when they come.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was completely black with no detail. It was as if a door into blackness temporarily opened and closed. There were clouds behind it, but nothing showed through it. Direction or view: East by Southeast. Angle of Elevation from viewer: 25 degrees. Apparent Distance: 2 to 4 miles.

We looked at each other and I asked &#34;did you see that&#34; and the said very loudly a resounding &#34;yes.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was also odd was that it made no sound, gave no vapor or other trail.  I&#39;ve served as a paratrooper jumping out of prop and jet aircraft, been involved in military aviation activities, served as an Army Aviation Brigade Headquarters Company Commander, and also been a student pilot flying in various prop aircraft.  While stationed and living in Orlando, my family and I watched 13 or 14 NASA rocket lift offs from Patrick AFB (1) and from our yard (remaining 12 or so).

And the odd feeling that something was touching me. I immediately ran to the window to see what could be making such a bright white light.  It was shaped like an airplane, except it had no wings.  It was hovering just a few feet away.  I was so excited I just stared at it.  The light blinked, as though something walked in front of the light.  It seemed like two shadows.  Then the light flashed brighter and I was blinded and all I could see was this light and nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog was growling and whining at the window.  The only time she acts like that is when there was a deer in our back yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw the ship raise a little bit, point the nose to the sky, and disappeared in the blink of an eye.  I went to bed, when I woke up I had a strange mark on my arm, and a weird mole sticking out of my stomach.  It felt weird, so I was uncomfortable and started pulling at it.  I worked on it for a couple of years and I was constantly pulling at it.  Then finally I gave it a good pull and a long string noodle thing came out of my arm, like a vein and it was a foot long.  I thought I&#39;d pulled my vein out but it wouldn&#39;t come all the way out.  I thought it was connected to me because I felt pulling on my stomach, on the inside.  So I took a pair of scissors and cut it off.  It was so repulsive that I flushed it down the toilet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My wife was resting on the bed.  I noticed a light from the corner of my left eye and thought that it was a jet landing at NELIS AIR FORCE BASE then I noticed a second then a third then maybe 4 or 5 more, but then I noticed it turning towards Downtown L.V. and that it wasn&#39;t planes of any kind and that it was huge, by huge I mean at least a mile long and I think about 4 stories high and it blended in with the night.  The way it turned or banked to the right I could tell that the lights that I saw where engines because of the way it was banking I could tell the shape and almost size of it.  I was out of my chair while it went behind Fitzgealds Casino for about 3sec. and came back into view going over downtown L.V. heading west slowly I felt like I could touch it but it was wishful thinking I guess because I believe in U.F.O.s since around 1953 when my mother and I first saw our first U.F.O. in Cleveland OH. off Lake Erie from Canada, but thats another story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But back to Las Vegas, I was so excited that I yelled to my wife to come here quick which she did and I asked her to look out in front of her and tell me what you see and she replied something dark and looked smoky or misty like a silk sheet blowing in the wind. The reason I asked her what she saw was so that I wouldn&#39;t influence her in any way. The reason she didn&#39;t see the lights or engines was because the thing leveled off. To me when it leveled off it looked like some kind of cloak like on the t.v. show Star Trek.

AFB said no activity in area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object appeared suddenly as yellow light 3 times the brightnes of brightest stars around in NW direction at attitude? of 4 fist lengths above horizon.  UFO moved erratically like an insect, drunken driver, or balloon in descending path toward the Southwest.  It disappeared behind trees in less than 90 seconds. From  my line of sight it never went more than 1/4 inch w/o change in yaw(?) or pitch most often 1/8th or less.  Total change of bearing about 90 degrees in no more than 90 seconds.  About 5 foot spread of my arms, my height is 5&#39; 6&#34;.  Traverse seemed steady but erratic compared to background stars and trees 100 to 300 feet away at 2 fist lengths above horizon.  Called my wife to observe and she thought it was something she had never seen.  I&#39;m pretty alert for almost 73 and she&#39;s a sharpie at 70. At first I thought landing lights of plane in heavy crosswinds.  Then helicopter in some crazy manuevers.  Even harrier putting on a show.  Didn&#39;t make much sense.  Hardly any breeze.  Too quick response for copter.  Beale AFB security, command  said no more activity after dark, checked with PRAPA(?) their satelite trackers and reported nothing at that azimuth(?).  Object disappeared behind trees just where Beale might be some 15miles to the SW.  Probably some hotshot AF checking his bombing run manuevers, right?  They do  U-2, Blackbird, and other stealth stuff there. Also they ate supposed to have radar responsibility for the entire US Northeast.

I have watched  meteors for years and have seen thousands of Meteors and fireballs. This was the most impressive meteor I have ever seen . It started in Cygnus and cut through the tail of the Big Dipper on an almost true westerly course and went all the way to the horizon and out of sight. It was orange in color and left a luminois trail all the way across the sky, that glowed for several seconds , even through the glare of the town lights . I know this is not A UFO report but I would bet many people seen this . So any reports of A great fireball or the such across So. Ill. will probably be this rascal.

It went down to the ground very fast. I estimate the altitude at about 5000 feet above ground level. It must have been going over a thousand miles per hour. I thought maybe it was a firework, being the july fourth weekend. However, I did not see any fireworks in the area before or after the sighting. To me, this was a ufo. It is possible that this is explainable, and not out of this world, but it traveled faster than anything manmade (airplane, etc.)<n>

Let me give you some background information as to my location....I live in a rather remote area, 15 miles from the nearest town.  The few neighbors that i have were asleep at the time of the sighting, as was my husband.  I was awake at 0100 hours to &#34;let my dog out&#34; to defecate...I have a back wood deck and behind the deck is a partially wooded area (Oak trees)and a very remote/unpopulated area that stretches on for approximately one half mile to the large foothills (1/2 mile away).  I stood on my back deck as my dog walked the remote area behind my deck (as aforementioned above)...I looked out at the night sky, as I often do, and was immediately drawn (my eye caught sight of) a VERY bright light that was directly over the nearest foothill to me  (this area would be to the west)...The object, as mentioned, would change colors (MUCH more dramatically than the twinkling i have seen of a &#34;star&#34;, and I could directly visualize in the very clear night sky, the silhouette of the foothill-top with large trees/etc as &#34;points of reference&#34;.  It was in using these &#34;points of reference&#34; that I was able to watch the object move (what i would term &#39;gently float&#39; left to right then up and down....I estimate that it would move within 1/4 - 1/2 mile of its original place in the sky, as it moved right-left and up and down....At no time did i see it land on the hill, but at times it appeared to be no more than perhaps 100 feet or so from the hilltop.  I watched the object for about 5-10 minutes outside, and then returned inside to inform my husband.  My husband was asleep, and thereby I COULD not inform him at the time (Needless to say i ! did try to wake him up..but my attempt was futile).  I went into my daughters room and watched the object through her levolor blinds for about an hour more...It was still continuing with the same readily apparent movements and color changes..... I attempted to sleep, but awoke after 1/2 hour..looked out the window again and the light was gone.  I am a professional nurse, educated, married and well-respected.. I have never felt the need to report an event before...But I truly feel this was an unusual phenomena.<n>

We had seen a couple of shooting stars and airplanes pass by. This though I have never seen before. An object resembling a very large star or planet moving from the north into view.This object  moving at a high speed then dims itself, or drastically changes elevation. From my viewpoint these are the only explanations I have come up with. This object looked like it became smaller. The funny thing was that this object was moving more into view. Different than looking at something above you only to see it dim into the horizon. This dimmed from the horizon as it moved overhead. I am not aware of any craft that could move so quickly.<n>

It was directly south of me when I first saw it.  I called for my daughter to bring binoculars.  By then the object was in the east.  Viewed through binoculars the object did not display the normal light configuration of an airplane. There were no red or green or flashing white lights. The object was at an estimated altitude of 20,000 feet and traveled at a speed comparable to that of a Lear Jet traveling at that altitude.  It made no manuvers, and did not make ANY sound. The object passed south and east of my location (2 miles North of Monticello) It appeared to pass directly over the town and flew northeast on a course that would have carried it near the town of Quitman, Georgia.  As it passed though an area of light cloud it gave off the kind of aura that is usually seen when car headlights move through fog. I am a retired USAF NCO with 25 years aircraft maintenance experience. I am also an astonomy enthusiast.  The Object was not an airplane that I could identify and was not a star, or meterior.  This report is not very timely, but may corrobarate some other sighting.<n>

Suddenly there was a flash of light in the direction I was watching and a triangular object appeared as if out of thin air.  I saw it long enough to discern the shape, but not much of anything else.  It went into a cloud. I waited to see it reappear but it didnt.  I thought I had to have been mistaken...it was a plane.  But just about the time I was sure I had misidentified a plane, an airplane came into view at about the same area and altitude. The triangular object appeared to be about one third the size of the airplane.  It was easy to see these two objects were very different.  The plane&#39;s wings were visible as were the windows.  It was a dull grey color contrasted to the bright silver of the first object.  Both the object and plane headed in a northerly direction. The airplane came throguh the clouds.

While they were in the pool they called me out to see these white star like lights in formation in the sky and an almost rainbow like color right around them. I kind of shrugged it off as maybe some satallites or something and told them not to worry about it. They were outside talking in the tent they were going to sleep in and around 12:30 I went out and told them to get some sleep and turn the lights out. I went in to get ready for bed and could hear them still chatting. As I was dosing off the phone rang. It was the other girls mother telling me to get outside that the girls needed me. I ran out and asked what was wrong and all hell broke loose. They were hysterical!! When I finally got them in the house and calmed down enough to understand them, they told me they were lying there getting ready to sleep and had just closed thier eyes when A bright light came in through the top of the tent and then a bunch of colored lights were flashing in on them and they tried to scream but couldn&#39;t. Then the lights moved to one side of the tent and then just vanished as quickly as it came. They were too scared to come out of the tent so they called the friends mother to get her to call me. I wish I hadn&#39;t slept through it I would have liked to have seen that.<n>

I was at a stoplight when I thought that it was very close to the ground (est. 500-600ft) and couldn&#39;t imagine an airplane being in such close proximity.  It was at this point when I realized that it appeared to be stationary and not moving.  It was approx. 1/8-1/4 mile down range and to my left as I was at the traffic light and as I continued on my way the road curves to the left and the object was now directly to my left about 9 o&#39;clock and still 500-600 ft in the air.  At this point I stopped my car in the middle of the road and rolled down the window to try and hear if it was a hovering helicopter or something.  It was dead quiet and now I could see that there were two distinct red pulsing lights to the rear of this object.  They pulsed slowly and intermittently.  I stared at this object in utter disbelief all the while waiting for another car to come by so I could verify this with someone else.  There were no other cars around.  I couldn&#39;t believe it and as I continued to stare at this thing for about 30-45 seconds I know it was completely still in its position.  Very bright forward lights with no defraction of light, by the way, and slowly pulsing red rear lights.  After this duration of time, this &#34;thing&#34; completely catapulted forward from its position roughly 1/4-1/2 mile away within 1/2-1 second.  When it did this I had a distinct guttural vibration of some sort and it took off like that and slowed immediately.  I literally screamed and took off to come home.  After I made my left turn at the next light  I knew I could see this object about 1/4 mile down the road and to my left because it was a clear view from there.  As I passed this area I could see the red pulsing lights, still the same distance above the ground but it looked to be about 3/4 mile away and it seemed to be slowly moving in that direction (away from me).  I made my right turn to enter my housing! development (300 feet away) and as I was going down this road I kept looking in my rearview mirror to see if I could see anything at all.  As I was driving down this winding road, all of a sudden this &#34;craft&#34; of somesort appears at my 11o&#39;clock and coming directly overhead on a slight angle so that as it passed over I would then be at my 5 o&#39;clock position.  It still seemed to be about 500-600 feet above ground and I again stopped my car in the middle of the road and rolled down my window to stick my head out to get a better view.  I was literally shaking with fear and/or excitement, I guess.  As it passed over me very slowly, I could make out what seemed to be underneath structure of some sort with 4 additional &#34;lights&#34; facing downward.  Because of the location of the red still pulsing lights, I had the distinct impression that it was sort of triangular in shape but more like a wedge/boomerang.  It was moving very slowly and didn&#39;t make any noise at all.  It was extremely quiet and it traveled out of my sightline (many trees line this street)and I raced home thinking it was going to turn around and follow me.  I don&#39;t know for sure if it was the same craft as I observed prior to this, but I am convinced it was the same shape and size.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The approach for commercial planes was directly over the common heading due east, the opposite direction of which way the light was moving.  It was clearly not a helicopter for it made no sound resembling a helicopter, although it was possible this object was too high to hear the sound if it made one. It was visible for about ten seconds at about a 40 degree angle in the southern sky of where we at that particular point (the exact location of the sighting was about 100 yards north of the gate which across the st. is the public garden, the path next to the softball field).   if anyone else saw this object and can explain it or give more detail on it, feel free to email me.<n>

She was previously employed as a Colorado River guide in which occupation she conducted group trips on the Colorado.  Witness is a college graduate, with a BA in fine arts. On the night of June 27, 2000, witness was enjying a recreational 10-day river trip with 3 other adults (dob 1951, 1958, &amp; 1984).  The four were camped on the bank of the Colorado River in a wilderness site known as Cataract canyon in Canyonlands National Park, UT. At approximately 10 PM (MDT) Witnesses were seated outside their tent, contemplating the evening.  Witness states none of the four had consumed any alcohol or other intoxicant that evening.  Witness states she cannot recall what oother two were doing .  THey may have been inside their tent or possibly reading using a flashlight.  In any case, they were not looking at the night sky and did not witness the event which unfloded. Abruptly, witness states, both she and other witness observed an extremely bright light at elevation 45 degrees to the north.  Witness variously described the apparent size as that of a quarter at arm&#39;s length and one-half the size of the full moon.  It was &#34;as bright as&#34; the full moon and did not vary in intensity of light, witness states.  On that evening, witness recalls no coulds, no wind, stars visible, and no moon. Investigator consulted an ephemeris and confirms that on the date and time in question, the moon was not visible. Witness states the bright object was white in color, surrounded by a white halo edged in blue.  As both witnesses watched, the object extended a white beam downward (left angled) to the canyon wall.  The white beam was edged in &#34;defused blue&#34;as was teh object.  Witness states she saw the beam&#39;s leading edge move downward and then retract, whereupon the object diasppeared.  Duration 10 seconds. One possible explanation for the subject light is a helicopter-mounted searchlight.  Telephone calls to the area-wide helicppter facilities revealed no helicopters airborne within 24 hours of the event.  Calls to two local sheriff&#39;s offices (responsible for search &amp; rescue) and the two local airports revealed no helicpoter activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Ron Regehr and Elaine Douglas, co-State Directors for MUFON/Utah, for submitting the report.

As I watched it, it travelled east across the sky until it was beyond the eastern horizon. The event lasted about 90 seconds, allowing me time to get binoculars from the trunk of my car and watch it travel. The altitude remained constant throughout my observation as did the object&#39;s speed. The object appeared to be very far away, orange in color, with a &#34;tail&#34;. The object appeared to be very hot or burning because as I looked at it through the binoculars it appeared to have smaller pieces falling from the &#34;tail&#34; and they too would create a tail, but they would drop in altitude. A co-worker of mine also witnesses the object, as did my neighbor, who was outside at the same time as me. My co-worker thought it was something from Vandenberg AFB, but I have never seen anything from there travel inland.<n>

On the second downward movement I saw light reflect on the side of the Butt. It went around the front of the Butt slowly.  I was stopped on the side of the road watching this ,  when I first stopped I called a friend to have him mark the time and listen to me. I decided to get home and get my bionoculars, when Idid this the ball of light was gone.  I could just kick myself for not waiting to see how it left! and in what direction, etc.  I watch the skies often, I now what aircraft look like, &#34;falling stars&#34;, meteors,  but I have never seen anything like this before! VERY white, bluewhite, fast silent reminded me of Tinkerbell in Peter Pan.<n>

I would start by saying, someone, or a few people in the surrounding area, had to have witnessed the same event. In the local areas, there&#39;s the Hilton hotel, where someone possibly, may have been looking out of the window. Tower for air traffic control and the everyday travelers, some other eyewitness, to the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My job includes outside work. while I had noticed how clear it was that night, It was going through my mind, is that the big dipper or little dipper. At the left corner of my eye, I spotted this bright light, yellow/green in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was round from the bottom, flat, slowly moving over the top of the terminal building, near what was then called,  the round house.The object was smaller then the round house, mybe by a half size. Could it have been curious, about the shape, looking like it&#39;s own. This was a restaurant, with coffee shops etc.,on the top level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was below the main tower, no more then a few hundred feet above the terminal bldg.. As it slowly moved, from where I was standing, towards the center of what airline employees call the ally, ramp area for taxing aircraft to the gates, I&#39;m thinking, no noise is being made, I&#39;m trying to make out some detail, there&#39;s to much of a glow. Then it was directly over my head, it stop for no more then one second, then it shot out towards my right. It moved so fast, you could see an after glow, tailing behind.  If you were to count, one, two,by three, it was over the trees, that&#39;s beyond the border of the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next thought, I need to get this down on paper. I ran into one of readyrooms, area for ground services, found a sheet of paper, and wrote down everything I had remembered. One thing I need to mention, a few days before, I heard on the radio, there was something that was picked-up on radar, eariler that week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The explanation, one of the facility bldgs. being picked-up, it was nothing to be worried about. This was no dought, a cover-up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I mentioned before, someone else had to have seen it as well. I would hope, someone could come foreward, and varify my story, it&#39;s the honest to GOD true event that took place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was told, say nothing, people will thing, your crazy. This was from a friend, who did not believe me. I believe the facts and the truth, need to be told.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>

I caught a glimpse of what appeared to be an airplane moving slowly across the sky, as it moved over head I then thought it was a satelite due to the extreme altitude and that the light never blinked.  Just after the light passed directly over head it increased to a speed four times faster as it headed south. It made no sound, left no contrail As I moved out away from my house to keep sight of it, 2 airforce jets flying in a tight formation flew north to where I first spotted the light, then turned south hard towards the objects flight path.  I ran through the house and out the back door the object was pulling away from the jets at an incredible rate.  The jets broke off and headed back north.  I have lived in Las Vegas for 13 years and I have been to the edge of Area-51 and seen things in the sky that I could not explain but never have I seen something fly over the city and display speeds of this nature.  This object was at an incredible altitude and the speed was remarkable.  Can satelites increase their speed?  Did anyone else see this?<n>

This light began to move. It had probably been moving, even before it caught my eyes. The sky was clear, with not many stars visible, because it was not very dark yet. This light was moving from south to north, in a fairly slow speed. I never saw any blinking lights, as I would on an airplane. I went in for my binoculars,to see better. I could not get a clear picture of the flying light, just bigger. I went in to log in your Reporting Center, to see if there had been any sightings in our area recently. The most recent reported was on my birthday 4/28. However, I found that close enough in time, if there has been any others reported, or if there is some activity going on in the Pacific Northwest. This sighting took place for less than a half hour ago. The light was a steady bright white. There were no other lights, that I could see.<n>
6/26/00 22:20|Otis/Lincoln City|OR|Unknown|1-3 seconds|Witnessed bright light/object  seemingly intensify and then accelerate away in a matter of about 1-2 seconds.|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13181.html|49|ndxe200006| Witnessed bright light/object  seemingly intensify and then accelerate away in a matter of about 1-2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live on the Cascade Head, west of Hwy 101, north of interchange, Ha! with Hwy 18 from Salem, mountainous by the coast northwest of Salem river estuary, excellent visibility, virtually no city lights except to the south. Walked out of rear of house made turn then facing ene, looked up, bright object caught my eye at about 15 degrees ene of top dead center if you were to draw a perpendicular line straight up from my position. Object at first appeared brighter than any star normally would and then intensified to 10 to 20 times greater in magnitude than any normal stellar object other than moon or sun. Light was not awesomely brilliant or unpleasant but bright. Intensity similar to moon at about 70% full. Not certain about definition until object appeared to reach brightest point and then either roll, turn to se, or accelerate rapidly away from my position. I first thought it might be a satellite or nortorious space junk as the time of night and season would probably be about right as this was just nearing total darkness and something at that altitude might be catching the last reflections of the sun prior to moving into termination however I am left with the stongest impression that it banked or rotated to the east and acclerated out of view in less than a second. The impression was similar to the way &#34;starships reach warp drive on Star Trek&#34; just with a less distinct tail or trailer. I did not get an errie feeling. I have seen satellites react similarly before but not with a sense that they have accelerated away from my position but more that they have continued on the path much fainter having lost the benefit of the sun&#39;s reflection.I could not pick the object up again. It gave me the impression of being a luminated disk not in definitive outline but in manner of the luminous area dispacing the normal dark background of the sky. Although not able to see more than perhaps 40-60% of the sky from our position due to mountains and trees the star just a bit(1-2 degrees) to the north of object appears to b! e one of the 5 brightest in this nights sky. Object in question was approx. the size of a silver dollar to a penny in comparing the two.<n>

6/26/00 21:30|San Diego|CA|Light|3-3.5 sec|I saw a single blue-green light in the sky traveling north to south at a high rate of speed without a sonic boom or engine noise.|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13184.html|51|ndxe200006| I saw a single blue-green light in the sky traveling north to south at a high rate of speed without a sonic boom or engine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a small, blue-green light, similar to what might be on an aircraft, steady and unblinking, traveling from north to south.  I was driving westbound on HWY 52 and was nearing the interchange with I-5.  It was shortly after 9:30p.m. and I was heading to work.  There was some patchy fog along the coast, on the other side of Mt. Soledad.  I live near Miramar Marine Corps Air Base, which does have frequent military aircraft and helicopters that fly out to the ocean, and turn southward before flying back to the east.  I have grown up as a Navy dependent, and I also served in the Navy for some time, so I am used to seeing aircraft maneuvers and flybys.  What struck me was the incredible speed of this object.  I did not see any shape of the aircraft itself, only the light, which looked like a beacon.  I did not hear any jet noise either.  The object, or light, did not appear to be circling south and then east, as I would expect having seen other aircraft use this flight path.  Instead, it continued southward, and I lost it as it passed behind Mt. Soledad, which would make the object appear to be somewhere over the ocean, and even further away.  Unfortunately, I can not give a fair approximation of the distance it covered, due to it being dark, and initially when I saw the light, I didn&#39;t have a point of reference to place it near, but due to the incredible speed that the object moved in the 3 seconds that I saw it, I believe that this was not normal, whenever I have seen an jet fly this fast, I have expected to hear a sonic boom with it.  There was none.  I have tried to reconcile that an illusion brought on by the fog, may be part of this, but it still does not make sense.  I was hesitant in reporting this to you, but thought perhaps it might help, if anyone else reports a sighting from the same area at the same time and date.<n>

As I was in a parking lot and happened to look into the sky, I saw two aircraft vapor trails, which intersected at an approximate 30 degree angle.  At the point of intersection, one trail, traveling appx. NNW, ended, or merged with the trail traveling appx. N.  There was no curviture of the NNW trail - it just immediately ended, or merged.  The N. trail continued, and there was a jet making this trail, ahead of the intersect point.  I could clearly make out the jet, and just as clearly, make out that there was not another jet slightly above or below.  Also, it is worth noting that both trails were created at the same, or nearly the same time, as they faded out also at the same distance in the sky, and their concentration appeared to be equal. I have never seen this before,and hope that I have related it clearly for you.  If you have additional questions, please do email me.

6/26/00 00:22|Los Angeles|CA|Unknown|20 seconds +/-|I observed a very fast, silent object(s),  heading roughly south to north while the lights occasionally seemed to tightly "pinwheel"|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13221.html|53|ndxe200006| I observed a very fast, silent object(s),  heading roughly south to north while the lights occasionally seemed to tightly &#34;pinwheel&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing on my back porch in the Silverlake District of Los Angeles at approximately 00:20, on Monday June 26th 2000, looking towards the south, when I saw two white and slightly hazy/luminous lights moving very quickly across the sky from the south-southeast heading towards the northwest.  The lights were no bigger than a match head at arms length, and were spaced an inch apart (at arms length).  There was no way to tell whether the lights were connected to the same object, but they always maintained the exact same distance from each other. The oddest thing about the lights was:  A) how quickly, and silently, they were moving across the sky   B) the light(s) would momentarily (lasting one or two seconds)and quite distinctly, yet gently, &#34;pinwheel&#34; or &#34;vibrate&#34; in tandem, and then smooth back out. This is the toughest part to describe  This motion did not appear to affect the velocity or direction of the object(s). The object never changed it&#39;s long arcing across the sky in the directions I mentioned above.  This slight movement happened maybe three or four times during the total viewing time. I watched the object(s) for at least 15 seconds as it moved across the sky.  The weather at this time was cool and relatively clear.  There were no clouds in the sky, the stars were out.  There was some light pollution, Silverlake is on the Eastern edge of the Los Angeles Basin. And in the direction of the sighting I&#39;m sure there was some low coastal haziness in the air.  This may account for the slightly luminous quality of the lights?  I couldnt estimate the height or distance, but they were at LEAST a hands width above the horizon line from my viewing position.  At the time of my sighting I noticed no other aircraft from my view. This was the only object in this part of the sky at the time. I went inside to note the time and started a sketch of the lights themselves. Maybe between 3 and 5 minutes later I stepped back out onto my porch and observed at least 3 or 4 airplanes puttering around the Los Angele! s Basin. None of them seemed to be trying to track or follow the object I had seen a few minutes earlier.  The flights were local police/news copters, commercial/delivery planes heading towards LAX, small private planes...etc.  3, maybe 4 in the sky.  They were all much closer than the object I had seen.  As my eye caught the object my first thought was shooting star, a high altitude jet, or satellite.  But when I noticed the other light right next to it I was a bit thrown. And then it did the tight pinwheel movement.... It really seemed to be quite a distance away.  I wish I could make a fair guess....  It had the type of high altitude depth you associate with the possible explanations I mentioned above: star, jet, or satellite.  It wasn&#39;t traveling as briskly as a shooting star, or as &#39;deep&#39; as a satellite, this was more like a high speed jet.  Another very odd almost-unrelated occurence is the fact that I just happened to be making an audio recording while I had the sighting.  I haven&#39;t listened back to this exact portion of the tape yet, but I think I will be able to get a much better estimate-guess as to the length of the sighting based on me clomping around the porch once I saw it.... That&#39;s about all I can recall right now.  By the way, I do not claim to be educated in aeronautical devices of any nature.  I could easily believe this was an airplane of sorts just tearing across the sky, at a distance that made it appear to be silent. I will admit that I have been fascinated by the UFO phenom since my first trip to the public library in 3rd grade, so I have done my fair share of watching the skies above ever since,  but I have never claimed to see anything that falls into the category of what I consider to be a UFO until this morning. I&#39;m curious to know if anybody else happened to see the same thing I did.  I was VERY CLOSE to calling my friend in Northern California to get up and take a look in the same part of the sky, just in the wildest chance that he saw anything like it, but that seemed a bit too hasty and kinda&#39; kooky, I guess.  I flipped on the local all news radio stations and listened for any mention, but there was nothing.  I also did some quick sketches of the overall view while it was still fresh in my head. So that&#39;s that on that.... I&#39;m proud to have done my reporting duty, and maybe this small tidbit will help complete a bigger picture for someone else.

My friend told me to look up at a satellite.  They obviously were not satellites.  They looked like they were at an extremely high altitude.  They both were strobe lights.  They would blink on, go out for approximately 5-6 seconds, blink on again, go out for 5-6 seconds.  They were very bright.  Eventually the lights eminating grew dimmer, we watched them blink dimly 3-4  times, then they vanished.  I would assume that they were headed straight up.  The sky was clear.  They were way brighter than satellites.<n>
6/25/00 21:23|Orange|CA|Light|15 seconds|Two objects flying in formation over Orange County|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13191.html|56|ndxe200006| Two objects flying in formation over Orange County<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9:15pm my family had concluded dinner at a friend&#39;s house and I was trying to correct the sighting scope on my friend&#39;s telescope, so that my son could use it more easily.  I had used some distant city lights from his hilltop ome, and had then turned the telescope East to run a test against the brightest object in the Eastern sky.  The brightest star (I could probably figure it out on sky charts) visible through the city lights stood about 30-35 degrees above the horizon, due East. As I positioned the scope so that the target came into the cross-hairs of the sighting scope, my son exited the house and stated that it was 9:23, and he needed to get home to study.  At that precise moment, two faint lights, similar to stars traversed the field of view, due North to due South, of the sighting scope above and below the target star.  Using the moon as a reference of 5%, I would estimate that the two lights were about 2 - 3% apart, with the leading light about 1% below the trailing light.  When they passed above and below the target star, the target star did not blink out. I looked around the sighting scope to see if I could pick up the stars with my naked eye.  I was not wearing my glasses, but could make out a slight, dull blur about where the two lights should be.  I returned to the sighting scope and picked the lights back up once again.  They continued to travel in the same direction and at the same speed.  I called my son over and pointed up to the are where the lights should be, hoping to take advantage of his better eyesight.  He could not find the objects before they disappeared behind the roofline. This house sits right amidst the approach lanes into John Wayne Airport in Orange County.  At the same time, about 6 airplanes were in the sky for comparison.  If these were aircraft lights, the aircraft would have to be at 30,000 feet  (not the couple of thousand that is typical for that close to the airport), be two planes flying in locked formation (to maintain position with respect to one another) and not one (because the target star was not obscured by their passing), and each would have to have a single warning light (white) in operation. Has I been able to see the objects from horizon to horizon in open land, it would have taken the objects about 30 - 45 seconds to travers the entire sky at their observed speed.<n>

The lights were coming from ether the football field of Cranston West High School or the baseball field. It&#39;s hard to remember some parts of the sighting for some reason.  I slowed my car down a bit but didn&#39;t stop moving.  Just as my neck reached its turning point in toughs last few seconds of view I noticed it lift slowly off the ground and movie in the direction I was driving.  I took the first right turn I could which was the parking lot of Western Hills School and drove as fast as I could to try and get another glimpse of this thing.  As I got to the back of the school where the road goes over the small river in-between the two foresty areas, what ever it was it flew right over me...  I tried to see it better but my car has a small sun roof so it was hard to see.  Plus it moved fairly quickly out from behind the trees on my right, over the road and then over the trees on my left.  I continued to drive forward but didn&#39;t see it again.   As I got home (my home is right down the road) I heard the sound of jets fly by.  All I could think was, &#34;Did that just happen?&#34;   As a side note, I can&#39;t really describe the thing I saw because it happened so fast and my memory of the ship or what ever it was is a bit foggy.

It was moving directly due South, approximately 5 degrees per second. At first I thought satellite but immediately dismissed that as it was too late and the sun too far West to illuminate an orbiting object. I then thought meteor as it seemed to have an orange or amber glow. I discounted that as there was no trail and the level of illumination did not change. As it came closer to overhead, I noticed the object was made up of 5 separate lights in the shape of a baseball diamond. The lights did not strobe or blink, but they flickered. I felt this was probably atmospheric disturbance. I tracked the object as it sped due South. I finally reckoned it was some aircraft with a non-regulation lighting arrangement when suddenly, without changing speed, the object made a 45 degree &#34;IMMEDIATE change of direction to the left (southeast).&#34; (THIS WAS NOT A &#34;TURN&#34;) and at the same time, the object increased it&#39;s speed threefold and disappeared.

They were traveling north to south at very high speeds and doing circular motions in the sky and moving in random patterns. Sometimes in an s shape and changiong patterns very quickly.  We observed this for about a half hour then noticed a long streak of light almost like a comet that originated at the horizion and moved extremely fast towards the stars above and then we no longer could see them<n>

We both were sitting on chairs looking up at the stars. It was partly cloudy outside. I was tilting my head back looking at the sky when I saw a dark cylinder  object sweep across the sky passing  straight above me coming from the East. angling off to the NorthWest. It was not brightly aluminated at all.A pail orangish color in spots.....if anything.... In fact if I had not been looking at the star, I may not have noticed it. It was more shadow than lit up but, I could see enough too see that it was a cylinder. It passsed through a thint transperant layer of broken up  clouds. My guess is that the clouds helped  illuminate it for me to see. It was so large in the sky, I jumped up and and said, &#34;My god&#34; .....My friend was not able to find it with his eyes. Believe me, I don&#39;t see how anyone could miss it! But I guess it was not meant to be noticed, Even though it was so large. It seemed to cast a feathery blurr when it angled off towards the north. It almost looked like a dark wing, with the cylinder in the middle. If you held your arm out straight up to the sky,, and made a space of about two and a half inches between your index figer and your thumb, that&#39;s how big it would have appeard in the sky. It made  no noise, no sound at all. It was very exciting!! That&#39;s the best I can tell you right now. Thank you for your time......<n>

I have a clear view starting at about 30-40 degrees above the horizon to 90 degrees. On the south are some trees and on the north is the backside of my house. I was sitting looking straight up and saw a faint light that flashed on 4-5 times in quick succession. The light came from the south and was going north at a very fast rate of speed. It appeared to be outside of the atmosphere based on brightness, speed, no sound. I frequently see a satellite going along a similar path at night but this was not the same. The first sighting was at 21:44 approximately. About 4-5 minutes later I saw what I thought was the satellite going in the same direction south to north but on a somewhat different path. It appeared much brighter than the other object but not different in appearance than it usually does when I see it. However it did appear to be moving much faster than it usually does.<n>

When two of my friends wanted to go jump on the trampoline, they left the tent and I was leaving trying to make my friend stay in as a joke, When I saw a bright Blue light blink, so I turned around and my two friends were looking up so I looked up to,when I saw a big floating circular disc not to far above us. Then I saw a cone come down from the ship. I knew it was a UFO. Then The cone went back up in the ship. Then it flew away to fast to see. After that we were standing there shocked for like 3-5 minutes. After we stoped standing there we were all scared. Then we dicided to still sleep in the tent. Even know I kinda didn&#39;t want to. When we were in the tent talking about what happend we saw the bright blue light blink again. We were all to scared to look. We all still talk about it to this day. We know for a fact that it wasn&#39;t an airplane because it blinked different then a airplane, and it just was floating there in the air for about a minute. So we definetley knew that it was a UFO. Please e-mail me back. THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE.<n>
6/23/00 22:40|Canyon|TX|Unknown|1.5 min|Brief but clear sighting of a noiseless lighted (3, reb, blue and white) object maneuvering and hovering.|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13214.html|74|ndxe200006| Brief but clear sighting of a noiseless lighted (3, reb, blue and white) object maneuvering and hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ten-yr-old daughter and I were relaxing in hot tub, just off back porch.  Sighting area:  to immediate west, a medium sized metal tool shed, backed by elm trees; directly overhead, some limbs from those trees; immediately north and northeast, the two-story house&#39;s southern eaves; to southeast, a huge elm tree; to east, at least 60 feet away, neighbor&#39;s house.  That left only a relatively small area of open sky visible almost directly above and to the west, framed by our house eaves, the elm tree, and the neighbor&#39;s house.  A lighted object came into view from among the elm branches, headed at a fairly slow speed to the north.  The object appeared to be quite high and displayed three separate lights in a triangular arrangement:  red, blue, and white.  If it had a &#34;nose,&#34; the blue light was at the &#34;front,&#34; with the red light on the west side and white on the east. No actual shape of the object could be discerned.  The object moved northward for several seconds, then slowed to a complete stop, where it hovered for perhaps 10-15 seconds.  Then it &#34;turned&#34; or arced to the east for a short distance and stopped again.  (Blue light pointed eastward.)  It hovered for perhaps 10-12 seconds, then appeared to &#34;back up&#34; a short distance, then stopped again.  After a few seconds it moved slowly northward for a short distance, then stopped completely again.  After another few seconds of hovering, it began to oscillate, or &#34;rock&#34; back and forth, but a shallow or short-distance arc, moving no more than three times its maximum width or diameter.  It then moved to the northwest a very short distance, stopped and hovered again.  Then, it began to move northward, visibly accelerting, but still only to a very slow speed.  After a northward distance of perhaps 20 to 30 times its width (that is, between lights), the three lights coalesced into a single, brighter white light for only a second or two, then the light simply &#34;went out&#34; or disappeared while the object was accelerating northward.  I am 60 years old, am an Air Force! veteran , and have loved aircraft and watched the skies all my life. In my opinion, this was not an airplane (hovering and backing up)  or helicopter (too high), nor of course was it space junk, meteors, comets, balloons, birds, swamp gas.  My daughter agrees with my descriptions and her descriptions of the object, its lights, and its movements concur with mine (with no prompting).  My 16-yr-old daughter and her (moronic) boyfriend were in the front yard at the same time.  It, too, is overshadowed by elms.  When the object disappeared (before reaching the eave of our house), I ran into the house and grabbed a rifle with a 9X scope and went to the front yard -- time about 40 seconds.  I scanned the sky and wasw only a rather bright star.  Without prompting,I asked my daughter and boyfriend to scan the sky and tell me if they saw anything unusual.  My daughter immediately pointed to a bright &#34;star&#34; to the east, moving very slowly eastward along the north eaves of the neighbor&#39;s house.  To me, it looked like a single light, but she said it was &#34;three lights,&#34; one red, one blue, and one &#34;pale yellow.&#34;  We all looked through the rifle scope and both kids, with ttenaged eyes, confirmed three lights, equidistance and of equal brightness.  I could still see only one light, but I could detect that the object was moving slowly eastward.  It quickly disappeared into elm branches in the next block.  No other unusual lights could be seen anywhere.  Lighting conditions:  None in back yard to interfere with view; a single street light in the front yard, catacorner and to the northeast -- overshadowed by taller elms.  No clouds whatever.  No haze.  Stars and planets sharply defined.  The occasional airliner easy to see and identify.  Length of sighting:  back yard, about 1.5 minutes; front yard, perhaps 1 minute maximum.  Still am not 100% sure the object seen from front yard moving east was the same object.  Don&#39;t doubt my daughter&#39;s flat, immediate and unprompted statement that the object had three lights, but boyfriend could! have mi micked her (he&#39;s not too bright).  Note:  Amarillo is 18 miles north and is one of the places where the Osprey aircraft is made.  However, I do not believe what we saw was an Osprey on stop-and-go maneuvers.  For one thing, no sound whatever; for another, too high; for yet another, it backed up, and I don&#39;t think the Osprey can do that.  Younger daughter is writing a report of her experience for one of her favorite teachers.  She did not consult me for input.  When I read her story, the details coincided almost exactly with my memories of the incident.  She, however, thinks she saw a round or disc-shaped outlined with the 3 lights in a triangular arrangement on its &#34;bottom.&#34;  I do not see how she could have seen the object itself. Again, no sound, no contrails, no &#34;tail&#34; of any kind.<n>

The object disappeared behind a tree and was lost from view.  This happned on the next two nights with the object appearing in the same area and following the same behavior.  The object, through binoculars could be seen to change color from red, to blue, to white.

6/23/00 15:30|San Francisco|CA|Circle|10 seconds|Saw dark circular object under the water just off SFO airport moving towards San Mateo Bridge at a fast speed.|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13291.html|81|ndxe200006| Saw dark circular object under the water just off SFO airport moving towards San Mateo Bridge at a fast speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in a plane heading for Vancouver, B.C. from San Francisco International Airport and just as we took off I looked out the window on the starboard side and saw in the water that surrounds the airport a dark circular shape on or just under the water. What made me focus on it was that it was moving towards a long bridge structure and it was moving pretty fast.(I have since found out that the only bridge that it could be was the San Mateo Bridge) The dark object had a diameter of about 100 feet and naturally as the plane I was in was climbing it got smaller in size. Unfortunately, I was not able to see what transpired when the object approached the bride as the wing impeded my view. No turbulence was notice in front of the object nor behind it as it moved swiftly. Therefore, I concluded that it had to be underwater but how could an object move that quickly underwater without churning up water and leaving a trail. I also considered at the time it was happening that it was a shadow but it was moving perpendicular to our flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A second, slightly different version of report was submitted by the same witness.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in a plane just seconds after take-off from SFO for Canada when I looked out from my window seat onto the water below and saw a dark circular object moving rapidly at right angles to our flight path. It was headed for the San Mateo Bridge coming from the northwest direction. (I have since looked on the internet what bridge is closest to SFO as I am not familiar with San Francisco at all). The object caught my attention as it was moving rather quickly for something on the water though it did not have any turbulence associated with it. My initial immpression was that it was a shadow somehow created by the airplane however, I have been in enough airplanes and seen the shadow of the plane I have been in to know that this was not the case (usually wings and tailfin are recognizable). During the experience of watching it I concluded it that had to be an underwater object. Looking at what direction it was going in I could see that the eastern end of the bridge was in its way; it had to either change direction, slow down or emerge from the water and hop over the bridge structure as this end of the bridge is solid underneath. Unfortunately, I was not able to witness what happened as the wing of the plane blocked my view. The reason why I am logging this sighting is to find out if anyone on the bridge at that time saw something emerge out of water.<n>

I droped them off over at his place and returned home. We are both within FRS communication range from our homes. I decided I was going to try to catch a nap, but prior to drifting off, he called on the radio and requested I come back over to look closer at one of the pictures I took in Wyoming. Upon arriving and inspecting this picture, I saw an object I previously considered to be a sun dog. As it turns out, this object, at around 600 percent zoom in BMP format was without a doubt, a UFO. I took the scanned photos and a CD he had tranferred them to, and returned home. I loaded the images into my hard drive and opened Adobe Photoshop 5 to edit. After only rendering x2 in PNG format, I could see an extremely detailed craft:  The craft appeared to be making a 90 degree turn at which it left me a view of the top of it. There was a short moisture contrail behind it suggesting the path and turn. There are visible short extrusions on both sides I take to be wings but these have a forward curved appearance and come to a sharp tip which seems as though the extrusions that are coming from the main body of the craft and ended up curved toward the bottom of the craft and then forward. What I feel is the top view of the craft, I note two dooms side by side but with gentle curves and a forward aft oblong doom, just shy of the nose of the craft which I took to be an intake of some sort. The craft is displaying reflection from the snow capped mountains as well as sun reflection. With the contrail of this craft, I would compare it to a flying Manta Ray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  We will request a copy of the photo.  PD))<n>

I spun around so that I was facing east to get a better look at the lights.  I noticed that the four lights were in two sets.  The four lights were flying in a square formation.  The best way to describe the two sets is one set of two lights was east and the other set of two lights were west.  Each set looked like it was rotating/spiraling and changing red and white.  Their direction didn&#39;t change and continued to go north. I tried to point them out to another person but they were unable to see them and they faded from my view.  I waited for about two minutes to see if there was any sound that would help identify the sighting but there was none I could hear of.<n>

Then out from around the same place another oject super high and white in colour moved in a side to side motion then disappeared upwards into the atmosphere. But one of the ojects kept going in a north west direction.  This did not look like anything i have seen before.  It was a very clear night and a few clouds you could tell the object was very high because of how much past the clouds it was. And at the height it was moving at unbelieveable speeds.<n>

At first I thought it was just a satillite but it blinked in and out - almost a three or four second pulse. When it was not &#34;pulsed&#34; or lit up, it was really hard to see. then my wife noticed a second one. Normally I would just shrug this sighting off as &#34;explainable&#34; until they would &#34;flash&#34; or &#34;streak&#34; What I&#39;m saying is, they kept on their path heading NW (went through Big Dipper - eventually) and as they traveled they would throw off this very bright &#34;Streak&#34; about 10 times longer than they were. It was if they were turning on massive bright &#34;headlights&#34;. Pretty neat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This incident occurred approximately 5 minutes after an airline pilot on the east coast reported having an anomalous, apparently non-aerodynamic, object streak past his aircraft, within approximately 50 vertical feet of his right wing.

An accurate time can be derived from the FAA ATC voice or radar tapes.) I was flying an aircraft on an IFR flight plan at 8000 feet msl.  Due to thunderstorms in the interior of MA, I was unable to fly northboud to my destination and I was tracking the RI/CT coastline to the west trying to get around the weather.  The Sun had already set below the horizon, but the western sky was still very bright orange and ground detail was still easily identifiable. At first I saw what I thought was a bird directly in my flight path, it appeared to be writhing in effort to avoid my plane (this is not an uncommon sight).  Very quickly I determined that the bird (object) was not on a collision course, but it would pass very close to my position.  As it drew closer I could see that it was not a bird, but rather an egg shaped object standing on end.  The top and bottom of the &#34;egg&#34; was not rounded but spiked with three points each.  Against the bright sky it was just a black silouette and possessed no lights.  It appeared to be moving in an eastbound direction and passed very close to and above the right wing of my aircraft. The first officer was looking for a fix on a navigational chart and did not observe the object.  However, I immediately contacted ATC and inquired about any radar targets on his equipment in my vicinity.  The initial response was no, but shortly thereafter he reported a primary target (no transponder or verifiable altitude info) behind me in trail about a mile.  ATC then informed me that object appeared to be stationary and then began to drift slowly to the east. I had no futher contact with the object.  Shortly before I was handed off to another controller (on a separate frequency) I heard the object called as stationary traffic to an airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have talked to the witness on several occasions, and we find him to be exceptionally credible.  In addition, we have received from the FAA Boston Center both audio and radar tapes for the time period indicated.  We have not processed the tapes as of the date of this writing, but will do so in the near future.  The Quality Assurance Office at Boston Center, which processed NUFORC&#39;s FOIA request indicates that the audio tape confirms that a pilot reported an anomalous object to the Center handling his flight.  We will post more information, once the tapes are processed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In his original report, the witness reported a time of 2130 hrs. (EDT) on June 22, 2000.  We have corrected the time here to 2130 hrs..  PD))<n>

Their vantage point was overlooking a low bottom to the northwest. The sky was a beautiful azure blue, and the daughter had just commented that it (the sky) looked like a huge lake. Just then, they saw the 3 craft, which did not seem to be moving, but was unsure due to the distance. They appeared to be lit up or reflecting sunlight.

It was mostly black, but it was a shining black. It flew fast towards the north, then stopped and hovured in the air. We got spooked and ran towards my uncels house as I was looking back I saw a cord or something drop in the field. We reached my uncel&#39;s and knockd on his door and we told him what we saw, he didn&#39;t believe us at first,but the objet circled back and hoovered in the woods in front of his house and took off and he said planes can&#39;t just stop and take off a great speeds like that,so I know that was close encounters with an alien species.

This with the naked eye.When I came out, it looked to be a bright star, but through binoculars, it resembled a disco glitterball - sorry, but that&#39;s the best way of describing it. My wife then agreed on that choice of words. The most significant part of the experience for me, was the speed at which it went away; it neither sped off like in the films, nor did it just disappear - it actually receded (so that it appeared at about a tenth of its previous size) within about 5 seconds. I would say it could have been a few miles away, but it&#39;s difficult when you don&#39;t know the size involved. My wife reckons it was a lot further than that, possibly celestial.

At this point a spot light of great magnitude could have been the result but as we continued to watch this object in the sky it began to move faster, it mad 2 or 3 quick moments upward, then a great burst of speed it took off upward into the sky.  It had a light trail and left what seemed to be a vapor trail.  By our understanding, the only possible way somethign is able to leave a light trail is if it is traveling the speed of light or beyond, but not positive about that fact.  Me as well as the other witnesses have pnndered the sighting and an ufo is the only reasonable thing that we ahve agreed on.<n>
6/21/00 16:50|Glendale (Denver)|CO|Changing|20 minutes|I observed a bright object changing shapes (spherical to oblong) and colors (gold, red, white) for twenty minutes in the Denver sky.|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13210.html|97|ndxe200006| I observed a bright object changing shapes (spherical to oblong) and colors (gold, red, white) for twenty minutes in the Denver sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To Whom This May Concern:  I would like to report an unidentified flying object  I personally witnessed on June 21, 2000 between 4:30-4:50 pm in Glendale, Colorado.  The weather conditions at the time of my sighting were superb, with clear skies, only a small amount of visible haze, and high temperatures. I am currently a taxi driver living and working here in Denver.  (Although I am currently a taxi driver, I hold a master&#39;s degree in the humanities from the University of Denver and worked for several years in the counseling field.)  Having driven the city most of the day (Wednesday June 21), I was somewhat tired and pulled into a Glendale city park located one block west of E. Virginia Ave. and S. Cherry St. I reclined back in the grass to cool myself in the shade of a small tree. (Although I was tired, I certainly was not sleepy and stayed fully awake and alert.) I was facing slightly northeast. At this time (about 4:30 pm) I noticed a gold object in the northeast sky almost directly above my position. The object appeared to be at an extremely high altitude (this was confirmed about ten minutes later when a passenger jet passed below it. I could then determine that the object was more than likely in the high atmosphere, or, a space object of some sort). The object was approximately twice the size of the brightest of night stars and it seemed, at first, to be spherical in nature.  However, occasionally it would seem to &#34;turn&#34; and take on more of an oblong dimension. During this time, the object changed from gold to red and then white, making no eccentric movements whatsoever. Colors seemed to change (sequentially, I believe) in this manner for the duration of my observation. Furthermore, its movement to the east/southeast was gradual and directional, and, although not hurried, still quite noticeable (traversing approximately 20 degrees east/southeast through the sky). I observed its movement for approximately 20 minutes until it literally &#34;disappeared&#34; at about 4:45-4:50 pm. Is your organization aware of any man-made objects (communication satellites, Hubble Telescope, the International Space Station, Mir Station, etc.) which would have occupied that area of sky during this time of the day on Wednesday June 21? My inital thoughts were of comsats, etc., although I have never before witnessed such an object (especially in such a bright sky as the sun was high and just after its zenith). If I may be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to e-mail or phone me at 303((number deleted)) appreciate any information you may have on my above question. Sincerely, ((name deleted))<n>

I was standing on the corner of W. Burnside Street and N.W. 5th ave waiting on a city bus.  This craft emited light (but it could have been from the sunlight reflecting off the object).  It was not (in my opinion) a regular airplane because there was no wings.  I seen this craft cruising around 5 m.p.h. seemingly because of its altitude.  I grabbed my camera and managed to take three pictures of it before it vanished.  This craft was flying in a straight south to north direction The second craft was see while again waiting for a city bus at the corner of S.W. 5th ave and S.W. Washington Street.  This object was much closer to the ground and appeared to be cruising at about 5 m.p.h. also, this craft had no wings.  I could see more detail but was not able to tell that much about it because I was not wearing my glasses at the time.  This craft appeared at around 3:52 p.m. and both objects were seen over Downtown Portland.  I was not able to get pictures of this craft because I was viewing it between buildings as it was flying.  Both objects did not emit sound.<n>

It had bright lamps<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving south on Highway 5 and we first thought a plane was in trouble and going to land on the freeway. When it got about one lane away from an 18 wheeler, it went straight up and we could, at that point, tell it was not a normal plane. We heard no engine. The object then &#34;teased&#34; all the cars on the freeway by flying back and forth across the highway. We know others saw it because the trucks were swerving and slowing down. The object would fly real close to a vehicle then suddenly go the other direction. Because of the agility, we were unable to tell which direction was straight for the vehicle, it would turn vertical then fly up, over, or back. Then do the same thing in a horizontal position. There were head lamps on it that were not on all the time that were so bright, we ruled out the possibility of a remote controlled model airplane. It seemed as though the vehicle was flying directly at something then when it reached a certain distance away, it would go another direction, immediately. The other side had 2 colums of flashing colored lights which helped to determine at what angle we were seeing the vehicle. We were somewhere on highway 5 about an hour north of Coalinga, California (that is where we stopped to spend the night-about an hour after we saw the object). The object looked about the size of an RV although there were no street lamps so it was difficult to detect. It looked like two platforms parallel to each other with a few columns connecting the platforms. It was too dark to see in between the columns and the lights were so bright, we were unable to see the full vehicle when they were shining in our direction. I am not a UFO type person and I would just like to know if this was a test project, but why would it be so close to the freeway and other vehicles, puting lives in danger. I was also wondering if anyone else has reported anything.<n>

This object was about the size of a BB held a foot from your face. The craft looked as if it were white hot. It was traveling at a great speed. As it neared the completion of my viewing, it passed a comm. airliner, and then flew straight into a severe storm cloud. These cloud according to the local radar were 45-50 thousand tops. The craft did not fly below or above them. It flew into this system, that the airliner was flying around. I am 43 years old, never seen a ufo until now. I hold dual college degrees, am a NOAA severe weather spotter, a space science buff, am very familiar with all type of aircraft, until I seen this. I was always of the opinion, that all of these ufo sightings could be explained scientifically, again until now. I hae lived in the rural part of Mo. all of my life, and have spent many may hours looking into the nigt sky, but until now I have never put much stock in the ufo sightings. I also have spent many hours watching Satellites going over, and this damn sure was not a Satellite.<n>

6/20/00 22:00|Revere|MA|Disk|15 minutes|I observed a disk shaped, luminous tan colored UFO with tiny colored lights flashing on its surface moving slowly north by northeast.|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13198.html|105|ndxe200006| I observed a disk shaped, luminous tan colored UFO with tiny colored lights flashing on its surface moving slowly north by northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am the only observer of this sighting.  I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Philosophy and am a member of Phi Beta Kappa.  I am employed as a Mental Health Specialist working with abused and traumatized children in a residential program of a pediatric hospital in Brighton, MA. Last Tuesday night, June 20, 20000 at 22:00 hours, I glanced out one of my living room windows, the one facing west, and saw a UFO.  I grabbed a pair of binoculars I had handy in order to observe it more closely.  It was a single craft in a disk or saucer shape.  It appeared to be moving very slowly and at a low altitude in a north by northeast direction.  Because of this movement, I had to switch to a northerly facing window at the front of my living room through which to continue to observe it.  My being on a 3rd floor lifted me above the surrounding houses and gave me an unobstructed view of this object in the sky.  It appeared to glow and was luminous tan in color.  Tiny lights red, green, yellow, white, etc. in color flashed on &amp; off all over the surface of this moving object.  This reminded me of the random flashing of a Christmas tree light array.  The disk of this craft did not appear to be rotating.  It was majestically beautiful in its polychromatic luminousness and surreal slow motion in the night sky.  At one point a jet or propeller airplane appeared through my binoculars in the same field of vision, but its white light was far more distant than the UFO and moved much more rapidly.  (Through an east window of my living room I can see Revere Beach, MA and the Atlantic Ocean.  The Logan International Airport is nearby.)  As the craft moved northeastward, it passed over the floodlights of the Wonderland race track north of my home.  Soon thereafter the UFO disappeared out of my view over the horizon.  From the moment I first saw it until this, approximately 15 minutes elapsed.  This craft was not a propeller plane or jet, not a helicopter, not a balloon, but, literally, a UFO.<n>

It was dark.  Three of us were satnding in a circle when my neighbor shouted, &#34;Look!&#34;  He pointed over my shoulder and when I turned I saw two brilliant flashes of light above the clouds in rapid succession.  Then some smaller orange lights radiated from the center of the flashes and rapidly faded as if an explosion had occured.  About one minute later we heard the explosion very plainly.  My told me they saw an object fly to the spot before the explosion but I did not turn around in time to see it, I only witnessed the explosion.  I called and reported it to Tri Cities Regional Airport safety line. After the explosion we decided to go see if anything had fallen out of the sky but were sidetracked by small orange/white or gold lights flying slowly.  We only saw one at a time but they (it) would disappear and then reappear somewhere else.  I am not totally convinced they were not airplane landing lights, but this area just does not have that kind of air traffic volume.<n>

I was still on the phone and told my sister the whole thing I just saw, and that I didn&#39;t feel well , I tryed to walk up the back stairs and fell three times and I don&#39;t drink or do any drugs, I called for help and my daughter helped me in the house .

They were slightly above the hills in a clear sky. As I watched, the lights alternated fading out and then popping on again in a different position.  The  original formation was about a 20 degree arc. I grabbed my binoculars and ran out on the porch, focused on them and they seemed to be partial circles of light with one straight line  coming out of each. But far away, even with magnification still about the size of a pencil eraser. As they each faded, it was like they got  farther away, very rapidly. Seemed to be some faint &#34;vapor  trails&#34; drifting off of them, but not like any plane I&#39;ve ever seen.  Finally it was just two, then one, then that one &#34;receded&#34;. I&#39;m loading up the video camera tonight so this time I&#39;ll be ready!<n>

It appeared to be over the eastern portion of Clifton when I saw it then getting the attention of my girlfriend at the time and my son, 17 I believe, at the time, all of us stood fixated on this very different looking object.  Different because I&#39;ve never seen anything shaped like this in any of the images put forth on any media. Basically and simplistically, it appeared to look like a drifting, bright, shiney steel garbage can. I&#39;m not trying to be funny. It seemed to be traveling I would say about 30 miles an hour approximately a half mile or so from our point of view. With the sun&#39;s reflection it&#39;s top appeared either had a series of brilliant lites or these were reflections. Vertical indents going around the side is what made it appear as I&#39;ve said, a garbage can and what would have been the lid may have been for observation. With the distance, it&#39;s size, and sun reflection I could not make out much more. I dubbed it the &#34;flying garbage can&#34; because that was exactly what if appeared to be but of course we all know they have no system of propulsion. At the speed this was going it definitely seemed to defy gravity. We watched it head toward the city of Paterson, NJ and at a point where we might have thought it lowered it&#39;s altitude large trees then blocked our view altogether. We were quite dissappointed. So that&#39;s it in a nutshell - I/we will not forget that one; there was a long time when any of us went outside we always looked for our &#34;floating garbage can&#34;.......it certainly was unique.......<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Lasted approximately 5 seconds. The object or objects traveled side by side in a straight line to the South-Southwest and did a slight bow in it&#39;s flight path and then headed more to the Southwest. It or they did not have a tail and there was no sound of a jet or prop plane. The lights were larger then any star out and seem larger and duller then plane lights (commerial fights). They seemed to fast for for a high altitude flight. The Fort Wayne International airport is SouthWest of my location. I&#39;ve seen many planes, but none that acted like this.<n>

I thought it was venus or something and then another light appeared about 2 cm from the first lights position. They both started moving across the sky at medium speed in a straight line at first. Then suddenly, They jerked to the right, and hovered around the direction of the big dipper for about 30 seconds. Then they bolted off into the sky. As they were leaving, they almost looked like they had tails, as a comet would. After that, we got out our scuba flash light, and we started sending out moarse code pulses of light into the direction they went (we are always ready for stuff like this and are always hoping for an encouter). To our surprise, about 10 secs after we did this, we got 2 very faint flashs as if it were coming from the crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.  PD))<n>

I|6/21/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13144.html|118|ndxe200006| I was driving east on I-74 towards Cincinati.  There is a lot air activity south of Harrison because of Greater Cincinnati Airport.   I was noticing some of the planes flying over.  It was dark out at that time.  One flew near the objecting (relative to me) and I noticed it wasn&#39;t moving as fast as the rest of the planes and didn&#39;t have the kind of running lights that the other aircraft did.   It seemed to be higher.   The light flickered like a fire or had an orange cast to it.   There might have been a pattern to the flicker but I didn&#39;t think to remember the sequence if there was one. I pulled of the highway at the second Harrison exit (exit 3) at Dryfork Rd and into the Chevron station.   I checked my watch and it read 23:52 EDT.  (The watch is 1 minute and 45 seconds fast compared to Naval Observatory Time on this computer.)   It was east of my postion heading west.  If the the horizon is 9 o&#39;clock and my zenith is 12 o&#39;clock, it was in the 10:30 or 11:00 position when I first watched after I got out of the car.   It was in the 12 o&#39;clock position at 23:52 EDT.  There might have been some zig-zag movement when it was there but it might have been my eye movement.   I tried to check that against the postions of the stars.  There was planet (?) right overhead.  It went by that point a distance of a thumb held at arms length. I had a compass and check it&#39;s movement relative to Magnetic North (which is close to true north in Cincinnati) it was heading west at 260 degree approximately. When it got to about my 1 o&#39;clock postion it disappeared.   There was a plane come from the south.  I checked the time as it was 23:59 according to my watch which is fast. Winds were listed as light from FOX19.com.  Weather Channel list temp at 64 degrees, dewpoint 61 degrees relative humity at 90% and visiblity at 10 miles.  Sky is partly cloudy.  Sunset was 9:04 tonight. I thought it might have been a hotair balloon but there was not sound and you can sometimes hear them as the fire up the balloons.   The other idea was that it was one of those kid balloons that use a candle to make rise but I haven&#39;t seen one of those since I was a kid.<n>

I&#39;m no kooke who just reports things i saw this and i need to tell somone so i figured this would be the best way to do it thanx much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports yet received from NYC about this alleged incident.

6/17/00 22:52|Spanish Fork|UT|Sphere|2 seconds|While pulling out of my driveway I observe a pearl white sphere descending at an angle moving slower than a meteor.|6/21/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13131.html|127|ndxe200006| While pulling out of my driveway I observe a pearl white sphere descending at an angle moving slower than a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving my house to pick up my daughter from the Miss Utah pageant (she was not a contestant).  After backing out of my driveway and turning the car north (I was not yet moving forward which would count out a reflected light on my windshield) I observed a pearl white lighted sphere descending down at a 45 degree angle about 15 degrees off to my left from geographic north.  Most city roads in Utah are laid out on a precise north, south, east and west grid so my car was pointed straight north and I observed this apparent sphere for about two seconds before the view of it was blocked by the roof of a neighbor&#39;s house.  In describing it over the phone I was given the option of describing it in comparison to a star or the full moon and it seemed to me to show a distinct spherical shape about one fifth the diameter of the moon from my position.  I have seen meteors numerous times and this was moving much slower than a meteor and much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen but it did travel in a straight line.  The light was not bright and the object did not leave a trail.  The object seemed to be moving north while descending into Salt Lake City but without having any reference points to judge its size, I can&#39;t say how far it was away from me. I have flown for recreation and I have been through Air Traffic Control School and part of flying in uncontrolled airspace is looking for other air traffic that may be a hazard to you while you fly.  I can&#39;t say I am a trained observer but I have had some experience and my overriding impression was that the object was over the west side of Salt Lake City.  On the chance that it might have been a meteor, I checked the Comets and Meteors website at http://comets.amsmeteors.org/meteors/june_radiants.html to see if there was any activity for tonight.  No major activity is slated for June but there is some minor activity that might explain it (Aquilids, Sagittariids, Lyrids, Theta Ophiuchids) but again, it was quite slow for a meteor and quite constant in luminosity, speed and size.<n>

Even with the binoculors we could not make out what it was.  It seemed to change shape.  It hovered in one spot for a few minutes and then seem to make a small circle and then hover again.  It then was not there.  We thought that it may have been a flock of geese but it was too large and solid.  We also thought it may have been a parasailor/sailors but we could not identife any people plus it stayed in one spot or went up.  A Plane went by but not in the direction of the object.<n>

The object was approximately the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length, and moved only 2 to 3 inches, using the same measure, when it appeared to blink out after only a short time and did not reappear while I was looking for it in the minute or so I waited before making my turn under the green light. I am a 51 year old welder with more than six prior sightings, some in the tri-county (local) area, and others in Eastern Oregon dating back several years.<n>
6/17/00 02:50|Sheboygan|WI|Unknown|90 sec.|Unusual Three points of light formation travel across sky in a northeast direction at  02:50  6/17/00|6/21/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13132.html|132|ndxe200006| Unusual Three points of light formation travel across sky in a northeast direction at  02:50  6/17/00<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur astronomer.  On the early morning of 6/17/00 I awoke early and decided to go outside on my open sky back porch and observe the sky since it was a beautiful clear sky.  There was a full moon out so the sky was fairly bright but still quite clear.  I was enjoying the sky seeing several meteors and a few satellites.  At aprox 02:50 am I notices some movement almost directly straight up from my position.  The object or objects were extremely high (I can only guess as high as most satellites).  The thing that was extremely odd was that this object or objects had three distinct equally bright points of light that all moved in formation at exactly the same speed and direction.  The direction of travel was toward the northeast.  The distance between each point of light was about the width of a thumbnail at arms length.  The object formed an equilateral triangle with a single point of light in the front of the object (northeast side).  The color of each point of light was bright white (similiar to a bright satelite).  The object or objects traveled in a straight line of direction at a constant speed.  If it had been only one point of light I would have believed this to be a satelite.  I have never seen a satelite with three points of light.  I am sure this was not a common flying object because it had to be at an extremely high altitude.  The object traveled at about the same speed as most satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the witness describes three satellites that orbit in formation, and which have been reported to us on numerous occasions.  We suspect that they are the three &#34;N.O.S.S.&#34; satellites that are reported to have been placed in orbit under a U. S. Navy program.  Mr. Terence Dickinson, journalist for the Toronto (Canada) Star newspaper investigated the phenomenon during the summer of 1996, when the satellites were first reported by astronomers, and many other sky watchers.  If anyone can provide NUFORC with more information about the satellites, we would be grateful.  PD))<n>

I was an F-14 pilot on CVN-65 out off norfolk VA and we were flying standard mig cap which is what we call fleet protection two or more planes fly a set course around the group and check all air and surface contacts that my pose a problem to the group. It was about 00:35 and myself and my wingman were at angels 12 (12,000asl) and had radar set for 100 miles and were at a heading of 226 when my back seater told me to check my 10  as i looked out i said that i saw nothing he replyed back yes there is I asked my wingman if his radar had any contacts he had one bearing at 206 at angels 13 but it stayed in the corner of the screen as we turned towards it it moved just enough to stay in the out most reach of the radar. So we made a tactical turn and lit em up and headed for it and the damn thing went (on the radar screen)180 miles across the screen thats the radar coverage set at that time in about 1.5 sec&#39;s we where shocked to say the least! So we landed back at the carrier and were debriefed for an hour on what happend i never took any stock in to UFO&#39;S until this happened. But i can tell you one thing for sure we would have never been able to get near it and if the US has any craft like it i&#39;m not aware of them !!!!!!!<n>

As they began to cross the bridge, they saw a large, non-moving object hovering in the sky. The object was above the bridge. They stopped and watched it for a minute or so. They said it was perfectly still, at a height where a very low flying plane would be and heard no sound. Both claimed it was difficult to make out an exact shape - but drew me a picture and described it. They saw two large glowing circular lights (white) on the side, and said they were attached to a long cigar shaped body. They had difficulty describing what attached the lights to the body. I asked what made them think it was not a helicopter and they said it was WAY too large and remained perfectly still - plus what happened next. They decided to keep moving and the passenger was looking out the rear window at the object. She lost track of the object briefly and saw it just in time to watch it streak across the sky at incredible speed. She said it stopped instantly over the Mississippi at a point South of their current position. They continued home.<n>

The weather was clear and warm, and the sun had just set.  As we were driving past the &#34;Mud Bay&#34; area north of White Rock, I gazed out the passenger side window and saw a bright light in the sky to the southwest.  At first I thought it was a plane on approach to Vancouver International Airport, or maybe a very bright star.  However, as we got closer and I watched it the object appeared to be immobile, and was closer than I had at first thought.  It was a bright, white light and was hovering over the bay, between where we were driving and the Pt. Roberts area.  I am not good at estimating height but I would say it was no higher than 1,500-2000 feet off the ground.  The light reflected into the bay.  I strained to look for any other lights that would indicate it was an airplane or helicopter, but it simply was a very bright ball of light.  It looked like a very bright star, just very low and very close.  After I had decided it wasn&#39;t an airplane or helicopter I pointed it out to my husband.  He was driving so couldn&#39;t examine it closely, but we both observed it hovering silently for at least 10 minutes until we had passed it.  We could still see it in the rear view mirror until a hill obstructed its view.  We wanted to investigate further but were late getting home to the babysitter.<n>

We saw a light and just figured it to be an airplane.  As we came closer we could tell it was no airplane.  It had 4 lights, blue and green colors.  It was a black color but not a dark black, it was almost grey.  It was very low, maybe 1000 feet off the ground. It was triangular, perfect no curves at all.  Moved very slow and the lights on the craft made it obvious that it was in fact no airplane.  It made no sound what so ever.  The weather was dry, it was barely sprinkling and we had clear sight of it.  The lights from the craft were just so bright it lit up the area around the craft.<n>

We live on a conservation area and our home sits on a hill. With very few city lights to be seen, the sky is pretty dark out here. Off in the northwest sky we watched in amazement as 4 lights &#34;danced&#34; around. It reminded me of four people holding four flashlights and making them swirl and dance upon the ceiling...each ball of light making a random swirling path across the dark sky...sometimes coming together for a &#34;spin&#34; then going off again to their own dances. We watched this incredible sight for about 10 minutes or so. After a short while, the 4 balls of light converged and glowed brighter. Suddenly a shaft a light dropped from the mass to the ground and stayed that way until the light of the converged 4 &#34;melted&#34; away. I couldn&#39;t tell if the shaft stayed in the sky or the image of the bright light stayed in my vision (light a flash from a camera sometime does). I caled all over to the small police headquarters out here and am happy to say that no one treated me like a crackpot! No one else however, called in such an occurance. The Adler Planetarium in Chicago told me it was from the recent solar flare and the northern lights. Is it? It seemed somehow mechanical to us ..kind of like butterflies fluttering around only to meet and sepparate to flutter around some more. Now I can understand if it was the Northern lights..what what the heck was the shaft of light coming down from the glowing mass?? Any ideas out there?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the witness possibly describes an advertising light, the type that has four projectors, all of which rotate around the same axis.  Incredibly, these lights are reported to us quite frequently, despite how common they appear to us to be.  If our theory is correct, the case seems to illustrate just how unreliable and incapable some &#34;authoritative sources&#34; are in accurately assessing reports of anomalous events reported by the public.  A major planetarium identifying advertising lights as the aurora borealis!!!  God Help Us!!!  PD))<n>
6/15/00 23:11|Seattle|WA|Other|~25 seconds|UFO seen crossing I-5 Ship Canal Bridge from East to West (shaped like a rowboat, iridescent orange, with a small blue light at front)|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88690.html|142|ndxe200006| UFO seen crossing I-5 Ship Canal Bridge from East to West (shaped like a rowboat, iridescent orange, with a small blue light at front)<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I had just started driving Northbound on I-5, coming from Highway WA-520, and were in the middle of an argument, when we both stopped arguing: in front of us, over the freeway, was a UFO crossing the Interstate 5 Ship Canal Bridge from East to West, at maybe walking, jogging, or running speed (possibly 3-10MPH).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was mostly a glowing iridescent amber or orange color, emitting its own light, but also had a small, bright, dark-blue light at the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was shaped almost like a rowboat, but was about as big as a house (single-story, rambler size).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see no wings, propellers, wheels, pontoons, doors, windows, rudder, or blimp-like parts to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not look like any floatplane (common in the Lake Union area), regular airplane, glider, helicopter, balloon, or blimp that I had seen before.  If it were a blimp, it had no gondola or &#34;passenger car&#34; visible below it, and no visible tailfins; and at the top of the amber/orange light, it was straight across, not rounded at all. It was moving too slowly to be a plane.  (It would have fallen out of the sky.) And it was much too large to be a helicopter, and wasn&#39;t even close to the shape of any I&#39;ve ever seen. Again, it was about as large as a small house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew very little about UFOs, and wasn&#39;t sure I even believed in them, but because I had heard that UFOs could quickly zip away, I tried to not even blink as we approached its path.  My friend was driving; so I unbuckled my seatbelt, and got up on my car seat so that I could quickly turn around, and keep my eye on it through her side windows; and I did this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was close enough that I could have thrown a baseball, and hit it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we passed it, I was not sure that I could still see it.  And as we kept on going past, I could no longer see anything there at all!  I said to her, &#34;It&#39;s gone!&#34; or something like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I no longer saw any indication that it was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DETAILS:  It was at night, and dark.  At least the one lamp it was passing over was out (not lit). (Two or three of them might have been out.) Other freeway lamps were lit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recall no rain.  So I believe it was dry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it, we had just entered I-5 not many seconds before that; and only part of it had come over the bridge yet. It continued to move in the air, across the width of the bridge from East to West.  As we passed it, we were, I believe, in the far right lane; and the back end of it had just then crossed over the railing of the bridge, on the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had crossed over the bridge just a short distance before mid-span, and was maybe 20-40 feet above the lamp posts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area where the amber or orange light was emitting (not reflecting), I would guess was between 6 and 10 feet high, but not more than 20 or 25 feet; and maybe between 50 and 80 feet long. The entire craft seemed lighted up by this light, except for the small blue light at front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither she nor I seem to recall the exact year or time of year, or the time of day. I am thinking that it was either in 1999 or 2000.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t report it then because I was afraid that we had seen something that we weren&#39;t &#34;supposed&#34; to see, something from the military or government, possibly. She didn&#39;t report it either. To date, she won&#39;t even discuss it with me!  I am reporting it now because, years later, I have found out that UFOs are far more common than I had then realized, and because whatever it was we saw moving slowly over the bridge was now more than 10 years ago, and now maybe the &#34;owner&#34; of it wouldn&#39;t really care since it&#39;s been so long, and because I just wanted to finally report it. I only wish I could recall the date and time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event came as a total surprise to me, and was startling at the time, especially since it seemed to me that while the craft was visible from one angle, it was apparently non-visible from another; or else it became invisible to my eyes; or it moved so quickly (after moving so slowly) that I didn&#39;t even see it jump away. I didn&#39;t take my eyes off of it, or blink (at all, or very little); I just couldn&#39;t see it anymore, even though we were still pretty close to where I had last seen it, a little more than maybe 7 lanes away. It was in our view for maybe 20-30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MISC: I think the height of the bridge is over 180&#39; above the water or streets below. A Wikipedia article says it&#39;s about 119 feet wide. We were going too fast to know whether or not it was making any sound (probably between 55 and 65MPH).

It was in the East, and singular.  It looked like a star; it was whitish-blue, but slightly brighter than a star.  I thought it was a star, until I saw that it was moving.  It moved fairly quickly, in irregular patterns.  The light was constant, not blinking or flashing as would an airplane or something of the like.  It was also moving in patterns that I have never seen anything, natural or manmade, move in. As for my background, I am an advanced student in junior high.  I am known to have a very down-to-earth imagination, and I do not have hallucinations.  I am not known for making things up to try to draw attention to myself.<n>

( Plus we had to go. ) I don&#39;t know what this could have been, I would say these were more in a square shape than rectangle, but each of them were very clearly spaced apart and moving in the same direction an equal distance apart ( the two sets, front 2 and back 2. )slowly, the four lights did not hide the stars in between or behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in Verl near Kaunitz, dates and times I would have to ask my friends again or work out when I last lived there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rubbed my eyes and looked away a few times thinking I was seeing double or had something in my eye which caused the effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to know if anyone else can answer this one.

I observed a round shape approach from the west moving to the east.  The shape was glowing a dull red and was the size of a dime held out at arms length.  It gave the impression of being at very high alltitude.  The shape moved at a rapid rate towards the east until it was approx. 3/4 across the sky then made a sweeping 90 degree turn and headed south.  The shape showed no sign of decreasing speed when it executed the turn, the manuver took no more than 1-2 seconds.  As the shape moved off to the south it faded away.  There was no sound associated with the shape.  The shape also showed no navigation lights or strobes as would be displayed by an aircraft, there were no lights other than the dull glowing red color the was evenly distributed over the entire shape.  I am a private pilot, and former police officer.  I have no explination for what the shape may have been, but it did not appear to show any characteristics of any aircraft that I am familiar with<n>

Then it shot downward slightly to the left to about 60 degrees, instantly.  At that time a second &#34;light&#34; shot into almost the same spot as the original one and stopped as well.  The first one then instantly moved almost a quarter of the entire sky line in an upward direction to about 80 degrees instantly, stopped, then shot back into what appeared to be space on an upward slightly left angle.  The second one was still at the same spot at that time and then slowly in a wave like motion moved for a few seconds then instantly shot to the same spot as the one before and it too shot at the same path as the first one.  I really never told anyone the story until recently but it really never crossed my mind it was or could be a ufo.

Last year in Darwin many people also saw them. Strangely enough it was at a time when the US military was staging a joint war games exercise - Pitch Black which occurs every year across the Top End of the Northern Territory. One incident was a firework display ona city beach the objects were observed by hundreds of people and hardly even commented on. They travelled slowly across the night sky, formed a triangle and then some manouvres then disappeared. They were also seen by my sister and many other people that we spoke to. Each time the behaviour was similar. The glowing golden objects travelled ina perfectly spaced file across the sky out over the sea. They would then manouver into traiangles and other shapes and then either disapear or rocket off at a great speed. On the local radio a man confessed to having released hundreds of orange garbage bag fire powered devices off at various localities. What a psycho - he must have spent a fortune and to what avail? I myself saw on separate occasions, examples of both types of objects. The pyro devices were erratic in behaviour and it was quite obvious to any viewer as to what they were as they flickered and drifted rising and falling. I saw the latter objects on the night of the lunar eclipse. The other orbs travelled in lines straight and at a constant speed not in any erratic fashion at all. We all think that the orbs were some kind of military test. The amazing thing was how blase people were about them. &#34;Oh UFOS maybe?&#34; Just thought you might be interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate; we have arbitrarily assigned a date.

In the shape of a triangle.  It moved fast and smooth in flight.  It was less than a mile up in the air.  I was mesmerized, but I tell you that this object was an UFO to me.  It moved slow enough that I feel that government/airport tracking officials could ID it.  But it was low enough in the air that I wouldn&#39;t think that radar could confirm it&#39;s existence.  I went out to a creek crossing about 7 or so miles north of Goodwell, Oklahoma two times within a month timeframe and in a distance I feel that I saw the same formation gliding along the same path.

I didn&#39;t hear anything. I was alone at the flat of the truck and I didn&#39;t call my friends because I didn&#39;t wanted to loose it. It had a slight vapor trail, but it was almost nothing.

I took a total of 11 photo&#39;s, in a 360 degree circle from the ground to the sky using a tripod, at about 5:30 in the evening EST.  I then went back in the house, copied the jpg. photo&#39;s from the disk in the camera onto my hard drive, and constructed the panorama. As I was scrolling around in a circle, I could see a small black dot in the sky to the West. The program allows you to zoom in, so when I did this, the dot appears to be a black sphere. I zoomed out and scrolled to the left (north), and there were 2 more black sphere&#39;s. In the photo, they almost appear to be in a large triangle formation. I would estimate the size of them in the photo to be about the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length. ...Also, around the time I was getting the camera ready to go, I heard a jet streak overhead, but couldn&#39;t see it due to the low cloud level.

I looked up and I saw like a little silver shiny sphere. It did not seem to have light by its own. We think it was just reflecting the sun&#39;s light because it was a really sunny and windy day with blue sky and few clouds (not so common in Mexico City). At the beginning we thought it was a metallic ballon (those for children) but it was a windy day and we were very surprised because this little sphere was static just like a light bulb in a room. We estimated it was very high because we saw an airplane passing by and the sphere seemed to be even higher. The same happened with the clouds. In fact after approximately 10 minutes we could not see it any more because some clouds passed by just under it. My husband concluded that maybe it was a geostationary satellite. That is why we could not appreciate its movement. But days after I searched in the  internet and it did not look like one. Besides these kind of satellites are very far from the Earth. I also looked for weather ballons but apparently these kind of balloons have some movement and they are not so big. If this was a a weather balloon it should have been a very big one because it was very far and we were able to see it. Finally we concluded that maybe it was a NASA new device for experimentation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, and witness elects to remain anonymous.

About 5a.m., we observed three white vapor clouds rising from the earth, as if evaporating. From a distance; they would have been inconspicuous, but clouds do not take independent trajectories regardless of wind direction, not to mention the clearly visible rotating bands of white lights in each cloud. A very  low-flying plane passed directly overhead, with a very odd  paint scheme, and a very odd metal framework of objects affixed to the underneath, so much that there clearly was no way landing gear could function, had there been any. Directly afterwards, three vehicles drove by us, one a white van w/ two men that followed us to our job, came in one hour before we opened, then a man phoned to offer us a &#34;cab ride out of there&#34; We were followed everywhere by white vans for weeks, then two vans came to my house to &#34;work on&#34; the utility pole in my yard.

Looking out of the upper left of the windshield I noticed a very bright, white light streaking west to east.  It was almost horizontal through the sky and moved very fast. At first I thought it was an airplane from the light and the path.  But it traveled very fast and almost at the end of its visibility the light dimmed quickly then brightened again and traveled a little farther then disappeared.  I would have been convinced it was a meteorite except that it had a very flat path (almost horizontal). It was visibile only a few seconds and could have been some natural object, but the one I have ever seen like that.<n>

At the campsite me and couple of others were sitting down looking at the horizon star gazing. While we were stargazing a light appeared out of nowhere that resembled a bright star, much like Jupiter or another close planet. The light moved down right above the mountains, and hovered there for what seemed to be half an hour. Then the light moved to the east about 300 - 400 yards (hard to tell due to distance). The movement of the craft was instantaneous and very smooth. From my experience of observing aircraft no known modern craft is capable of this kind of movement. Then a second light appeared, exactly like the first light. It moved to where the first light was, then joined the first light. It stayed there for about half an hour and then went up and dissapeared. The first light remained in its original position for another 10 minutes, then also went up and dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is my firm belief that these were UFOs.

It was almond -shaped, a little bigger than the half gibbous moon that night. It was a little cloudy but the clouds were thin. We didn&#39;t see the object but it seemed like a big circle (oval from our point-of-view) maybe 30x bigger than the moon. It rotates and cross at the center and then rotates again. They are very synchronized but the center where they cross is in random, as if they are moving in accordance with a big massive object floating above the thin clouds. I&#39;m 23 and working as a web surfer while my bf&#39;s 24 and studying computer science. We don&#39;t have any bad records, in fact we are active members of our parish choir. I was wearing my lenses that night and my bf has 20/20 vision. That same night before we went jogging, Our cellphones were not working properly. We experienced delayed messages and we cannot contact each other even if it both indicate a 4-bar signal. While we were observing the lights, we tried contacting other friends but we got busy signals as well. What could that be?<n>

Moved across horizon and farther away. 7 lights decreased to 3. A large, bright, steady light appeared very low on horizon. It was joined by 3 more lights of the same size and brightness. Appeared to attempt to form a line. All smaller lights, save for one, went out. Then, the bright lights went off, randomly. We lost track of the last small, blinking light. Should be noted that Whiteman Air Force Base is nearby. The large bright lights seemed to hover over the base.<n>

The lights blinked one at a time in a racing pace. There was no pattern to the blinking. There was no sound from this object. After watching it for about 5 minutes I noticed an airplane coming past it from the south-there was no similarity. I watched it for about 15 minutes(until I could no longer see it). Actually, I couldn&#39;t really tell if it was a v. The lights were spaced in an irregular formation. I would say that the space between these lights were probably 1/3 of the size of the moon, and there were many lights. Since the pattern of the blinking was so irregular, it was hard for me to figure out the shape-I do know that it was not in the shape of an airplane, helicopter, or blimp. When I first noticed it I was approximately a half mile from it.<n>

When bright it was brighter then Venus or any star.  The light did not waiver but was a constant flow.  It drifted mostly, stopped at times and once disappeared and reappeared in a different location.  It was based on the western Horizon.  At first I thought it was a satellite, but it disappeared and reappeared to often and it&#39;s pattern wa too eratic.  I have seen this same exact object about two weeks ago on a Saturday at about 3pm but it was directly above me that time.  This bright light was nothing like a plane and was oddly close to a bright sliver of light that remided me of the contrail left by rockets.  This contrail was comparatively small but bright and permanent (meaning it was not produced by a plane).<n>

The fireball&#39;s size and shape appeared as that of a tennis ball held at arms length (approximately). It did have a tail, which was approximately the same length as the diameter of the fireball. The duration of the event was about 2-3 senconds, but the fireball was brilliantly lit and appeared to be very close, maybe within 10 miles or so. The object disappeared behind the treeline as it fell toward the horizon. The trees that I&#39;m speaking of are about 120 feet behind my house and about 40 feet tall. The fireball had an electric blue core and a yellow outer &#34;shell.&#34; I may have these colors backwards, it happened so fast. The shell was about 1/2 the thickness of the fireball. If I had to associate this with anything that I&#39;ve ever seen before, I would say that it looked like a very large flare. But in my opinion, it was moving far too fast for a flare. I&#39;m a 39 year old Technical Writer for a large telecommunications company in the Dallas area. I have had military experience (in the Army Signal Corps many years ago) and have never witnessed anything like this before.<n>

I looked up and saw a US air force fighter jet flying west, just below the clouds. Since I normally like to see the contrails from the jet, I was watching closely.  I saw a object above the contrails.  At first I thought it was a helicopter because it setting very still. After staring at the object, I realized it was round and metallic, emitting no sound. It was tilted in about a twenty degree angle, with it&#39;s belly facing toward the south.  It had a grey-silver belly and the top half was a darky to black.  I kind of dark color I have never seen before that appeared to be vibrating.  The sun gleamed off the bottom since it was late in the afternoon. Two teenage boys, nearby playing basketball, were also looking up at the object as I was riding by them.  I said to them, &#34;Looks like a UFO doesn&#39;t it?&#34; and they responded, &#34;Yes, it sure does&#34;.  I look at the sidewalk for a second and when I looked at it again, it had disappeared. I stopped and looked around for awhile but it did not reappear.  The fighter jet left the area and did not return. Now I believe I have seen a UFO.<n>

One small dull black object went from north (nearest to me) to west(farthest point from me) in 35 seconds. It was at an elevation of 30 degrees to the ground and remained at that as it traversed a 70 degree span of sky. It crossed below large white cumulous clouds. The clouds were moving NW. The object appeared as a peculiar balloon (roundish and blobbly) for the 1st 4 seconds and then as a flattened triangle. It&#39;s trajectory was absolutely straight with no variation in speed. From my point of view, it was moving very fast and methodically. It disappeared into the distance (became so faint you could no longer view it). I drove 5 blocks away and watched the sky in it&#39;s direction-4 crows harrassing an eagle-nothing about the birds resembled the black object-not shape or flight characteristics. The object was between an eigth to a qaurter of an inch at arms length when I first spotted it. There were no wings or protusions of any kind, a smooth oblongish triangle with rounded edges. More like a triangular oval flying in the direction of it&#39;s flat side.

BUT it&#39;s not because there is no sign of verticle light you know when you torch something there a line of light too right? so this one is like it&#39;s been torch from above and that&#39;s impossible. then the next week our national tv show news  show some of the vidoe taken from other people same night same city as me. the ministry of science and technology (Law Hein Dieng) said they still investigate it and it&#39;s maybe a new phenemon bla bla bla so that&#39;s my story to contact for more contact the NTV7 people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  It sounds to us as though the sighting may have been the result of advertising lights.

Mention was made of it and I went out and still found it in the sky but located approximately 3 feet (held at arms length) north of original position which was just next to the moon in the eastern sky. My view was looking north with Mt. Lemmon in the background (a 9,000 ft mt.)and up at about a 45 degree angle in the sky. Object was moving further away in height and distance from my vantage point. Binoculars revealed an odd shaped object much like a balloon but not round at all. Rough estimates of the shape are difficult but it was not aerodynamic in nature. My thoughts were like a balloon that they attach to car lots of a gorilla etc. Maybe this floated away. The only problem with this theory is that it was not a recognizable shape except for a rectangular portion at one end and 2 pieces sticking out from it to another irregular mass. Object made no noise, shape changed as you watched and was estimated at between 2000-3000 feet high and rising somewhat. Object moved slowly and had strange grey shadowing on white, no other color (such as advertising balloons would have). Upon looking at object for some 10 min. I went inside and returned to have another look about 2 min. later. Object had disappeared. This is what caused me to report the incident. Being in the aviation field and familiar with aircraft types I would have to say it possibly was a balloon except that through the use of logic and common understanding of gravity I cannot see how an object of approx. 30-60 feet in size(estimated) could have &#34;deflated&#34; and fallen out of the sky in such a short time period .I believe the object could have been a balloon but it gave chills to view from binoculars as it was a very odd shape and in the sunlight you could see a grey mist around the object as you viewed it,perhaps an occular trick due to binocular magnific! ation an d the eye straining to understand what was being viewed. I still do not know what it was but it was the topic of conversation at our dinner that night.<n>

I observed two glowing, white/spherical objects hovering a mile or so away.  They were at the same altitude, and then began to move toward one another; and appeared to intersect one another; before drifting apart and hovering a smaller distance apart.  There was no sound.  I departed on the bus moments later, so don&#39;t know what became of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought they were perhaps Helicopters, but; I concluded it was too dangerous for them to move toward one another the way they did, perhaps they circled one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Looked out my kitchen window facing east, and freaked abit. I saw a( I know not a normal UFO---but still was &#34;flying&#34;) dark gray hummingbird tha was about 12 in. long and had a wingspan of about a foot also. Black beady eyes( cameras), and a sharp-cone-shaped &#39;beak&#39;. It&#39;s wings moved just like the Ruby-thoated ones we all see in our flowers, just a blur. It had come around my house and right up to my window--watching (recording??) and sat there(hovering)about 30 sec.. It then did as the rest of the hummingbirds do--autogryated(that is backed up and &#39;rolled&#39; over and made a sweeping turn out of my yard). I have had other events that are NORMAL ufos&#39;back 76&amp;78, tho they scared me and caused me to almost loose it. I also live in a place that when I was kid that I was scared to death of---due to the little men tha walked up to me and asked me to describe the &#34;funny&#39; mirrored ball to them. It was their power ball! Oh! the sighting in 78 was of a bright light that made moves as if it was trying to find a door out of a glass shoebox in the sky, then the 8 people tha were with me went to the Starr Fire dept. to ask them if they saw this. When they wree gone a &#34;STUBBY-winged PLANE&#34; made a silent arc down from the light and stopped in front of me, THEN I saw a &#39;pilot&#39; &amp; copilot get out and walked up to me, then BLANK till my friends got back. My friends were upset with me as I didn&#39;t know they were back for about a hour, the said I was like a zombie!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/11/00 03:05|Lunenburg|MA|Sphere|10 seconds|Spherical light of florescent like quality, started with apparent size of penny at arms length, and climbed rapidly at steep angle.|6/21/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13093.html|189|ndxe200006| Spherical light of florescent like quality, started with apparent size of penny at arms length, and climbed rapidly at steep angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out early morning Sunday, delivering newspapers, June 11th, 2000, 0305 hrs. EST. I had an urge to stop, and looked out my side window. The sky was clear, starry, the moon had likely already set by this time, on the opposite horizon. I saw a spherical object at my 10 o&#39;clock, about 30 degrees above the horizon, in the northwest. It was bright and luminous, but not bright enough to cause me to squint. The quality of the light reminded me of florescent, dull white with a slight bluish tinge. The light did not pulsate, or show any other variation. The most interesting thing was the size of the light. It had the apparent size of a penny at arms length, much to big to be aircraft or landing lights. The brightness was even across the diameter, and the edge was sharp, with no halo effect, against the background of the clear night sky. It gave the impression of a self luminous, spherical object, not a bright light projected from a small souce. The object hovered; completely stationary for a full five seconds, at least. There were enough clear stars to judge its relative movement, or lack there of. I live fairly close to a municipal airport, and am very familiar with aircraft lights and the effect of a head on landing light. This was not an ordinary aircraft, and the size of the light made i unusual nature very clear. The object suddenly blinked out, as if a light had been extinguished, and a split second later re-appeared north of its original position, slightly higher in the sky.  I would estimate its apparent  movement relative to the starfield was a fists distance at arms length. The interesting thing was that when it reappeared, in addition to the visual distance in movement, the object appeared to be only one-third to one-quarter the diameter it appeared originally. The light still had a wider visual diameter than an ordinary aircraft light, and maintained its almost florescent quality. Roughly a second after  it reappeared, it started moving in a northerly direction, covering  about four fists width in about three seconds. As it moved relative to the starfield northward, it also very quickly diminished in size and brightness, until it totally disappeared from view. Just before vanishing, the light was much smaller than the way a typical star appears in your vision, and the quality of the light was more a dim reddish orange. Just as unusual as the large diameter of the light was at the beginning of the sighting, the tiny pin prick of light before it disappeared  was much smaller than the lights from even high altitude airliners. As it diminished in size, it very quickly reached such a small size that it would not have been noticed at all by anyone not following the trajectory of the object. It gave the clear impression of an object shooting skyward at incredible speed, but not straight up. More like an 80 to 85 degree climb. There was no discernible form to the object, but its perfect circular appearance from my viewing angle seems to support a spherical rather than disk shape. There is no way to be certain of its actual size, but I had the very strong impression that its distance from me at the beginning of the sighting a quarter mile to half mile, or less, and its altitude somewhere between 800 and 1500 feet.  If so, based on the rate of decrease in the visual size of the light as it climbed, I would guess that it climbed a NUMBER of miles in altitude in seconds. It was the perceived speed and rate of climb that cemented the impression that this object was extremely extraordinary in nature.<n>

As they traveled West along Tx Hwy 44, they saw an oval,  bright yellow light in the  distance.  They watched it for several seconds as they continued to travel at a speed of 55 mph.  As they topped a small rise, the women saw what at first they thought was an accident scene, with ambulance and police car lights flashing red in the night.  As they approached the scene, Mrs. X became frightened and crouched down in the front floorboard area of the passenger side of the car.  Mrs. Y stopped her car opposite the scene in the brush.  The circular object, which appeared to be hovering just above tree-top level (about 15 feet).  The object was round, aluminum in color and was circumvented with flashing red and green lights.  There was a spike on the top of the object with another red and green flashing light.  Mrs. Y said the object, which she estimated to be at least 50 feet in diameter, made absolutely no sound at all.  She flashed her car lights in an attempt to see better and at that time the object began an upward movement, slowly at first, giving Mrs. Y the opportunity to see a large, black &#34;spot&#34; in the center of the bottom of the object.  The object then shot out of sight at a high rate of speed.  Mrs. Y continued her trip into Freer, dropping off her friend (who refuses to speak about the incident at all) and arriving home about 03:15 CDT.  It was at this time that Mrs. Y became frightened, realizing that she had seen something totally unknown to her.  Her daughter, a woman in her mid-twenties, became concerned at seeing her mother&#39;s pale, wide-eyed appearance and asked her was wrong, thinking the older lady had been in a wreck.  When Mrs. Y related the sighting to her daughter, who insisted they call her brother in Arizona. The brother, Mr. Y, is a retired AF Lt. Col. interested in the ufo question and a lay astronomer.  He was awake, star-gazing, when the call came. When the &#39;phone rang, Mr. Y was afraid there was trouble at home.  He was relieved to learn there wasn&#39;t, and excited to learn of his mother&#39;s UFO sighting.  Later that morning he contacted NUFORC, who contacted me.  I am Doris Upchurch, Asst. State Director (for S.Tex) for MUFON.  I called Mr. Y, verifying his excitement and obtaining his mother&#39;s &#39;phone number.  I then contacted the Y household, talking to the daughter, who related to me the appearance of her mother upon her arrival.  It was agreed that I should contact them again when I reached Freer, approximately 3 hours later.  I called Susanna Washburn, a MUFON field investigator, and we left within the hour.  We could not contact the Ys by &#39;phone when we reached Freer, so returned home to Corpus Christi.  I talked again to Mr. Y, who told me that his friend, R, had visited the sight and believed there to be some physical evidence of a landing, although this did not agree with the report from his mother.  R had also e-mailed Mr. Y a drawing made by Mrs. Y of the object she had  witnessed.  I talked again to Mrs. Y, who told me the same story as had originally been related to me by her children, stating that she believed God had allowed her to see something special.  Mrs. Y is a quiet woman, who neither reads nor writes English, learning to speak (quite well) the language when her children entered public school. To satisfy the investigative attempts, the Live Oak County State Section Director, Connie Churchill, was asked to do a follow-up investigation.  She was in contact with Mr. Y by &#39;phone and was told that Mrs. Y was expecting her call about 15:00 CDT on Thursday, June 15, 2000.  She was equipped with map co-ordinates and descriptions of the area which had been received from Mr. Y.  Again, there was no response from the Y household when our investigator got to Freer.  She proceeded to the intersection of Tx Hwy 44 and FM 3196, near where the sighting took place.  She found nothing to indicate a landing had occurred. During the following week, I received another excited e-mail from Mr. Y, stating that his friend R had found an alien face etched into a rock outcropping in the dry creek bed at the site.  I asked our newest field investigator trainee to accompany me back to Freer, arranging this time to meet with R upon our arrival.  When we reached the intersection of 44 and 3196, I called R, who came right out, leading us west for 4/10 of a mile.  We examimed the area carefully, noting the natural flood water drainage area, the dark, clay rock bed and the high voltage power lines (main supply lines between Freer and Laredo, Tx).  Neither myself nor my trainee John Richardson found anything that looked remotely like an alien face etched into the clay.  As we prepared to leave the aarea, Mrs. Y and her daughter drove by, stopped and talked to us.  Mrs. Y again related the same story she had told me on the &#39;phone, pointing out where the object had been hovering and re-affirming the fact that it had not been on the ground. She said that the dark area on the bottom of the craft looked like a hole.  (Mr. Y had told her he thought it was a doorway, but she didn&#39;t know if it was or not.  Just that it looked like a hole.)<n>

I was trying to see if I could pinpoint any ships on the horizon, this being my first trip to the pacific ocean.  I noticed a bright white light that seemed to float a little bit off the ocean almost to the horizon.  it became brighter then it moved like nothing I&#39;ve seen before from the left to the right.  I was startled by the speed because I am familiar with hydroplanes from the seattle area and I&#39;ve seen them race at close proxmity.  I could understand the speed I saw if it was right next to the pier, but this was almost completely to the horizon.  I yelled to my wife, &#34;I just saw a UFO&#34; i said.  then I pointed it out to her just before it went over the horizon, she saw it too.  I noticed it was pright enough to shimmer off the waves giving a better representation of its distance. Personally I am familiar with tracking objects at a distance, having made a hobby of watching planes as a child and my aformentioned Hydroplane race watching. Also I know the physical limits one can achieve on a sea craft due to informal training from my father, who was in the navy sub fleet. I am sorry for the delay in publising this, I have recently moved and it has been a while since I even thought of it.<n>

As the first oject would move off to the north another object would appear in its place coming up from the horizion in the south.  The objects that would head to the north would get more distant and higher in the sky almost as if they were gradually moving away.  As for the acrobatical movea they would preform, when one object woul move they would all do the same action.  These objects as they made a line from the south to north they seemed to all be gradually moving away.  This went on for what in my recolection was about an hour and five minutes, and the most unbelievable part was when it ended the last oblect on the end of the line moved at an alarming rate and almost seemed that the last flew through the others and picked them up.

I have had dreams “vividly” off and on since it happened.  Just recently,  I began experiencing these dreams again.  After searching on the Internet for the meaning of these dreams I found this site.  I am a very “down to earth” type person that usually believes in only Science and Facts.  I have heard many stories from family and others about UFO’s.  And never believed until ten years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the summer of 2000.  I was traveling down Highway 11, a country road between Weippe Idaho and Orofino Idaho.  I was on my way to Orofino Idaho after visiting a friend in Weippe.  This stretch of road is in the middle of nowhere.  It is on top of a mountain surrounded by wheat fields.  The most you might see normally is a deer in your path.  About 2130 as I entered an area of the road known as “Fraser” (Fraser is a small section of land named after a few old time farmers from the past) I was shocked to see several lights hovering over a mountain top roughly (as the crow fly’s) 25 miles away.  This particular part of the mountain has no what so ever houses or lights and barely any roads.  As I slowed to a near stop I noticed two other vehicles pulled over looking at the lights.  One was a beat-up pickup and one was a station wagon type car.  I pulled in behind them and turned off my lights.  I immediately got out my binoculars and started surveying the lights.  What I ! saw was literally “out of this WORLD”.  There was 6 lights surrounding one singular light in the middle.  The light in the middle was very strange as it was not as bright and pulsated from green to blue to red and back again.  The shape was in a perfect triangle shape just like a upright Pyramid.  The most Awesome thing about this was the size.  It had to be as big as a CITY!  Measuring the only way I knew how, I stretched out my thumb and forefinger and put it up to the sky, It was as I said a good 25 miles away and was at least 3 ½ inches between my thumb and finger in width.  That would make it at least a mile or more wide at this distance.  I and the others watched it for at least ten minutes.  The lights where so close to the top of the mountain it was over that it actually lit up the peak.  After about ten minutes the Station wagon car took off down the road back towards Weippe at a high rate off speed almost hitting me.  Just then the “object” turned slowly just so y! ou could see it’s bottom 3 lights.  Those three lights slowly ! powered up “got very bright” and the whole thing disappeared in a explosion of light.  Just like you would see on Star Trek when they went into “Warp” drive.  I then, dumb founded went over to the pickup truck to see what they had seen only to realize that there was no one in the truck at all.  I think that they all left in the other car, or the pickup was empty to began with.  I think back and could slap my self for not getting the trucks licence plate number if only to verify that I was not going nuts!  I then drove home very shaken up and tried to go to sleep with no luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dream that I keep having involves this craft coming over the horizon and a feeling of “impending doom” like the world is going to end.  I know this sounds unbelievable but it is true.  I am of sound mind and have never told this to anyone other than my wife.<n>

It covered an arc of about 10-12 degrees and then rapidly disipated. I checked Heavens-Gate to see if an Iridium flare was due in that region of the sky, but it nearest event was expected about 30 degrees to the west and on another course. I was kind of surprised, as not a lot of stars were visible as it was a typical hazy evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The description seems consistent with the sighting of a satellite in polar orbit, but that is only a guess.

Saturday evening, on my way home from work, i  witnessed a strange occurance, which I have described breifly  below. I was driving down C highway  (Hillsboro), heading towards Y highway(Hillsboro, DeSoto) @ about 7:30p.m. To  the left of me was a series of  large fields And behind them were large  tree--covered hills   In the sky high above the hills was a  single object, a bright red perfect circle, moving slowly down in a straight  line, a; leaving a trail of smoke behind it   As it feel it never seemed to gain  speed, the circle grew bigger and brighter, the trail of smoke also grew. It  finally descended behind the trees leaving the trail of smoke.    I never heard any sounds and although  I looked for it, I never saw it again, or determined what it was.   The entire ordeal took about 10-15  minutes the object was visible for a long stretch of the  road. My question is, do you have any idea  what this could have been? It was definately there. I ruled out fireworks,  because there was no noise and it moved very slowly. I have never seen an  airplane go straight down, either crashing or landing; besides, if it had been a  plane crash or something like that it would have been on the news. The area is  outside of city limits, and mostly farm land. The closest airport (which is very small) is two towns away (Festus/Crystal City)<n>

I saw a large oval-shaped craft that was black in color and blocked out half of the sun. It stayed in the same location for about 3 minutes and then I saw another smaller craft of same shape and color come out of the original craft. The smaller craft then went approx. 300 miles per hour behind my point of view. The larger craft then speed off towards the sky at an amazing speed. During the siting the first aircraft stayed at about 2,000-3,000ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Wittness 2 I didn&#39;t rely see much cause I was a bit ((drunk)), but I can safely say that Wittness one and 3 were compleatly sober cause they don&#39;t drink cause wittness one used to be a acholholic and has stopped drinking and wittness two just dosn&#39;t drink!!! What I did see was some little red lights in the sky flying around and doing stuff that a plane can not do, but then I was bladerd! Wittness 3 I was trying to stop wittness 2 from falling over cause he was propper drunk when wittness 1 said that he could see something in the sky. I looked up and saw this littel red triangle zooming around like and space ship in one of thouse kid&#39;s games. it just flew around the sky like it was scanning the gorund and stuff the two other ones came and they all went upwards and dissopierd into the clouds. It was probbably just some thing that can be explaind naturaly, I don&#39;t think it was aliens caus I dont belive in that stuff. Wittness 4 OK all I saw was some blobs in the sky and everone got all freeked and said they were aliens and they were gonna abduct us and stuff. I don&#39;t rely know what it was but I&#39;m not that relighable cause I was drunk. Well that&#39;s it!!! We&#39;ve put that they had light but they didn&#39;t rely they just gave off theis red light all over, it was like one big light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the report would be of considerably greater interest if the witnesses to the alleged event had not been so chemically impaired.

With binoculars I noticed that it was stationary, and I observed 3 lights facing my direction. There was more of a greenish tint, but the lights strobed w/red, and yellow also. After about 20 minutes it moved further northwest out of my view, but reappeared in about 5 minutes, heading east. That is when I observed 2 more objects, at a greater distance, but w/same features.  Some of the time, they were covered by clouds, but they slowly moved due east towards the ocean (approx 15miles from where I live).  The sky was beginning to brighten, and they were too far away.  I called the sheriff&#39;s office, but no one else had reported these objects.<n>

It was the middle of the night after the first day of the trip when I saw it. I have heard stories from a few people about golden or multi-colored shining spheres that hover silently and move at incredible speeds, I even met a guy who said one followed his car for 45 minutes once, so I wasn&#39;t in shock when I saw one myself. I looked up and I saw something moving very fast across the night sky, at least 20 times faster than a plane. My eyes had to struggle to follow it as it darted by. It was WAY too big to be a shooting star, and it had no tail either, plus didn&#39;t move like a shooting star. From what I could see in the 20 seconds it was there it had a white color, like a light sort of, so it was different than the spheres I heard about previously. It came from beyond the horizon and just as fast as it came it darted back into the sky. I wasn&#39;t that shocked about it really, I didn&#39;t even wake my dad and Bob. I thought to myself: &#34;That had to be a UFO&#34;, and then I shrugged it off and went back to swatting misquitos and trying to sleep. I think it&#39;s obvious these things exist, it&#39;s just that most of the proof of &#34;sightings&#34; either looks like or is B.S. or a hoax so it&#39;s difficult for us to find solid evidenct that these things exist. Even if I, by some lucky chance, happened to have a video camera nearby and I was fast enough to hit record in time to see that thing, it wouldn&#39;t be considered proof! . Anyone could just say I created a special affect with Adobe Photoshop(which I could do, I&#39;m a film maker) of a light moving at unearthly speeds across the night sky. The problem is most people are too ignorant for the truth, and they will always be until a UFO lands in their backyard and the greys come out for a cup of tea and crumpets. For whatever reason the mysterious pilots of those things wish to remain anonymous, and for GOOD REASON. Earth people in general are very very stupid, if the truth came out today and president Bush was on T.V. shaking hands with an alien, people would panic and raise so much hell that I don&#39;t want to think what would happen to us or the aliens. Some advice: get over it guys, life is short. We can&#39;t convince the world UFOs exist until the aliens decide to convince the world UFOs exist. &#34;A person is smart, people are dumb, panicy, stupid sons of bitches and you know it&#34;.-Tommy Lee Jones, Men In Black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

6/10/00 02:30|Polk City|IA|Circle|5 minutes|Strange circular object seen moving against the wind, making irregular movement and sudden speed bursts.|8/24/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38635.html|207|ndxe200006| Strange circular object seen moving against the wind, making irregular movement and sudden speed bursts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was but 4 years ago, sometime in early June of 2000. Me and the family were packing our camping trailer, because we were headed to South Dakota on a camping trip. Our camper was parked in the backyard of our house. We have a small cludder of trees right behind the house, but nowhere near to blocking my view of a strange object moving against the SE wind in the sky, almost directly above me, as I was standing next to the camper, loading some silverware and misc. items into the camper. As I had finished, I looked up into the sky, searching for any storm clouds, as it was windy that day, yet pretty hot and a bit humid. The weather forcast recently had described several showers in our area, therefore I was searching to see if we were going to get poured on while packing. It was 2:30 or so in the afternoon, and as I was searching the sky, I saw a small circular object, the color of white, moving against the wind. The wind speed was about 10 - 15 mph, heading SE, with sudden strong gusts, which leaded me to guess a cold front was moving in, with the present warm front already in the area. The object was far out into the sky, near the clouds that I had seen. Some of these clouds were rather thin, but a few large cumulonimbus clouds could be seen headed our way, near Big Creek lake. This object was definately not an airplane or satellite, because it moved in strange patterns. It also left a very very faint trail as it made sudden bursts of speed. First, it moved at a steady pace going North, then it would suddenly jerk towards the West. As I watched for 2 minutes, the object seemed to be making strange, sudden movements in the sky, the slowing down  to almost a stop. It almost looked as if it was zig-zagging in the sky, but at incredible speed. Its speed would change dramatically every few seconds. Within 3 minutes of watching this object, a few clouds came by it, and it seemed to do more of its jerky movements, then it slowed down again, only this time whipping around one of the clouds. As the cloud that the strange object had hidden behind passed, the object had dissapeared, and then reappeared just left of its original location. I was so amazed at this, I quickly made my way into the house and got the camera. I came back, and the object was still there, making slow movements, and then sudden jerks in the sky. I took a picture of 2 of it, and had my parents send the film in right away. The strange thing is, I never got these 2 pictures back, as I remember my mom bringing home the set of pictures, and I could not find the snapshots. I was furious. The object was again, circular, white color, and was rather small, as it was far out into the sky, perhaps the same altitude as the clouds. After I had taken a picture of the object, it came to a stop, and then again whipped around another cloud. I waited for it to pass, but as I searched, the object had dissapeared. It never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

High in the sky there were several flashes of light, all at the same point but each one smaller than the one before.

I know a meteor shower is not consistant with these flashes and there were no apparent aircraft in the area at that time.<n>

I was looking in a northeasterly direction...sky was very dark...no clouds in the sky....many stars visible...half moon was to my back At its brightest, object was approx as bright as the planet Venus, yellowish white in color...approx 30-40 degrees above the horizon... The strange part was that it just seemed to appear out of nowhere...i was looking in that general direction and noticed it sort of out of the corner of my eye.<n>

It grew smaller and disappeared in a very small distance from where it had been stationary.  Exactly 2 weeks later and at just about the same time we saw it again, exactly as we&#39;d seen it the first time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting is consistent with the flare of an Iridium satellite.

The lights were quite dim and difficult to see without focusing on them.  They moved extremely fast with absolutely no sound.  It passed the roof of my house about a second after I sighted it.  I proceded to my front door, but by the time I got there it was gone.  It seemed to be flying very low, since it moved so quickly.<n>

At the same time was looking at a large, submarine shaped (though it could have been tilted) object about 150 feet above our heads.  It flashed and then disappeared, no sound.  There is no explanation for this object of light...no car lights, flashlights, anything could have made this bright, brgight flash.  There is no answer to the shape &amp; size of the object seen.  Though we are on the flight path to National, there was no noise and the object was so low and large and disappeared so suddenly that there was no way it was a plane.  I think it may have left a little trail though that may have been just the movement.<n>

I quickly told my friends and we stared at it while it was going back and forth in a way a plane could NOT move plus the weirder thing is it was right over the demonstration project.  then about fifteen minutes later after we started staring at it the light moved towards us at a very fast vilocity and then it just totally disapeared then the next morning i went to my friends house and in his field his dog was dead it torn apart we walked a little further then we saw marks in his field very strange marks.  so then i told my parents and they cracked up and said a coyote must of gotten the dog and what we saw could of been a weather baloon. but they could not explain the marks in the field.<n>

The light was the color of a car tailight, larger than any planet, star, or airplane light, and was approximately 30 degrees above the horizon in the north sky.  The light drifted slowly upward for a couple minutes.  The light then began to dim and brighten slowly, eventually flickered and disappeared.  After, in the northwest sky (near Sky Harbor airport) just above the houses, we saw another light of the same description.  Over the course of approximately 15 minutes the light drifted slowly eastward and upward to a similar position as the first light.  The light then dimmed, brightened, flickered and disappeared just like the first one.  During this time the air traffic in the area was greatly decreased.  A couple weeks before, one of the six witnesses stated he saw a similar light (unknown time).  On Saturday 6/10/00, I was outside about 8:15pm when I witnessed the same light in the north sky, this time approximately 45 degrees   above the horizon.  My wife was able to film the light for a couple minutes until it dimmed, brightened, flickered, then disappeared as the others had done.<n>

It appeared to be moving quite slow and to the northeast away from us.  The object made no noise and appeared to have small wing like appendages on each side of it. Then we observed that the object appeared to be observing a Cessna jump plane in the area that was below it and slightly behind it.  One of the individuals in the Cessna jumped from the aircraft and the object above it (approximately 3000 to 4000 ft.) excellerated away at an incredable speed to the northeast.  There was no contrail and the only sound discernable was that of the Cessna aircraft.  I questioned the pilot and occupants of the aircraft and they advised that they did not see the craft.  The pilot seemed completely uninterested. This incident occurred directlty over the Richland Airport and the objects altitude was between 7000 and 10,000 ft.<n>

Noticed what I thought was another satellite treking along in orbit.  Watched it for about 5 seconds or more when it (just a small bright light, no brighter than any other object in orbit) flared a very bright, roundish, white light for one brief second.  After the flare diminished I noticed that the direction it was following had changed by approximately 30 degrees from my perspective with one difference, it was now moving out of orbit as the object had increased it&#39;s speed in that flash and moving at a new constant speed.  As it was moving on the new direction it was progressively going from the small bright light (1 - 2 millimeters across) to a smaller and less bright state until it could no longer be seen.  I noticed it while facing west, looking upwards at approx 70 degrees ascention. So far as I know anything we have that &#39;leaves orbit&#39; requires several seconds of &#39;burn&#39; before it can reach the speeds needed to totally overcome earths gravity. I see that adding contact info in here is not desired, but I would like to know if anyone else had noticed this aside from myself.  If so please contact ((name deleted)) as I&#39;m overly curious now. Thanks<n>

That particular evening we fished until 11:00p|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13243.html|219|ndxe200006| We were camping in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area on Basswood Lake near Ely, Minnesota.  That particular evening we fished until 11:00pm and returned to camp  to  build a fire.  My little brother had went to sleep in the tent while myself and our other couterpart went to the point to observe the stars.  We admired the scenery for a while when we noticed a star that appeared to be descending from the sky.  It was a blue diamond shaped object that seemed to be falling from the sky.  We became aprehensive when the object began to descent twoard us.  As the object became closer I was contemplating my escape, which would be impossible through the enourmous amout of dense forest and underbush however, my main concern was my little brother asleep in the tent 100 feet behind us.  We said if the object made it to the island 350 yards infront of us we were going to make a break for it.  All of a sudden the object make a complete 90 degree turn and headed directly north at a speed that I can not even estimate.  Immediately after we seen this phenomenon we decided to turn in for the night. To this day my counterpart and I still have the same exact recollection of that particular evening. I was wondering if any of the other campers on Basswood at that time had observed the same experience.  I know that the object flew direclty over another capsite on the adjourinig point beore heading north to Canada.  I am reluctant to submit my personal information for fear of riducule and to protect my professional reputatuion. This was second of my sighings while camping as a teenager near Clinton Lake, Lawrence Kansas in the late 80&#39;s a myself and a friend observed an object that would split into several smaller objects and would all of a sudden reapperar from all directions to form one object for a multi hour duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.))<n>

Satellites in low earth orbit are visible from the surface on clear nights with the right lighting conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed the object out to my wife fully under the assumption that the object was a satellite, and moments later it made a 90 degree turn heading almost due west.  The turn was not a sharp right angle turn, but a tight arc with a radius of approximately 8 - 10 inches, at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a degree in electronics, have worked for defense contractors and have studied air craft and space craft extensively, and to my knowledge, this type of a maneuver in orbit is currently beyond our capability. The craft did not slow down while making the turn, and the amount of rocket fuel required to make such a turn at 17,500 mph and maintain a stable orbit, would be beyond the ammount carried by current satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Currently, we move satellites over the course of several orbits. The space shuttle is not even capable of such a maneuver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I saw a few satellites and a couple of meteors among the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw a dim red light above the trees some distance away.  The light was small, steady, a deep cardinal red, moving slowly in a horizontal fashion over the big lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light quickly rose in altitude and began a &#34;ballet&#34; of arcing turns and curved trajectories, appearing to approach closer then retreat farther away.  The speed varied from almost static to a blur.  I noticed the light being reflected on the lakes surface at one point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only sounds were those of frogs, toads, loons and birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light might have been a large object some distance away, or a smaller object relatively close to me...it was difficult to tell because it never flew below the tree line to provide a scale of size or proximity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The show lasted about three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I related my observation to a party of other campers a few days later who were exiting from the north.

I assumed it was an airplane until I saw two other airplanes flying in the vacinity, one in front of the object and one behind the object and realized they were moving but this light was not, and then it flashed, like a reflecting flash, but much brighter than any reflections off the other two planes in the area, and then I noticed it was somewhat like a flat oval shape and silvery and pure white when it flashed, very clear and pure color(silver and white) compared to the two airplanes in the area....it looked like it was hovering(stationary) flashed two lights towards me and then vanished...it could not have gone behind any clouds because it was a crystal clear sky...and the sun was still fairly high in the sky. When I looked at my clock in the car it was 5:22. When I could not see it anymore it was 5:23 I could not believe it. My first sighting of something I can&#39;t explain. This is the truth. I don&#39;t know what it was. The flashes of reflecting light were so bright compared to the other two planes in the area it was like a floodlight next to a candle.......I hope this helps. I don&#39;t know if anyone else saw it on the highway or not.<n>

Two sightings seen from backyard patio. First sighting was witnessed just by me, I first saw a weird colored light in the sky, as if a child would draw a solid line across the sky, from where I stood it was about three inches long. It stood out from the rest of the sky, there were no clouds near it. I have never seen such a thing and this is why I took notice, I have seen other balls of light but not like this one. I also have had UFO sightings, again, not  like this one. The streak if that is what you want to call it was solid, and a flourescent pink/orange all by itself in the sky, nothing else in the sky looked as bright as this nor had its coloring. It was moving from right to left, what clouds could be seen in the distance were moving in the opposite direction. I first saw the streak appear out of no where, I also noticed a very bright ball extending from this streak on the beginning of the right side of the streak. Needless to say I was hypnotized by this event. Just as it was going to disappear, I called out to my friend who was in the house to come and see. She saw it too and I thought that this was the end of it. Then all of a sudden another streak appeared looking exaxtly like the first one. I said to my friend to get the camera and she did. We took the pictures right before this second sighting disappeared too. I was hopeing that we caught it on film. Got back the pictures the other day, and low and behold there it was. But its funny because you cannot see the streak, only the bright round ball. I have two sets of these pictures and would like to get them to you, I do not have a scanner, and so I think that I would have to send them to you through snail mail. Please let me know if you are interested, and thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, ((name deleted))<n>
6/6/00 03:20|El Cajon|CA|Sphere|30 seconds|SPHERICAL BRIGHT OBJECT IN SOUTHEASTERN SKY OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY EARLY JUNE 6,2000!|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13037.html|231|ndxe200006| SPHERICAL BRIGHT OBJECT IN SOUTHEASTERN SKY OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY EARLY JUNE 6,2000!<n> <n><n> <n><n> While heading east on I-8 as a front passenger in a car,I noticed an object in the southeastern sky about 45 degrees off the horizon. It looked like Venus does when it is at its VERY brightest in the western skies---same size and brightness. Perhaps a bit bigger and brighter,in fact. But it seemed odd to me to expect to see another object such as that or Jupiter,etc,there at that time. It did not move. It just &#34;hung&#34; in the sky. Then,suddenly,it started scintillating more and then it began to dim until it &#34;dimmed out&#34; so to speak. As if it had gone into a fog bank. But it was crystal clear out. All other stars were visible even though much further and smaller,of course. There was no mist nor a single cloud in the entire sky. No objects such as towers or mountains in the way. I&#39;ve lived in the area for over 50 years(all my life)and am quite familiar with the night sky and terrain at all hours of the day and am a frequent traveller at that late/early hour on that highway. There were no aircraft in the air and this object never displayed blinking lights nor red or green running lights at any time. My son,the driover,did not see it in time because he was leaned back in his seat watching only the road while I (as I often do) was leaned forward and purposely observing the awesome night sky. He noticed how intent I was looking at something,so he asked me what was up and by that time the object had dimmed out totally. We both watched the whole sky intently and then were home about 10 minutes later and watched it further. Nothing out of the ordinary. Best---((deleted))  (do not use my name please).<n>

I grabbed my camera as fast as I could and took a picture of it. Then, I called to the group I was with including about 3-4 peopld and asked them if they had seen it.  When they looked it had gone behind the trees. I only saw one.  It was silent and jet black.  It looked to me like a short rectangle.  We figured at the time it was just a helicopter, but I seriously doubt that.  I&#39;ve never seen a jet black helicopter that was that big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.

At first I thought it was a satellite way out in the distance but then it stopped and just hung there, then proceeded again in the same direction it was originally moving. It was a whitish light just like a star and was pretty far away. I would imagine that when I started watching it, it was almost straight up overhead. Anyway, after it started moving again it seemed to arc upward a bit and then descend again. Then it stopped a second time. When it started moving again it went almost straight upward for a couple of seconds then moved down and continued on it&#39;s original path. I knew then that it was not a plane and I don&#39;t think satellites stop like this. It soon faded almost directly over head. This is the second time I have seen something like this. Several of us saw it.<n>

Sorry, I do this from time to time.  Well, anyway, as I sat there,  I got this strange feeling as if the room was moving slightly from side to side.  I called my dog &#34;hambone&#34; to come into the room b/c I didn&#39;t want him to be frightened.  I sat there for a moment stroking his belly watching his leg move back and forth such as dogs do.  I then noticed outside the window there was  a faint glow about the sky so I decided to investigate.  Upon looking out the window, I saw what looked to be like a ball of light hovering approxmately 3 inches from the tops of my trees in the back yard.  It was real wierd.  I tried to convince myself that it wasn&#39;t real but there was just something real eeery about it.  I think what or whoever it was must of saw me looking at it b/c about that time, the overhead light went out and just as fast as I saw the strange object, it was gone.  I told many people about this and they all think I am crazy but I swear its the truth!  The truth IS out there.<n>

No moon, and the lights at the storage facility in front of my home were out too.  My house faces the south and about 2 miles away, were 6 or 7 lights in a &#34;v&#34; formation.  It was too dark to tell if it was all one craft or if it was a bunch of little craft. It seemed pretty large to me.  The craft or crafts weren&#39;t very bright. About the same brightness as a 25 watt lightbulb.  I knew this wasn&#39;t an airplane because My mother works at an airport and i&#39;ve seen all kinds of lights. Each individual light was in a diamond or oval shape. They blinked at at 4 second increments for 5 minutes, then they dissappeared.  To this day, I still belive it was a UFO.

6/4/00 22:00|Sydney (NSW, Australia)||Oval|10 mins|silver football shaped object hovered above rooty hill seen by more than 50 people including me! The Truth Is Out There!|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13027.html|240|ndxe200006| silver football shaped object hovered above rooty hill seen by more than 50 people including me! The Truth Is Out There!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were at my best friends 16th tonight, we were all out in his back yard, we were playing around and had the music up loud listining to KoRn. As the night went on we decided to lay on the ground and make things out of clouds, after about 30 mins we noticed a football shaped object hovering low above Rooty Hill (which is located about 500m from his house and is also the name of the suburb). immediantly i went inside to inform his parents and relatives, at first nobody followed me but after the heard everyone out the back they went straight out the front (which faces straight at the hill) i followed them. When i got down the hall way enough to see the top of the hill i was ammased to see it was only about 5m off the ground, instead of about 15m which it was when we first noticed it. At this point it had been in veiw for about 3 mins. We were all in shock, there was a shinning silver, perfect football shaped ufo that would have been 30m long by 15m high, there was no visible windows or wngs or jets, But still it hovered perfect. after about 5 mins it began to rotate then it began to rise till it was about 50m above the hill, Then &#39;shot&#39; straight up, it looked like when the enterprise or whatever it is off that show with captain spok, took off into space and just became a dot with the big light streak. The streak of light was red in colour and lasted for a couple of seconds. THIS IS THE FREAKIEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!! This all happened tonight. there are easy 50 ppl who can varify my story. I didnt know if i should call the police or what!?! So when i got home (about 20mins ago) i put ufo in the search and ended up here. I feel others in this area may have seen it, as it was on top of the hill on a perfect night, and you can see the top of the hill from anywere in the suburb!!!!!! I hope this information can help you do whatever it is you do. the time is now 1:05 only a couple of hours later i am still shaking, i will never ever ever forget today!!!!!!!!<n>

We saw the craft land in a nearby street and approached it We saw a bright set of lights in the sky (like stadium lights) that appeared to be about 1 1/2 away. The lights dimmed. The craft made a sharp turn to the right and hovered. We ran to our car. We saw the craft land through the bushes. It landed almost like it was going down stairs. We drove about 1/2 mile twords it and saw the craft in the middle of the street. It appeared to be moving twords us. We Y-turned and when we looked back it was gone completely. ((NUFORC Note: We received no other reports from this area for this time. The witness, a student, does not state what he and his friends were doing at the time of the sighting. PD)) .....my notes.....i saw this far, far off in the sky, and wouldn&#39;t have noticed it at all except i happened to stare at the same area for awhile, and noticed that this &#39;star&#39; was very slowly moving. i&#39;m not sure of the exact time, but at this point it was quite dim, like a star on it&#39;s way out...quite a clever disguise...i had seen this once before about 5 years ago, and pretty much just as soon as i started thinking about how 5 years ago the &#39;star&#39; turned into an EXTREMELY bright spherical row of lights (stadium lights), this &#39;star&#39; did the same...these were very obviously seperated lights, not any kind of trail from a shooting star...i&#39;ve seen plenty of shooting stars when i was younger up north, and this was nothing like those...even though this was very far off in the distance, once the &#39;star&#39; turned to the bright lights, they were almost blinding....then it just &#39;hovered&#39; for maybe 20-40 seconds, and it kind of freaked me out, as i got the sensation that whatever it was, be it government, alien or spirit, it felt like i was being watched, and as soon as i thought this it turned back into the &#39;star&#39; started moving quite fast and just disappeared .....i was letting my dogs out when i saw this.....also, when it shifted appearances, it was like it was &#39;morphing&#39;, like it was actually taking on different properties....i&#39;m surprised not more people noticed it, at least the little while that it was so incredibly bright, but i suppose the majority of city people don&#39;t care about nature anymore<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This report is submitted anonymously.

6/3/00 23:30|New York City (Brooklyn)|NY|Chevron|1 hour|Satellites searching area before and after   2 chevron UFO 's were seen.|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13199.html|243|ndxe200006| Satellites searching area before and after   2 chevron UFO &#39;s were seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a video technician presently employed at the D.A. s office. My duties are to document crime scene evidence and statements from defendents.This is actually my second UFO sighting,in June 1982 on a clear sunny day I was walking with my older brother who is also an ameteur  astronomer. We  saw a large cylinder shaped metallic object approximately  150 ft in length hovering about 10,000 ft. The UFO made no sound, it just floated for about 2 minutes, it then became smaller in size and began moving north. We lost sight of it. On 6/3/00 at about 11:30pm my wife returned from having dinner. I stood at the window  looking out at the harbor and the New York skyline. We have a pretty good view from our top floor apartment and could see for miles. The evening was cool and the night sky was clear. I looked up at the big dipper and  saw a small object like a star moving north to south across the big dipper. I thought it could have been a satellite and I wanted my wife to see it, however the object vanished. About 15 minutes later a second object appears inthe same area also moving north to south. At this point I was already on the fire escape with my binoculars. Unfortunately for my wife she was already in the shower. I sat patiently looking up at the night sky for about another 15 minutes, then saw 2 chevron shaped UFO&#39;s circuling next to the dipper.They stopped and faced eachother then continued circuling. I remember thinking  that these had to be birds flying around at night but when I looked at them through my binoculars I saw 2 boomerangs slowly circuling in the sky. I immediately became exited and had to rub my eyes to make sure I was not seeing things. I watched these objects for a few seconds, they were a dull biege color with a soft brownish glow or haze, One of the UFO&#39;S was wider then the other and looked more like a large hand glider while the other object had a much more alien appearance to it. They had no lights  or windows though they appeared to reflect some light. It was difficult to determine s! ize beca use they were dull however when looking at them through my binoculars I could tell that they large objects, probably 100 to 150 ft wide and hovering about 10,000 ft up.I realized that I had to get my wife to see this. I began knocking on the bathroom door pleading for her to come out and see these things. she came out but  they had  already dissappeared. Together we continued watching for about another 15 -20 minutes.Then we observed a third satellite moving in the opposite direction across the dipper. That night I couldn&#39;t sleep thinking about what I saw. The next morning we talked about it and decided that what we saw were either real extraterrestrial crafts coming in from space circuling over the city and then moving back out to space or military satellites trying to track the two chevron UFO&#39;s. What&#39;s also strange is that this incident occurred exactly 18 years after the first one and for the past few weeks prior to the second sighting I&#39;ve been getting this feeling that I was going to see something again. Could we be right about what we saw and have other people had similar feelings prior to seeing a UFO?<n>
6/3/00 22:35|Ithaca|MI|Flash|one second|I witnessed a very fast moving white light that suddenly exploded into a bright white flash.|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13025.html|244|ndxe200006| I witnessed a very fast moving white light that suddenly exploded into a bright white flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 22:35 Eastern Standard Time, while traveling north on US-27 just south of Ithaca, MI, I witnessed a very fast moving bright white light that suddenly exploded into a very bright white flash of light.  I was a front seat passenger looking out of my door window when I saw the fast moving light.  The light was traveling southward at an elevation of approximately 45 degrees above the horizon and from my position it seemed to be descending at a ten degree angle.  After about a second of observation the light suddently exploded into a bright white flash that lasted for a fraction of second.  The flash did not linger in the sky as an explosion would, and I did not see any trace of the light following the explosion.  The object seemed to be moving much faster than any meteor or debris that I&#39;ve previously witnessed entering the atmosphere.  There were a few high altitude passanger jets in the immediate vicinity of the phenomenon from the position which I witnessed it occur.<n>
6/3/00 22:30|Cranberry Township|PA|Circle|2-3 seconds|Ball of white light seen traveling at low altitude|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13022.html|245|ndxe200006| Ball of white light seen traveling at low altitude<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 10:30 PM I was out on my back deck facing the north. At this time I noticed a very bright white light sped into the area at relatively low altitude traveling roughly east to west from my vantage point. Estimated distance from the object to me was around a mile. The light sped into view from behind a row of trees at a fairly fast clip, intensified slightly in brightness as it reached a due-north angle from me, and then its flight curved to the right during the last second of the event and quickly faded from view. The light itself was a steady bright white circular shaped light that was slightly bigger than a pencil eraser held at arms length. I did not notice any sound or &#34;tail&#34; coming from behind the object. The light traveled about 10-15 degrees above the horizon and judging it&#39;s relative brightness I figure it was at a fairly low altitude 3,000 to maybe 5,000 feet AGL. Speed was a bit harder to judge, although it was traveling much faster than the commercial air traffic that routinely fly over my area into Pittsburgh Int&#39;l, albeit at a much higher altitude. A rough guestimate would be around 500-600 mph, maybe more. Total duration of the sighting was a little less than 3 seconds. I&#39;ve taken a few flight lessons and have 25 hrs credit (1 hr solo), and from what I saw it was traveling much too fast to be a plane at any altitude. It also didn&#39;t travel quite as fast to be a meteor not to mention I saw no visible tail and it curved to the right noticeably during the last split second it was viewable to me. The sky conditions were clear with a 55 degree temp, no thunderstorms anywhere near the area.<n>

The most at one time were 3. One appeared to stop overhead until the one behind came to the same point and the first one would dim and disapear. They appeared to be coming over the ocean.<n>

When we looked up to the Norhtwest sky we saw 3 bright gold/orangeballs of light, that appeared to be pulsing in brightness.They were in a triangle shape pattern and then would separate and move back together. We looked at them thru the binocculars and no shape could be recognized. One appeared to travel higher and to the north slowly , until we were unable to see it anymore.At the same time another bright light(ball ) was accending towards the other two..One of the two was also appearing to go higher and northward. The accending light ball was traveling rapidly , followed close by other. Whe they arrived at the position of the other one they stopped and waited until all had reached that level and did some formations, always returning to the triangular pattern.We never saw more than three at anyone time..we couted a total of 8 thru the 1/2 hr. we watched them. there was no noise and once they reach a certain level the movements were planned. we live on the Oregon coast and they appeared to come from the ocean (as far as direction goes..not from the land) It appeared they came from the area beyond the ocean , formed a group and slowly proceeded inland to the north.<n>
6/3/00 20:30|Kaneohe|HI|Other|1min and 30sec approx.|Two witnesses observe a "V" formation of lights moving across the night sky.|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13030.html|248|ndxe200006| 1.)  Came up from the horizon in the Northeast over Kaneohe;   (my first thought was fireworks).  Two<n> <n><n> witnesses involved,  second witness arrived approximately 30 sec. after the initial observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.)  Traveled from left to right towards the Southwest in an unorganized group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.)  Some objects seemed to circle others and even back track a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.)  Continued toward Soutwest and without stoping appeared to &#34;degroup themselves&#34; and with incredible precision seemed to go to their assigned positions on &#34;que&#34; and stop......&#34;remarkable&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.)  The formation seemed to form a &#34;V&#34; with the apex point ing in the approximate direction of the northwest and located directly over the Koolau&#39;s ( a formation of vertical cliffs.  approx. 3000 ft in height) so steep that NASA Satellites cannot accurately photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6.)   After the formation  appeared there were less points of light then seen in the origninal unorganized group;  Almost as if groups of lights had taken up their various positions.  That would account for the points of light in the formation appearing larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7.)   As luck would have it, at this point the whole formation became obscured by clouds ( a common occurrence due to the trade winds rising over the mountains.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8.)    While the clouds were obscuring the formation one point of light  (muted amber red)  took off in the direction of the south with great speed and another took off to the north a millisecond later (white); both disappeared quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9.)    The other  witness claims to have seen a red point of light proceed the original grouping;  &#34;I did not see that light&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> 10.)   Interesting to note that at approximately the same time our observation was taking place; NASA  was to have a controlled re-entry of the 17 ton Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, launched in 1991.  The Satellite was supposed to enter the atmosphere along a 1,000-mile srtip of the Pacific about 2,500 miles southeast of Hawaii.  It was said that if it left its projected course sufficiently it would be in the southeast sky about 8:30 p.m. and could be obsereved here in Hawaii.  It is my opinion what we saw was a completely seperate sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11.)    Added note.....at approximately 22:30 the same evening my curiosity drove me outside again to look at the sky and much to my surprise I observed another object traveling in the same direction (straight line) muted amber red in color.  This object had a ghost like form directly in front which seemed to move back and forth from right to center forward.  It seemed ghost like because I could only observe it  when I would look to the side of the main object. ( I assume this is due to the optical nerve phenomena where the object disappears when observed straight on in the dark.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12.)     I might add I am a trained observer.  My profession is to observe even the &#34;smallest&#34;  morphological structures of the human cell under the microscope.<n>

I told the other 4 people that were there and they all looked at the light.  It was too big for a star and too big and bright for a satelite.  We took some still pictures with the 35mm camera and also took the camcorder and filmed the light.  The light stayed in a stationary place and did not move at all.  It lasted about 40 minutes before we could not see the light anymore.  The light slowly faded out.  It was oval in shape and bright white.  It was much brighter than a headlight of a car for comparison.  It just hovered in one spot.  I am a nurse and my husband is a mechanic.  We have 2 boys one age 7 and the other age 13.

We took several still pictures of the objects seen and just got the film developed.  The objects that were not visible to the eye at the time of the occurance do show up on the pictures that have been developed.  The camera is a new camera and was not damaged in any way or altered in any way.  The film was developed at a commercial film lab and we have video tape to go along with the pictures.  If you are interested in seeing these please contact us.  We were informed that a preliminary finding was that it was a high altitude balloon, but the pictures show saucer shaped objects.  One of the objects is zig-zagging across the sky.<n>
6/3/00 19:30|Overgaard|AZ|Triangle|45 minutes|At 7:30 pm, the sky was still blue when we saw 3 large separate red lights moving in a triangular formation in the northeastern sky.|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13024.html|251|ndxe200006| At 7:30 pm, the sky was still blue when we saw 3 large separate red lights moving in a triangular formation in the northeastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 7:30 pm we saw in the noth to northeastern sky,  what looked like a very large  very bright star. The sky was still blue. The over the next 15 minutes the &#39;star&#39; turned a deep yellowish or golden color and then to bright red and very slowly seemed to be shrinking. That&#39;s  when we realized it was not a star and that it was moving away from us. We got out our telescope and saw that the object was actually 3 bright red lights in a very symetrical  triangle formation.  You could see the sky backround through the center of the triangle. There appeared to be a white line that connected the three red lights.  We lost sight of it with the naked eye around 8:00 PM but we still saw it through the telescope for another 20 min.or so.  It was very high much higher than any plane could fly. We lost sight of it in the north/northeastern sky.  We couldn&#39;t really tell if was a single craft or 3 separate crafts. The single &#39;point&#39; light was not as bright or as red as the other two. It also appeared to be moving in a forward direction as if the  two brighter lights werte the front, and the single point being the rear. My husband said it didn&#39;t look to him as if the white line that connected (and surronded) the red lights,  actually met and touched at the single point end. Like it was a little bit open at the single point  end.   Each of the lights seemed to be the same distance from each other.  This was NOT one of ours!   It was too high. moved much to slowly for any of our aircraft, and didn&#39;t seem to show any type of exhaust coming from anywhere.  Which was why it was hard to tell which end was the front or back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  High-altitude balloon))<n>

There were three cars parked on the side of the road, all of them with people standing outside, looking into he sky. I wondered what they were looking at, so I looked in my rearview mirror and saw a red-orange light in the sky. I turned around and pulled over behind another car and asked them what they were looking at. They handed me a pair of binoculars and pointed to the same red-orange light. When I looked through the binoculars, there weree three red-orange light arranged in a triangle shape with the point downward. This object was directly to the north between the tops of some trees and moving to the east toward the Springerville Generating Station, but far enough away that it could not have been caused by the plant. We stood there watching the light for well over 30 minutes and it remained for more than an hour; I know this because we kept looking for it. Finally, around 8:30 or so, the object went behind a large cloud and I lost track of it. That does not mean it dissapeared, it just means I had to leave. Based on the haze of the sky and power plant emmissions that I saw when looking through the binoculars and the lack of a coherent outline, I believe the object was a long way away.<n>

While driving south on I-25 from Santa Fe to Albuquerque to pick up my girlfriend at the airport, I noticed what looked like to be a super large baloon over the Placitas area (north of the Sandia mountains, just a few mile east &amp; parallel to I-25).  I was doing almost 80 mph the whole way and the object appeared to move in tandem with my car speed, maintaining approximately the same angle until I got to Albuquerque.  I stopped at a bookstore and had the manager come out and look at it.  It was entirely motionless then, translucent silver, and could have been a balloon.  I saw the sun reflections on both the &#34;top&#34; and &#34;bottom&#34; sides of this sphere, relative to where the sun was at the time.  It was a windy day in New Mexico, but this thing wasn&#39;t moving at all.  I stopped again to pick up mail a few miles away; it still wasn&#39;t moving and I pointed it out to 2 other witnesses.  Finally I arrived at the airport and the object was directly above me and slightly south.  Figher jets were taking off, flying near the object, then landing immediately.  I saw them do this 3 separate times (and I&#39;m told by neighbors that fighers do touch-and-go often in this manner, though it was my first time seeing it).  I met my girlfriend at the gate appx 3:21 pm and immediately pointed the object out to her through the airport window.  Within a few seconds, it began moving directly west, slowly but noticeable.  Within minutes the whole sky was covered with clouds and that was the last I saw of it.  Whatever it was, it was hard to ignore and lent lots of excitement to my afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have learned that the object was a high-altitude balloon, launched from Fort Sumner, NM, by the University of Chicago.  The FAA released a Notice to Airmen about the launch, we are led to believe.  PD))<n>

While size was impossible to determine (because I could not tell how far away the object was), my best guess was about 6 feet in diameter and about 1500 feet above ground level. I though nothing of it other than the balloon itself looked a little strange (a little TOO translucent, and I had never seen anything quite like it before). I went about my work for a few more minutes, looked up again, and was VERY surprised to see the balloon in EXACTLY the same place in the sky...I would find this strange on ANY day, but particularly strange today because the wind was blowing about 20kts out of the west. I again thought &#34;it must be a balloon&#34;, and again went about my work...a few minutes later, I looked up again, and the balloon had moved WEST...that&#39;s INTO to wind. Now my curiousity was piqued. I finished up my work, and planned to go into the house, get binoculars, and take a picture...however I still had no sense of urgency because I felt it HAD to be a balloon. To my AMAZEMENT, by the time I got into the house, I was distracted and FORGOT to go back outside and have another look! So ends my story. I did feel like I was being watched when on the roof...but this could have very well been my own imagination. I&#39;m sorry I did not get pictures. Thanks for the fine service you provide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Follow-up Report:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since found out that the object I saw is/was an atmospheric research<n> <n><n> balloon.

It was a extremely bright silverish light but did not hurt eyes.  Started moving east to northeast at a slow pace and then start ascending quickly north and upwards.  Not changing form, it kept decending upwards until no longer able to see. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means Saturday, 03JN00, but we are not certain.))<n>
6/2/00 22:00|Escondido|CA|Light|10 minutes|My husband and I witnessed a bright reddish, gold light with no sound, change directions several times prior to disappearing.|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13017.html|256|ndxe200006| My husband and I witnessed a bright reddish, gold light with no sound, change directions several times prior to disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was in our backyard moving the sprinkler when he noticed a very bright light coming coming towards him from the west. Friday night was very dark, no moon light to speak of.  The stars were very visible and unusually bright.The light was quite large and much brighter than any of the stars and was moving east over our backyard.  He came in the house to get me.  After we ran out front of our house the object which was moving in a straight line and had no audible sound had just come over the top of our house and was moving in an eastward direction.  If I had to estimate the size, I would say it was about the size of a small pill held at arms length.  An airplane came from the south going north (which we did hear) and crossed in front of the object.  The airplane was about twice the size of the object. Once the plane was past the object and out of sight, there was no sound again.  The object then seemed to come to a stop, then start to move to the south.  It never appeared to turn, just change direction.  It went for about 30-40 seconds south then change directions again and go back north. It appeared to stop again and start to go backwest over our house again.  The object never appeared to turn, just slow down or stop then change direction.  It also seemed to get brighter then dimmer then brighter again.  In looking at it through binoculars it appeared to be reddish, gold color, not a flame, but have a sparkling energy moving it.  My husband indicated that when he first saw the light in the backyard, he thought it might be a helicopter, however, as the object came closer, he saw a row of lights inside the brighter light.  Not red and green, just moving lights in a row inside the brighter light.  After watching the object for approx. 7 mins.changing direction approx. 5 times it seemed to hover for a couple of seconds then go up and out.  I can&#39;t say it took off, it just turned off.  It didn&#39;t die out, the bright light just went out, like someone turned off the light.<n>

Usually the plane light would be whiteish in color. That&#39;s why it caught my eye. I kept looking at it for about a minute and a half with the naked eye and when I  had come to the conclusion that it was not moving I ran and got my Binoculars out. I focusedd in on it and saw that the light I had seen was actually 4 lights positioned in a 12 oclock, 3 oclock, 6 oclock, 9 oclock pattern and they had looked like one light to the naked eye.  I kept watching it even as 2 Jet liners flew between me and the object. I also saw a helicopter flying towards me and assume that they must have had to see it also. I tried to find anyone in veiw of me to confirm what I was seeing but nobody was around. I even tried to see if my neighbor was home but he wasn&#39;t. I continued to watch the object hover and then all of sudden it took off so fast that it seemed to disapear. All I saw the very first part of the take off andd there was nothing left to follow. I have not told anyone else of this other than my exwife who is now convinced that I am nuts.   I sure hope that other people report this or I  might start doughting even my own sanity!<n>

Suddenly, a giant dark blue flash appeared over the entire horizon above the tree line in front of us.  We were face to the southwest.  We all stared up through the vans window at the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instantly, the dark blue light was replaced by a gigantic saucer shaped craft.  I estimate it to have been over 100 yards in length.  The height to be over 75 to 100 feet.  It was metallic in nature as you could see with the reflection of continuous blue flashing lights traveling around the center of the craft.

We were driving north on I-95 back home at about 10pm when we saw this ball of orange light in the northwest. I was the first to point it out, as I was the passenger. It looked like a meteor or something. I was a little freaked out at first -- I kept having visions like in the movies, where the meteor crashes to Earth and all hell breaks loose. But the &#39;ball&#39; never hit. It sort of faded out and disappeared at first. My friend saw it too and decied to pull over to safely view whatever it was. A couple seconds later it was hovered almost directly over us; it was pretty large...larger than a helicopter and had no visible wings, more like a long triangle. There were no flashing beacons or standard collision lights except 3 dim white lights on the bottom. It hovered for about 5 minutes before this huge (about 1/3 the size of the craft it self) bright blue afterburn came out the back and it took off. In a couple of seconds it sped off towards the northeast and was gone for good. What was so strange was that there didn&#39;t seem to be much sound when the craft took off; I was expecting a sonic boom at the least, but nothing. My friend and I could not believe what we had just seen. About a half hour later in a supermarket, a woman overheard us talking about the event we had seen and chimed in that her son had seen the same thing at a soccer game.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/1/00 22:20|Mineola|NY|Teardrop|6 minutes|Tear shaped object seen crossing the sky over Mineola, New York|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13012.html|261|ndxe200006| Tear shaped object seen crossing the sky over Mineola, New York<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:20 p.m., north of the North Star, we noticed what appeared to be a very slow moving tear-drop shaped fuzzy object that glowed very dimly and appeared to wobble back and forth as it moved from the North West to the South East.  We hurriedly retrieved binoculars from the house. My brother looked first.  He was apparently taken aback by what he saw, and exclaimed in a shakey voice that it was a &#34;UFO.&#34;  Nevertheless, I was sure he was looking at an airplane that was out of focus; so I took the binoculars and zeroed in on the object.  I could not believe what I saw.  It was not an airplane.  Rather, it was a tear-shaped object with a dim, fixed light at the top, and several lights at the bottom, seemingly surrounded by a haze, that moved together in an irregular fashion in a wobbly circle.  It appeared as though the object were tumbling across the sky.  It then turned some 30 degrees to the right, and eventually disappeared into the haze. We looked at the sky intently for another half hour or so, but did not see the object again.  I did, however, notice what I think was an iridium satelite.  It was a pinpoint of light moving steadily north to south that briefly flared in brightness and then disappeared. At around midnight, I continued to look at the sky, but only saw a solitary meteor cross the Big Dipper&#39;s Handle.  Although beautiful, I retired to bed curious at what I had witnessed. Today, I read several articles about an orbiting gamma ray observatory that is in the process of descending through the atmosphere, eventually crashing into a remote section of the Pacific Ocean on Sunday.  I can only wonder if the object I saw was this satelite.<n>

I was driving my car on divisadero st. or in that vicinity and what caught my eye was a huge ball of fire behind the clouds. It was big and bright. There was no rocket sound or vibrtations. There was a older gentleman that was riding a bike, his head was looking up towards the sky. He saw it as well. By this time i double parked my vehicle and watch the light dissappear into thin air. No sights followed after that. I never saw the man again as he rode away. I live in atlanta but was visiting family at that time. oh yeah it seemed very close to the earth, about the height a helicopter or small plane would normally fly<n>

We never saw anything, remotely, like it, before, except in pictures of a developing eclispe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The, we noticed evidence of a forth object, overhead and stretching, due east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> my wife grabbed her 35 mm camera and started shooting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the images that she captured are unexplainable.

It, certainly, got his attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> that is when, i started to examine, just what it was, that was making the images.<n> <n><n> <n><n> after much thought, i realized, that in the case of the most well defined image of an an inverted arrowhead, i was looking at a shadow being cast by a v shaped object, suspended point side down, flat side facing the sun.  the object appeared to be hovering in a fixed position, at a point that would place it between the sun that had set -the light source - and the pink sky and dark shadowed atmosphere in the southren skies- in effect, the movie screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the image in the sky was an artifact of the atmosphere, as it bent the light and focused the dark image of the v shaped object onto the movie-screen like background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> we snapped 10 pictures that day and they indicated that the above mentioned v shape object had changed its allinment to the sun.  the pictures contain a wealth of scientific information and rasie a whole lot of questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

The object appeared.  It was at first a silver saucer shaped object.  Then all of a sudden its wings shot out on two sides of the object, and started to twirl around at an extremely fast pace.  We were expecting the object to fly either east or west.  Instead the object flew out, as in out of our vision and into another part of the galaxy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was something that we will never forget.<n>

It was around 3 p.m. in the afternoon, and the moon was about one-third of the way between straight up and the western horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching military jets as they raced across the sky leaving vapor trails behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then spotted a bright light, similar to the planet Venus, moving eastward at a speed similar to the jet aircraft.  I assumed that it was another jet much higher up, and the sunlight was glinting off it.  It was not leaving any vapor trail.  As it passed almost straight above me, it started making a sharp arc of 90 degrees (about the same radius as the moon), and simultaneously coming to a complete stop.  I kept watching it, but after about 20 minutes, it was noticeably starting to slowly fade, but still not moving again. After 10 more minutes, it had completely faded away, and I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I large circular (disk) craft was floating above our vehicles on 7 mile between Farmington and Newburgh Road in Livonia MI.  I don&#39;t remember the exact date or anything.  The only thing I remember is this massive disk spaced thing floating about us while driving.  It was VERY close to us... I would say about a couple hundred feet above us.  I wanted to see other people&#39;s reactions, but at the same time I had to follow this craft.  It floated away VERY QUICKLY and I only followed it for about 1/2 mile.  I wish to this day that I took down the exact time and date... and I wished I shouted out of my car window and asked someone else if I was seeing things!!!!  I&#39;ve never claimed seeing a UFO before, but from what I remember, I was speakless.  I almost feel like I was in a different state of mind when I saw this thing.<n>

These lights have even come to the windows of my house, not actually stopping, but just passing by in groups of about 10, wizzing by at around 300 mph, this can be judged from my past experience as a local Powhatan cop.

I was parked in a lay by near to the village of saxton in yorkshire, England, UK when i caught sight of a shiny sperical object crossing my line of vision as i looked out through my windscreen. The object was approximately 150 - 200 ft in the air and was as big as a golf ball from where i was sat in my car. It crossed my view fairly slowly from left to right and disappeared into the field to my right hand side. It made no sound and gave off no light at all which i found strange but the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end as i watched it. I am positive that the object landed in the field to my right but again there was no sound and no light to back up my thinking. I saw no visible markings at all, it was just a plain silver sphere. I did not get out of my car as i felt the need to move on. The hairs on my neck still stand on end as i think about it even today. I know what i saw and i still think it strange but i want to know what it was and if anyone else has seen anything like it before. At the time of the sighting i was working for a surveillance operative team and worked for certain sections of local police forces up and down the country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was walking south-east on 7th street in San Francisco, about 1 block north of the I-80 overpass.  It was sometime between 1:00 AM and 3:00 AM.  I was returning to my office after spending the evening with some friends (I was not intoxicated).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up to see what stars were visible through the light pollution, as it was a clear night.  I had grown up in more rural areas of the Midwest, and enjoyed stargazing, although I had never taken the time to learn more than a handful of star and constellation names.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked south, over a low (2-3-story) building across the street, I noticed very distant/faint light moving at a steady velocity against the stars in the background.  The movement was about two-thirds of the way up from the horizon to the zenith.  It was so faint that I would easily have missed it had I not been looking intently in its general direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I focused on this movement, I realized that it was three very faint lights in a triangular shape.  The lights were close together, perhaps one-third to one-half the diameter of a full moon overhead.  These lights were moving from a southerly direction to a northerly direction.  Because of the perceived distance, if it had been a single light, I would have assumed it was a satellite and thought nothing more of it.  I did assume it was a high-altitude aircraft, but I was intrigued by the fact that the lights were solid, when I expected to see flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, I realized that the formation of lights passed in front of a star, and I could clearly see the star between the lights.  This happened with other stars, leading me to realize that the lights were not on a solid object, but rather moving together in a formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched more intently to see if the formation shifted.  It seemed to be locked very rigidly, and I saw no evidence of the lights moving relative to one another.  I also realized that there was no sound from the craft(s).  (There was little traffic on the overpass that time of night, so I would have heard a small plane, helicopter or jet.)  I don&#39;t recall a rotational motion, but it&#39;s possible they were rotating around a central point very slowly.  Otherwise, they moved in a straight line, southerly to northerly, just to the north-west of the zenith.  I do not recall if they moved with one light in the lead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped watching the lights after they moved to the north side of the street.  I do not recall if they were no longer visible, or if I just lost interest (after a few minutes, they exhibited no new behavior).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The memory of seeing these lights has stayed with me very clearly for over 13 years, and I have been curious what they were.<n>

We sat on a picnic table for awhile then walked back towards the direction we came on the path.  We were facing mostly East in direction.  Suddenly in the sky above there was a flash of brilliant dark blue, dark purple, then dark red.  Within that flash of changing color appeared an oval shaped small craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft had no wings and made no sound.  It was so close above us approximately 400 feet.  It sat motionless.  You could almost make out the metallic like reflections as a set of blinking lights encircled the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, without a sound it shot some 1000 yards away from us towards the south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stopping instantly, then it shot into the distance and out of sight to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then stared at each other in disbelief and began to laugh at the incredibleness of it all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
