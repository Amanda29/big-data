I started to film but couldn&#39;t get the lights to show up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a I was filming, one saucer detached its self from the rest and flew very slowly over me stopping as lights flashed white two on either side then quickly flying off and upward (not seen again).  Then as I was heading back a yellow light showed up slowly just over the tree line and started almost dancing or jittering like movments till it got past the trees.  It started to float upwards and at this point I was in pure shock and decided to go home.<n>

Neither formation was perfect, each were clearly formed of individual craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it might be an airplane, satellite or possibly a star or sunset.  Unsure of how large the object actually was since it was too far off to get a realistic measurement, however it appeared to be hovering around the Evansville, IN area but it could’ve been much further west when viewed directly from I-64, it was definitely large, oblong and stationary in the western sky.  It had an oblong-oval / cigar shape and appeared bright white in color such as found with a star or a satellite / metallic object reflecting sunlight.  I viewed it for approx. 15 minutes before exiting highway (exit 105) and it was still in the same location fixed on the western horizon when viewed directly down the I-64 corridor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I observed it for approx. 15 – 20 seconds.  The orange object was not flickering or flashing but the all of a sudden the light went out and I could still see a dark image for a brief moment  and then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 30 -45 seconds later I observed a second object with the same description as the first traveling the same trajectory.. Then the orange light went out about 15 – 20 seconds later and  I could not see the object afterwards. I then ran into the house and got my cell phone camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, approx. 15  seconds later I observed a 3rd object, same as the first two traveling the same course and manner. I recorded this object on my cell phone and again the light went out and again I could see the object briefly but I could not see the shape or where it disappeared to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was clear and the temperature was approx. 70 -75 degrees at the time. I did not see any aircraft in the area. It should be noted that Luke AFB is located approx. 20 miles to the southwest of my location and the F-16’s usually do night training from about 2100 – 2230 hours and you could see and hear them but there were no military aircraft at the time of my observations. On the video I gave the description as possibly as flares but none of the three objects flickered or left a smoke trail. As of this writing I have not seen anything on the news or the web.<n>

9/29/14 21:30|Frankfort|KY|Fireball|10 minutes|I saw a bright fireball moving in the sky for 10 minutes at a constant speed and path.|10/3/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114096.html|21|ndxe201409| I saw a bright fireball moving in the sky for 10 minutes at a constant speed and path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 9:30 PM. It happened on September, 29th 2014. I stepped outside on my deck to smoke.  I looked to my right and noticed a very bright, orange light that had a hint of red to it.  I immediately thought it was a plane like the small ones that often fly in this area.  I was thinking it was a small 4 or 5 person aircraft like a Cessna or something.  However, there were no flashing lights like are commonly seen on a plane.  I then thought it might be a helicopter and it was shining some type of bright front light ahead of it in my direction.  However, there was no sound.  It was moving fairly slow in a horizontal path.  It did not waver from side to side at all but continued on a straight course.  It was going the speed that local small planes in the area normally seem to go.  I then realized that it actually appeared as though it were on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached my house on its course, I could distinguish what looked like flames.  There was a central round core of glowing orange light with a hint of red light inside and around it.  There was also what looked like two plumes of large orange flames jetting on both sides.  As it came over the house I noticed that there appeared to be a dark structure of some sort beneath the flames.  It almost looked like there were possibly jet black wings like a plane around the flames and central area of the object.  The object left no trail. The object was mainly round except for these two plumes of flames and the two wing-like structures.  I became very concerned because I thought this could be an aircraft on fire and in distress.  However, there was no sound or any other flashing lights or colors.  The only colors were orange and the tiny hint of red.  The orange was a pumpkin orange.  The red was not a bright red, but a brownish red.  The object did not descend or slow down, no! r did it speed up.  The speed seemed to be moving in a constant speed and the direction or path of the object did not change or vary.  It was going coming from the Northwest and heading toward the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed over the house and continued past the neighborhood, the flame plumes began to diminish.  It almost looked like they were being turned down as if I were turning off the flames of a gas stove.  When the flames died down the center of the object was still glowing orange. I could then make out a dark structure of some type that did resemble an aircraft in some way.  Suddenly, the central core flickered into what appeared to be two small orange lights.  The lights then went out.  For a second it seemed I could again make out some type of dark structure.  The object was still there and moving, but it blended in with the night sky and passed out of my range of vision.  It bothered me a bit.  I have watched the skies a lot, and I know what planes look like.  I have witnessed meteorites and such often and know how they move and appear in the sky.  This did not appear to be a meteorite.  It kept a consistent path.  There was no sound.  The speed was relatively slow.  The! event lasted at least 10 minutes if not more.  When I first saw it and realized that it was not a plane or helicopter, I called my fiancé to come outside and see it.  She brought her phone, and I recorded at least 3 minutes of it on the phone.  The video from the phone showed no color.  All you can see is a white blob of light.  You can hear us talking about what we are seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did see an object in 2004 sometime over Berea, Kentucky that was rather large in the sky— about the size of a full moon.  That object was perfectly round, low to the tree-line, and glowed the same orange that this object tonight did.  However, that object in 2004 was much, much larger and closer to the ground.  It did not appear to have flames or be burning, it just glowed pumpkin orange.  It also moved slowly and in a straight path until it disappeared behind the hills in Berea, KY.  At that time, I had never seen anything like that before in my life; and I never expected to again.  Tonight, I mentioned on the video that the color and movement reminded me of what I saw in 2004.  It was very similar.  The object tonight in 2014, however, must have been higher in the sky.  It wasn’t near the tops of the trees but was up about whatever height the small planes in the area fly.  It was much bigger in comparison to the stars.  It was like a low flying plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called 911 tonight to report it because I thought there might be a possibility that it was a plane in distress.  The 911 operator told me to call a different number because it was not an emergency.  They were not interested in taking a report.  I then called the number they gave me, and that number was not in service.  I then decided to call the local airport.  I got a number there that gave me a hotline to call.  I called that hotline number from the recording.  I left a detailed message on the hotline number about what I saw.  This call was made after 10:00 PM.  I then decided I would look on the internet to see if there was a place to report UFO sightings.  I found this website and called the hotline and spoke to a man that told me to write up this report.  My fiancé will also be writing a report as well since she was there with me and witnessed the event. I also made a post on Facebook to see if anyone had seen the same object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would really like to know what this was.  It makes no sense.  I even thought of a Chinese lantern, but the object was being propelled in a straight course at a constant speed and was as large as a plane.  It couldn’t have been a burning balloon or Chinese lantern.  I don’t know what this was tonight.  I don’t know what I saw was in 2004.  I am an educated man with a graduate degree and professional career, and I would like to know what this was.  Thanks for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It shot straight up in the sky within the valley, stopped around the top of the mountain range for a moment, slowing descended, stopped half way down, slowly descended again and began to swirl slowly around the top of some houses then I lost sight. Twice it did this routine within about 10 minutes, I can tell the way it moved it was definitely a ufo.  I actually called the resort and there wasn&#39;t any &#34;fireworks&#34; last night she said, told her what I saw and can tell she didn&#39;t believe are care about it. I know I couldn&#39;t have been the only person who saw this, hope someone else here did. Thanks!<n>

It wentbpast me slightly then stopped and hovered.  I was afraid to run for my camera but bolted to get it.  When I returned it was in the same location but going straight up quickly. I got 2 shots, it moved faster and almost disappeared going straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran for my husband in the front yard  who was talking to a neighbor and we all saw it continue to go straight up.  It hovered higher up and started to send out large red beams in different directions for a few minutes and then it disappeared still going straight up.  My neighbor and I saw  a new object or the same one appear in a different location right over our heads and then it moved north and then straight up like the previous object.  It too sent out some red beams and then while ascending in a straight line up disappeared.<n>

I noted a particularly bright star in the n/e section of the sky above the harbor and the Strait of Georgia.  As I looked at it, it began to change color.  I assumed it to be caused by atmospheric conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw red and green lights flash, and I assumed it was an airplane probably about to turn about to head toward Vancouver Intl. airport.  But then I also saw blue and yellow moving lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that I thought it might be a UFO.  So I went to get binoculars and said to my partner, “I think I see a UFO in the sky”.  My partner said, “It’s probably a star.”  Then with the binocular I saw a small circle of flashing lights.  Again my partner said, “Ah, just a star”, as I continued watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights began moving quickly, and the source was moving about as well; it was obviously not an airplane or a star.  I noticed another possible same thing lower in the sky on the left, and 3 other ! possible shapes in a kind of triangular shape in the lower right side which my partner confirmed.  My main focus though was on the first object (?) that I saw.  Then the object grew in size, or appeared to, probably moving closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I called my partner to come and see, with binoculars.  Before he got there, the object suddenly became ovoid in shape and I realized that it was heading toward me.  Suddenly it stopped, and “flipped”, apparently on its side, showing the full surface of what was probably the top side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled at my partner to hurry up.  The side or top was almost perfectly circular but the top edge was slightly flattened, and the lights appeared to be on the outer edges.  However, the flashing moved across the surface in different ways, as in forming patterns.  The surface was covered with an irregular grid.  Visually, my partner and I both watching, the object now almost completely filled the visual field of our binoculars, which meant – we assumed- that it had come! much closer to us than originally.  After several minutes of w! atching the flashing lights moving about the surface, the object appeared to be moving backwards in a straight line to where it was before.  But it then began moving about in a display of aerial acrobatics and movements that nothing we know of could make in the air.  The movements were up/down, side to side, twirls, spirals, fast threads up or down or sideways or just about all over the place. Gradually, though, it settled back down and seemed to climb higher in the sky and become smaller to the sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then noticed the other lights below and on the sides had disappeared.  There was some thin cloud moving about in the atmosphere, but it was otherwise quite clear during the time we were watching this wonderful aerial show.  However, the “close up” was quite unsettling, especially in its implications as to size, etc. and in regard to the possible meaning of this sighting.  It appeared to us that it might somehow have known we were watching it!  Not that we can prove that, however, but when it flipped on its side for the full view, the hair on my neck stood up!<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a professional social scientist, I am a relatively trained observer, and somewhat used to seeing anomalous phenomena. Nonetheless this was an amazing event.<n>

The dog ran to the front of the house barking. Since the dog is usually very calm, I knew something was up so I followed him.  When I came around the corner I saw that he was barking at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up above the house next door and saw an orange fire ball that had sort of a ring around it and thought at first that it was the flame from a hot air balloon and wondered why it was flying at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a few minutes and the flame didn&#39;t shut down the way a balloon would but it remained stationary during that time and made no sound. I think it was about 500 feet north of where I was standing and maybe 1000 feet up so it wasn&#39;t a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> It then started moving to the east very slowly and when it got to be what I would guess to be about a mile or so away, it looked sort of like a burning cross in the sky.  At that point I saw a single flash of white light and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what this thing was,<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I can say is that I can&#39;t stop thinking about it.<n>

9/28/14 20:30|Jacksonville|FL|Unknown|30 minutes|Bright light on Hodes BLvd fast flying close not plane or helicopter.|10/3/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114049.html|43|ndxe201409| bright light on Hodes BLvd fast flying close not plane or helicopter<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving on JTB towards jax beach at 8:30 PM on 9.28.14 I saw a blue/red/pink/purple looking light going way up and down above the tree tops, in the area of beach blvd. At first I thought it was a helicopter. But the object moved so fast. It dove down and right back up and swirled around, way too fast and too bright to be a helicopter. It was not a plane either. I knew that from the start. It did not have the right shape or fly like one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned on to Hodges blvd I continued to watch this light rise and fall in the sky. It would go way up in the air maybe 100 or 1000 feet and then fall right back down fast and zoom back up.  When I made it to my home my family got in the car with me and we drove toward beach blvd to try to find what it was. As we turned onto Hodges again we saw the ball of light zooming around.  It flew over the Windsor realty office and when we got in the turn lane to get closer it flew above our vehicle, about 10 feet above us. And then we pulled into Cape House and it zoomed away from us. It seemed to hover 20 feet away and above from us. I took out my camera phone and tried to get a video but the quality is horrible. As I started to film it I felt like it was watching us. It was so weird and then my husband took my phone from me and tried to zoom in on it and lost the light in the image. Then it zoomed up over the cape house office building. So we drove into Cape House Apts. Trying to ! find where it had gone but we never saw it again. We drove around for about 20 minutes trying to find it again. Got home at 9:20 PM. So It ended at about 9:00 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought if it wasn’t government or alien then maybe someone had a gas powered flying toy that they modified with blue/red/pink lights. I don’t understand why no one else driving around noticed this thing and tried to find it too. It was so bright and flying so close and all over Hodges Blvd.  I want to say it was maybe a foot long of light but I couldn’t get a good view of it because of the bright light. It was so fast. I have no idea what it is. The lights did not blink. It was like a bright ball of light maybe a foot wide. NO sound. After the ball disappeared a Plane came by flying kind of low and we wondered if that was government coming to find out what it was too. Or maybe the plane had dropped a drone in that area. I&#39;m stumped. The light seemed clear but we couldn&#39;t tell what it was attached too couldn&#39;t see anything but the light.<n>

My father and I are typically looking up when we can for satellites, aircraft or celestial bodies.  My father was discussing flashing satellites and he spotted a strobe and pointed it out.  I&#39;m a bit of an aviation enthusiast and this did not fit into anything I could readily explain.  It was a strobe, but interval was just over slower.  I would say approaching 3 to 4 seconds.  A single xenon-like strobe (blu-ish) was all that was visible to us. My father and I both thought weather/observation balloon as it was coming from the North heading SSE.  Twelve to fifteen seconds after initial observation was when the path deviated.  It appeared to head to the East.  It turned out that this was a loop to the East and after approximately 360 degrees it slowed to near stationary for 3 or 4 flashes of the strobe and either started a slow descent or heading East again when we lost it.  My father went for his binoculars! at this time and I walked to the North along the road to a more open spot from atop a hill.  Neither my father or mother nor I saw it after that, though I spotted a faint orange meteorite (assumed) dispersing in the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my parents if they were messing with me as they&#39;d recently been in contact with a commercial pilot friend of mine who was into RC aircraft as I am.  They said no.  I thought it moved as if it could have been a radio-controlled quad-copter, but heard no motor whine at all.  If it were at a much higher altitude, I cannot fathom a civilian RC aircraft that had that rate of speed.  I don&#39;t know that a weather/observation balloon would make a loop as this did unless there is some wind phenomenon I&#39;m unaware of (which is possible.)  The last explanation I could think of was perhaps a night-skydiver wearing a strobe.  It would explain the loop and apparent stationary position afterward, but the strobe did not increase in intensity I would expect with the descent that would occur.  Also, the local municipal airport does not have skydiving and I saw no GA aircraft headed back to the airport or in sight at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It scared the hell out of me seeing the Orange light on the ground coming towards us. I am going to ask my husband for more detail because he has been watching for weeks. It starts at dark with red yellow and blue blinking lights in the sky.  They get scattered everywhere on the properties of where they are going to mess with people..  Then they turn into yellow , then red, then a bright orange, which means they are on the ground and coming towards us. It seems like the light is a bright flash light, but when he shines a light on them they just vanish, like they were never here. He says he got to se one up close and it was round! and three bright orange lights. Every now and then they drop some kind of white stuff, like fairie dust sort of stuff, not really sure how to explain,  this is getting really scary, makes me wonder if the neighbors have seen them too, we are going to finally talk to them tomorrow.<n>

The lights converged and became one light, then fading out more and more, with two lights appearing again.  Then two more lights descended rapidly on the same trajectory.  The lights became less bright as the first two lights had done.  My impression is that the objects were descending vertically, but then quickly transitioned to a horizontal flight path, and at a very high speed continued westward.

Where were you and what were you doing at the time? - We were taking a walk in a suburban neighborhood near our apartment, up Cottage St. to &#34;Clark Creek Park&#34; with our 4 year old &amp; 7 month old daughters around 6:00 PM. It was twilight but still very light out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  What made you first notice the object? - I don&#39;t know, I just looked up into the sky and saw the 1st one of the &#34;balloon-like&#34; clusters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  What did you think the object was when you first noticed it? - The objects looked like balloon clusters at first, descending down from the many wisps of clouds high overhead. Then it became apparent that instead they were some &#34;balloon-like&#34; cluster UFOs that we&#39;d studied about before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.  Describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - These were the infamous &#34;balloon-like&#34; clusters, as well as some single spheres that seemed to slowly move in paths. The 1st group had 3 separate sphere clusters, the 2nd group had 2 separate sphere clusters. Some groups had a red sphere within a cluster of apparently white spheres. We&#39;ve seen many photos, videos and have read about these &#34;balloon-like&#34; clusters before this event today. They would move along on slowly and then seem to stay in the same area for awhile at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5. Describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - We had no strange feelings, just excitement. We&#39;ve had different types of encounters numerous times, but have never witnessed these &#34;balloon-like&#34; clusters in person. We&#39;ve also never gotten any photos or video of any other incidents before this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6. How did you lose sight of the object? - We never really lost sight of the objects except when they eventually would rise above and beyond certain wisps of high clouds after awhile. We continued on to the public park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am emailing photos and a short video clip of the objects<n>

The object appeared to be  large and far away, but the witness is unsure just how big and how far away the craft was.  The witness  observes that it could be a few football fields in size about 10 miles away or could be 20 miles across, the witness had no way to tell for sure as the visibility was slightly hazy with city light pollution, no stars  were visible, it was not cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object hovered, but moved about a central area, bobbing and wobbling. The object appeared  triangle in shape due to flickering and flashing, multicolored star-like lights that followed no noticeable  timed intervals or which star-like light would flicker or flash.  There were also multicolored star-like  lights flashing around the object that did not appear to be attached to it..  The witness describes that  this looks very similar in behavior to one the witness had spotted multiple times but facing north,  intermittently over the previous six to eight months and much farther away from the observer.<n>

On Sunday morning, as the Orion Constellation was just getting into full swing in the southeast sky at or around 2:00-2:30 am, we noticed something. I had my iPhone with the pocket Universe app, so I can hold up the phone in the sky at night and go over the constellations with my kids.  If you don’t know all the constellations, this is a real handy app and if you do, well then, you are a real geek.  Anyway, as was panning around with my phone, I stopped and notice something in the northwest sky that caught my eye. It appeared to be two bright stars and I then asked my buddy what constellation they were a part of as I didn’t remember seeing them earlier.  That’s when he said, they aren’t stars…they are moving! I shut off the phone and we just stared in amazement as these 2 white lights moved sl! owing through the northern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they continued to move in a pattern (as if they were surveying  the area) one seemed to slow down and the other got to a place and stopped. The light went dimmer and dimmer (bubbling like) then just vanished. A short time later, the other did the same. There was also no sound during the whole event. I’ve been looking up the sky all my life and this is a first time I feel confident, we were seeing something that wasn’t from Earth.<n>

PD))|10/3/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113988.html|64|ndxe201409| Flashing Red Fire Object<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I looked out my bedroom window that faced the mountains in Eastvale, CA.  The past two nights we have been seeing a fireball like light object flashing in the sky.  We are currently watching it right now.  We have watched it come and go tonight and last night.  As I am typing this it is still currently in the sky.  We ran out at earlier in the night to get a better view, but by the time we ran outside it disappeared again.  This object is bright red.  It fades in and fades out.  It starts out as a pin sized red dot in the sky and then it grows big.  We watched it flash so bright it grew 10 times the size from the tiny dot and it gets brighter and more red when it has big flashes.  This is the second night that it has appeared in the sky.  There is no sound and it appears to be hovering.  It comes and goes every so often, but remains in the same exact position in the sky.  We were curious of the location of the flashing fire like object, so we! used my iPhone compass.  From my viewpoint in my bedroom the bright red flashing light that changes color is exactly 0 degrees North on my Compass.  Exactly.  It is very strange.  I have witness multiple orange fireballs by my home in the same area, but they normally rise up in the sky one by one and disappear in the horizon after about a minute.  This object just sits in the horizon flashing bight red, but changes size as well.  It looks like a bright red star on earth.  It disappears for an hour or two then reappears for about 20-30 minutes at a time.  As strange as this may sound.  It seems to know we are looking at it.  I wonder if anyone else has reported this object.  I felt the need to write this post considering its the second night in a row it has been hovering near my home.  I see a lot of strange things in the sky here in Eastvale, but I never saw this type of hovering red fir ball.<n>

The second object slowed approximately 20 seconds later, and also dimmed and turned northeast.  Both objects began a slow but steady acceleration.  They both continued to travel at an increasingly faster speed along the coastline.  By the time they were out of sight, they were travelling about 2 times the speed of a conventional plane at that altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Close grouping or one object - greyish with some dark red.  Shifted Circular to triangular shape<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 22:35 on Saturday, September 27, 2014 my son – who is 15 (a high-school student) and myself – I am 50 (an electrician by trade)- saw an odd object in the sky of South Brampton.  There is an airport nearby – Pearson International – and many planes fly in this vicinity day and night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen many interesting things above my house in the past few years.  I&#39;ve seen satellites fly over head; meteors, airplanes and unidentifiable object on occasion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one was most definitely a UFO.  From where; I have no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing in my driveway and looking at the sky – as I often do – and noticed a blurry object I thought might be a star.  As I continued looking; I was certain it was moving in my direction.  I watched for about 30 seconds and ran inside the house to tell my son and get my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son joined me outside and I pointed the object out to him.  It was now approaching us and nearing the overhead position.  We both looked at it with the binoculars.  Neither of us could clearly focus on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Either with the binoculars or naked eyes; the object looked blurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was rather dim – no bright lights.  The dim lights were impossible to focus clearly-on.  They were a dull grey colour and changed to a very dark, dim red on occasion.

It faded and was no longer visible as it – at the end of the observation – was heading West towards the town of Georgetown.<n>

My window faces the Hollywood Hills.  I am on the second floor and I can look over the rooftops of the building next to me with an unobstructed view of the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking out at the night lights and aerial comings and goings I noticed three red lights pop on in the night sky.  They didn’t enter in from one side of the window but rather popped on as if they either just showed up in that location or decided to turn on their lights.  If one was to try to pinpoint the location I would say the lights came on over the San Fernando Valley between Laurel Canyon and Van Nuys Blvd. The lights moved from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were a milky red color glowing color.  Red balls of light as I’ve heard many see through out the United States.  They stayed in a V formation and kept pace with each other with none of them pulling away from or falling behind the others and they all kept the same altitude.  They moved at a brisk pace and there was no sound as one would hear with a helicopter or plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted for about twenty seconds before it dawned on me what I was seeing.  I moved to a westerly facing window but the tree blocked my view and I did not see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having spent hours looking out this window for many years I know that these were not helicopters as the lights were not those of the numerous helicopters that I have seen at night, nor were they the lights of a low flying place as I could see sky between the red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best guess is that they were about half a mile away from my location and flying maybe 200 to 300 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have worked in the film industry for over 20 years, mainly in the field of visual effects, and I know of no technological set up that would let one pull this off over a densely populated area and just below the flight paths of Bob Hope and Van Nuys airport.  And to that point, having heard and seen everything from Lear jets to military and commercial aircraft to news and police helicopters I can without a doubt say that what I saw was nothing like anything I’ve seen in the sky.<n>

Orange glow center<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 22:15 at night, on Saturday, September 27, 2014, my daughter looked up in the sky while she was getting into our car.  Not high enough to be an airplane, but almost like at the height a model airplane would fly.  7 or 8 rounded rectangular shaped objects, with an orange glowing light at their center, were flying in a single line but staggered, formation.   The horizontal flight path was going north to south, from the very southernmost and easternmost part of Edmonds southbound—southbound along Shoreline, just west of Interstate 5—through Shoreline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were lit up with a big orange glow in the center.   We were thinking that maybe they were a cluster of drones or lanterns.  However, have never seen either in person so really unable to compare to anything. They didn’t make any distinguishing types of noises—like an airplane or helicopter… or any loud noise for that matter.  The noise I did hear, was a very soft, hum/whistle that maybe a sophisticated, high tech, model airplane--engineered specifically for low noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lost sight of them as they headed down past Shoreline.  By the time we called out a houseguest and my son to come witness these items, only two were visible for them to see as they were above Shoreline (central) along and above the I-5 corridor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is most likely what I saw--at night--but the shape of it is how it is depicted in this photo:http://www.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/AFAEED3C-749A-42C1-8E796C8B74E8C45B_article.jpg?8BC4B<n>

There was one light per object.  They kept coming up from the horizon from the east, flying upwards and west at various altitudes and not in any particular formation.  It was eerie because they dominated the sky.  It was very quiet.  This took place at Community Hospital North and was witnessed by one other person that I am aware of.  I estimate over the 15 minutes that I stood there observing that there were about 40-50 lights total that eventually flew off into the distance.<n>

We just stood there looking up at them as they passed by, I could see the clouds in between the 3 triangular &#34;ships&#34; but could not see the clouds through the &#34;ships&#34;.  It took a total of 2 to 3 minutes for them to pass. Than they just disappeared. My husband was in the 82nd airborne so I know what planes etc. look like from beneath at night, I have watched the night sky my entire life because I love stars, and have seen flares and fireworks in the sky many times, but never have I seen anything like this! .

We were approximately 100-150 yards away from the bridge where the Waterfire festival ends, near the pavilion next to the river that marks the place where the Gaspee was burned by RI colonists in the early 1770s.  I looked up and noticed a large commercial airliner flying overhead, perhaps approaching TF Green airport in Warwick which was flying fairly low, but that quickly disappeared over the bay and we continued on our walk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were walking north towards the bridge, a group of three younger guys were walking towards us and one said “What is that?  UFOs?”  The other guys laughed, but we turned our heads and saw 3 bright orange lights in the sky in a triangular pattern…approx 100-150m high (but could be higher…hard to tell).  They made no noise and as we watched another guy (older who was walking his dog) came along behind us and saw we were looking at something and looked up and said something like “What the heck is that?”  We said we had no idea.  Slowly, the color faded from bright orange, almost flamelike to white and the first two dots continued down the river towards the harbor/Narraganset Bay while one stayed suspended for a minute or to (I took a quick video with my iPhone of that one) and then it slowly faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to blame the appearance on Waterfire, thinking that perhaps they were large embers suspended in the sky but there was no major breeze that would blow these downriver 100-150 yards and they all turned white at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally the one light in the sky faded out and we turned and walked away. This was the 3rd UFO I’ve seen in my life BTW….but was very strange as it was seen in such a cosmopolitan area, by so many people (the young college aged guys, the dog walker and us), but we were literally only 300-450 feet away from hundreds, perhaps thousands of people.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In fact I am more inclined to believe that what I saw was probably a secret American aircraft.  This is what I saw:  On Saturday, September 27, 2014, at around 8:50pm, I saw two circular red lights moving slowly in the sky of Martinsburg, West Virginia.  The lights were far enough apart, and were moving slowly enough to lead me to believe they belonged to an aircraft preparing to land.  There is a military air base around here, so I was accustomed to seeing slow-moving aircraft move in in this fashion.  However, I did think it a bit odd that a) I did not actually see the plane, which I should have seen at the distance (the objects were not very high, and practically over my head); and b) I did not hear the drone of the engine.  As I watched the lights slowly approach I expected to hear the drone of the engines at a! ny minute.  Instead suddenly the lights dimmed, one at a time, and then disappeared; and in their place I saw what looked like two stars twinkle brightly, and then it was over.  There was something very strange about how the red lights suddenly became stars that blended into the night.  In fact, I could have sworn that one of the red lights put some quick distance between itself and the other just as they switched from red lights to twinkling stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These are exactly like the ones that have been reported in different parts of the world. We witnessed these lights on Barker Cypress Rd located in Houston TX 77084. We are in shock.  There were originally 3 lights in an L formation then after 20 seconds about 20 orange lights appeared.  They were in the sky moving for about 2 minutes then they just completely disappeared.  These Lights were large. We were and are in shock. The whole process took about 4 minutes.  We stopped the car at the edge of the street and tried to take photos but our phones would not capture them. We are perplexed by these orange lights.  They cannot be planes since they were silent and completely disappeared plus the huge number just would not make sense. I hope this is helpful with any studies or anything in particular. The unknown is quite frightening but awfully interesting. We have! 1 blurry image.<n>

This same evening, the sunset an hour before and the rays of light were coming from the east rather than the west with the setting sun.  In addition, an arc of light was across the whole sky like a rainbow earlier in the evening.  The objects appeared to move closer and then would disappear only for more to reappear.  They also moved into what looked like formations and would then disperse.  By seeing them firsthand they were bright orange and red but in video or pictures that were taken, they are all white/gray.  The still photos of the images when zoomed in on appear to be some type of spacecraft. The sky was clear with no clouds.  It was quiet and they did not omit any noise. Police called but arrived after observation and objects had disappeared.  Not visible from other areas of the surrounding community.<n>

What we saw was 6 orange lights in the northern part of the sky.  These objects moved slowly toward the east.  As we observed them a 7th light appeared from the south moving north an hovering just above us.  This light changed color from reds to orange, and both at once. It appeared to be watching the other lights.  As the other lights moved eastward and became obscured by a tree line, the 7th seemed to slowly fade out.  This hovering light was different from the rest it was more like an oval then a sphere.  All said and done we witnessed this event for 4-5 min.  Bazzar!<n>

Two sets of three were in v formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark and I was on my way home from work and driving on a busy road through a residential area when I saw off to my right ahead of me there were a number of large round mustard-yellow lights (approximately 10 to 15) in the sky that were simply hovering and not going anywhere.  Each one appeared to have one round yellow light (without a beam) that I could see, and I could not hear any sound. Two sets of three lights were in a “V” formation.  I saw the two “V” formations slightly move once for each of them.  The two “V” formations were parallel and the others were spaced around and between them in a general congregated area.  These lights were not like airplane lights.  The lights stayed consistent without any flashing, blinking, color change, beam or any change at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights appeared larger than the lights we normally see in the sky on regular airplanes and jets when flying at the same level.  These lights were not at a high altitude, but not close enough to see other details in the dark.  This sighting was over a busy, small city and I could not tell if they were positioned over the business or residential district.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see any other aircraft in the sky at that location. It was not raining and there was nothing obstructing my vision until they were hidden by trees as I passed by in my car.   I do not have a camera phone so I was not able to take pictures.<n>

It mostly resembles a police with it lights on.  The objects are stationary and visible for hours.  These have been witnessed by myself and my girlfriend on several occasions now.  I also was telling a family member about them a night prior while in Byron MN and we were able to find one in the sky at that location as well.  The flashing colors and stationary position are obvious.  There are lots of aircraft that pass where I live due to MPLS international Airport being close.  I first noticed one about 2 weeks ago and as I grew more sky aware and curiousity have observed up to 4 at one time over the different nights.  There is currently one to the north of my location as I type it. It is why I&#39;m reaching out.  I found a video on youtube of a news casts that describes these similar objects as well.

(+/- 2 minutes) while viewing the south east skies (primarily more to the east vs. south) I noticed an orange orb under the star Regulus.   It appeared to travel straight down from Regulus to almost my viewing horizon and then travel south or distally away from my vantage point.  The orange orb continued on this path until finally dipping below my horizon and out of sight. I was able to apply both my 4x30 and 10x50 binoculars to the object.  This did not reveal any detail to enhance my description of the orb.  I played my Starry Night software and did not notice any satellites traveling in this pattern during this time period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is I am a beginner star watcher with over a year sky watching experience.  I own a 4 x 30 and 10 x 50 range binoculars and a 100mm Orion tabletop telescope with the ability of 80x magnification at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Thought it was in the back so i went to look because that is where the  noises were coming from.  Then in the front, went to go look..  Then from the west, thought it might be my neighbor, then back towards the front and a little from the east.  Well as clueless as i was.. I went outside to experience some very loud off and on crackling boom type sounds almost like thunder or fireworks but nothing of the sort in the area.  At 5:30am? in central Minnesota.. and where I am nothing but roaming tiny hills, trees, grass etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after about a half hour of listening to these sounds from all directions (neighbors were up wondering too) I went online to search and find something about it.  Nothing from anywhere about anything.  The noises lasted till about 9am then slowed and eventually stopped. I continued to search Google for hours to find nothing still. 3:20pm now and I came across this page, figured I&#39;d post this and see what others think or if they could determine what the hell that was?!!!   Thanks in advance Nothing was seen, only heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Skies clear, no Airports near, no storms near, no fireworks or any reason to have any(didn&#39;t sound like them though), sky looked normal as usual.

It was a bright ball of white light coming from the north.  It slowly banked to the east and went over the tree tops and out of site.  I&#39;m not sure how high it was or the exact size. Its a ball of light thats the same which ever side you see.  It has no flashing lights like an aircraft would have. Also this summer in July around 2300 I saw the same type of light at about the same height. This one was moving west to east at the same slow speed. On this occasion I had a witness with me that also saw the light. I did not hear any sound from the objects on either occasion.<n>

At one point the front orbed moved to the back and the other two starting swaying up and down right next to it in the same pattern.  Before they disappeared they started shuffling from positions to positions and and then traveled higher in the sky. Now I understand the airport is right next to the installation and planes are constantly flying around the area, but there wasn&#39;t no blinking FAA lights to them which military jets also have.  Being a recruit training site there is no UAV operations being conducted there and no 3 pilots whether UAV or manned can pilot the way these orbs were traveling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was always a skeptic until this morning and I seriously apologize to all those that believed before me.<n>

Thought this was odd, looked at few other stars in the sky, they were all significantly less bright and unremarkably twinkly.  This woke me up more and and i watched the object in question for 20-30 more minutes hoping it would go back to looking like the rest of the stars or start moving like a plane or a satellite.  No change in the objects location occurred during this time but the light grew much stronger and seemed to sparkle like brilliant white light from far away refracting through a crystal.  Thought i saw distinction between blue and red light so i continued to watch the object hoping, again, it would display behavior like an airplane or something familiar.  At one point the light became so brilliant i was positive this was not like any star i have ever seen.  The twinkling/flickering seemed to fluctuate at a constant  rate, like something mechanical. To give you an idea, if the brightest stars and lights from nearby jets in the sky amounted to a pea, this object&#39;s light at its brightest moment would comparable be that of an apple. Light faded and is now gone from the spot in the sky, even when no visible cloud cover is overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

She&#39;s on a leash so I had to walk and walk. And I looked out to the street about 400 feet away and saw a flashing light over the road. And it caught my eye because it was pretty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a round green object, sorta disk-like hovering about the height of the street lights. It had red flashing lights. Many of them. There were several and they each flashed one after the other all around the disk. Then it went to only 2 red lights but still a green disk-like hovering object. It went many feet down the strip of the road and came back. It went up and down the road and stayed at the height of the street lamps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object would occasionally bob higher and lower but stayed relatively the same height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had no one to tell so I called my mother and she told me to get inside immediately and questioned why I had been watching it for a whole hour. I turned around to head inside and heard what sounded like a very short length tornado siren only a few seconds long. It stopped and as I jumped around to see what that was the object came my direction and then went back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It only came my direction a few seconds before deciding to stay where it was already at.  I continued heading inside when it went the opposite direction it was originally going and toward my apartment complex leading office.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it came this way it made a sound like a plane and helicopter engine combo. I booked it inside. It went behind the leasing office and disappeared but I could still hear that sound. My mom has seen a ufo so she advised me not to play around with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported another ufo back in July that I got no responses on.  I am curious about them, but I have enough respect/terror of them that I keep plenty distance.  I went inside on my deck to look from a safe distance and that was the end of it.<n>

Looked up on this clear, star-filled night to notice what I first thought was a star or a plane in the north sky, but it was a &#34;cluster&#34; of multi-colored flashing lights; not moving.  When looking around the sky, I noticed 5 more of these identical flashing clusters, not moving.  They are at about the same height in the sky, and form a very large circle across the sky. Two more such objects are flying quickly across the sky.  I got my camera with a 500mm lens, and captured the 6 lights, kind of in the shape of a stealth fighter.  I called my friend, who lives a few miles away, and asked him to go outside and look at the sky, and he readily spotted both the still objects, as well as the rapid-flying ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I love sky watching, and have NEVER seen anything like this.

Over the tree line, in the direction of Plum High School, we saw two bright orange lights moving along the tree line -- one following the other.  My wife wondered if they were planes or jetliners, and I thought they were two close together.  Just then, two more orange lights appeared behind the first two but they were in a different pattern, not following one another but stacked.  It should be noted there was no sound, and a smooth motion as they moved across the tree line and eventually faded away.  Maybe a meteor breaking up? It was weird!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

My friend was the first to notice it and when I first seen it, I thought it was a small plane or helicopter. I was mistaken!! When looking at the object through binoculars it was very clear to me that the triangle shaped object was no plane or helicopter.  It had lights flashing around in different colors almost like a disco ball would. It stayed in the same general area but moved it quick random movements (front2back, zig zagging, left2right). I am a huge skeptic when it comes to ufo and what have you but this incident really has me thinking twice.... should we be scared??<n>

It seemed to remain in the same place the whole time it was sighted.  When I went to recheck its status at 22:45, it was gone.<n>

While I stood watching it I noticed that it would move slowly up then down, stop, then move left to right slowly stopping again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood out there for about 15 mins till&#39; I asked my mother to come out &amp; watch it.  She agreed that it was unusual then went back inside.  When 30+ mins had past from when I first noticed the light, &amp; still continuing to do the same movements I called the Medina Police Dept.  About 15 mins later &amp; missing my driveway about 3-4 times the officer pulled up, by then the light had moved below the tree line so he was unable to see it.  He took my report, said it was probably someone&#39;s drone then went on his way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A week or so after I saw a similar light in the back yard, but since I didn&#39;t post asking if anyone else in Medina was witnessing the same thing I don&#39;t have a date &amp; time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t contact the police dept the second time after seeing how they pretty much took it as a joke the first time.

It was a cool and clear night. I was star gazing.Caught a shooting star! About 8:25pm ,looking towards the west . I notice a very bright red light! It got closer, than notice the second red light than a third but not that bright. When all three was close enough . I see that the third object was in fact an airplane with its strobe lights flickering and the red and green lights blinking on and off. But the first two  objects were very bright red,no strobe lights or the red and green lights on wings, no sounds neither ! When I started to say to my co-worker what I&#39;m seeing, she started to point out the red objects to me! We stared at it ,trying to figure out what it is ! No sounds from it! Yet ! We see the plane miles  behind it ! We can see the different from the object  to the plane. There were lots of traffic of planes between Philadelphia and McGuire AFB.The red lights were heading toward McGuire area ! .I was raised in the military .Lived next to McGuire and Fort Dix! Seen all kinds of planes flying day or night and even at times knowing what sounds coming from what planes.I need to say and report this sighting ! Lots of my co-workers saw as a did! One co-worker trying explain that it was a chinese lanterns ! Not ! I know the different ! Lanterns are not that bright nor do they move as fast as a plane  .As I stated that the third object was a plane miles behind the bright red light ! Never caught up with the red lights! Than both lights faded not turned off but faded !<n>

I stopped to look, as I could see it farther away, not directly overhead, and it seemed about 1/2 the way between the horizon and the top of the sky.  Then I saw 2 other round lights moving ahead of this one, toward the southern sky.  All 3 were coming higher up from the northeast direction and down toward the south. There was no sound or noise coming from them.  The movement was not fast like a meteor or shooting star, it was more like 1/2 the speed of a low-lying propellor plane, the speed was steady with no stopping that I could see.  I knew it was not an airplane, since a local airport is several miles away, and I am used to seeing small planes flying low, and am familiar with the lights on such planes seen at night.  And the orange light did not dissipate, it seemed to keep its form.  Actually, these 3 orange lights were not f! lat, they seemed to have a dense or 3-dimentional form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a professional in the health field with 45 years experience, have children and grandchildren out of state.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I stopped to look and saw 2 more of the same in the sky further to the south through some of my trees, but farther away than the trees.  They were all traveling from northeast to south in the sky, from where I was looking. It seemed they were 1/2 way between the horizon and the top of the sky. The speed was not fast like a meteor or shooting star, but more like 1/2 the speed of a small propellor plane flying low. I live a few miles from a local airport and am familiar with low flying planes at night and their lights -- what I saw was not that. The orange lights looked to be about the size of 1/2 of a plane. There was no noise or sound emanating from them. They seemed to have a denseness or 3-dimensional form to them, with one side a bit irregularly shaped. They kept moving steadily without stopping, without speeding up/slowing dow! n. It is a clear night with stars much further up in the sky than the orange-lighted objects I saw.

They were parallel and in a fixed position.   Tonight at about 8:00 p.m. we noticed an object on the western but slightly more northern position along the horizon looking from east wenatchee towards highway 2.  The object is fixed and visible with the naked eye.  It is blinking red, green, blue, yellow and orange and resembles the light emitted from a welder regarding intensity.  We viewed it through both binocs and our telescope and we&#39;re able to observe its triangular shape.  It looked like Christmas tree lights hanging out in mid-air.  Did not appear to move which is highly unusual for any object in the sky, aside from stars of course, and it appeared to be well within our atmosphere.  It lasted until about 10:15 p.m.. As our family was observing it, my wife said that she also observed something last year in the middle of the night, but was too frightened to talk abou! t it at the time.  She said that she was awakened by a powerful low frequency humming sound directly over the top of our house.  It lasted about 8-10 seconds then just disappeared.  She said it was definitely not a plane.<n>

The crafts would change colors from red, blue and white and the light colors where not normal.  The lights did not blink light air planes.  It had one area of light.  The one craft stayed in are area and the other went down towards my house out of sight. We watched the one hover in the sky till it dropped be low the tree line out of sight. I thought the show was over so we went home. When we got home I went out back to see if the  other one was there and it was in the sky right across from me. It was sitting there hovering not moving at all. I got a picture of it. It was there for hours  hardly moved. It look like it w! as watching or collecting data. I went to bed at midnight it was still there. When I got up I look and it was gone. I been looking at the sky for them and I can see one up very high. It looks like a star flickering but if you look closer you will see it is flicking red, blue and white. I would like to know if it is from here or another world?<n>

I looked out the window and saw several brilliant red lights moving from North to South.  The lights were much brighter than the airliner lights on planes coming into Sea Tac airport. There were a few airliners in the same airspace so I could compare. I left the garage, watching the lights; and as I got a larger view, I could see it was a parade of these things as far as I could see from North to south. I went to the back door of my house and called out my wife. We both stood on our back deck watching this long parade pass by. We looked through 10X binoculars and both agreed there was no sign of an aircraft we could identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DESCRIPTION: Bright red orbs emitting continuous mildly pulsating light. A well defined pale pinkish or white cylindrical shape, which did not pulsate, and was attached beneath the orb. On some of them the cylindrical shape was moving around, like a camera lens on a swivel mount. There was no sound. The &#34;flock&#34; of orbs moved similar to the parade of crows that flies North to South or South to North here--random, linear, fluid. These things had to be moving several hundred mph because it did not take them long to make the journey across the airspace. The sky was clear. Altitude was difficult to tell but had to be over 4000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to get a video camera but the last of them disappeared behind the trees and did not emerge again. We have not seen or heard anything on the news about them--which is wierd.<n>

Thats when i noticed 3 others a big dark yellow light that moved a small white light and a small orange light above they seemed to stay in certain areas and didn&#39;t leave those spots. The orange one seemed like it dropped something from behind i saw a bright flash and a second later a big bang.  The small white one vanished completely and the orange one moved straight above me while the white one continued to observe me at a distance i tried to signal it to come closer but it moved away a bit and came back and then another white light came into view and was moving around. After about an hour and half of watching them my brother came out and we heard some kind of creature roar/growl at us and it sounded huge we could hear it walking and branches snapping it moved around a lot and it roared again. It sounde! d like it was calling someone and in the distance we heard another one. After that last roar we ran inside because it was close very close and i attempted to take a picture of the mimicking light and my phone went crazy the light started turning on and off the clolor schemes on the camera started changing really fast and then the creature roared again and i got scared and ran inside turned off the lights and locked the door and it vanished the lights didn&#39;t though they continued to observe my house and my neighbors.<n>

Red and blue lights appeared on the top of the object, which randomly went off and on. On the bottom of the structure were blue lights, alternating to yellow lights.  From vantage point, object looked to be cylinder in shape about 80&#39; tall at one end, and 40&#39; tall at the other end.  Shape of the object was deduced from the illumination of the lights. Object remained hovered over Mesa Verde for approximately two hours in duration.  First spotted at 1:30 a.m.  Sky was filled with stars, but object appeared large and brightly lit in photo taken.<n>

It moved  just a few seconds across the sky and then descended quickly straight  toward the ground behind trees, which put it out of our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance, we thought it was a huge falling star, but then it became clear that it was far too large for be a  falling star, too bright and a different color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither has us have ever seen any  a light in the sky the same color of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When first spotted, it was moving very fast, then seemed to fall to ground at a slower speed.

I thought it was an airplane because of the formation they were in but all three moved back and forth in a serpentine manner, and it was a constant glow.  They went completely across my field of view in a matter of minutes.  When they were overhead I could distinctively see the orange V that looked like lights on the bottom of a triangle shape ship. After they were no longer visible I went inside to tell my friends. About 10-15 minutes later I went back out to see a military helicopter (flashing lights as apposed to the solid orange) flying the same area I last saw the UFO&#39;s. Since there is a base at Fort Riley helicopters are common but I&#39;ve never seen them behave like this.<n>

The light then stopped and hovered for a moment and then started ascending.  We followed the source of the light and saw it begin to make erratic movements in the sky.  We turned around onto another street going the opposite way, and the object turned around and came towards us and was closer to the ground at this point.  When I saw it pass over us it was a large triangle, with blinking lights on each point of the triangle.  It then shot off into the sky in an instant with no warning.  This is my third UFO sighting and all have been in Southampton.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were still in OK when we saw a white ball hanging in the sky.  The sun was setting and the round object never moved. We drove on at 70+ mph, and ended up stopping twice, about 30 min. apart, to observe it with binoculars and take pictures. As the sun went away, the object turned orange and then grey against the night sky, but always seemed to be the same distance away from us.  It was not riding the air currents or moving in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was 1 bright light in the front centre and a bright white light either side to the rear.  There were no other lights, ie: no green or red lights like a plane would have.  I went outside to the back of the building within a few seconds, so I could check it out further, but it had completely vanished.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every night for the last two weeks we have had some very strange lights in the sky.  They look somewhat like stars, but they were twinkling waaaaay too brightly.  I walked out of my house in Mimbres New Mexico around 830pm on the night of the 25th of September.  We had just had a good rain and the clouds had cleared off.  I looked up and saw at first 5 extremely bright and twinkling stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my eyes adjusted I noticed there were more like 30 or 40 of these lights strewn about all the way from the east side of my house through the south and to the east.  I went inside and got my wife to make sure I wasn’t just seeing things and I also grabbed a pair of Leupold 10x40 binoculars.  I looked at the closest “star” with the binos and saw that there was no way these things were stars.  They have extremely bright red, green, white, and blue lights that orbit around them at very high rate of speed.  The orbital pattern of the lights looks like the way an atom is portrayed.  The lights seem to rotate around the bright light at different angles, giving it the appearance that they  “twinkling” like stars but they are much too bright and the twinkling is much too obvious to be stars.  I didn’t tell anyone because I was trying to rationalize this in my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the following Saturday one of my neighbors approached and asked if we had seen the lights.  We confirmed the sightings to him.  We then proceeded to do a “group watch” of these lights over the next few nights.  Note that I took the position of the formation that was the most obvious in the sky on the first night so that I could rule out any type of atmospheric phenomena.  The objects were not in the same place the next night at the same time.  They had moved to completely different locations but were still there.  They are around every night but there are fewer each night.  We peaked around 50 objects.  They stay stationary wherever they are posted as you can actually watch the big dipper move past them.  They are NOT celestial objects.   I do not have any type of camera equipment that would capture them on a pic or video unfortunately.<n>

Three appeared over the Centennial Hills area, then a pair near Nellis AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last week they lasted long enough to be considered flares but tonight&#39;s lights flashed &amp; died out in seconds, seemingly more brilliant.  Flares that short-lived would be pretty useless, so I am left wondering what these could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only caught this glimpse tonight because I was out having a cigarette, I didn&#39;t even have time to run inside for my camera before it ended.  As before, no obvious aircraft were near the lights.<n>

He was speaking to his friend who was standing next to him and when I looked over they were both looking up in the air pointing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where I was standing the trees were blocking by view so I quickly ran over and as soon as I could see the sky, I was blown away, as I initially saw a formation of aircraft moving through the sky; there were approximately 6-7.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked further to the right and saw a second formation in the sky of 6-8 more.  They seemed to temporarily hover in the air and then continue to move sideways through the sky in formation.  They all looked just like a solid bright light and what caught everyone&#39;s attention is that they were all flying so close together, or at least closer than an normal aircraft would fly together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, they appeared to be far higher in the air than I had ever seen any aircraft in my life, and that includes my time in the military and and as a civilian.  I have never seen even military aircraft moving in that type of formation.  They were extremely high in the air.  Higher than I believed normal aircraft could fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two aircraft that were not flying within the formations and were larger and brighter than the others in formations and it was amazing because they would be moving in one direction and then instantly change direction at like 45 degree angles unlike anything I had ever seen and s movement normal aircraft is not capable of doing.  It was not a turn it was an instantaneous pivot in the sky.  Those two appeared to be able to fly more freely but also seemed to be guiding the formations almost like how one man marches a formation of soldiers; he is not part of the formation but he is giving the orders on how they move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then there was one other aircraft that was flying out of both the formations, and was also brighter and bigger than the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I ran over to my house to inform my wife to get me the number for the local press and for the local police (who referred me to your call center).  While she did that I pulled out my ipod and began recording their movements through the sky and narrating the entire experience.  As I looked up I noticed three aircraft that were not in the formations could no longer be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back to the two guys who were still there watching.  They explained that the three big and bright aircraft had all disappeared.  They said that two of them had shot up into the air making an X and then disappeared into the sky.  They said the third one simply moved upward quickly and then disappeared as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I again went back over to my house and by at this time I could no longer see any of the aircraft.  Then entire incident took what looked like directly over the Reno Airport.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I did did not know whether to be amazed or scared as I am not sure what they were doing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I do not wish to include my video recording of the event due to the sensitivity of the content.<n>

Looking closer at the object it was stand still in the air, with 3 bright lights in an upside down triangle fashion.  We stood there looking for about 20 minutes until driving to a gas station.  When we arrived it had moved from a north postition to a northwest position, still standstill.  We noticed around sunset the three white lights turned orange almost instantly.  After about 30 to 40 minutes of seeing it we looked up again and it was gone in an instant.  No stars in the night sky came even close to how bright this object was during daylight hours<n>

The cylinder appeared to be the larger than the airplane but had no wings.  It traveled behind a small grove of pine trees, I went to the other side of the trees to get a picture and it had vanished.  It was a beautiful clear day outside not a cloud in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my husband to tell him about it and while I was on the phone with him another one of these crafts appeared in the sky traveling in the same direction.  I managed to get a photo of it, along with video footage of some of the others that followed.  In total there were about 9 different UFOs, all similar in size and shape and color, traveling in the same direction. They would seem to appear out of nowhere and then travel northwest before vanishing in the sky after about a minute or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started to get dark outside and while I was on my way into the house I saw a very bright and large flash of intense light to the north, just behind and above the grove of pine trees.  I felt strange afterward, dizzy like my sense of balance had been disturbed.<n>

Tbought of these to be ufo since I have seen them before.  When I had looked behind me down the road in the sky was a huge bright glow.  It slowly flew towards me to eventually fly slowly over my next door neighor roof next to me.  My back deck is almost level to their roof. This object was a triangular shape with white bright lights around the shape on the bottom of it. It was silver also and absolutely breathe taking.  It flew off silently to disappear into the sky. I went to get my fiance and the light had started again from the original point.  Again it flew by and he then saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever since then ever night I go out to smoke a cigarette I see this ship. It always come out of nowhere.<n>

PD))|10/3/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113957.html|188|ndxe201409| Four Illusive  grayish transparent lights bouncing in patterns around each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked outside  around 7:47 (PM), I saw my neighbors pointing at the sky above my house.  There were four lights in the sky.  They didn’t have form or a craft shape.  It certainly was not flares or lanterns.  The lights bounced back and forth meeting each other in the center than bounced back away from each other at times they moved in a semi circle went back away and bounced to the center almost meeting each other. They stayed the same distance in the sky the duration, about the height of a landing airplane. I am so happy there were other witness’s! I don’t have a video camera I tried FaceTime to my daughter to see if she could also verify seeing them but she couldn’t see it through my I Phone camera. I kept wondering if it was some sort of spotlight or human device but I could not trace anything from the ground that appeared to be shining light towards the sky or any light source. I continued to go outside to see if it stopped, the event happened for over an hour stopping around 8:56 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At times, the lights would slightly separate and turn into two lights each but there was no pattern or count to it. Because only two would separate at a time and turn into two lights then back to one and bounce again towards the center- at times slightly traveling in a circle turning back and then bouncing in the center but the pattern was random. I did not feel fear; more mesmerized wondering what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most irritating thing about it was to have no way to record it. Moreover, my Nikon doesn’t have a night vision.  I am familiar with astronomy, aircrafts, satellites, etc it was nothing I could explain. I actually worried it could be orbs that are spotted before an earthquake or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think many would term it ghosts, because it was not a bright light it was more cloudy (transparent) grayish looking.  The circles of light were not perfect in shape were round but not exact in size in relation to one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continue to try to find a logical explanation for the lights, I cannot find one. I watched the sky last night September 26, 2014 to see if it happened again (they didn’t come back last night), and will continue to watch nightly to see if it comes back. I drew diagrams of how the mystery lights traveled but am sad to report I don’t have a picture or video to prove it.  I DID take notes on the event in my journal.  They were unidentifiable flying lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  PD))<n>

I occasionally look out at stars or sight see for anything interesting.  I have seen many shooting stars, your occasional moon events.  I especially see air crafts coming in due to a nearby airport and airfields.  I have never, however, seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew noticeably close to the ground and had no noise coming from it.  It had a chevron shape, but was more obtuse and had nothing on the back to signify any rockets or propellers.  The overall size itself was not commercial at all. More privatized or military issued.  The craft had no visible detail to it besides the red lights on the edges from the bottom (Est. about 11 in all), perhaps due to the absence of moonlight and few streetlights. It did not have much speed either.  It looked more like it was gliding or just floating through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event was very short, but caught my attention and encouraged me to investigate. I found a post that almost exactly resembled it in the same area during sunset in 2011.  After reading it, I knew I was not imaging things and this same craft has made a second trip.<n>

Noticed 2 red lights in distance. Thought they were the tops of the wind generators in distance. They must have been a little different because they caught my attention.  My sister also saw them once I pointed them out. As they got closer a small green light was rotating around them, as they got closer the green light was brighter and spinning fast enough to leave a circle trace around the red light. I thought they were propellers spinning.  They were 50 - 100 feet up heading west. When they were almost over us I recognized a smoky haze inside of the circles they remained next to each other and could have been part of the same object.  I would approximate them at 10 - 20 feet in diameter green part and 1 foot or less diameter for the red portion in the middle. My sister saw blinking square red lights inside the red circles. It passed right over us and we could not track it because we were traveling 75 miles an h! our the opposite direction. It appeared to travel slow over us, but I could not gage because of the darkness.<n>

I love looking at the sky at night.  I saw something moving across the sky, going west, at maybe 1500 to 2000 feet above tree level. It was oval shaped, and it was a glowing red color.  It moved in a smooth fashion, straight, and there was no sound at all. I yelled for my wife and son who came out and saw it, as well.  We watched it for about a minute before we couldn&#39;t see it anymore due to trees and buildings. I don&#39;t drink, don&#39;t do drugs, and I&#39;ve never seen anything like that before.<n>

The only problem with this object is I could not see wings it was oval shaped with 4 lights on top, and a non pulsating red light on the bottom.  I only noticed the object for about 1 minute before it appeared to disappear in front of my eyes.  My wife called me to ask if I saw the light.  I was very surprised because my wife is very skeptical, and she described the same object, but she saw it for about 3 minutes, she described it disappearing as well before I told her what I saw.  I am just curious if anyone else noticed this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I got closer the light increased in intensity.  Due to the low altitude I figured it had to be a police helicopter so I slowed down.  As I drove under it it was banking to the east towards the tree line of the bluffs.  What I briefly saw in about 3 seconds was a rectangular shaped object moving slowly with no apparent sound.  The size was like holding a envelope at arm&#39;s length.  Would estimate height at less than 300 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was huge!  When it banked, the bright lights I first saw faded, and I could make out some faint but sharp led type of lighting on the perimeters and within object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned around a sped south to see if I could spot it where the bluff are lower to east but had no luck.

But then it moved away at least 2km and came back rather rapidly and finally sped away at least 600kts so that couldn&#39;t have been the case.  Also it was totally silent but maybe it made a sort of hissing noise at the point when it was closest to me (maybe it was like 400 meters away at that time).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Other witness looked up and asked what are those?  Caught my attention and we began conversing.  Didnt look like planes. My  Dad was a pilot, so very familiar with identifying specific aircraft in sky at many altitudes.  Had witnessed the same days before, just one craft...  But figured light was playing some sort of optical illusion.  They were flying at a normal aircraft speed it seemed, but dissapeared into sky quicker than a normal aircraft would.<n>

A massive span of light coming up out of Anahola mountain caught my eye.  I have a large picture window in my bedroom that looks north towards Anahola mountain.  I kept looking at this light coming out of the mountain trying to figure out what it was and what might be causing it.  It was probably 2 miles across the ridge line and about a half a mile high. There are no roads leading to or on the mountain and no cities or towns on or around the mountain and no houses on the mountain. I left my bedroom and went into the bathroom and looked out of the large picture windows towards the mountain. The light was still there. After brushing my teeth I went into the living room and looked out of the window from there. The light seemed to be kind of growing and dimming. I also noticed a flashing of &#34;balls&#34; or &#34;cluster&#34; of electrical light further west on the mountain about a mile from the original light.  The flashing electric light was eradic and moved all over the face of the west end of the mountain and then disapeared or stopped.When I looked back at the original mass of light it was no longer there. The view out the windows had become normal darkness with stars visable. I continued on with my normal routine of getting ready for work.<n>

However, last night I was in my backyard when I happened to look up in the clear sky at the exact moment an unidentified flying object with a red light and a white light (may have had another light, but I know I saw a distinct red) darted a short ways across the sky, only to disappear into thin air. It was too low to be a sattelite, WAY too fast to be an airplane (VERY fast), and COMPLETELY silent. Living in the country, I&#39;ve seen hundreds of shooting stars, and this was absolutely NOT a shooting star. It was low enough for me to make out a vague outline of the craft. Unfortunately it happened so fast it&#39;s hard to say exactly what shape it was.

The whole thing took between 3 and 6 seconds, I think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched, and within a few seconds, saw another one pop out from behind the tree.

I opened the door got out to look and nothing, gone, no sounds or anything.   Ok, I know it was NOT a helicopter, they don&#39;t normally climb to commercial jet altitude, which is about where this was, say about 30-35,000 feet.  It wasn&#39;t a reflection off the windshield, I tried to recreate it just in case and couldn&#39;t.  It wasn&#39;t a commercial jet, I see those all the time, it wasn&#39;t a satellite, I see them too.  I cant explain what that was.

Jefferson St, in Princeton, Ky., my daughter and I noticed 2 somewhat small, but extremely! bright, objects move into view from over us, and then ahead, at fast speed.  They were approximately 150-175 feet in elevation.  They were both bright white lights, with smaller red lights flashing at their rear (attached).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought of gas powered RC helicopters; as I used to know and enthusiast.  But then I realized they were faster and higher than I remembered seeing his fly.  And as they continued on in front of us, one just disappeared into thin air.  The other continued for over 1/2 mile, and that too wasn&#39;t what I remember compatible to the range of a RC air vehicle being from the operator.  When the second one got several blocks ahead of us, it also vanished.  (The total distance traveled by the second object, from first sight to last, was well over 1 1/4 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both objects stayed on a straight West to East course (my guess by the street we were headed toward being one that runs to the North).  Neither object was ever obscured by buildings or trees, and neither just fell from the sky.<n>

Everyone else stayed in the house looking out the open window.  By the time we got outside there were only four left in the sky that we could see. The three lighter ones formed a large triangle.  They looked like they were moving but remained in the same place in the sky the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The largest one was very bright and appeared to be moving fast, toward the triangle of lighter ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued like this for approximately 20 minutes, until the lighter ones just disappeared and the brighter one went behind the tree line and we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took several pictures and a video of the object&#39;s.

When we were at around Winton Churchill Blvd and Steeles Ave, I noticed in the sky what I thought was a comet or something similar.  It looked like a plane contrail except it was heading downwards, and it was very, very white.  Like, there was a large white cloud covering a good portion of the sky behind the object, but this stood out noticeably.  What first brought to our attention that this was not contrail or a comet was the fact that it didn&#39;t dissipate or move separately.  Instead, the entire thing would occasionally move down a bit (though this may have been because we were travelling towards it, but it did look like it was moving on its on).  The closer we got, the brighter the object would become.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance from our car to the object I would estimate between 5-8km.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were heading further north we lost track of the object because of the trees blocking our view. When we arrived at the destination, we went out in the back to see if we could find the object. In total, I would say we lost the object for about a minute and a half. Where we were now would have been closer to the object, to the point where I was expecting to see detail. However, it was nowhere around us, and was instead very far off in the distance. I can&#39;t stress enough how far away this object became. It went from being a very large white object in the sky, to a very bright dot off in the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we viewed it, we noticed it occasionally moving sporadically in all directions, but not going too far. I took a picture at this time but all that it shows is a very faint bright white dot (it was much more visible in person). I took a video too but the quality is extremely poor and it is pretty much impossible to see the object. I didn&#39;t think to take a picture earlier, because at that point we weren&#39;t really convinced it was anything too unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to specify how far of a distance this object must have traveled when we lost track of it. It wen&#39;t from being completely still in the skies (aside from possibly moving down slightly every so often), to being almost unnoticeable in barely over a minute. I can&#39;t even guess how far it must have traveled in that time.<n>

Looking east over the ocean,I saw a perfect semi-circle on the horizon.  Along the circumference was a band of white that looked like clouds.  The inside of the semi-circle was clear, because I could see stars.  I could not see stars through the white band.  Estimated it was about 15 miles out.  The base diameter approx.2 miles, radius 1 mile,thickness of white band 1/10th of radius.  The top was about 20 degrees above the horizon.  As time went on the semi circle expanded proportionally until it dissipated at about 75-80 degrees above the horizon.  I did not see any type of craft or hear any noise.  It was very likely associated with the sighting on the road to Haleakala crater at about the same time.<n>
9/23/14 04:37|Haleakala National Park|HI|Sphere|5 / 30 minutes|White, translucent sphere seen on the road up Haleakala Crater, Maui, Hawaii|9/25/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113840.html|237|ndxe201409| White, translucent sphere seen on the road up Haleakala Crater, Maui, Hawaii<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 4:37am HST Tuesday, September 23, 2014, we were driving up Crater Road to the summit of Haleakala on Maui to watch sunrise for the Autumnal Equinox.  It was a new moon with nearly no light in the sky yet.  It was a clear night full of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we rounded a switchback to face East North-east, we saw what looked at first to be a moonbow directly in front of us.  At that point it looked to be “rising” from behind the mountain that we were driving up.  If one compared it to the size of a full moon high in the sky, it would be 100 times that size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we pulled the car to the side of the road, we realized it was a sphere, rather than a two-dimensional semi-circular object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a thick, white, glowing rim that was the thickness of a typical rainbow.  Using the “full moon in the sky” size reference again, the white glowing rim was initially the thickness of two full moon’s diameters, side by side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed that the walls or “inside” of the sphere was a translucent white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the two minutes since we’d first seen the sphere, it had grown – either by expanding or coming nearer to us…we can’t be sure of the perspective.  It had slowly, smoothly grown in size, doubling and then tripling as the “wall” of the sphere came closer to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took several pictures as the sphere approached, getting larger (timestamped at 4:53), and there is no sphere visible in those images on either my iPhone or my friend’s camera. The cameras captured the lines in the road and the road signs, but absolute darkness otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere enveloped us.  That is, the translucent wall approaching us and moved past us – over us, through us – and as soon as it did, we could not see the sphere anymore  – neither it’s translucent walls nor the thick white, glowing rim/outline.   In that moment, the wind stopped blowing (had been 20-25mph) and ambient sounds ceased.  Then, the night sky returned to how it had looked before we initially had seen the sphere; wind and sound returned to normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In reviewing the data on my JawBone UP 24 (fitness band that tracks my walking motion), we spent 25 minutes out of the car, walking/moving (4:39am – 5:04am).  That was a surprise to me. My friend and I agree that to our memory, the entire episode lasted 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the sunrise, we stopped at a breakfast spot on the way down the mountain and overheard a tour bus operator asking people if they’d seen “the giant orb”. We shared what we’d seen and it was the same experience in terms of what it looked like and that it seemed to expand or get closer.  At the time, we hadn’t yet realized our experience with loss of time (I discovered that while looking at some data points while writing this account), so we don’t know if that driver had a similar experience.  We did not think to get his name.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In coming down the mountain, my friend and I both noticed that everything we saw and heard seemed to be in “high definition.”  That is, colors in nature – plants, flowers, etc. – were (and still are) oversaturated.  We’re more sensitized to sounds and tastes.  I’m not sure what to think of this experience, and so post it here as a possible step in making sense of it through others’ insights, or perhaps similar experiences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mahalo<n>
9/23/14 04:35|Haleakala National Park|HI||5 minutes|Bright white dome-shaped light seen at pre-dawn on summit of Haleakala on Maui.|10/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114280.html|238|ndxe201409| Bright white dome-shaped light seen at pre-dawn on summit of Haleakala on Maui.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early on Tuesday morning September 23, 2014, my husband and I drove to the summit of Haleakala National Park, on the island of Maui, to view the sunrise.  We arrived at the summit around 4:30 a.m.  It was cold and extremely windy.  There were already a few tour shuttles that had arrived, and approximately six or seven other cars that had arrived. I got out of the car to use the restroom at the visitor’s center and looked around a bit.  It was pitch dark, and, since it was way too early for the sunrise, I went back to the car to keep warm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our car was parked approximately 15-20 yards from the visitor’s center and the accompanying railing constructed there, along which people stand, facing east, to view the sunrise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I was back in our car, I noticed a strange white glow emanating from the area of the visitor’s center or just beyond it (to the south/southeast). From my perspective, sitting in our vehicle, it looked like a half-circle or dome of white light illuminating the area of the mountain just on the other side of the viewing railing and extending above approximately two stories high. So, relatively close by. The defined outer edge of the “dome” was distinctly brighter than the interior. The interior was translucent but very white. The outer edge made a sharp, bright, distinct border.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered if it was some sort of pre-dawn phenomenon having to do with the moon, or the coming sun, and the clouds. I said to my husband, “Look at that dome of white light over by the visitor’s center. What is that?” But he was already dozing off, resting after the somewhat challenging drive to the summit in the pitch dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I very much wanted to get out and take a closer look. It was like nothing I’d ever seen before. But my desire to stay out of the extreme wind and cold won over, and I continued to view it from inside the car. I nodded off, since we’d gotten up at 2am to make the drive from the Ka’anapali Beach area to the summit. I napped for about 45 minutes, after which time my husband and I got out of the car to position ourselves amongst the gathering crowd to view the sunrise.  I did not even remember seeing the white light…  …until, three days later, after boarding our flight home from Maui, we struck up a conversation with the man sitting next to me on the plane, and discovered that he and his wife had also gone to the summit of Haleakala on September 23rd to see the sunrise.  And he said to us, “Did you see a mysterious white light when you were there, while it was still dark?” To which I replied, “YES!” I’d forgotten all about it until he mentioned it. From his perspective, when he saw the light (I believe he said he was standing outside when he saw it), he observed a complete circle hovering in the air. I don’t recall him mentioning how nearby it seemed, or how high above ground he thought it was. His description matched mine in that he said it had a white translucent center and a bright, sharp, defined outside edge. He said he’d been searching the Internet for an explanation of what it could have been, but without much success, as he wasn’t sure what phrases to search on; it was so difficult! to describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally got around to doing my own Internet search on this phenomenon last Friday (October 4). That’s when I found this web site.<n>

On 23 September at around 430 am my girlfriend woke me up to look at something outside her window. I got up and looked out expecting to see an animal and was surprised to see a white dome shaped half sphere to the Northeast protruding up from behind a ridgeline over the ocean. She said she had been watching it for a few minutes already thinking that her eyes were playing tricks on her. The dome was about the size of a saucer held at arm’s length in the sky. It appeared to be a moon halo, however there was no moon that morning since it was a new moon. It was a very bright white ring that was very pronounced. It appeared stationary but then I realized it was moving in the direction of her house on Mariner’s Ridge in Hawaii Kai from the northeast to the southwest. It appeared to be moving the same speed as the few clouds that were in the sky so I thought maybe it w! as some kind of weird reflection from the small clouds. When it got closer I realized it was a perfect circle and was very large. I would say it appeared to cover half the distance of the sky. There was no noise and I didn’t see any light source that could create a halo like that. It was generally clear except for a few small clouds, so it wasn’t something reflecting off of the ground onto clouds or anything like that. We watched it for about 5 minutes until it went over the house. We have no idea what it was and the best way to describe it was a very pronounced large white moon halo, minus the moon and moving at about 10 miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I suspect it was in the Watsonville area, but don&#39;t know.  The flashing star continued to rise in a 45 degree angle ( to the right )  for an hour.  Stopping at times, but always with tiny ricochet movements that seemed random.  At times fast and at times slow. Around 5:00 AM it completely stopped moving and flashing and stayed put.  There were two tiny stars on each side that appeared dim.  Husband woke up and saw the static bright star with two tiny dim stars.  By that time there was no ricochet movement.  I fell asleep.<n>
9/23/14 03:40|Torrington|CT|Light|15 seconds|I keep seeing these objects.|9/25/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113864.html|242|ndxe201409| I keep seeing these objects<n> <n><n> <n><n> I keep seeing these things.  On September 23, I woke from sleep, needing to go to the bathroom.  Next to my bed is a large window that faces due east.  When it is warm I like to prop the window open for fresh air, which I had done this night.  Before I went to the bathroom, I took a look out the window as I usually do.  It was clear and cool and many stars were visible.  I saw Jupiter maybe 10 degrees above the horizon to the ENE, Sirius to the southeast, with the constellation Orion above it.  I know the stars, planets and constellations pretty well as I have been interested in astronomy since I was young.  I own a nice telescope I use on occasion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was unusual was a bright star like object about 10 degrees above Jupiter and slightly north of it as well.  This object was a bright white color, brighter than both Jupiter or Sirius.  I was a little confused because I look out the window every morning and have not seen this star before. It did not appear to be moving at all.  After about 15 seconds, it suddenly dimmed to a very small pinprick of light, and then dimmed out altogether.  I looked carefully to see if a cloud had passed in front of this star, but it was very clear.  I did see one faint patch of cloud, but this was nowhere near this &#34;star&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s it, that is my sighting.  Not very eventful except that I keep seeing objects like this on a regular basis.  Back in April I was going to work early in the morning when I got the impression to look up, and I saw a very bright light just like the one I saw tonight, which also quickly faded out a few seconds later.  Over the past five years or so I have seen about half a dozen lights like this.  You can&#39;t help but feel that these objects are appearing for the express purpose that you see them. I am not a nut job, but I know what I am seeing, and I am seeing these objects on a regular basis.  I have a very difficult time believing it is just a coincidence that I repeatedly look up just as some bright military aircraft or other object is hovering in the sky, and then quickly turns off its lights, or jets away.  Altogether, I have seen UFOs about a dozen times in my life, three times up close with much detail.  But the last few years I seem to just &#34;look up&#34; and there they are.  What they are I have no clue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am rather religious and do not believe these objects are from other planets, I rather believe they are spiritual in nature.  Still, why do I keep seeing these things?  Most people never see a single UFO in their entire life, I have probable seen at least a dozen.  What does it mean?   Oh well, that&#39;s it.  I have turned a very short and unremarkable sighting into something big, but when you keep seeing these things, it begins to get to you after awhile.<n>

I noticed 2 lights in the sky approaching from the North in a strait southerly direction.  As the craft approached I was able to see a total of 6 lights that were glowing pinkish white - 3 on each wing.  The Craft was a very dark metal color (charcoal) and Triangular in shape.  The nose of the craft had a somewhat rounded front.  I could see that the front of the craft was bridged wing to wing approx. a quarter of the way down the wing span.  The craft made absolutely no sound whatsoever as it traveled directly over our backyard.  I had a very good visual of the craft and had to lean over the deck to see the entire craft due to our covered deck portion on the south end of our home as it fly overhead until out of sight.  The altitude of the craft was very low (less than or equal to what a helicopter would normally fly).  It was larger than a military jet yet resembled the shape of a stealth bomber.  I did not take my eyes off the craft during the entire time, then went inside and drew a picture of what I had seen.<n>

Once outside we saw two military helicopters buzz low over the town(very loud and sound so different then commercial or stars helicopters) and that caused our eyes to look at a very bright star once the helicopters were gone our focus was on this bright star.  My wife said “that is one bright star” and we both looked at it as it made an even brighter flash and looked as though it was moving away from us in a manner that it went from the brightest star in the sky to the dimmest and then completely invisible.  It moved in a way as to make a Nike check exactly like you would see in the movies when a space ship travels away into space.  It moved faster than anything I have ever seen and I am an avid watcher of meteor showers and just staring at the stars in general so it was! not a meteorite or satellite as its change in direction and speed defy my knowledge of physics.  Just thought I would report this somewhere as to be recorded, hope this adds to the banks of data.  Have a gooder.<n>

I had just clocked off from work and went outside to grab a change of clothes.  Four of my co-workers were outside smoking a cigarette. When I came out they were all staring up above the building directly across from the south side employee parking lot which was approximately 30 feet from where we were.  As I glanced up to see what they were looking at I was immediately shocked at what I saw, a bright orange circular ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be the same height as a small aircraft but with a much brighter light. It was bright orange but not solid orange.  It had changing orange hues within the craft, similar to the movements of fire, except that it looked more solid then fire.  The center appeared to be changing from a darker orange to lighter orange.  The object hovered for about 30 seconds from the time I stepped outside to witness it.  After hovering the object took off at a very fast speed high up into the night sky. You could still see the faint orange ball traveling for about two minutes before completely disappearing.  At that point you wouldn’t have been able to differentiate it from a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best description I can give you is that it looked like a hovering fireball, however when it zoomed off there was no orange tracer like fire would leave.  Also, while the orange ball was hovering there was very slight horizontal movement from left to right.  My co-workers and I agree that it mostly resembled a floating fireball but with a solidity to it.<n>

I asked the rest of my family if they were seeing them too and they all said they could.  It looked almost as if some of the stars had come to life and were parading around in the sky putting on a show.  We would see them come in and out of focus, blink occasionally, disappear and reappear.  These tiny light points came at different times in different locations all over the sky above us.  I hadn&#39;t seen any in a while, so it was quite an enjoyable experience for me.  It continued until we left the concert, and maybe for longer, but we watched them fly across the sky for at least 30 minutes before we left.<n>

This craft was huge and a dark red almost like a dark cherry red.  It was totally lit up and glowing.  I could&#39;nt really see any details except it was basically disc shaped  and maybe 100 feet long and not very tall.  It looked like 2 plates joined together. This object looked totally different than anything else I&#39;ve seen lately and it looked like it was sitting on the west side of this hill on the grass.  During my 5 to 10 minutes I watched this object it moved from right to left about 200 yards really slow like at a walking pace.  Then it just seemed to disappear like a light switch turning off.  There were several other craft in the immediate area but they were really low key and barely visible unless you had binoculars.  There was no sound heard except for the crickets outside.  This is the second time in 9 days I believe I&#39;ve seen a landed craft in this same spot and the other night on 9-12-14 I just happened to be filming with a camcorder and captured a craft that changed color from orange to white and basically moved from right to left about 200 yards on this hill. It could be that it was flying or hovering in front of the hill but even that is basically impossible for a normal aircraft. These craft (with the exception of the red disc) all look the same. They look like an ice cream cone turned sideways so the white light or orangish light is  on the left and there is a black pointed tail shape to the right. They look like craft seen on Area 51 footage that I&#39;ve seen in amateur footage. There were other white and orange lights that joined this craft that I have on f! ilm on 9-12-14 and a second craft looks like it&#39;s sitting on t! he right corner on the top of this hill.Anyway this hill in Corte Madera has these huge objects that approach from the east and hover over the left corner of this hill like a lit up Christmas tree and then they go backwards and down on the S.F. Bay side of the hill and then either the same object or another identical object will do the exact same thing and sink down behind the hill. If you are standing up in the hills you can really notice this activity and I wish more people would notice this. Any doubts I had that these might be conventional aircraft seen at a distance were laid to rest one night in April of this year when I was directly involved in one of the most bizarre close encounters-landing-other worldly encounter that was so unbelievable I still can&#39;t believe it.<n>

The time was arround 11 am.  We started to look at airplanes to see if is worthed to report this.  All airplanes look totaly diferent in the sun reflection for all sizes.<n>

It was way brighter than the other stars.  As i was looking at it. i began to notice a diamond shape of dimmer lights that resembled a diamond.  After a while of looking at it, I began to see white lines coming off of the star-like light.  It was moving slowly,and choppy.  At this moment I got my brother to come look to make sure I wasn&#39;t crazy. He saw it and began looking in the sky.  We found 3 other diamond shapes in the sky.  We found an open place in our driveway where all the shapes could be seen at the same time.soon after we saw the last diamond shape in the sky the first 1 I saw started blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the second on started in an alternating pattern between the two.  As we was looking at the two blinking shapes in the sky a sudden bright burst of light happened between the two.It was Amazing.  My brother went and got his friend that happens to be a girl to be another witness ! to this extraordinary event.  She saw the shapes too.  Around 5:45A.M, just as the sky turned blue.  The shapes slowly started to elevate into the sky.  As they got farther away, I began to notice trails behind the objects as if they were using some kind of boosters to go higher.  They kept going until they were out of sight.<n>

I watched for 2 hours trying to figure out what I was seeing.  It was bright blue and sometimes flashed to yellow.  The object was moving erratically and zig zagging around.  I recorded several videos and showed a few people and no one has any idea what it could be.  Definitely not anything man made.

Date is flawed, and source has failed to respond to our e-mailed messages.  We have changed the date.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 22:45 in Bothell, WA, I was on my back deck and saw numerous objects (I believe 6) fly overhead.  They had no lights but were clearly visible I&#39;m assuming due to the city lights below.  They looked silverish-gray but that is probably the city light reflecting off them.  They were in a &#34;V&#34; formation.  One in front, two directly behind the first, and 3 behind the two.  The row with three, the one on the far right was off centered however.  Appeared to be pulling away from the others but I can&#39;t be sure as I only saw the objects for a few seconds before they went over the tree line.  There was no sound at all.  I cannot give an exact altitude but I&#39;m guessing 1000-2000 feet due to the speed across the sky.  Basically west to East.  If they were at 10,000 feet they would have been the size of jumbo jets and going at least mach 4 or 5 so my assumption is much lower altitude.  Again, no sound at all which is not possible if it was a low-flying (or high flying) formation of jets. I cannot guarantee they were separate objects as it&#39;s a pitch black night sky, but it appeared they were, as one was out of formation.  My first thought was maybe a big drone but the speed was too fast and the off-centeredness does not make sense. I&#39;m sure others saw what I saw too as it&#39;s a populated area.  Very strange and never seen anything like it.<n>

Neither of us was looking up at the time but is was so large &amp; distinct, we caught it out of our peripheral vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking up we see 15+ faint lights in a perfect bow or arc shape approximately 2000ft up &amp; almost directly overhead ...  All the light were very dim but perfectly equal distant from each other.  The total distance of the arc from end to end was 300+ feet and making absolutely no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it as it moved towards the south for approx 4 to 5 secs ... I would estimate it moved a couple of miles in that time ... And at that point, the lights just disappeared ... Not that it had moved so far that we couldn&#39;t have seen them ... But the lights just seemed to be blocked from our view once it moved out that far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total time of the sighting was no more than 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Above is what we seen as best I can describe ... The rest is pure speculation on my part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe what we seen was some type of a cloaked craft ... As I stated all we could really make out when we looked up were these faint lights ... But I believe what we were seeing was just the leading edge of a larger craft (Most likely circular in shape) ... And I say this because the distortion we first notice was large &amp; round&#39;ish in shape ... I would describe it as what you would see if you were looking at a still pool of water and then throwing a rock into it ... Undulating waves. But by the time we looked up that distortion had cleared and all we could make out at that point was this large faint arc of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Secondly, as this thing moved to the point where the light just seemed to disappear. I believe what happened was that as it moved to the south our viewing angle changed so we were now looking at the back of this craft ... And our view of the back was blocking our view of those leading edge lights.<n>

One of the secondary orbs dropped a new white orb, which after ~2 seconds of dropping became a fireball.

I saw some golden yellow lights moving around in sky they were as if  20 to 25 planes moving in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After sometimes the lights disappeared one by one.  Initially my husband refused to see, as he was driving.  When we stopped, he and my daughter were totally shocked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if it was some kind of UFO or something else.  But I&#39;m quite sure it is not normal, if it was meteor shower then it would seem to be falling not moving here and there and going off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are very curious to know what it is?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

They would blink on and off and vary in brightness.  At times the ball was white/blue with a red flaming tail.  Then they disappeared.  They did not streak down like a meteor but again floated down bouncing like feathers.<n>

They were sitting at a diagonal from each other but too close together to be airplanes.  I pointed them out to my husband who commented that they may be an antenna tower.  I commented that it must be one crocked antenna because of the diagonal line they made instead of vertical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dismissed them until 20 minutes later when we were on the 202 E just before the Val Vista Rd. exit.  I looked up at them and they were white now and, to my eye, looked to be about the size of the old large satellite dishes until they broke up into four separate balls about the size of basketballs.  I guesstimated them to be around 3-4 miles northeast from us and approximately 500 feet from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled off to the side of the highway and watched them as they seemed to be floating down from the sky in a diamond shaped pattern.  As they were doing this each ball of light intermittently changed in brightness going between glowing bright with red flaming tails (like a comet) to dim white balls of light to barely visible.  They floated down slowly like a feather.  Each time one flared up the others did not. Also as they were coming down individually they were slowly changing direction in circular motions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They eventually fell out of our line of sight behind buildings. They were moving to slowly with weird directional changes to be a meteor or something else falling from the sky.<n>

The objects seemed to be travelling back and forth, and each time they changed direction, the fire trail subsided, as if the object was changing direction and we could not see the exhaust at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This gave the appearance that the four objects would randomly disappear, and then reappear nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects seemed to be descending, zigzagging in the same area of the sky.  In just a few minutes, they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All we could really see was the fire trails, or exhaust plumes of the objects.  Something was obviously leaving fire trails, as they appeared very thick at the source of the trail and thin at the rear of the trail as it burned out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This area of the sky commonly has aircraft passing by, since Sky Harbor airport is nearby.  We could see the light of jets as well, but those were MUCH higher in the sky and further away.  These fire trails seemed less than 5,000 feet in the air, and less than 10 miles away from our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Trails like comets, but with a sparkly appearance, going all sorts of directions (up, down, left, right, loops, all over the place).

All four changed numerous times, from the blue/red light to a flare-like light that fell downward.  It lasted about 5 minutes until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore because of the trees.  We thought it was odd, that if they were flares, why did they change back to the blue/red light many times?<n>

THEY WERE RED IN COLOR, NOT BLINKING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WE PULLED OVER AND GOT OUT OF OUR CAR AND WATCHED THEM, THEY TRAVELING SIDE BY SIDE MOVING SLIGHTLY UP THEN DOWN.  GOING SOMEWHAT FAST, THEN THEY STOPPED TO OUR RIGHT THEN ONE DISAPPEARED, THEN 5 SECONDS LATER THE OTHER DISSAPEARED, WE THOUGHT THAT WAS IT, THEN WE SAW ANOTHER COMING FROM THE SAME DIRECTION WE SAW THE FIRST TWO HAD COME FROM.  IT WAS MOVING SAME SPEED, SAME COLOR AND WHEN IT GOT TO SAME SPOT TO OUR RIGHT IT DISSAPEARED.  THEN ANOTHER CAME SAME FROM THE DIRECTION, DID THE SAME THING.  THEN ANOTHER ONE DID SAME THING I GOT MY PHONE OUT AND WAS ABLE TO TAKE PICTURE OF 5TH ONE, I DID NOT HAVE ANYMORE ROOM ON MY PHONE TO TAKE ANOTHER PICTURE OF THE 6TH.  IT WAS AMAZING TO SEE WE WAITED AROUND TO HOPEFULLY SEE IF THERE WERE ANYMORE.  WE DID NOT SEE ANYMORE AFTERWARDS. WE BELIEVE WHAT WE SAW WERE UFOS OF SOME KIND,  THEY DID NOT MAKE ANY NOISE AND THEY DID NOT BLINK.  AND THE SPEED THEY WERE TRAVELING WAS NOT LIKE ANY AIRCRAFT,HELICOPTER OR LANTERN/FLARE THAT I HAVE EVER WITNESSED BEFORE.  THE OBJECTS MOVED FROM THE SOUTH TO THE NORTH.<n>

9/20/14 01:55|Vero Beach/Melbourne|FL|Circle|5 minutes|Bright yellow orange glowing circular object observed for aprroximately 5 minutes.|9/25/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113770.html|330|ndxe201409| Bright yellow orange glowing circular object observed for aprroximately 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 01:55am and I was driving from Vero Beach, FL, toward West Melbourne, FL on U.S.1. I was about 14 or 15 miles south of West Melbourne (approximately 25 miles north of Vero Beach) heading North on U.S.1 along the coast when I observed a round, bright yellowish orange light.  At first I thought it might be the moon, but, I quickly realized that it was too small and too bright.  This light was unusual as it gave the effect similar to what you would see watching a safety flare or a piece of magnesium burn - very bright &amp; glowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I noticed was that it was too big to be a star. I also noticed that it was moving from North to South down the coastline, but over the ocean - in my general direction, but not directly at me.  It didn&#39;t seem to be moving incredibly fast but I would say it was moving at a moderate pace, it was slightly off to my right - but in front of me, again - yellowish orange &amp; very bright - too small to be the moon &amp; too big to be a star, so now I am thinking to myself - this has to be a meteor.  With my curiosity peaked, I actually parked in the median of U.S.1 and got out of my car and observed this &#34;Thing&#34; for about 5 minutes.  Now I have my cell phone out and I am gonna try and get some video of it. I had a little trouble finding it at first, I am guessing at it&#39;s closest point, it was probably 1-2 miles from me and if I had to guess an altitiude, I would say somewhere between 3,000 &amp; 5,000 ft.  There was no audible noise associated with this object or it&#39;s! movement.  Once I finally did get it into view and was ready to record it, it suddenly burned extra bright - and then disappeared - just like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Or, so I thought. Upon looking closely for about 10 seconds I picked it up again but the bright yellowish orange glow that was there previously, was now gone.  There was still some light there still, but it was very dim (to the point where it could have easily been overlooked) and appeared to be coming from behind the object now, thus silhouetting it.  So, I surmised that it had simply changed direction, I am guessing it had made, approximately, an abrupt 90 degree turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the object was still moving but appeared to be heading away from me - but still remained in the same general location with a little lateral movement back &amp; forth. I understand that this object changed direction abruptly, but, I can&#39;t explain the dramatic decrease in the light it was emitting, it went from super-bright, to virtually no light at all.  And again, there was no noise that I could associate this object.  I watched it for a couple minutes longer, as it seemed to be moving away from me (East) o! ut over the open ocean and then I decided to leave as I was meeting somebody. I have never in my life (45 years) seen a UFO - but I believe, for the first time, I did last night.<n>

It seemed to have a trail behind it, it split into 5 balls of lights that made a formation at first it was a V shape but did not hold that.  They slowly started off due south and i lost sight of them behind the tree line.  I would guess the balls of light looked to be the size of a craft, or bi-plane the big ball of light they came from I have no idea how big it was.  It looked like they were this big ball of light, and once they seperated into the 5 crafts the big ball of light was gone.  The big ball of light seemed to come into view like it was raising up from the ground, when i saw it i first thought it was a gigantic firework being shot up into the sky and it had trails, it almost seemed like the crafts had trails themselves once in a while, hard to explain like when they first split up!  They had drops of liquid coming off them or something.<n>

Just as it was over head and I was watching it in binoculars, the second one appeared in my site radius traveling east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second one past right by the first and was notably smaller and sharper imaged.  The second one was noticeably bronze like, and the first a more blue white colored light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Are these satellites??????

In effect, they &#34;just appeared&#34; in the sky (west-northwest direction from my position in Los Banos).  The &#34;objects&#34; remained in the sky for about ten minutes changing color and dimming in intensity in the process.  No time during the observation did the &#34;objects&#34; move in the sky.

They were getting brighter and dimmer at certain points sometimes disappearing for a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 4 groups of 2 that kind of circled each other.  At some points they seemed to swirl if that makes sense.  They worked their way down the ridge from left to right disappearing completely out of view around 7:45pm.  About 30 to 45 minutes later there was yet another lone light starting at the highest peak and working its way down like the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again 15 minutes later there was one final light to the left towards the base of the mountain.

My girlfriend and I, on route to San Francisco, stopped to use the Valero service station on Hwy 33 off Interstate 5.  Upon exiting our vehicle we noticed the attendant and a customer looking up in the sky to the West.  We looked up and noticed 8 objects at a high altitude fixed in the sky, like a constellation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no stars visible as it was still light out. The objects appeared to be angular in shape like an elongated hexagon.  The attendant told us that they had been visible for about 20 minutes already.  There was no sound audible. The objects did not move for the 30 or so minutes that we watched.  I cannot accurately estimate the size of the objects but an airliner flew over at one point and the objects were higher and larger than the airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the daylight diminished, the objects grew less visible leading me to conclude that they were not emitting their own light but were illuminated by the sun, reflecting the sun that was already over the horizon.  The 8 objects were spread out over about 1/3 of the sky in front of us, 60 degrees high or so and about 60 degrees left to right.  As we watched, there were many other witnesses coming and going as they stopped to gas up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the sun continued to set, the objects became less and less visible until we could no longer see them.  There was no way to tell if they were still there.<n>

At first I thought it was maybe saturn but then I said no that&#39;s way to brite. Just one bright sol I don&#39;t light.  As I&#39;m driving  about 2 or 3 min later I think we&#39;ll maybe it&#39;s a light from Jabara airpirt.  Not thinking 3 min ago I thought It was a planet.  About the time I hot rock rd.i know think it&#39;s a helicopter because it&#39;s flying so slow and so low.  Still not thinking I thought it was a planet few min ago. As I go to get off on webb rd.  It almost right in front of me.  I catch about a 3 second good look at it and by the time I got to the bottom of webb.  It was so low was so low I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  It looked like something out of star trek. It was like a double decker triangle something.  And very very very large.  Has to be the craziest thing I have ever seen.will never forget what it looked like. So!  I have a friend who works for Jabara airport and he said he would talk to the guys who watch the radar and see if they know maybe whst it was.  He got told ..don&#39;t ask...I&#39;m like really.  I wish they would stop being so secretive about things were not blind.  If anyone can help answer what I seen Friday morning please reply to this.<n>

All of a sudden I seen this bright light that looked to me it had some sort of flame behind it.  It was so bright that it lit up the sky till it disappeared when it went down behind the trees.  I know it wasn&#39;t a shooting star cause it would not have been as low as it was above me and my boyfriend.  And a shooting star would&#39;ve moved faster than this object did.  This bright object moved slower and flew real low above us.I swear It was a ufo of some sort.  When it went behind the trees it just disappeared and was nowhere.  I looked cause like I said I knew this was no shooting star.  The only sound I heard that was faintly was the sound of the fire behind the bright object, but it was a faint sounding noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I knew what that bright light was.

On Hwy 25 about four miles outside of Millen, Georgia city limits I notice something out of the corner of my sight on the right side.  I look and there was 4 bright white lights spaced apart in a curved downward shape.  The lights were apart of a very large football shaped glossy black object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yell to my friend look at that.  An instant fear came over both of us as we watched.  In a time frame of around ten seconds the bright lights turned off one by one starting left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds after the lights went out the very large football shaped object vanished. it didn&#39;t fly off, it vanished into thin are in front of our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment my friend and I both had all the hair stand up on our bodies and goosebumps all over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I remember after seeing the object vanish I could see the lights of an airplane off in the distance behind it.  After seeing this we turned on the emergency flashers and sped all the way to my house<n>

That night at around 11:00pm, I saw a very large bright light escaping from the second to last star on the handle of the &#34;big dipper&#34;, it was heading due east for about 5 seconds before it shot straight up and out of sight in a blink of an eye.  My second sighting came in late March of 2000 at about 5:30pm on my way home from work driving West from Mound to Watertown.  I was looking straight ahead at a large cloud off in the distance when a silver UFO came peeking out of the clouds, it stopped about 20 feet out in the open when another one popped out and went right over it.  The two crafts literally played leap-frog in and out of the clouds for about 2 minutes then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I am emailing you is not because of those two sightings, but of my last one which was also seen by my fiancé and eldest son.  This time, there were two UFOS and we got one of them on video and the other one on camera.  This occurred on September 18th, 2014 at around 9:00pm just over our house in Waconia, MN.  The craft was hovering above our house for about 5 minutes then headed SE at an incredible speed and evenutaully out of sight.  The craft had lights but the entire thing was engulfed in a deep purple haze.  It looked like a purple ball surrounding the UFO. We captured this craft on video with my sons phone.  You can&#39;t see the color but you get to see it fly away, make a couple 90 degree turns, stop on a dime, go straight up and back down.  It made ZERO sound and was nothing I have ever seen on ANY alien show before.  I have seen hundreds of UFO Sighting shows, Hangar 1, etc....and what I saw has never been documented as far as I can remember. My son and I chased it for 15 minutes in our car but saw nothing so we headed back home.  Before I could pull into our driveay my son yelled to stop the ca! r.  We got out and sure enough the second UFO was right above ! out hous e in the same spot as the other one.  It too headed in the exact same direction.  This one was a blueish green color changing between the two. We got a picture of this craft. It also made no sound.  There was also a very large, low-flying, incredibly slow-moving(what looked to be a very, very large military plane) that my son and I both saw over the city of Waconia within 30 minutes of the original sighting. I have wanted to be a part of MUFON for the last 5 years or so.  I would love nothing more than to be an investigator. I want to help people with their stories and most importantly, I want to bring UFO&#39;s out in the open for everyone to see.  They are real, they are here and they aren&#39;t going away.  I would love to show MUFON my video and picture. I am not afraid nor do i care of what people think or say.  I honestly believe that this is what I was meant to be doing with my life.  I look forward to hearing back from you.<n>

We have an annoying dog as our backyard neighbors and I thought maybe the dog had barked, so I was laying in bed looking out the window waiting for a bark, when I saw a small white light in the sky zoom in from the left (north) at a great deal of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light stopped within the view of my window and stopped moving. I would estimate the light to be over the Colfax/Wadsworth area, but it was hard to tell as the I had a very limited frame of reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my sleep addled state I thought at first that it was a plane, but then I realIzed how fast it moved into my field of view and that it had stopped.  I surmised that if it was a plane, it&#39;s reference within the window would change against the tree tops I can also see In the window. I watched the light for a full 20 minutes and it never moved.  I then began to think it was a star, but again no other stars were visible due to the light pollution of Denver and it had literally flown into my field of view earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drifted off to sleep at this time for about 10 minutes by my brdside clock and when I looked again the object was still in its same place and not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light looked white and &#34;flickery&#34; like a star looks but it&#39;s position never moved against any reference points in my window. It never grew larger or smaller either, so I surmise it was hovering. It also had no noise I could discern, nor did it project any light (like a searchlight) it just looked like a star.  I fell asleep again at 2:35 and woke back up at 2:45 and the object was gone from view completely.  I even got out of bed to see if it was now behind a tree, but it was completely gone from view.<n>

My guess the location was about 15 miles south to southwest of Wickenburg Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later 2 more appeared near the north amber light. They appeared at times to be slightly glowing. They were not moving and I heard no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9:40 PM, they just disappeared within a few seconds of each other. I then looked everywhere in that general direction for the remainder of my trip home for the next 10 minutes but never saw them again.

It looked like a very bright moving star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it got just over head, another appeared inmy view traveling north to south right past the first one.  This one was noticeable different in size and brightness, don&#39;t know if that&#39;s because of the distance it was from me or the size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Does someone know what times the satellites fly over Valley, Alabama???<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was at 9:33pm.

Just now 2 star like objects moving in a south to north fashion were just spotted.  These objects always appear to be moving stars and sometimes if straight over head they will start burning real bright, then dull back down.  Some people try to say their satellites but I find that hard to believe when I see 13 of them in a 50min period, with the naked eye.  The only way to describe it is a moving star that can be seen approaching at a 45degree angle sometimes and leaving on the horizon as far as possible with binoculars sometimes.  The second one seen tonight wasn&#39;t quite straight over head but off to my left and appeared to get brighter and lighter, within a rhythm.  This is along the Chattahoochee River and they always appear to be going north-south or south-north.  If the skies right they can be seen every night.  Oh yea, the sky was perfect this evening and two jets traveling north-south came over spraying a very thick trail within a 10 min period straight over head.  10 min later a large jet flying south-north but between their two trails passed over head.  Someone tell me what these flying stars are, that move at a constant speed every night.  I live near the Troup-Heard Corridor and south of West Point Lake, in the town where the famous Valley, Alabama, UFO pic was taken, and know the guys in the local media that covered it then.<n>

During the time of my recording, there were two fireballs visible as a plane approached from the south.

The object following it appeared to be an aircraft as it had a white strobe light and I could glimpse red and green marker lights from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the midpoint of their travel path from my vantage point I estimate the objects were 5 miles from me.  They had an estimated separation of ¼ mile with the orange red light source in the lead.  That separation was maintained for the entire sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took an estimated 90 seconds for the objects to traverse the sky from east to south west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listened for engine noise but could hear nothing, even after I turned off my radio and fan.  This is odd as I have lots of commercial and military air traffic in my area.  Aircraft even at 40,000 feet always leave a noise trail as they pass over my property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was hesitant to make this report but I have never seen such an event as this!  The orange red object did not appear to me to be a normal aircraft.  As it was essential a point source of light I do not know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My location is approximately 5 miles due east of Interstate highway 59 exit 35 in Mississippi.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired Lockheed Senior Manufacturing Engineer with 25 years of service in the Space Shuttle External Tank program at the NASA Michoud Facility in New Orleans.

As I tried to get to a clear spot and park, one of the lights (the lower of the two) faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to park and get out of my car and another neighbor joined me in observing the remaining ball of light.  It was stationary, but pulsating a reddish-orange light.  There was no sound.  This lasted about 5 minutes before it slowly faded away or burned out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that there is a nuclear plant not too far away in that same direction, but I am not sure if there is any connection.<n>

I never looked away, but I tried pulling up my camera. I was just about to head inside after it had passed over the trees, but then I saw another.  I was so transfixed by what I was seeing, I couldn&#39;t bring myself to come to my senses and get my camera ready, and I figured it would have been really difficult to see anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 4 of them; one right after the other.  It&#39;s hard to describe what they looked like, and I&#39;m hoping they&#39;re just some form of aircraft I&#39;ve never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were five large, round, blue lights: one in the center and one on each end of these rectangular-shaped wings.  They seemed to be black, and flying not much higher than the trees in my area.  They were fully symmetrical (even though it&#39;s hard to see in country darkness) and flying very low to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once all 4 had flown by and I the sound started fading in the distance, I rushed inside to see if anyone else had seen or heard them.  Perhaps 10 minutes later, there were maybe 20 other aircraft flying at a much higher altitude which we all just assumed were military jets, though that would be unclear.  They were extremely loud and were going in the same direction as the aircraft that had initially passed by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have yet to be offered an explanation as to what the first 4 were and I&#39;m hoping I can find someone who might be able to tell me what they were or saw the same thing.  I did leave out one minor detail to see if anyone else can vouch for what I&#39;m saying here.<n>

I was basically holding a &#34;peace&#34; sign in the air, to try and judge the distance between the two lights.  (The two lights would be the base of the triangle, and the point at my knuckle, between the index and middle finger would be the point of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two bright white lights appeared to ascend high into the sky quickly, moving the same direction toward the northern star. The view of the north star is directly north of my house way up in the sky, so I have a perfect view of the northern star. The lights were moving really fast, but they were moving straight up, and appeared to be going straight toward the star.  The further away they got, the dimmer the light was.  They appeared to dim evenly, and this made me think they were going in the same direction at the same speed. Eventually, they got so small you could no longer see the light.  The best way to describe it would be comparing it to a balloon floating into the air, and watching it until it was so far away, you could not see it any longer.  These two lights were VERY intense in color. We have planes fly overhead at night often, and these were NOT planes. It was the strangest thing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night, with stars visible, and light overcast. No lightning, bad weather, etc. The best way to describe the light would be Car Headlights. They were bright like car headlights..Also, I need to note that these lights were not directly overhead, they were off in the distance (toward the north) at least a few miles away, or probably even further. WE have a tall tree in our neighbors front yard, so from the top of this tall oak tree, the lights appeared about halfway from the top of the tree to the north star in the northern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am curious to know if anyone else in my area reported the lights?<n>

Have never seen this type of light out here before.   I have seen several plants that appear to be flickering from gases released, but never this.  The colors were too vivid.<n>

This pattern continued to change. In it&#39;s flight pattern, it maneuvered in small tight spirals like a emote controlled plane would move.  But being it was pitch black out, and there was no sound plus the brightness of the lights, it could not have been a model aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Stars were beginning to appear in the eastern part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of sighting:  Orange in center, darker and hazier near edges, steadily bright but with edges slightly flickering. Would compare the appearance to a candle&#39;s flame in the darkness. The light was much, much larger than the lights on the side of a plane as seen from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a woman in my late 20s. I regularly walk my dog four times a day, and have lived in this area just over a year, so I am familar with the area and the changes the neighborhood undergoes at various times of day.  A large airport is situated in a nearby city, and I have seen many airplanes, but the object in sky did not resemble an airplane.  I saw it as I walked around the back of my building, which is located next to a small park.  As soon as I saw it, I watched it as I walked for about a minute, and because it was so strange, I ascended a hill in the park to get above the treeline and watched it slowly move southwest for an additional two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog was perfectly calm and didn&#39;t seem to notice anything different. I had no physical reaction to its presence, other than being a bit surprised, confused, and a little unnerved. At that moment, I could see no planes in the sky and I heard no sounds other than those of nature and the cars driving by. No other people were by me on the path. I was unable to ascertain the actual shape of the craft, seeing only the orange light as a flat circle, so I cannot say if it was spherical or otherwise. I squinted and thought I saw a dim triangular outline around the orange, but when I looked again, it didn&#39;t seem to be there. It seemed to be moving slowly directly away from me, only growing slightly smaller in the sky. At this point, I saw the lights of a plane heading toward the airport, and heard the usual airplane noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started down the hill toward home, and had my back to the object for one minute. I turned to see if my lower vantage point blocked it from view, and the craft was now moving in the opposite direction, toward the northeast, and it seemed be moving more quickly. At that point I reached my home and headed inside, so I cannot say what happened after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have looked up pictures of lanterns and hot air balloons at night, and it looks like it could have been either of those. I doubt hot-air balloons would fly so closely to the airport, though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Link to video provided below.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I (and our dog) left the house around 8PM to walk the dog and go to the store.  I noticed a red pulsing light between some houses across the street from our place, around the corner.  I mentioned it to my mother and then I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we approached the main road, we saw the light again, across the street from us, high enough up.  From that distance it looked to be about the size of a nickel, sometimes appearing to grow to the size of a quarter and sometimes a little bigger.  I noticed it seemed to follow us, so we stopped moving to make sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we stopped moving, it was ahead of us, but moved back toward us.  If we stood still to watch it a while, we noticed multiple lights and different colors (red, blue, green, white, yellow and purple).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also seemed to pulse at regular intervals, as if to convey some kind of code.  It moved up, down, sideways, go around in a circle, backwards and then would do some type of movement which looked like it was riding a wave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It in fact did follow us all the way to the store and back home again, until we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  I did see something similar on 09/12/2014 while driving up to the country, I first saw it on one side of the car, seemingly following the same path, then lost sight of it, then saw it again on the other side of the car for a while until I couldn’t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing lasted about 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> To whom it may concern,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel pretty silly about all of this but a few days ago, I found a video on Youtube showing an LED kite which apparently, some students from Rideau High School in Ottawa were flying a few streets down from my place, on the very same night I thought I saw a UFO (09/16/2014).  Here is the video I saw:<n> <n><n> <n><n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEwCBT-1KsI<n> <n><n> <n><n> From this video, it&#39;s pretty obvious that the object seen is NOT a UFO, but from my perspective and location it looked rather blurry in the distance and moved oddly and could have easily been mistaken for a UFO or something other than a kite.  It definitely looked nothing like what you see in the video but exhibited the same colors.  That is why I I feel pretty confident that what we see in this video must be what I saw - same night around the same time.  I still feel pretty silly.  The only thing I can&#39;t account for is the red light, which, like I said, had followed a friend and I on a country road a few days before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time<n> <n><n> <n><n> Honestly,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

We were driving out on my street going East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was completely clear and blue. Sunset had started and I was looking at the sky admiring the scenery.  The sun light coming from the west was shining bright when reflected by planes cruising at very high altitude.  I saw at least 6 planes cruising at very high altitude, probably 30k to 36k feet, following two routes patrern from east to west.  Every single one of the planes had very visible chemtrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I realized there was a extremely bright esphere by one of the airplanes. It stroke me as odd, because it was too early yet for stars to appear in the sky.  I told my wife to look at it, and we both realized that the brightness of the object was coming from the reflection of the sun light.  It was definitely metalic and reflecting the sun light.  But how could that be?  The object was in the form of a large esphere, about 2 to 3 times the size of the airplane nearby it. It was crusing along the airplane.  About the same altitude and same speed.  No chemtrail whatsoever!  We realized then that we could be looking at a UFO!  We were very skeptical at first.  But then the object which seemed to be following the airplane, turned to the opposite side, and start accelerating eastward.  The speed in which it was going was about 10 times the speed of the planes.  Then It just went straight up and the bright faded until it was gone out of sight, which took about 3 to 5 seconds!  We could tel! it was going up, because it was not going in the direction of the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was it.  My wife and I looked at each other almost not believing what just had happened!<n>

Just after exiting the front entry door, I looked up to check for any wasp nests under the overhang from the roofline edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment, I immediately noticed an object hovering in the clear open sky, past the roof of the apartments, opposite my own.  The object shape was sort of fuzzy and hard to make out, but it was silent, and flashed 3 red lights, then 3 white lights.  The object looked close enough to have made a sound, if it had been a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object very slowly floated off to my right (in an Easterly direction), and got gradually farther away, but I could still clearly see the alternating lights flashing, red then white, red then white...<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about one minute of watching the object, a dragonfly insect flew close to where I stood on my balcony, and for a brief second distracted me from the object.  When I looked back at where the object should have been, there was no lights or sign of the ufo anymore - as if it had &#39;blinked off&#39; or simply just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the sky for half a minute more, but there was nothing at all to seen in the blue, above me.<n>

While facing North, I noticed an unusually bright star.  The &#34;star&#34; accelerated from a fixed position moving from West to East.  I noticed a number of fainter, smaller, star-like objects floating around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area around the brighter object was distorted in a type of lensing effect. Very briefly a cone of light like a spot light emanated from the side of it.  I called my daughter over to witness the object as it sped away.  We agreed there were no strobing light, no colored lights, no sound, and therefore, it was not a conventional/commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live close to the airport and always recognize commercial aircraft readily.<n>

Alarm was set for 7am but thought I’d get up and check the weather outside.  It was still dark and the sky was extremely clear, no clouds, and the stars were quite visible.  I decided to go get my camera and take some pictures of the stars since there were so many and visibility was excellent.  I looked up at a group of stars and noticed one of them was moving.  It was a ball of light, silent, and travelling fairly quickly. I thought to myself this is no star or meteorite because of the speed of the object.  I’ve seen meteorites and they fade out pretty fast and travel like a bullet and are gone.  I grabbed my camera and tried to film it with no success. It was pretty high up, maybe 3-5000 feet up.  I watched it for about 90 seconds until it was no longer in sight. Then lo and behold another appeared travelling high up and went by one of those stars that twinkle and appear to change color.  It was also high up (ball of light) and I couldn’t focus for a good picture.  At the same moment in a different area in the sky there was an airplane flying with the typical blinking navigational lights and jet engine sound.  The two were completely different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my attention was drawn to this apparent star that was very bright and changing color. Even to the naked eye I could see it change color. I had my camera on a tripod and started to shoot video and a few pictures. This object whatever it was bluish in color and went from a ball of light to a hexagon with a slight dark spot in the middle. Do stars change colors and shapes?? I don’t know. I thought maybe it was the Earth’s atmosphere and it’s distance from Earth that caused these variations in shape and color. Whatever it was it was fascinating to watch and I videotaped it for about 16 minutes. Unfortunately the balls of light just wouldn’t cooperate with my camera. Here’s an interesting tidbit. I was going through the reports on your site and noticed someone in Surfside Beach, SC reported a red ball of light in the sky on 9/19/14. They said when they zoomed in, it looked like a human brain with shades of gray. Although I couldn’t capture this with my camera, when I used my! binoculars to look at this apparent star, it too looked like a brain in the sky. It was really cool looking and when I went out of focus with the binoculars is when it looked like a wired brain in the sky. I thought maybe I was seeing things. Now I know someone else saw a ball of light when zooming in taking on the appearance of a brain. I think I will coin the term UFB,meaning &#34;unidentified flying brain”. Of course I’m poking a little fun at this but this story is absolutely true. I think many people see odd things in our skies but never take the time to ponder something really different just happened. If I can I will post the picture of this pulsating star and video on your site.<n>
9/16/14 04:40|Escondido|CA|Light|20 seconds|Two distinct lights, similar to satellites, one following other, rotate about axis, change positions and then direction.|9/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113629.html|438|ndxe201409| Two distinct lights, similar to satellites, one following other, rotate about axis, change positions and then direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just outside our house in Escondido at approximately 4:40am on the morning of 9/16/2014. My husband just went back inside for a minute.  I was staring up at the sky, stargazing as I very often do. It&#39;s a treat when I get to see a meteorite or even a passing satellite.  But this time...<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two very bright, but very high lights passing from East to West.  I&#39;ve seen many satellites passing in my life, and if I had to guess, they were many miles from each other, but within about 5 degrees from each other in my field of view.  They looked like most satellites do when passing, a white to red/orange reflective light, but they were slightly brighter than other satellites I had observed.  One following the other perfectly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, a few seconds after I saw them, they rotated about an axis and switched positions while still moving West, and continued on in perfectly swapped places.  Then the new lead light continued on, while the new trailing light veered off South and disappeared.  The leading light soon disappeared (faded) as I would expect of a satellite reentering the earth&#39;s shadow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this in the span of 15-20 seconds.  My observation covered an arc of about 45 degrees from the time I noticed until the remaining light was not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have observed many passing satellites, the space station, the old shuttles in my life.  I am a smoker who is up late night and early morning and go outside and stare at the sky.  I&#39;ve never seen an event like this, and my main reaction was to repeatedly say out loud, &#34;What is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> And this was of course one of the few times I&#39;ve walked outside without my phone on me, not that I think it would have recorded a viable video even if I had gotten to it in time.<n>

It was so low and so bright I thought it was a hoax.  But I can&#39;t get it out of my mind.  Just like previously reported it was right above 69 and DuPont.  And right above my apartment complex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else seen it please say so.thanks.  I swear I&#39;m totally real.  Still kind of freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was right above my head at times about 500 feet above me and made absolutely no noise and the lights kept turning on and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the lights were off you could see a single whit light at the center of the craft. It was probably 50 feet wide<n>

I watched it go from almost directly overhead to about a 65 degree angle at low speeds. (assuming 90degrees is straight up.).  However the oddest part was the accompaniment of a aircraft that had a blinking light that caught up to it. as the second aircraft caught up, on this clear night I watched the solid light object go from 60degrees to around 45 degrees at a much higher speed than the blinking light could.  it left it behind and they never caught back up to eachother.  my only problem is I didn&#39;t know till recently that only military aircraft in a wartime zone could change their lights to off or not blinking otherwise it was mandatory to have signal lights.  the light was a solid white orb. not very big, but was about 2x the size of the blinking aircrafts lights.  I couldn&#39;t tell if the object made a sound or not seeing how the other aircraft did. but I know it didn&#39;t change color didn&#39;t blink just kept moving slowly then quickly.<n>

It was observed for aprox 30 min then noticed an aircraft overhead.  Object then became bright, then dimmed to reveal a shape of an inverted wye.  Then object became illuminated again moving to the left on the horizontal seemingly paralleling the aircraft and mimicking the strobe pattern of the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She then lost sight of the aircraft (plane) and the object was seen doing circular motions and then vanished to the right in the night sky.  There is mention of hearing the actual aircraft (plane) overhead but nothing for the &#34;object&#34; and we had another sighting on sat 09/13/14 at aprox 2130 hrs as a blinking light white,red,green all at the same time from an object at a great distance.  Object seemed to move within the same area for an extended amount of time before it not seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I almost called the PD to ask if there was helicopter traffic over Middletown but didn&#39;t want to come off as a freak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I spotted a rich, blue light in the sky north of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started watching it, and it seemed to be hovering slowly.  It would pulsate very slowly from blue to white, and I happened to see a little red.  Then it stayed a rich blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started to head east, then flipped around completely and quick and headed west.  It was truly amazing.  We couldn&#39;t watch it any longer as it went behind buildings and such.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope we&#39;ll get to see it again.<n>

Description is the same but event details are different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight we saw an orange &#34;fireball&#34; that flickered reddish and looked like an airplane on fire at first.  Didn&#39;t make any noise.  This evening it approached a bit slower than the other nights and then stayed in place for about 2 minutes.  It started to move again, about 90 degrees from how it approached but for the first time of the three nights did NOT pass right over our yard.  The &#34;fireball&#34; then flickered and went out.  None of us has ever seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night (second event of three) it seemed as if the object had a rotating light emanating from it but it was hard to tell because the whole thing flickers somewhat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to get a video but didn&#39;t have enough memory.  We&#39;ll try again tomorrow because it has come around the same time each (3) event.<n>

I was crossing the street to enter my vehicle, when I looked up and saw a hovering fireball about 250 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my perspective, it appeared to be as large as a penny, and simply burned in one spot for about fifteen minutes.  It didn&#39;t move, or burn out.  The color was a reddish orange, like embers in a fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, I started the car and left.  There were no clouds in the sky, the street was empty, and everything was quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no explanation for what it could be, as directional mathematics would have placed it over the outskirts of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the object was not the Sun, we have no idea what it could have been.

I looked up and became aware that the approaching “jet” in the N/S flight route, did not appear to have wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I said something to my friends, who seemed unimpressed.. and kept on talking.  It was fairly high and I had time to go in the house and get my binoculars and camera.  I looked through the binoculars and said, yep, no wings, and again tried to get my friends interested, to no avail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then got the camera out and I had to zoom all the way out.  Took a picture when it was closer and about to start going away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was to the extreme east hand side of the regular N/S flight route.  I don’t know why my friends would not get interested.  I don’t know why I forgot the sighting until I was looking back through photos and came across it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Funny thing is, everything before it is date stamped, and everything except the one right next to it, is date stamped.  There is a gap from 9/11 to 9/27.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No lights, no windows, no writing, dark colored.  Just came into sight, flew by, and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total duration:  5 to 7 minutes?  No sound.

9/15/14 06:45|Vail|CO|Sphere|90 minutes|Bright object seen over Vail for 90 minutes.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness observed the balloon over NM.  PD))|9/25/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113769.html|450|ndxe201409| Bright object seen over Vail for 90 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work as a security officer at the medical facility in town and on Monday morning, 9/15, at about 0645 AM I was patrolling outside the facility and looked up at a clear blue sky to see the moon off to the south.  I was surprised to see a very bright object below and to the right of the moon, more towards the SSW.  I watched it for several minutes and it appeared completely stationary.  While it did not appear to be a bright star or planet I went back inside and checked the &#39;Heaven&#39;s Above&#39; site and there was nothing seen near the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back outside and watched the object again, and over a dozen or more employees and visitors saw the object too.  During this time the object, which had appeared to be stationary, began to move very slowly to the east.  It was still in the sky around 0810 when I went out with two employees to see if we could still see it, which we could, though it was now in the southeast and still visible despite the sun being up.  I took 8 photos with my I-phone and when enlarged on my computer do not show any detail.  The consensus of the people who saw the object was that it was a high altitude balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it might be a large balloon, and if so would likely be known to the FAA and tracked by their radar. I called the Eagle County airport and was told that they knew nothing about large balloons in the area, and suggested I call the FAA.  Eventually I talked with a supervisor in the FAA Denver office who said they had no information on any large balloons over Vail at the time.  They suggested I contact your site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There I read about the sightings that occurred around Albuquerque/Santa Fe area on the 13th, and thought it might be the same thing.  I also read the article on the X-Calibur balloon which was interesting and if the balloon operates at 120,000 feet then it would not be a worry for the FAA.  It would be nice to know more about this balloon and if it had been launched as planned, and where it traveled to so far.  Also knowing wind directions over this time.  Fort Sumner is about 140 miles southeast of Albuquerque and the winds often come out of the southwest this time of the year, but then there might not be wind at 120,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a MUFON field investigator, currently inactive, who have had numerous sightings out here, so when I saw this object I thought it might be a UFO.  Eagle County is a very active area and was among the top 100 counties in the U.S. in reported UFO sightings, I think about 95th on the list.  As a MUFON investigator I have done about three dozen investigations in the area, and also have talked with dozens of people who have had good UFO sightings out here that were never officially reported.  We have had some cattle mutilations and reports of orbs over the years.  I have had several dozen good sightings myself, including three where the UFO was within a few hundred feet of me. It&#39;s amazing what you might see when you look up a lot.  I have had two good LITS sightings in the last two months, one on 8/14 and the other on 9/2, and will do reports at your sight in a day or two.  Also I will call to see if you have any more info on this X-Calibur balloon.<n>

Upon looking at with more attention, it was moving side to side and up and down.  It was also flickering different color lights: white/blue, red, green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point it was not a star, it could be an aircraft.  It then began moving in ways that did not indicate an airplane or a helicopter.  No sound came from it, though it seemed far enough away that I would not hear sound from a craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke my wife to confirm what I was seeing.  She confirmed it was moving in ways that did not seem natural to a plane.  We also noticed another object but farther away behaving the same way.  It was from my view about 10-15% north of the larger object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also began to noticed what can only be described as sparkles around the object.  Not on the object but all around it, some close some farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for about 45 minutes, I fell back asleep due to the time of the sighting unintentionally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also note that I live near a closed down, small airfield.  It has been closed down for 20 years.<n>

This happened on 2 nights, one was the 19th or 26th of August and again in September, about 5 weeks later.  While I did not see a saucer,  it was strange that o could not locate what was creating the lighting effects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is long but I am trying to get in the many details that were not the usual things I heard and saw almost every Tuesday night for the past 5 or 6 years that I have slept in my car by the river at East Fork, San Gabriel River, up from the city of Azusa, in Los Angeles County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first years a lot of prospectors stayed there, but the last few years, most of the time I am completely alone.  I have some Google Earth photos of the spot if you want them by email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a river fork off Hwy 39, where the highway runs along the top of a steep edge with paths down to the water in the national forest.  I am so alone there most of the time the lst few years that, unless people have seen bears, I leave the car windows down and do not lock the doors or even display my forest pass. I park near a forest service rest room near the 4.96 mile marker on East Fork Road.  The right side seats on my Honda CR-V go down flat to make a bed thatis very comfortable. I always leave the radio on low playing coast 2 coast, and I usually fall asleep part of the time, and miss some of the program, then later wake up and hear the parts I missed. I also an doing research on subjects related to Sitchin’s work, and I almost always have a book that I read  if I wake up and can’t sleep, and I mark pages and sentences related to my work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am so familiar with the noises, and often complete absence of any sounds at all, that any unusual noise wakes me up. Though people have reported UFO’s, the reports I have heard are not likely to relate to UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am quit familiar with UFO activity from being a volunteer at UFO and free energy conferences for over 20 years, and going on a lot of trips to spots considered active that few people go to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several weeks before the first event, two men parked their trailer across the road from where I camp, and leave it to go prospecting in the evenings and during the night.  They leave one dollar store yard light stuck in the ground. Sometimes a truck was left hitched, other times just the trailer was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Either way from where I park, it often looked like there was some light escaping from a covered window in front of the trailer.  The steep rock faces on both sides of the river seem to be covered with foliage, but when the moon is up the rock face reflects some spots that seem very bright, and you have to know the area to be sure if it is moon or headlights coming down the road to up on a higher road that winds up to connect with other roads.  The slope down the rock face to the river level is so steep and the rocks so solid that you never hear the flow of the river on top by the highway. You have to get out of the car and walk right to the edge to hear anything at all and the water level is so low this summer that you can hardly find a place deep enough to get your body all wet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in Army Intelligence, and pay attention to out of place things, and for some reason when I wake at night I always want to a analyze what woke me, and if there are lights, what the source of them is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where I put the radio on the dash it sometimes needs to be angled to eliminate a buzz, but most of the time the reception is crystal clear.  It was the week before and the week after the first incident, that there was radio interference different from any I had ever heard. I changed to a different radio and still heard it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night I think was September 14th, the radio was fine. Before  I went to sleep, I thought I saw a sort of very fast strobe light in the sky to the west, but it was so fast and the sky was still somewhat bright, so I could not be sure if I had seen it or  my eyes were playing tricks on me.  It was an extremely quiet night and I woke up later, turning over in bed, and I thought I saw the light again, this time from someplace by the drivers side  back fender.  You know when you have a light source you look at and then away, and you see a dark outline of the object, drifting away in a different place? And sometimes there are several overlapped images fanning out?  Well each time I saw the faint light strobes I saw 30-50 overlapping thin lines like part of a Japanese fan, with the lines going to someplace out of the frame where you assumed they were connected with a pin so the fan could fan out. But I could never see the bottom half of the fan segments, and it would move around! fast. Sometimes I did not hear the sound even though there was no sound at all outside.  I would turn off the radio for a few minutes so I could hear carefully.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That first night, after the 4th or 5th time I woke to this, I began to think that the sound was caused by a source that reflected off of the metal parts of the trailer or other metal objects such as the large iron trash cans. And by then I was certain that there was a bluish tint to the strobing lights, as faintly as I could see them. It was the fact that the light always seemed bluish, when nothing else ever did, that made me think it was something real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second night I saw and heard this,  was about 5-8 weeks later when I came out of sleep and realized that I was hearing a very low sound of electricity fizzling, like signs neon signs do in cheap horror movies, or arc welding when sparks fly around.  I realized then that the low sound was what woke me up, but if I was awake I saw them when there was no sound or it was too low to hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The truck was not parked by the trailer, but I was almost certain I saw some pale blue light coming through a crack in that window.  Later when I looked over there, I was sure I still saw bluish light, but could not hear any sound. I  decided that the men must be inside the trailer working with some electrical device, and that bluish light was coming out the window where blinds did not meet exactly right. Late the next morning they arrived in the truck, so they had not been there during the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night when I used the restroom I did not see the faint strobe light or hear the sound.  But I did wake up a few times and hear the sound and see the faint light, and  tried to pinpoint the direction of the sound, thinking that would help to figure out the light source. I was not able to do it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The guy with the trailer had told me the week before that they (forest service or sheriffs?) told him he had to move it to the north fork for 14 days, then he could come back. But he never did come back, and neither did anyone else.   Many of the guys up there had no place to go, and the place the guy said he planned to move to, had a nightly use fee that the old prospectors could not pay.  Also, it is general knowledge that there is no gold on north fork, and the river is really far from the fee camp.   Usually when the old guys were told to get out, they hiked  past the paved road to three mile camp or just hid out in the camping places down by the river that were invisible to anyone looking from the top.  If they had done this, I would have seen them walking down the road at night to go down to Williams where they had friends at the trailer park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it was the next week that there was the bad buzz from the radio, and I became alarmed, which I almost never do.  When they tell people to leave, there is just no one there when I arrive Tuesday nights, and thinking everyone is gone, they do not drive by to check, also, it is the sheriffs that do this, when they do not have jurisdiction on forest land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well this is a lot to read, but I want to stress again that it was it was your description of the lights that made me think i should report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There have been odd things going on at East Fork for a long time, but I never associated them with UFO’s.<n>

I always look up at the sky.  I work in Dansville, N.Y., and that night it was a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was walking in to work I saw a flash of Light.  It lasted about 2 seconds and was bright enough to light up the sky and to be able to see detail of the hills like it was day time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked to see if there was any Storms in the area for lightning but, the closest lightning strikes was over 1,100 miles away.  I also listen to see if I could hear the fire whistle because of the brightness of the light I thought that maybe there might have been an accident or maybe something exploded like a transformer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something logical to explain the flash but, there was no noise and the fire department was not deployed.  So I have no idea what the flash was.  It was strange.<n>

It was bigger than a commercial airplane, but I could not tell exactly how big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving very fast, and the movement was in a single direction and very smooth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving from Fairbanks area, over Ft.

I did not see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A small group of colored moving lights caught my eye.  It was approximately due west of my house in Centralia and just above the horizon, which in this case is a hill known as Cooks Hill.  The lights were just above the hill, probably at around 15 – 20 degrees elevation from a true level horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was bobbing around in one area and not moving in any one direction.  I watched for about five minutes and then went to get my binoculars.  With the binoculars, it was more clearly about four lights.  They were positioned with a green light at the top, then perhaps two red lights in the middle, and another green light at the bottom.  There was also the typical yellow light amongst them but it was hard to hold the binoculars steady so that there was some jiggling of the object.  The small area covered by the lights would be about the size of the full moon.  The yellow, red and green lights, in size and brightness, were much the same as airplane lights in size and brilliance.  But if they were from an airplane it was not going anywhere.  I watched for about ten minutes, total, and the small group of lights just bobbed around, up and down, side to side, much as a fishing bobber that was being dangled above the water but not in it.  I could hear no sounds of an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went to turn on my computer at 22:29, in those few seconds, the object(s) was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could possibly have been a helicopter but the prolonged bobbing around motion in the same spot does not seem like a practical explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area over and beyond Cook’s Hill is mostly wooded but with homes along the rural Cook’s Hill Road.  When I last looked at the area of the sighting, at 23:00, they had not reappeared.<n>

(1000+mph?).  It was far enough in front of us that i never considered reducing my driving speed, but vanished behind the trees along the highway in a matter of seconds.

The object was large.  It first appeared the be a star but then rose as if to hover.  Movement could be seen while it continued its ascent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was clear and stars could be seen in all directions.  The craft was bright.  It was not an aircraft.  There were no blinking lights like a normal aircraft would have.  After approximately 7 minutes the object disappeared as if someone had turned off a light switch.  The action was immediate.  I would estimate the altidude at 4 thousand feet or approximately a 45 degree angle from the beach to the sky.  I am 100 percent sure this was not a passenger aircraft or any other type of airplane.<n>

9/14/14 20:40|Katy|TX|Changing|I witnessed it for over t|UFO near Detention Pond in Katy, Texas, Emanates Threatening Gunfire Sounds.|9/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113584.html|469|ndxe201409| UFO Near Detention Pond in Katy, Texas, Emanates Threatening Gunfire Sounds<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was doing medical research on the computer, when suddenly I heard loud gunshot-type sounds behind the home I rent a room in.  In short, order two more bursts of these sounds alarmed me.  I went to the window.  The house is adjacent to a water detention pond that is fenced off, and the ground slants towards the pond.  This area is behind the fence of the backyard of the home I live in.  I can&#39;t see the pond from my room; just the slanting land to the right of it and part of the fence.  Actually, my room is the ONLY vantage point of this area in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Alarmed, I pulled the curtains back to see if a shoot-out or home invasion might be taking place in a neighboring area.  It was very dark.  In the extreme right corner of this detention pond area, on the ground, I saw a very bright light.  I judged it had to be at least 20 feet across because on foot it is close to 1/8 of a mile from my window.  I say this because although it was very dark (my landlord refuses to put lights in the backyard, and the house is next to this area and some woods also) I could see this object with startling clarity.  It was not smalll even from the distance of my viewing point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it emitted the last burst of gunfire, I unfroze and called 911.  I described the situation to the dispatch officer.  She said, &#34;We are getting other calls about it,&#34; and basically disconnected me after asking for my name.  I watched from the window for over two hours:<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my knowledge, no police approached the object on foot, nor was a helicopter dispatched.  On the left my vision was completely blocked by huge oak trees.  I could vaguely see house lights from another sector of the neigborhood that is adjacent to this detention pond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, trying to peer through the leaves of these trees from my vantage point in my room on the second floor, I thought I saw red and blue lights (police cars) near those other homes. It was very brief.  They probably took a look and ran.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object pulsated from dim to brightly starlike over and over again. It appeared disabled or unable to achieve a getaway.  I don&#39;t know why I had this feeling that it was disabled. I was hoping to watch it make its getaway but missed that event.  These things can disappear, btw, without a grand getaway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made itself known with the extremely loud gunfire sounds, so it obviously wanted to be discovered but not approached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told the police dispatcher about the gunfire so likely if the police approached, they of course would not attempt a close encounter but rather a distant viewing angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many UFOs in the USA and in foreign territories. I was shocked and dismayed about this thing being ON THE GROUND and making warlike noises.  I looked at the area this morning and saw no evidence of scorching or gunfire destruction.  Perhaps the sounds were meant to achieve another goal...a &#39;look at me but don&#39;t dare approach&#39; message.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as long as I could but eventually fell asleep.  A few months back I saw two of these starlike things in another neighborhood, practically on top of a house.  I had an eyewitness with me.  Interestingly, it was also adjacent to a detention pond in that neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My contact info on this form will be scant but a 911 call was placed by me and I gave them my full name.  Again, I was told others were alsocalling in while I was on the phone with the dispatch officer.<n>

We watched them go Eastward.  I kept watching them and following the jets with my eyes and head and could still hear them as they went by us and now I could see their tail ends, when all of a sudden a white flat circle that was brighter than the white clouds flew across (intercrossed) the tail ends of the jets.  My husband quit watching the jets as they had crossed over him.  He just slightly turned his head to watch them.  The jets were flying one behind the other keeping perfect spacing between each other.  I followed the bright white circle until it went behind a tree that obstructed our view.  The white Circle didn&#39;t go behind the tree on purpose, it was just a big tree that was on the side of the house that blocked my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband watched me stand up and follow the circle with my eyes and he turned to see what I was looking at and pointing at, that&#39;s when our view was ob! structed by our tree. The circle was flying as fast and steady as the jets and was very high in the sky. It was a perfect circle, brighter, whiter than a cloud. It looked flat almost like a orb dancing in your vehicle from jewelry or a watch that the sun reflected off of.  The circle didn&#39;t fly behind the tree on purpose it was just a big tree beside our house that blocked our view from seeing the circle any longer.  The circle was moving as fast and steady as the jets and was very high in the sky. There was no sound from the circle.  I don&#39;t know if the circle came out from a cloud next to the jets or where it came from.  I just began seeing it come from the right side going to the left side of the back end of the jets.  It was a sunny day.  Yes, there was some clouds but sun was shining and the wind was blowing.  My husband didn&#39;t see it because he didn&#39;t react fast enough and the tree obstruction didn&#39;t help.<n>

I saw a bright object--like a star--about one finger’s length from the sun, my finger one foot from my nose.  I observed it for 5 or 6 minutes, during which time it never moved.  The bright light was stationary.  Because the light did not move, I concluded that it was not any sort of ordinary aircraft (not a helicopter by any means, and no noise whatsoever), nor was it a balloon, because high altitude winds would cause it to move.  The light looked just like a star.  But, how could a star be visible shortly after noon, in a cloudless sky, a finger’s length from the blazing sun?  I have never seen a star under such conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A man and woman came walking by while I was mulling over the possibilities. I stopped them, to see if they would have a look at the bright object.  They did so, but neither knew what it might be.  One reason I asked them to look was to verify that I was seeing something, and that its nature was not evident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for 8 or 9 minutes, I went inside, but the meeting had not yet started, so I went out again to see check on the light.  It was still there, its position the same.  I was stumped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My conclusion: Something very curious was up there, but I have no idea what it might have been.<n>

We kept watching and they flew over the mountain and after that we stayed out of curiosity and suddenly we both noticed two beams of light diagonally flash and go behind the mountain.  Shortly after we heard Peeble falling as if someone was coming.  We then left.<n>

The houses here are spaced apart with some lighting on the houses and driveways and no street lights in the area where I was standing.  I noticed three reddish lights in a triangular formation in the northern sky seeming to rise and with a brighter light than the stars.  They continued to rise until they were no longer visible.  There were no contrails or sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as they seemed to dim then disappear another two appeared which were in a vertical orientation.

The object did not have apparent lights nor sound.  It flew in the approximate speed the commercial aircrafts passed but i can&#39;t be certain because i don&#39;t know in what altitude it flew.  I tried to capture it with my phone camera without flash, but when i reviewed the photos in the computer, I could not identify it unfortunately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking in the internet, I came across your site and was shocked to see that a similar object has been captured in photo at Maryland 30 August, 2014.<n>

We were facing Northwest when we noticed a red glowing light rising up.  I have witnessed these things many times and I was excited to have him witness it as well.  He is NOT a believer.  He always tries o debunk what I see by saying it was Chinese lanterns or a plane.  He is now baffled by it, but I know for a fact we witness a red fireball.  It was bright red.  We were first noticed the fireball when it was the size of a tiny red star.  Then all of a sudden It grew bigger and then smaller as it was rising.  This thing was huge in the distance.  It grew to the size of a basketball.  Then would reduce to the size of star all while glowing and floating.  Then after about a minute, it shrank again and completely vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend of course was in disbelief trying to debunk it, but what sealed the deal was the helicopter to followed that circled for a good 15 minutes after it disappe! ared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE:  We have not heard or seen one helicopter all night or ll day for that matter.<n>

Dark blue with rose/pink pulsaing interior light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday September 13, 2014, at 11:15 PM on the 1500 block of West Embassy Street in Anaheim California 92802 (the cross street is Loara 1 block south of Lincoln Avenue).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the following:  In the middle of the street (Embassy Avenue) I saw an egg shaped object floating 2-3 feet off the ground.  The object was about 2 ½ feet across and it was approximately 20 feet away from me.  It was a dark blue like an India ink blue and it blended into the night and the black asphalt.  The only illumination was from a street light.  I first thought it might have been a helium balloon that had drifted from Disneyland.  Disneyland is about 2 miles away and sometimes helium balloons float away and they land in the area.  Upon close inspection it had no string attached to it and it stayed in the same position.  It never touched the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached the object I could see that the “balloon” had a thin semi-transparent membrane covering it.  Inside the object I could see a faint rose/pink colored light that was the size of a football and the light slowly pulsated.  It was a faint light.  Not bright.  And it was inside the object.  The object was smooth and it looked like latex.  Not metallic.  It had no antenna, fins nor propeller.  And it had no exterior lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked towards the object it remained in place about 3 feet off the ground.  My first impression was that it may be a balloon, drone or remote controlled object.  But it made no sound.  The object was totally silent.  It seemed peaceful and tranquil.  Not threatening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked toward it (I did not run or make any fast moves), I thought I would try to capture it but when I got within about 2 feet from the object it slowly rose out of my reach straight up into the night sky.  It banked to the north and went over the buildings across the street and out of sight.  Its motion was smooth and not fast.  I never touched it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not experience any adverse reaction from it.  In fact it seemed inviting and almost playful.  I regret I did not have a camera with me to photograph it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alone and no one else to my knowledge saw the object.<n>

The sky is usually clear and it was this night, too.  We were crossing the Interstate 88 overpass near route 20 when we saw an unusually bright white light with a red tinge in the western sky.  It captured our attention as we crossed the overpass and began to turn on our home street.  The object was spherical, bright, and deep red.  My wife was sure it occupied the Northwestern part of the sky just 60 seconds ago, although now it wasn&#39;t moving fast.  It was the biggest object visible in the sky, so much so that we pulled over to look at it some more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bizarrely, staring at the object gave both of us the perception of VERY large, red lightning streaks emanating from it.  I vocalized this red streaks experience and my wife said the same was happening to her; the streaks appeared more orange to her.  At this point we pull out and iphone 5 to capture the brilliance of it on camera.  Naturally, the video just shows a bright white sphere against a black background.  The camera could not see what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We must have watched the sphere for a few minutes.  We had the inclination to drive another .5 miles to go home and get a better camera.  We started the car and the object lost its red brilliance.  Within 5 seconds of losing the red streaks characteristics, it disappeared by closing in on itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving and lamenting this fact, a much faster moving and closer red and white object was visible in the Southwestern sky.  The first object was far away.  This second one was so close and so low that it appeared to descend quickly just over some trees not that far away.  The road did not exactly allow us to investigate exactly where we thought  this thing was aiming to land.  The second red object lacked the red streaks characteristic of the first one.<n>

As my girlfriend and I were driving she pointed to a huge set of white lights that were almost hovering or moving slowly (I was driving so maybe because I was also moving) over a neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were seven lights, maybe nine, in an arrowhead type triangle formation, basically no flat third side of the triangle shape, as it went inward.  I drew an interpretation of what I saw and can show you the drawing of light setups.  Anyway, they were all bright white lights, and as we tried to find a place to pull over, the lights dimmed to about 25% of what they were.  It blinked red once or twice before I stopped getting a clear view from trees and houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15-30 seconds we pulled over and it was completely gone. I looked towards the local airport direction and saw nothing in the sky and I could see the stars, moon, and very clear sky.  It was weird not seeing anything in the sky only a minute after that, which makes me know it was not an airplane or helicopter.  Also this formation of lights or underneath of something, was about 400 feet above us if I had to guess.  Maybe even less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was 10:35 PM in Macungie/Wescosville area outside of Allentown, PA.  Time stamp of 10:36 PM calling my friend, so well say we saw it at 10:34-10:35 PM<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below is a picture of what I thought the light formation looked like.  This is the best characterized way I can describe the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> O O o O O  o  O<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two little circles are smaller to represent that they were higher up, not making a full triangle, but more like an arrowhead shape.<n>

I pulled over where highway 1804 approaches the northwest corner of Lake Trenton to observe.  I took a video using my iPhone.  It was too dark for the video to be of any use, but it did provide me with accurate location, time, and duration of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was approximately 100ft in the air and 200 ft from me when I pulled to the side of the road.  I flashed my head lights at it, but got no response.  I exited my vehicle and watched it continued to travel silently, perhaps fifteen to thirty miles per hour, away from me at a consistent altitude until disappearing out of sight.  The object had a reddish orange flickering light at its center.  It was roughly the size of a large trash can and spherical to ovoid in shape, but the central light made its boundaries diffuse and hard to definitively make out.<n>

There was another ball of white light higher in the sky moving all around, not just in one direction.  It too disappeared.  Saw a blinking white and red light rapidly flying across the sky and as we pointed it out, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before these sightings, my dog started maniacally barking at something behind my shed in the backyard.  We could not get her to stop, so my daughter started taking pictures.   Several strange lights appear behind the shed including a circular shaped light and a triangular group of three lights that seemed to move in two different pictures.  It is possible that the circular looking shape is an entity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We let the dog loose and she ran around the shed and across the yard like she was chasing something.  However, we could not see what she was chasing.  We also heard a strange clicking noise, unlike any night insect or animal we have ever heard.  It sounded like the clicks were communicating from two different sides of my yard.  We also heard a humming noise, like the engine of an aircraft hovering.  Eventually both noises stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time we have experienced the flying lights and humming.  Almost every night, my dog goes crazy barking at the same part of the yard behind the shed.  The first time I saw the light hovering over my neighbor’s house, I pointed it out to my daughter and it vanished.  Will email images.<n>

That night, five of us walked out to the beach to catch the moonrise over the hills.  While sitting on the beach, I noticed a bright red light in the sky.  The light was changing to blue, green, white… I thought for sure it was a plane.  But then I noticed it wasn’t moving, it was just hovering.  The light began to zig-zag, drop and rise and shoot left to right and back to the left again. It would move in lines that were diagonal to the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching this UFO for about 20 minutes, a few more friends showed up and another UFO lit up in the sky, but located on the oceans horizon.  This one glowed bright orange.  A third UFO appeared to the right of the second UFO.  All three UFO’s were moving around in various shapes and speeds and flickering their lights at one another, as if they were signaling each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first and third UFO flew out of there with no trace, leaving the second UFO in the sky.  This one was by far the most active of the three.  It had to have been at least 25 miles from us, but at times it moved closer to us, the light was bigger and brighter.  It split at one point and then rejoined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon came up over the hills a little after 11:20pm.  As the moon was rising, the UFO was almost playing “peek a boo” with it.  The UFO would dip under the horizon and then shoot right back up, zig-zag on the sky and plummet again or shoot off to the left or right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was such an amazing night to watch the UFO’s.  All of my friends and I were in complete awe that we got to witness this rare sighting.<n>

Her friend interrupted our conversation and pointed out there were strange lights in the sky facing SW of the hotel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately pulled out my phone and started capturing what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had seen the recent reports with similar descriptions and the red color we first noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were at least 15 spheres moving together and changing color from red to a brighter almost yellow gold color.  Some were breaking off and forming triangle formations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took off running on Horizon Dr heading West. I was capturing these objects and talking to people near by alerting them to look at these lights in the sky above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few thought they were Chinese Lanterns that were launched, but being so close to the airport and freeway it seemed like it would be a dangerous thing to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I e-mailed the Bookcliff Country Club GM on the 14th inquiring if they had hosted a party that may have launched some Chinese Lanterns.  I have not heard anything back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my opinion they did not resemble or move like Chinese Lanterns would have and they match similar recent reports, including the UFOs over Olympia, WA.<n>

What appeared to be sparks were falling from the sides and trailing edge of several of them.  I was looking at them through 16 power binoculars.  The bottom of each round object appeared to be composed of multiple circles of light such as an LED flashlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard no sound from them.  The height was above the cloud layers.  The clouds appeared to be at or above 15,000 feet.  The cloud layer they overflew was approximately 10 miles due south of our location.  They appeared to be well above that cloud level.  There were 3-4 loose formations of 8-10 objects.  Several minutes after the last formation there were two “Tail End Charlies.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an ATP/CFII/MEI with over 4000 hours.<n>

Just off to the left (perhaps the South by South East direction) of the cloud I also noticed what I thought was a helicopter heading directly for our local airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are used to seeing helicopters fly from the direction of Albuquerque to the airport several times a week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked at this incoming helicopter, I noticed it had a rather large orange-reddish glow to it.  It soon came clear to me that this was not an approaching helicopter, as it was not showing the usual outline of the shape of any aircraft at all.  The incoming light was nothing more than just that, a large, soft, glowing light.  I don’t feel real confident speculating the distance that the light was from me or even guessing the size of the object, it’s hard to estimate as I had nothing to compare it with as far as scale is concerned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I proceeded to complete my phone call with my cousin, I immediately ran into the house to grab my video camera.  With my camera in hand and on my way out of the house, I told my nine-year old daughter to come outside and take a look at what I was witnessing on this nearly cloudless early evening.  I powered up my video camera and began zooming in to get a closer look at the glowing object.  I was unable to zoom in on the object, which made me think that it was probably farther away then I had first thought.  I continued to look above the viewfinder with my naked eye to check for the object’s presence, it was still there.  After numerous cycles of checking the viewfinder and looking at the object with my naked eye, I was convinced that I was not going to capture the object in my zoomed in video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter continued to ask me what the object was as I just kept the camera rolling with the object in my naked eye’s view.  My daughter became frightened and decided to go back into the house.  I watched (with video camera rolling and it collecting my verbal frustration of not being able to zoom in on the object) the object growing smaller as if gaining distance between itself and me, the observer.  The object soon grew very small, made an upward climb and was soon out of my eye’s natural vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I collected my thoughts about what I had just witnessed, I thought to myself; “What makes this experience different from any other visual of a typical man-made aircraft?”  My conclusion and rationale to my self-imposed questioning of this experience made me think of the following:  If I summed up the time from the moment I first saw the object to the moment that it was seemingly its closest to me and compared it to the time it took for the object to leave the area and vanish, I would say that there’s no comparison between the two sums.  The object was able to vanish in much, much shorter time than it to took to arrive, plain and simple.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter thinks the object was red, I think it was more orange, hence, the orange-reddish description.  I am over fifty years of age, I’ve had a long career in the same occupation in public service, I am well respected in my local community, and I consider myself a very rational, logical, and reasonable human being.  I know what both my daughter and I witnessed this evening and it (the object) was not normal or typical of any man-made aircraft that I have ever seen.

Picacho, observing a very bright large white object which seemed to move very slowly, almost imperceptibly.  This was at 5:00 pm in a deep blue sky; it looked something like a bright planet, but much too large for that.  As we observed it repeatedly on our climb down we speculated it could possibly be someone in a large paraglider who had been able to catch an updraft to a very high altitude, but it hovered so long in a nearly motionless state that that would have been most unlikely.  Hours later, at a few minutes after 8 pm, we observed it again from our home east of the plaza in Santa Fe.  It had moved a few miles west during that time, and seemed to be directly over the central area of the city.  Our only magnification was a pair of opera glasses.  It appeared to have an inverted tear drop shape, almost like a balloon (spherical but with a small conical projection underneath), but without! a distinct basket, and was very brightly illuminated, as though internally lit with a very powerful light which seemed to have no distinct source--like a brilliant, radiant glow.  My wife states she was taken aback by its “otherworldly&#34; beauty.  A good description would have been an inverted tear drop shaped light bulb with faint horizontal bands.  Checking back on it at 8:45 pm, it had completely disappeared from the sky.  I was sorry not to have witnessed how it disappeared.  Its motion had been so slow I’d expected it to still be visible and was surprised at its sudden disappearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object was a hig-altitude, helium-filled balloon.

I don’t know the real name of the hill, but we call it by its shape.  We live off of Eagle River Loop Road and the lights were east of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed at least 10 to 12 bright orange lights, probably more, flying in a single file line.  They all seemed to be the same size and traveled at the same speed, which was slower than an airplane.  There was no noise that we could distinguish.  They climbed, then flew level, then climbed, then leveled out again, then climbed again continuing until they disappeared one at a time into the sky.  It almost seemed like they were somewhat following the contours of the mountains that run on the north side of the Eagle River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son, my husband and myself watched from the driveway of our home for about ten minutes and my son said that there were multiple witnesses pulled over alongside of the road as he was coming home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have witnessed similar lights here in Eagle River.  My husband and I witnessed some several months ago in a different location and two of my sons have seen the same type of lights on a couple of different occasions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

On the way I noticed a very bright white flashing in the sky.  It was like lightening but only in a small area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer I was looking for a break in the trees to get a glimpse.  Finally, I saw it twice it was flashing 4 large lights along a rectangle shape.  They flashed all at the same time and were fairly large.  If I had to guess I would say it was only about 200 yards into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled the window down in hopes to hear something but with the sound of the air coming through the window I couldn&#39;t make out any sounds.  I have never seen a UFO before and only recently began thinking about them so it seems so impossibly coincidental I would see one but I have spent all day trying to think of anything else it could be and can come up with no answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the lights were not moving. I found this site hoping someone else would have ! seen it. I plan to return to the road same time next week in hopes of seeing the same thing to help figure out what it was but don&#39;t suspect I will see anything.  I wish I could have got a picture but I was driving on a curvy road at night I couldn&#39;t just stop because I saw lights in the sky.<n>

The part that was so cool about it is that it left a blue tracer that stayed lit up for about 5 secs.  It kind of reminded me of a light saber that was blue.  I watch the sky every chance i get for years now and never had seen anything like it.  I was alone however phoned my ex girlfriend and she answered you will not believe what i had just saw.

It lasted about 5 seconds and from my viewpoint it appeared to moving vertically directly towards the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was big enough and slow enough that I definitely had the impression it would impact the ground and I would see an impact flash.  However it either appeared to burnout before impact or traveled below my horizon which is the Cascade Range (approx 75 miles away), though it appeared closer than that to me.  More like 40 to 50 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to describe its appearance, I would say it looked like the sparkling white/gold spark remnants of a very large fireworks shell as it drifts to the ground after exploding if you were sitting in the immediate vicinity of the launch area.  The speed was similar to that type of occurrence as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To be clear though, there was no explosion, noise or flash preceding its appearance.

I happened to look up towards the western sky and saw a strange light glowing behind what looked like vapor or fog--kind of like what a jet looks like when it&#39;s coming in for a landing in fog.  But it wasn’t really moving.  There was some movement to it, but very slow.  The bright white part was about as bright as the moon, and about half the size (the setting moon was also visible quite a bit to the left and higher in the sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it started to dissipate, then the light went out and there was a strange oblong &#39;glow&#39; or vapor remnant left for a few seconds, then nothing at all visible where it had been. And there was absolutely no sound or noise associated with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire event lasted maybe about 30-45 seconds. I tried taking a video with my cell phone, but it doesn&#39;t really show much and I wish I&#39;d just tried taking a photo. I am an artist though, with an excellent visual memory, and went home and drew in pastel what I remember it looking like both when the light was bright and the vapor after it went out.  I also did another drawing in pencil.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m interested in astronomy; I have seen comets, fireball meteors, planetary conjunctions, eclipses--this is like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before.  Like I said it looked like a jet coming towards me in fog, or like the top part of the moon peaking from behind clouds.  It was weird and fascinating to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The air was perfectly clear and afterwards during the walk I even saw a small plane, a helicopter, and a low flying jet headed west --and they looked nothing like what I saw; they were all crystal clear in view--no halos, vapor, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what I’ve found online this morning a lot of others saw something similar.  I sent an email to CBS news about it.  Some others reported it to a radio station.<n>

As I watched it slowly moved just a bit, then a big spray came from the back of it  in a large tear drop shape, it expanded into a cloud like shape, the bright light went out and the cloud expanded and expanded until it dissipated entirely.

Only way I could describe it would be for you to picture driving your car at night and to see a motorcycle coming towards you.  It would be about the size and shape of on coming headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, as we were both staring at it, speechless, it slowly looked as if it just kind of faded away.

The red seemed to change slightly and then it turned white and  changed shape into more of a comet with a short tail, all bright white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my friend saw it too.  The object seemed to grow much larger then and resembled a bright spot light shining into a smoke like vapor, like a v shape trailing behind the light.  The light seemed to steer towards the south and west from my position on the north shore.  The vapor seemed to expand and lighten and the light then vanished completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure what it was but I will be looking up more from now on!<n>

I hear a student say, &#34;what&#39;s that?&#34;  I turned around and at first I thought it was just a helicopter searching for someone.  Then, the bright light started spinning and growing in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point it was like a flare.  My other friend told me that if it was a flare it would&#39;ve been brighter.

It was bigger then a plane and was moving at A somewhat slow speed.  I looked at it for apx. 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was watching it, I pulled out my cell phone and walked another 10 feet to get out from under a street light.I started filming the orange  light, I could see the orange light on my phone then after another 5 to 10 seconds there was light comming from under the orange light.  These lights came in the shape of an upside down funnel.  The colors of these lights were a greenish, blueish, yellowish, whiteish in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching the lights, the orange light just disappeared.

I was looking north and saw 2 stars instead but what caught my eye was that the second star was moving.  Both stars were of the same intensity and brightness to the naked eye and it had not occurred to me it could be a moving object.  The UFO was not bright and blended well with the other night stars.  If it had not moved, you would thought it was just a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I initially thought it was a meteor/shooting star, but what made me suspicious was that it moved in a slow, crooked, line, about 1 cm per 1-1.5 sec (take a ruler and move it about 30 cm away from your face/eye and hold the ruler, that is how fast it was moving when you are looking at the night sky, I am not sure how else to describe it).  The &#34;star&#34; moved east in an obviously crooked line and eventually drifted south-east and disappeared out of sight.  It did not blink so it is unlikely it was an airplane, and it does not have other lights nor was shaped like a triangle so it may not even be a drone at all. It had no other coloured lights nor multiple lights.  The night sky was quiet and that &#34;star&#34; did not produce any sounds.  The sky was clear with no clouds so visibility was not an issue.<n>

And I quickly stood up to try to get a better view.  By that point it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve lived in this area for about a year and a half, and I&#39;m quite used to the normal police helicopters, border patrol helicopters, commercial airline planes, and private planes that move around the skies in this area; as well as the sounds they produce.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was like nothing I have ever seen before, and the fact that it produced no sound is what really made the hair on the back of my neck prick up.<n>

This activity would occur for many miles until the lights separated at a great distance from each other with one stationary &amp; the other moving away at a greater distance.  The stationary light would then rejoin the other red light until out of view.<n>

I was on the phone with my friend from work and to my left, in the sky, I saw a ball of flames gliding in the sky.  It was gliding at the rate which a balloon would glide,not fast or slow just an easy glide...I kept looking to figure out what it was,all I could tell was there were flames bouncing up and down inside this ball.  The sky was dark behind it.  You could still tell there was a dark halo above the flames,as if they were encapsulated in a ball, sort of oval/egg shaped encapsulated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to glide in a North Eastern direction for about 2 minutes, until it passed over buildings and out of my view.  There was only one,the color of the flames were red/orange glowing with white tips.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am going to draw a photo of what I saw and mail it to you, along with emailing a photo I got on my cell phone.  My phone would not allow me to video.  The video part was not showing up for me to activate, that was weird as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to enable video, once the fireball disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at a height where you knew it was high up ,but low enough that it was clear to see the bouncing flames within it.  I have never seen anything like this in my entire life.<n>

The night was bright because of the moon overhead.  High, thin clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a haul truck cresting the hill with its headlights on.  Behind and above that haul truck was what looked like a very large light falling from the sky.  It was a sphere in shape and very bright.  It was falling at about a 45 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thinking there was gonna be a loud crash.  Maybe this was a plane or something.  It was only a short distance from the ground, maybe 100 feet.  It disappeared behind a large stockpile.  The light object was about the size of two haul trucks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were four other people who saw this from all sides.  The object passed over a large roadway we call tmf2.  Crossed a water area and went just over the hill.  There it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No crash, no fire, just disappeared.  It was a solid light with no tail or anything following it and no noise of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any idea what it was, please let me know.

Couldn&#39;t have been more than a few hundred feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both lights were moving in unison together in a Southeast to Northwest direction.  I&#39;m pretty sure it was one entity because the lights themselves were not very far apart from one another, maybe 10-20 feet from my perspective. The speed was constant and slow. Lights were both extremely bright, almost to the affect of looking into a cars headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was a helicopter at first because of the speed and low altitude, but it couldn&#39;t have been because it was completely silent.

I immediately pulled over and we both watched as the orangish lights moved slowly and independently of one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, we saw what appeared to be three different objects.  There was one in the center which appeared stationary.  To its left, there was another object/set of lights moving towards it.  To the right of the center object, there was another object/set of lights that was moving towards the center.  The rightmost object/set of three lights slowly moved downward and disappeared behind the treeline.  The leftmost object/series of lights disappeared while as we were watching it in the sky.  The center object flashed and its lights seemed to rearrange in configuration.  Then it flashed and went out.  My passenger said that when she first saw the lights, the left and right objects/series of lights left a little contrail or little sparks. I did not see that part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound that we could discern from the objects. We estimate we were about a half a mile to one mile from the treeline. The night sky was clear, only a low ground fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Odd notes: after the lights were gone, we heard a screaming noise coming from the open field.  Possibly a fox or injured animal but it sure was creepy!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also had to try three or four times to get my car to start to back up.  I don&#39;t think this is really attributed to the event, though, as my car has had this issue in the past.<n>

I looked to my left about 2 or 3 miles ahead (it was dark) and there are some power poles/towers  together that have some white lights going up the sides of them.  They are not the tallest towers around, because there are a bunch of them around the few mile stretch of road, but those two are the closet two that are together.  As I got closer I noticed the color turquoise was illuminating from between the two towers.  The closer I got the more distinguished it became and at 1st I thought it had to be a blimp.  But then I realized it wasn’t big enough. It was about half the size of a blimp.  I kept looking for some kind of support under it like posts or metal legs holding it up and then I thought it must be a water tower they just put up, but I saw none when I got closer and it actually moved just a bit.  I noticed as I got closer it had a string red lights all the way around it protruding like Saturn’s halo but I think was attached.  When I got as close as I could, which was about probably a ¼- ½ mile to my left off through the woods, I saw it the best I could. It was the shape of a sphere.  Almost like you would see in a cheesy sci fi movie form the 50’s.  Illuminated in turquoise with the red lights going around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was actually chaos on the road as others saw it and were struggling to continues to drive straight as they tried to make out what they saw.  I thought I’d be side swiped,  The only thing that saved it from happening was there wasn’t very many cars on the road…I saw 2 cars pull over, but I was afraid to, because I feared someone would ass end me looking at the site as opposed to seeing me on the shoulder, so I reached for my iPhone to take a pic/video and struggled to get it on and just as I held it up, the damn trees blocked my view.  So I drove real slow for the next mile, hoping to get a break in the trees as everybody else did as well.  The speed limit is 65 there and everybody was doing 40.  I took my exit about a mile later to go off on the split where I-74 leaves I-73 and hoped to get to an elevated spot where I could still see it.  Finally as I began to give up I looked back and turned my neck as far as I could and I saw it! It had taken off and was headed due west (I was! headed north) and it had climbed high in a short amount of time, and it looked like a green airliner disappearing in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In about 3 minutes or so approx, I saw what appeared to be an air force jet go by high in the sky in that direction. I also saw about 10 NC State police doing about 100 mph headed south toward where I just came from.<n>

It was difficult to gauge distance  and scale but they appeared to be big, high in the sky and at least six miles away.  They were visible in the same spot for at least five minutes and my drive turned me away from them.  I could not recall ever seeing anything like them.  My phone pics do not do justice.  They were not orbs but had clearly defined edges.<n>

I WAS ON MY WAY TO WORK IN NEW JERSEY ON RT. 78 EAST BY JCT. 287 NORTH &amp; SOUTH IN WATCHUNG, NEW JERSEY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH MY WIFE THE WHOLE TIME SINCE I LEFT THE HOUSE AT 4:04A.M.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS I WS TRAVELING EAST ON RT. 78 COMING TO TO CROSS ROADS FOR 287. I SEE A HUGE BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY UP ABOVE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IN FRONT OF ME, IT LOOKS LIKE THE BIGGEST STAR I HAVE EVER SEEN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS I GOT CLOSER TO IT I THOUGHT THE STATE POLICE WAS GOING TO LAND A MED A VAC CHOPPER ON THE HIGHWAY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS I GOT CLOSER TO THE LIGHT, I SAW WHAT LOOKS TO BE ONE LIGHT TURN INTO TWO BIG LIGHTS, AND ONE LITTLE LIGHT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE MOON WS FULL BUT THERE WAS A FEW CLOUDS IN THE SKY.  AS I GOT CLOSER I COULD SEE IT WAS SOME TYPE OF DISC  SHAPE TO IT, LIKE A STEALTH BOMBER.  LIKE A HUGE V-SHAPE IN THE SKY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHEN I WAS RIGHT UNDER IT, I LOOKED UP, I SAW A PLANE THAT WAS FLYING WAY ABOVE IT AT A TREMENDOUS SPEED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AT THAT EXACT MOMENT AS I WAS UNDER THE OBJECT I HAD A VERY WARM FEELING THROUGHT MY BODY AND FELT LIKE I  URANINATED MYSELF.

I KNOW NOW WHAT OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THE  WORLD SAW IT THE SKY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THERE IS SOME THING OUT THERE IN SPACE, EXPERTS CANNOT EXPLAIN. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT OR WHO THEY ARE OR WHERE THEY CAME FROM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I WILL SAY THIS, ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2014 WAS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE TO HAVE SEEN AND  EXPERENCED THIS MY SELF.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite eloquent and serious-minded.

Sound was very soft popping sound.  The ambient sound prior was very quiet because time of night.  This allowed me to hear and see just at the right time ( I was unable to sleep and smoking on the balcony).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Circle of light green colour similar to northern lights green followed explosion and lasted about 3-5 seconds. Circle was quite round and appeared to be approx. one meter in diameter.  Colour dissipated downwards over the 3-5 seconds.  Reminded me of popping spores I have seen on documentary.<n>

But this orange sphere was moving against the slight breeze at 2-3 mph going west and it had like two and at a time four pulsing light inside of sphere its orange color looked a little metallic as it was a orange and slightly teal not bright orange but going to bright as it passed my view did not see any thing hanging down as you would for a weather balloon no visual exterior lights! it was moving at this 2-3 mph past me at say 70-100 feet off the ground and i watched pass trees on my right but it either changed its course or direction because it never passed the stand of trees on my right toward my other neighbors! house! did not see anything as i was cleaning up from the bur! n and to ld my wife and kids what i had seen , well you can guess there reaction!! look i have seen about every kind of military or civilian aircraft in my time as i worked awhile at Hollywood/Burbank Calif at martin aviation during the time of the shunk  works for the stealth aircraft a watching black c-5 galaxy land every other night during 1983-84 years so i know what to look for if something was man made this was not! and its been bugging me trying to come up with with a logical explanation of what i saw !and i dont have one two months later!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I asked her if she knew what it was, she didnt.  When I looked back, was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all went separate ways...I went home.<n>

I stood up and looked out, and saw about eight yellowish-white dots in the sky.  I then called my mother over to see them and by the time she got to the window, about half of them faded away.  About three seconds later, they were all gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously I didn&#39;t know what they were, so I examined their placement in the night sky.  They were too high up to be anything like fireworks or spotlights and there were too many of them to be airplanes or shooting stars.  I had no clue what they could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the initial shock of seeing what I thought was a UFO, I went outside to see if I could find the dots again.  It took me about three minutes of staring at the sky to realize that nothing would be coming back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then proceeded to go inside and get on the computer to research my finding.  I looked and looked and came up with nothing.  My mother then informed me that she had read about UFO sightings on PennLive (our local internet news source) recently.  Hearing this, I knew that I had to tell a professional about my finding, so I found your webpage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please help me to figure out what this was that I had just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

It was cloudy and they all disappeared into the clouds.  None of us knew what we had seen.<n>

9/9/14 19:15|Winsted|CT|Fireball|45 minutes|Anomalous behavior of anomalous bright lights.|9/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113426.html|612|ndxe201409| Anomalous behavior of anomalous bright lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of 9/9/14, I was at a house in Winsted, CT. I was there in a professional capacity, and am not at liberty to disclose information on the house or its resident(s).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:15 pm, to close approximation, I was sitting in a chair on the front porch, smoking a cigarette. I was facing due west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was overcast, low-lying cumulous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From a point on the natural horizon (forested hill), west by south-west, I saw an object with the appearance of a fireball-type meteor, i.e. “burning”, orange-color, about an order of magnitude brighter than Venus. It ascended at apparent high velocity from the horizon, dead vertical. I initially thought it was a firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It ascended at constant velocity to approximately 40 degrees celestial latitude. Then it stopped and had no motion, as though it had contacted a solid obstacle. This is to say that its velocity instantly ceased. It then had the appearance of a star in the sky, except that it was brighter than Venus, as stated. It was below the solid cloud deck. It illuminated the cloud deck, as though its radiance was omnidirectional, at least on hemispherical coordinates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sequence of events repeated til I lost count. I approximate the total number of objects as, three dozen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When several of the objects had ascended, they formed an asymmetrical grouping, maybe five to fifteen minutes of arc separate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When several (the number was different each time) were collected, the grouping ascended up into the cloud deck, cohesively, and faded from sight per the opaqueness of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were approximately six such groupings and ascensions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While gathered in these groupings, which resembled tight constellations of exceedingly bright stars, as if “waiting for the next one” (teleology inferred), these objects sometimes separated into two or three components. Sometimes one component would circle the other, or others, which remained stationary,then apparently rejoin and reintegrate back into a single object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several times one object moved or was ejected from the grouping, at apparent high speed, one to several degrees of arc laterally. It then reversed direction instantaneously, like a ball deflecting off a wall, to instantly stop at its original location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The luminosity of all these objects never varied, except when several times they seemed to show internal structure, as of two or more of them fixed to a nonluminous body or frame, not inconsistent with the several lights fixed to an aircraft. This differentiation was at threshold visibility, on the order of 15 or 30 arc seconds. One time, and one time only, the differentiated light detached itself from the presumed structure of the object, circled the object and returned to its original place, before this differentiation ceased and the object again appeared as a unitary “fireball”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This entire phenomenon was soundless. There was no engine noise, or propeller chop, or any sound from this event at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The phenomenon ceased at 8:00 pm, to very close approximation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The phenomenon was witnessed initially by myself alone, then by a resident of the house. About halfway through this event, a neighbor walked by, and I called out to him to come observe it. He then went and came back with his wife. The four of us together witnessed the last twenty minutes or so of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So far as the subjective, human aspect of this event, there was unanimous bewilderment, astonishment and incomprehension.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know of no airfields or military bases in that direction to, with certainty, the New York State border; I do not know with certainty of any airfields or bases in that direction whatsoever, albeit at some distance they undoubtedly exist. Because the ascension of the objects was dead vertical, and there was no variation in the luminosity of the objects, I assume the distance of their apparent origin from my location was equal to the elevation of the cloud deck, whatever that was at that time, divided by the declination of the region of the cloud deck where they vanished, which would be to say ~9/4 the elevation of the cloud deck. If called upon to guess, then if the cloud deck was ~2000 m high, the apparent origin was 4 or 5 km distant. I know that to be an area of state forest and farmland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the beginning of this event, many coyotes at different locations began howling and wailing, and continued doing this until the end of the event, when they all simultaneously ceased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By 8:00 pm, conditions were as normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Sir,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, 9/9/14, I submitted a report about an event that occurred a couple hours prior, in  Winsted, CT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to be as factual and precise as I could. But reviewing that report, I see I was sufficiently disraught to forget my high school geometry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the altitude of cloud deck, whatever that was, and what I reckoned a point at somewhat less than a vertical right angle, the distance from my location to the apparent origin would have been equal to, or slightly more than, the altitude of the cloud deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel that this event was important. I hope that my report will not be rejected because of my error, but that this correction can be made to the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I apologize for any convenience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

I noticed an extremely rounded shape object in the sky over the mountains. The object was “gliding” at a steady speed going west, towards the ocean.  There was bright light reflecting or coming from the “front” of the object while the back seemed darker.  The brightness made me notice the object.  The object was against light blue sky and passing thru some wispy cloud.  The sun was behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped moving, turned to my friend, then I pointed into the sky where I was last looking.  The object was gone, with no sound and we could not spot anything in the sky.  I knew this was not an airplane.<n>

At first glance I thought it was my favorite star flashing and warbling. Then realized it was too close to be a star but too far to be a plane or helicopter, as well as not really moving like a plane or like a satellite. It appeared to be rotating in an odd way, sort of warbling as it slowly dropped below the tree line diagonally to the right of its original location. It was flashing red yellow and white lights or reflecting something but no pattern could be discerned. Appeared to be drifting across the sky about as slow as watching the hands of a clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m not very good at telling distances but maybe around 20-25 miles away. When I first saw it, It seemed to be a plane but when I took a second glance it was very odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying horizontally across the night sky. It flew straight like a plane. It Also seemed to have blinkers on, also second glance I notice that the blinkers were like three separate lights. First one would go off the back of the object, then the middle, and then the front and go back the end of the object and start al over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next Thing after it completed three blinks it seemed to skip forward a little bit and then start the blinking process all over again. Now I couldn&#39;t make out if it was a plane shape at all but it flew straight like one. I don&#39;t have an illustration because my camera wouldn&#39;t be able to pick anything at the distance up, and I couldn&#39;t make out a shape either. Hope this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/8/14 20:52|Zhujiang (Newtown; Guangzhou)(China)||Oval|~27 minutes|Unsual Object Sighted in Night Sky near the Huacheng Square, in Zhujiang Newtown, Guangzhou, China.|9/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113458.html|621|ndxe201409| Unsual Object Sighted in Night Sky near the Huacheng Square, in Zhujiang Newtown, Guangzhou, China<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was night time, and I was going for a casual walk at the Huacheng Square walkway near the IFC building and also near the Guangzhou opera house and the presently constructing Luk Fuk building.  I decided to take a quick rest at the Mall of the World, which was underneath the Huacheng Square walkway.  Shortly after my rest I decided to go back outside into the warm, humid Guangzhou heat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then made my way over to the end of the walkway and the end of the square, which was near the Guangzhou Asian Games Stadium and the Canton Tower, as well as near the side of the Pearl River.  As soon as I arrived near the end of the square, I noticed that there were lots of people.  It was very crowded that night, and I realized that it was the first day of Mid-Autumn Festival (aka Moon Cake Festival).  There were many street vendors and lots of people with their friends and family eating food, as well as taking pictures of the wonderfully lit ornaments and the quickly changing colorful lights of both the Canton Tower and the IFC (Four Seasons) building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to walk ahead closer to near the river side, but the way there was blocked by barrier, as there was a large ornamental display bearing the shape of a traditional Chinese junk ship (without sails), and a led or neon-lit sign the posted Chinese characters, translated as Happy Mid-Autumn Festival and welcoming of happiness or such (since I’ve studied Chinese for four semesters in China before).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, I made my way over to the barrier closest to the river, but was also near other people taking pictures.  I was gazing around the buildings and the night sky.  Occasionally I would see an airplane or two from the far distance to the East and the South of the Canton Tower, with ordinary flashing beacons and navigation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once more, I then gazed across over to the north to see the wonderfully lit IFC building, as well as the construction of the Luk Fuk building. I then turned around to face the river side once more, but something caught the attention of the corner of my left eye. I then turned left towards the east to see a far away red light (brightness similar to an aircraft). It must’ve been at least half a mile out on the horizon, as far as I could see. The amber-red light appearing distant at first, then gradually brighter as it was making its way over towards me (heading west-ward).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was clear, but there were some low-lying clouds and slight fog or mist closer to the ground and river. It was a also a little breezy near ground level. Gazing towards the red light, I thought at first it was just an ordinary aircraft, and thought that maybe the fog or possible city pollution caused the aircraft’s lights to appear redder instead of a typical incandescent yellow-white. But as the red light drew nearer, I realized it maintained a constant color, and it was coming at a slight decline angle. Then as it drew even nearer to me, it quickly disappeared into the nearby low-lying clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curious, I still kept my eyes open for any other activity. To my surprise the red light came out of the clouds and continued westward, and finally made its way over the festival square. As it passed over me (about a 75-85 degree angle above my head to the north of me), I noticed an unusual shape. Although it was dark, I was able to make out a round, almost oval-like shape.  It was neither perfectly circle nor perfectly oval. To my eye, it appeared to be roughly between the size of an aspirin pill and a penny (or a Chinese wu jiao coin).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color appeared to be a grayish, slightly white-blue color, and there was a slight reflection on the object from the surrounding city lights. As it passed over me, I noticed that the object made no sound (no motor or engine noise), from what I can recall, except for a faint ‘cutting through the wind’.  Gauging the craft’s distance up above the ground, the object must’ve been at least 500-600 feet above the ground, but no more than 1000 feet, I reckoned. It was about as high as the lowest flying domestic aircraft flying over the city, but a bit lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it continued over me (over the festival square), it quickly fluttered some violet, blue, blue-green, red-pink, and a bit of green lights. Sort of like temporary beacons or special kind of navigation signals, I suspected. It must’ve done this signaling at least twice or thrice, but very rapidly, in a glimmering, sequential and reverse-sequential fashion. By the time I realized that this was no “ordinary” object or “craft”, I decided to pull out my Smartphone to take a pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I got my phone camera ready, the object then sped up quickly towards the west, towards the direction of the Guangzhou Opera House and past other buildings in that direction (i.e. the Baoli Center Building), then quickly ascended and faded away.  A bit curious, I still had my phone out of my pocket. Some people (two couples, and a small group of two to three people) nearest to me noticed me attempting to take pictures of something in the sky, but they must’ve thought nothing of it at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two to three minutes later, I notice the exact same amber-red light (as the object had when entering from the east), but this time appearing to the southwest of the Canton Tower. It must’ve been several hundred feet above the large high-rise apartments directly on the other side of the Pearl River. It was hovering for at least half a minute, then slowly ascended, paused and hovered for a few more seconds, then gradually continued westward and “disappeared”. By this time I had already taken a few snapshots from my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a less than a minute later, I notice the exact same amber-red light near and above a large building the west of the Guangzhou Opera house. It was hovering for at least half a minute, then ascended slowly again, but this time, the amber-red light began to pulsate (almost undulating). It must’ve done this for a few seconds at a time, within one to two minutes max, then ascended higher, and gradually disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, I had already had taken a few more snapshots from my phone, and there were at least three to five other people that pointed to the object, and took some snapshots, but they appeared to not be surprised, but rather amused (as if it was nothing very special).  Unfortunately, my phone’s camera resolution and quality wasn’t the best, the object appeared dimmer in the pictures than in real life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a few seconds later, the amber-red light appeared again near the direction I last seen it (toward the west of the Guangzhou Opera house and neighboring buildings). About a few minutes more it hovered and ascended gradually on and off, occasionally with a pulsation, then it slowly made its way southward towards the Pearl River, and disappeared again. During this time I had taking more pictures of it. I had also noticed that another couple near me had pointed to the object discretely, and took a quick snapshot from their Smartphone, showing some interest. I did not bother to ask them as I was afraid I would ‘sound’ or ‘look’ like a fool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About another minute later, I noticed the same amber-red light, but this time, further in the east, even further east of the Liede Avenue Bridge. It was a little higher in the sky, and was more distant, and was less visible because of the low lying clouds and fog. It must’ve hovered in place for a least another one to two minutes, then disappeared again for another few minutes. I was able to take a picture of this period of time. As you will see in the related photograph, one can barely notice it with the naked eye, but if one was to open the photo, one can zoom-in closely and notice the slight color in the midst of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after that period of time, it again appeared to the slight southwest of the Canton Tower and towards the high rise apartments directly across the Pearl River.  Again, the object, hovered, and moved slowly toward the west, and slowly ascended, then changed direction in the opposite direction and hovered another few seconds more, and disappeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my wonderment and disbelief, I had realized by this time that there was something strange about this object. It could’ve not been any ordinary aircraft. It was not in any perceivable way, identifiable, and the only two things I could suspect were that object was either of terrestrial or was non-terrestrial origin. Military flares? I’m not familiar with any flares that fly and behave the way that object did. Whether the object was of terrestrial (military-government or non military-government) origin, or non-terrestrial origin, it was indeed unusual in its appearance and behavior. What it was not was any conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I can neither conclusively prove nor disprove that this object was either terrestrial or non-terrestrial, but what I can conclude was that I experienced seeing something out of the ordinary, and without any recollection of the unknown.  Shall anyone choose to believe or disbelieve my experience; it is their choice, with rightful reasons to their own thinking and opinions.  But I hereby declare that I stand true and clear to my words, to the best of my knowledge and experience.  I know what I know, and I know what I’ve witnessed.  All analysis, thoughts, experiences, correlations, and opinions are greatly welcomed and appreciated.<n>

They were hovering over the city in the south east location, out towards an area we call the punch bowl.  I stood there and watched them for about 10 minutes...they were just hovering and then they just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked various weather information sites to see if perhaps it could be related to something.  It wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also checked the city&#39;s airport schedules for departures and arrivals of aircraft or any special events and there were none at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw and it was an anomaly of unknown character.  They emitted a radiant light....at one point the light at the ends orbs shot upward and formed a circle. So it looked like a V with semi-circle enclosure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an amazing site!! I do not know what this was..!  I just know that it was not something that could be described as anything yet known to this world.<n>

I looked out the passenger window and couldn&#39;t explain what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a plume of smoke with a bright large (maybe 10ft a cross ,it was difficult to gage how far into the distance it was ,or how high in the sky it was.)  It looked like a giant flash light was shining down.  I thought it was a meteor, but it didn&#39;t seem to be moving, nor did it look like what I&#39;d expect a meteor ,or astroid ,or what have you.  There was no tail, it was more compact.....stumpy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The man driving decided to pull over so he could get a better look, but just as he said it the light blinked a couple times and the just went out.  Right when it went out, there seemed to be a little piece of something that was burning.  It shot off to the upper left and immediately it burnt out.  And that was it.  All that was left was a poor of smoke. I was stunned, and I thought for sure with its size and the 15 seconds that I saw it, (let alone the actual filtration of time it was present) I  was SURE somebody, somewhere had caught it with their cell phone, or camera.  But, nothing.  I heard nothing about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what I saw, but I know it was something extraordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finding this site helped me see that maybe I saw something even more unusual.<n>

I was on my back, facing my bedroom window, which is on the west side of the house, when through the partially-opened blinds I witnessed an extremely bright double flash of white light that appeared to come from the west-southwest at an angle of approximately 40 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second flash, which instantaneously followed the first, was well-defined, circular, and appeared to be brighter but smaller than the sun, momentarily lighting up the entire outdoors as if it were daylight.

I kept watching to see if it would come out the other side as the cloud was dense... but not that large.  Within less than a minute the upper half of the cloud which had been distinct from the lower half was just absorbed like water on a hot skillet, leaving no trace of the cloud at all while the bottom half/cloud remained the same.  I never saw the object come out and the sky was as clear and blue as it could ever be.  The object made no sound.  Though I may be somewhat off on the shape due to the sun which reflected off it made it appear metallic and boomerang or crescent moon shaped. My first thought is that the object absorbed the water.  I am in my 60&#39;s and never saw anything like it befo! re. I never even believed in UFOs other than what is here on earth which it still could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It took like 3 secs to realize were in a highway with no intersections near for light to be coming from the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I quickly looked back I noticed the lights weren&#39;t on ground level but, in the sky my girlfriend quickly said &#34;record that thing.&#34;  Within 1 sec of me opening my iPhone to camera this object moved about 1,000 ft from the east to right infront /above us.(At this time is when I start to record the object).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object is now hovering in front of us, and then goes from 2 lights to 3 lights in a triangular form and we can clearly see the triangle dark shadow with a bulb in the middle of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then started moving faster than what my camera can capture but, we can see it move in circular rotation twice as it came to a stop and more lights came on and then disappeared to! about 2 miles away west where we just saw the light moving at an insane speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole time, we are driving with the windows down because of humidity, and as you watch the video notice it was completely silent with no blinking red and blue lights like a commercial airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It began to changed colors and more noticeable.  It had a steady white light on top of what appeared to be a saucer and a red light going around it repeatedly.

My mother, and brother were over for Sunday dinner and we were sitting on my balcony off of my kitchen when my mother said, &#34;look, what is that&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and seen a clear, illuminated object in the west sky.  If was difficult to make out a defined shape of the object but it appeared wider horizontally that vertically.  The object seemed to have a strange illumination that gave a cross kind of shape.  It was sunny and clear so it was difficult to tell how much of the illumination was caused by the Sun&#39;s reflection, but it appeared to reflect the Sun differently than normal metal would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was stationary and than made a few sharp 90 degree movements at a speed that would be impossible for any none technology to replicate.  It then seemed to have a rapid elevation again unlike any none aircraft could, which made its visibility more like a bright dot.  A couple of seconds later it disappeared from sight.  We all seen the same thing, and all agreed we had just witnessed a UFO sighting.<n>

I only saw the objects after downloading the pics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not observe these craft at the time of the incident, but only saw late them in photos I took (two photos 3 seconds apart).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out taking photos at a park near my home. It was a sunny afternoon and I took some pics of the sun behind a large tree and a commercial jet making a contrail next to tree (visually speaking). I did not notice several small shapes to the right as I was focused on the tree when taking the pictures. My camera is an iPhone 5s. I can send you the picture setting details if that helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I took two photos where the objects appear. They were taken 3 seconds apart, but, the objects have changed shape and are apparently further away and in a different area of the sky (you can see this in the two photos). I have enlarged these images and looked at them from different angles and experimented with changing the contrast and sharpness of the pics. You can judge for yourself but so far I have not been able to debunk them as balloons or Chinese lanterns or conventional aircraft. To me the second picture has even more oddness to it in several respects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If these are UFOs, my impression is that they are possibly trans-dimesional, based on the shape changes and the difficulty deterring the exact shape of the objects (edges are a bit fuzzy for example). I would interested in hear what you think.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I heard a load rumble as a b29 flew over from an air show at Selfridge air national guard.  As I watched this plane fly away from me I thought there was another plane flying behind it and to right of.  Heading due west, what I thought was the sun glimmering off another plane as it was bright glowing white.  It appeared to be cylindrical in shape with wings?  very short compared to the object.  As I watched, it just faded out.  I kept looking  were is the plane. There was no plane just a glimmer.  Would have been twice the size of the B29.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has any one else seen something like this just light and 30 seconds later nothing?<n>

The duration of the event was about 25 seconds at most. The object appeared to be dark in color and smoking as though on fire and was as bright as the moon during the day on a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound at all during this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my vide linked here below demonstrates, the object fell behind trees and did not appear to break apart - it did appear very large and as though it was an oval mass without distinction in shape or form. I have never seen a thing like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is my video link - please don&#39;t post my video anyplace to the net as I have newsmedia interested in paying to use it and KOMO TV NEWS in Seattle last night already used my video footage - they paid for its use and it was featured on the 11pm news last night.

I had a clear line of sight across a hay field, the moon was off to the west of my position behind a large stand of trees I was parked beside. The sky was clear and the moon had the countryside lit up brightly enough to pick out individual trees and surroundings.  To the east of my position on this night is the Edmonton international airport, roughly 3 to 5 miles away.  I have parked in this spot approximately 20 nights these past 2 months, and I have watched aircraft land and takeoff on a regular basis. You can hear jets coming long before you see them and they have a distinct sound and light pattern. I was sitting in my car looking at the night sky almost directly out my front window above a large grove of trees, my drivers window was down and I was relaxed, smoking a cigarette. When the light appeared in the sky, it was ins! tantaneous and directly in my line if sight, I did not have to look towards it. In the time the light appeared and disappeared , I watched it drop from at least five hundred feet directly above a grove of trees and then freeze for a second or two then disappear with out a sound. I estimated it&#39;s size against the trees that it disappeared behind at at least 300 feet long. The blue light illuminated fuselage, something you would see in a movie, three distinct out lines of fuselage with blue light erupting out with a hint of white light surrounding that. The only shape of a craft I observed was the fuselage. In that short period of time, I knew that I had just witnessed a spacecraft. I am 43 years old , well read, reasonably intelligent and not prone to seeing things that aren&#39;t there. In all my life, I have never witnessed a man made craft that could be mistaken for what I saw. For the next 3 hours I watched for any sign of the craft again. All that I saw in that time were je! ts landing and taking off with the odd helicopter in sight at ! the airp ort. This is the second time in my life I have witnessed a UFO , this is the first time I have reported one. The first time was over 20 years ago. Thank you for this platform and i hope my report is helpful. I have typed this report on my smartphone , forgive me for that, for it is the only avenue I posses. Please feel free to contact me for any questions via email. This was a exciting and confusing experience for me, reality jarring to be truthful. So if someone would kindly respond to this report , I would be in your debt, thank you. Respectfully<n>

My friend was in mid-sentence of telling a story when she stopped and said “WHAT IS THAT???” pointing up to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 of us girls stood up and turned around to see what she was pointing at. It was a formation of flying objects that appeared to be illuminated but not lit up sort of in a bird formation. We watched this formation go across our heads for about 20 seconds starting from the north and disappearing toward the south. One of the women’s husbands mentioned this website as he is intrigued by situations like this. I just looked over the front page posts and they are VERY similar to what we saw.<n>

There was a dim blue light and red light appearing to be flashing on either side of the bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached the object we could see it was a HUGE triangular craft (approximately the size of a football field?) with a very intense white spotlight in the front and two white lights on either back corner. The red/blue lights appeared to be on the bottom of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was hovering about 300-400 yards above the ground and did not appear to be moving by the time we passed it. It was very near to the Interstate. Either we crossed out of view suddenly, or the craft simply vanished in to thin air, as we were not able to see it (despite it&#39;s enormous size) about a minute and a half after passing it. We were driving about 65-70mph.<n>

I was driving when I noticed a beam of light in the clouds in front of me, as I got closer it got lower to the ground until I drove right underneath it at which point it was approximately 200-300 yards off the ground. 30 minutes later I drove back back the location of the sighting to find nothing. It hovered in the air with complete silence<n>
9/6/14 00:00|Elizabethtown/Louisville (travelling between)|KY|Triangle|15-45 minutes|Two 3-legged/pronged shaped UFO seen flying along interstate between Elizabethtown and Louisville|9/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113320.html|682|ndxe201409| Two 3-legged/pronged shaped UFO seen flying along interstate between Elizabethtown and Louisville<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on a Megabus route from Nashville TN to Louisville Kentucky, sitting on the top level in the very front of the bus in front of the large window.  The entire duration of the sighting probably lasted forty five minutes from when I first noticed it but only maybe 15 minutes of it in full sight as it would dip above and below the tree line as we traveled, the craft not in sight for the full forty five minutes.  The entire time that it was in my view it was either flying to the side of the bus or directly ahead of the bus to the left side of the interstate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed a formation to the right side of the bus that I could not make out what it was, but it was composed of blinking red and white lights almost as an airplane would look, and very far away and high in the sky.  At the time the formation was so odd, it was almost in an L-shape, almost looked like an apache, but I&#39;ve seen many of those fly between where I live in Nashville and Fort Campbell military base, and as it dropped in altitude I realized that that was not what it was.  As it continued to drop in altitude and it was still flying in front and to the right of the bus, I could see more detail in the lights and it took on a V or chevron shape.  Then as we traveled the craft went out of sight, and that&#39;s when maybe 10 minutes later I saw one appear very close on the left side of the interstate.  (the shape of the craft was not changing, only what I could see of it and make out.  I suspect that my first view of it only seeing the lights in an L-shape, that the cra! ft was actually facing sideways, whereas the rest of the sighting I am looking at the back of the craft as it flies forward.) It would change elevation very fluidly and speed up and slow down.  When I saw this craft appear, I realized that it was not a V or chevron shape (that i thought could have perhaps been explained by a B52 stealth bomber-like military aircraft) but that it was actually the shape of a three-pointed star or a three-pronged/legged craft with white lights on the tip of each prong and flashing red lights in the center.  That is when I took my phone out and started filming video of it and when it came closer into view I managed a photo of it.  The large craft that I watched on the left stayed consistently in view for at least 10 minutes.  Then a few minutes later, unfortunately I was not filming at this point, it dropped very very low, maybe only a couple hundred feet above the treeline (created by the wooded area that lined the interstate) and the ambient ! lights from the cars and street lights on the interstate manag! ed to sh ed enough light where I could see the underside of the craft, and that is when I realized that it was not a V shape, but a 3 pronged or legged craft.  The entire underside of it was illuminated to a light beige or grey color (I did not see any shine on it) and I could see the full shape of it.  When it came so close to the ground I realized it was an extremely large craft and something I would not estimate to only carry one individual, rather a craft that would have been designed to carry either multiple smaller craft or cargo.  There were clearly no wings on it or propellers and no other signs of any external mechanisms that could have been propelling the craft.  Also, the way in which the three legs of the craft were aligned did not seem to be in an aerodynamic fashion as you would see on triangular shaped military planes or aircraft, but rather a 3-pointed star with the legs equidistant from each other that was able to somehow fly very fluidly and very quickly.  I have no! idea what was propelling this craft as there were no signs of any trails or substance (like fuel) being emitted by the craft.  I also did not hear any strange sounds during the sighting, or see any kind glowing haze, smoke, or aura.  The nature of the blinking red and white lights that adorned the edges and tips of the pronged craft lead me to believe that they were actually light bulbs flashing just as you would see on a plane, but the craft was clearly not like anything man-made that I have seen before, or that has been known to the public as any type of aircraft or drone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I tried to also take video or pictures of this instance but my phone camera would not capture the lights as they were not bright enough and too far away.)  Then later as the bus was coming into Louisville off the interstate and the large craft on the left had disappeared over the horizon/tree line (it dipped down very low and I could no longer see it) I look to the right of the bus and can see two lights in the distance, just barely larger than stars.  I could see the red and white individual lights clustered together and realized that the two &#39;stars&#39; were actually the craft I had seen, and that there were 2, not just one.  For at least a minute, I could watch them ascend and drop altitude, very, very quickly, rising directly upwards and falling directly downwards.  They were then very far away with an enormous distance between them vertically.  The UFO that was highest in the sky flew ahead of the one below it, then stopped, and the UFO below it flew ahead so that it was i! n front of the one above it.  Then they seemed to be changing altitude.  Unfortunately by this point the bus was in the city and my view of the UFOs was eclipsed by a building and I could not see them after this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the sighting, I did look at other people who were on the bus with me and could see them also watching the craft, looking perplexed, but as it was between 12am and 1am, most on the bus were sleeping or had earphones in listening to music, so no one talked about it to each other, but it was very clear that others were seeing it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing to me is that I have google searched trying to find images of the craft that I saw and I cannot find anything like it.  I have looked for images of all shapes of UFOs, all known military aircraft new and old, including drones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said, I do have multiple videos and images of the craft that I will try to upload from my phone, but I am not on my computer right now so it will have to be in a few days when I am home.  Thank you for receiving my report.  I really want to know if anyone else has ever seen something like this before, and what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sighting occurred around 9:00 pm in the western sky above Aberdeen, Maryland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at the big dipper group of stars, when I noticed what appeared to be a star above the first star in the handle.  I had never noticed it before, so I continued to watch it. The star began to grow larger and brighter.  I watched it become extremely brighter then anything else in the sky for a minute or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then moved very fast towards the north, omitting a bright tail of light that disappeared in less than a second.

I noticed towards my right the clouds looked similar to a UFO so i glanced at it for a few seconds.  It was dark out; but, not quite dark yet and the clouds were darker than the sky.  As i began to seat myself, I noticed something moving across the sky in front of me.  My eyes were glued in wonder as it moved with glee across the atmosphere traveling left.  It didn&#39;t make a noise which is why i almost didn&#39;t see it.  It blended in with the sky like a 3D effect or maybe 4 or 5D.  Whatever that means.  I could not believe what i had seen.  It was like it defied gravity and that IS what it did.  It was amazing and wonderful to see.  It moved through the sky like that was what it was supposed to do.  Like nothing could tell it nothing.  As if it owned the sky!!  And there were no lights which made it even more unable to see.  It was so smooth.  IT DID NOT MAKE A SOUND!!!  I am truly amazed.  I thought I would never see this...  I always &#34;knew&#34; they were true!!  I now have my proof!!  Case is closed.  I was like, &#34;What is that?&#34;  It was moving so fast but not like super fast just gracefully fast.  I knew it couldn&#39;t be a plane or helicopter.  Birds are that that big and it did not flap.  I only saw it for maybe 5 or 6 seconds. I looked on for maybe 10 seconds more but i couldn&#39;t see it anymore though i tried. It vanished into the clouds and blended in so well.  It was gone!!  I did not want it to be. I knew it was gone.  It was there.  RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF MY EYES and it was gone!!!  I cannot believe my eyes!!!  I can not identify what it was and so is I have actually saw an UFO!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I took multiple photos of the interesting view.  In only one photo, taken at 6:30 PM, a small bright dot was seen above the ridge.  Enlarged, the dot appears to be an object or craft followed by orange flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A family member suggested it was space debris burning on re-entry.  On-line research did not show any debris reported or expected to reenter the atmosphere that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weeks later I carefully viewed all the other photos taken at about that time.  In the photo taken 6 seconds after that one, there is a smaller dot in the further distance which when enlarged appears to be a delta shaped craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of these images appear in only one of the two photos taken 6 seconds apart.

There were no other stars visible anymore so it caught my eye that there was a very large, very bright star off to the Southwest in the sky. Except when I looked closer at it, it was flickering incredibly fast between mostly white, but also blue and red. The lights flickered for the duration of the event. It then occurred to me that the shape was not regular for a star and rather than a dot, it was a long cross-like shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it appeared stationary, but then I found a place to view it where I could set it against a stationary object in the foreground, and observed it was actually moving. It listed to the left, or right, sort of randomly and moved slightly downwards several times. Movement seemed random, just sort of listlessly floating around, and then it started rising up. As it rose, it became slightly more dim and moved up very, very slowly, appearing as if it were moving away from the earth at a very acute angle of ascent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live near an airport, so I see and hear planes coming and going all the time, and this did not appear to be a plane. The flashing lights were reminiscent of a police siren, and it was far too far away and/or small to be a plane. I observed it with binoculars, but could see no increased details. Eventually, after twenty to thirty minutes of slowly moving away and up it became too faint to view and by then the sun was up enough that we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued moving in a Southwesterly direction for the duration of the event in an area of the sky that lies south of the airport I am near. Flatmate claimed to hear sounds, but I did not hear anything, and other aircrafts were regularly flying overhead, into and out of the airport to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Around 7 a.m. both lights just disappeared.  I took pictures on my phone and when you zoom in you most definitely can see the object shape and three very distinct lights on the larger of the two.  The lights appeared to be colorful; at least yellow and red or pink can&#39;t really tell.  A passenger plane was also flying toward the trajectory of the large light but turned around and headed back in the direction it came before getting too close to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed there were several beams, all of the same size and appearance.  There were two sets of beams which were rotating left to right and the other side right to left in perfect symmetry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wouldn&#39;t be able to estimate the size of the lights/object.  I could say about 100 - 200 meters but wouldn&#39;t be altogether sure.  It was truly one of the most incredible sights I have seen.  The lights disappeared after a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside to call my husband and came out to see the lights had reappeared in a different area behind my house.  As I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing I ran to call my husband again and by the time I came back the light had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got goosebumps from this experien! ce.

The objects did not move from their positions and continued to flicker red and green.  Other air traffic moved througout the sky near objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Objects appeared to react towards aircraft by emitting a beam (very quick to the eye) and/or turning towards aircraft in an aggressive manner.<n>

Two spotted twice and then 3 single ones after those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very clear evening and all stars could be seen.  2 Red moving balls of light that looked about the size of a bright big star.  The light did not flash. 5 different instances.  2 of these lights were spotted moving at a constant speed diagonal from each other maintaining spacing.  They eventually seemed to dim but appeared to be moving outward from the Earth and then disappeared quickly. almost instantaneously they reappeared in the same configuration in the opposite direction of where they were traveling but then seemed to travel the same path again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then there was one at different plain moving about the same speed as the first 2 in the same direction.  As that one moved another one appeared at about the same plain but not exactly moving in the same direction.  Then a 3rd one appeared in the same way but all were on a similar plain but they were not right behind each other.  These moved at a speed that seemed slower than what a satellite seems to travel at when one goes over head.  It was not a plane because I was able to see several planes prior to and after this spotting.  The light were very visible on the planes and blinking could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not appear that the balls of red light were within Earths atmosphere.  I was in the military and I am a quality manager now so I generally get details very correct.  These were red and came from the west.  I would not expect anything to move in that manner even though it seemed to drift to the east.  They way they disappeared was unusual as well. I have seen flares and many things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also witnessed this same ball of light about 2 weeks prior to this sighting but there were two of them in the east sky not moving much.  They stayed in one spot and one time drifted to east slightly, maintaining their configuration,  and then stopped.  They were there for about 3 minutes from time I spotted them.  They too disappeared quickly but seemed to moving away from the Earth because these drifted as they seemed to move away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have some video but it looks just like a red star and nothing more on my phone camera video.<n>

Low earth orbit?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clear night, many stars visible, moon was close and bright but only 90 percent full.  What I thought was a bright and low satellite (bright solid white light, no blinking) was traveling (to the west of my position) steadily from the north, southeast bound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed it for about 3 seconds (it covered 10 horizontal degrees in that time) when a much dimmer (further away looking and blue tint) object came from approximately 5-7 lateral degrees above the bright object (or above and to the west of it, from my vantage point) and changed course, following the bright objects path.  The lesser object stayed about 15-20 horizontal degrees behind the bright object when the lesser object CLEARLY changed course to follow, but the bright object gained another 10 degrees between the two (either the bright object sped up or the lesser object slowed but it seemed like the former).  They traveled another 20 lateral degrees south, towards the moon (just a reference point), an! d I noticed a third object (looking exactly like the lesser object) dropped down from approximately 10 lateral degrees above the bright object (which then began to travel more southeast than south) and it CLEARLY changed course to follow the bright object.  The two lesser objects were close together at this point (2-5 lateral degrees between the two), obviously chasing the bright object, and all three covered about 10-15 lateral degrees before the bright object just faded out (like a fast dimming off) and the two lesser objects separated about 5 lateral degrees and, together, turned more east but still heading south until they got too far for me to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three objects covered 5-10 horizontal degrees at a given time.  NO blinking lights at any point from any of these objects.  I believe this was low earth orbit, not in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 22:50, the same night (sept. 4), .25 miles west of SR-17, on Merion Rd., I was looking at Ursa Major when another object that looked like the lesser objects from earlier, dropped down 10-15 degrees in about 3-5 seconds, steadily, and slowly stopped and began to blink a red light.  It dropped from the furthest (from the handle) east most, top star of the “pot”, but barely on the inside of it, below the lowest and furthest star in the “pot”, stopped, began blinking the red light, lightly, and just behaved like a plane at this point, heading west slowly.  It took about 20 seconds for it to travel west, below ursa major, and then appeared to stay in that vicinity.  I left after about 5 minutes of keeping an eye on it but it got dimmer and dimmer so it may have been getting further from me.  I was facing northwest of my position on Merion Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are always military craft out in that area, day and night, and I have come to the conclusion that the only options, of what these were, are either military and extra terrestrial, or just extraterrestrial.  Unless, of course, there are private industry high altitude to space fights and chases going on.  Very strange and active night.  I have NEVER had such solid clarification of objects I see in the sky (that aren’t regular aircraft) being under immediate intelligent control.  Now I know what it feels like to have actually seen something surreal in the sky.<n>
9/4/14 21:15|Seattle|WA|Diamond|4 minutes|4 bright triangular-shaped objects remaining in a triangular formation caught my attention over Lake Union in Seattle.|9/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113268.html|723|ndxe201409| 4 bright triangular Shaped objects remaining in a triangular formation caught my attention over Lake Union in Seattle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my pleasant surprise, just two months since my first UFO sighting over Lake Union in Seattle, I witnessed four unusual light shapes again tonight - very close to the same location they made their appearance in July.  What caught my eye this evening were 4 bright lights slightly north east of the Space Needle from my vantage point where I was gazing south toward the Space Needle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each object appeared triangular shaped with lights at each point. However, it seemed there was a light in the center of each as well.  They struck me initially as probably being lanterns, though unusually shaped if in fact lanterns.  As I kept my eye on them they did not seem to characterize lanterns floating through the air due to their tight triangular formation while moving upward then sideways in perfect synchronicity.  One object was positioned to the left of the other three in their triangular formation.  The object on the left from my view faded within approximately 20 seconds after I first spotted them all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I snapped a 26 second video, then two photos of the remaining three objects from my iPhone while standing on my front deck then lost view as they moved further east and were hidden behind a neighboring building.  I ran through my house and up my dock to zoom in on them once again.  I was able to snap two more photos, though they did not appear clearly in the brighter light from this angle.  They seemed to turn southward and disappeared within about 20 more seconds from my new viewing spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following their disappearance there was a single helicopter hovering over the middle of Lake Union facing the direction these objects had been seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will include the video clip and the original two photos that are the most clear I was able to capture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Second similar sighting by the same witness over Lake Union.

I thought I was watching an exploding star and after about an hour I went to tell my roommate and like 1 minute later while we were both watching it suddenly it moved very fast to the northwest and was mostly orangeish when it started moving and was over the horizon in seconds after being in the same spot for at least an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mostly white and red with some blue.  It would pulsate and fade the white color and flash the red and blue i think.  It could have been there for longer i saw it first just sittin there looking like an exploding star or somethin but taking off in a straight direction we both immediately knew that was a ufo.  Also i thought i saw a black circle shoot out about 30 mins in<n>

As I watched, the lights faded out completely and the object was no longer visible against the sky. It had appeared to be approaching me over the slight dips and swells of the landscape in that area. The area is devoid of trees, mountains or hills, and there are no large buildings to obstsruct the view. It struck me as odd so I began to scan the sky as well as I could and continue driving. About a minute later, I saw a golden light ahead of me, more towards the Nampa area now, which was the direction I was headed. I thought that if it were the same object it must&#39;ve been moving fairly rapidly, or the light may&#39;ve just not been as bright, making me think it was further away than it was. The night was completely clear with a little over a 1/4 moon, which if it was considered to be at a 12 o&#39;clock position,! the light I was now seeing would have been about 7 o&#39;clock. This light also dimmed until it faded from view. I was now intensely interested in what might be flying overhead. Two minutes later, I saw the light again, but this time it had either split into two objects or had been joined by another, since I could see what appeared to be two separate sets of lights. The lights now appeared quite a bit closer to me than before, much as the first ones had-and I&#39;d estimate that to have not been over a half mile from me. There was one fairly bright golden light (I would say that it was nearly as bright as a very bright star, but not as bright as Venus appears)that remained steady, but the second object had, first one light, then as it dimmed and went out, a second one lit, and as IT dimmed and went out, a third one lit, and then it dimmed and went out, as did the single light. The 3 lights that lit and dimmed in sequence were almost verticle from my point of view, and the sequence! of lighting and dimming began at the top and ended at the bot! tom. Thi s was like nothing I&#39;d ever seen before. Traffic was fairly heavy on I-84 so I feel someone else must&#39;ve witnessed the same thing as I.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then they paired up, one out of the two descended while the other ascended.  Then they reversed direction.  The final formation I saw were the pairs moving diagonally, but with the set of two still aligned in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights went behind some trees and when we searched for them again we didn&#39;t see them.  After about 10 minutes of driving around I saw a single light next to the dome of the Capitol building.  We passed another tree and then it had disappeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of us have never seen any sort of aircraft move so fluidly and silently.  The lights were much larger then any plane lights and moved in an impossible pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it could have been but it was certainly &#34;unidentified&#34;.<n>

I have had several sightings in our area in the last 6 months.  I grabbed my binoculars and went outside to look.  To the south I could see the mountains, (we call the Clockum, &amp; Mission Ridge) and above that was a cloud layer, and above the cloud layer in the blackened sky were flashing red, white and green lights, that were flashing in what appeared to be a circular motion.  I could see them flash but they would disappear and reappear as if they were going around something.  I could see 4 different areas in the sky where these lights were flashing in this way.   They stayed stationary for at least 20 minutes, then one started moving southwest and finally disappeared from my view. The others stayed fairly stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted a third friend and told him to look. He too has seen a UFO on the same nights as I have, and even got video of one.  He looked in the sky, and could see them, he also saw a blue light in the sky. He took a picture and sent it to me.  He has since blown up the images on his computers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked over towards the southwest and could see an orange orb stationary over the mountain top.  I could see an orange and red glowing object thru my binoculars, it was also quite large without binoculars, as I pulled the binoculars down to look with the naked eye, then looked thru the binoculars again it was gone.   I looked back over to where the flashing red and white lights were, and they too were gone.  So crazy. This is happening often here.  My 4 dogs were highly sensitive while outside, barking a lot. We live in a secluded area, mountainside.<n>

It looked like lightning or an explosion in the sky and it lit the clouds with an amber glow.  There were 3 areas where it seemed the flash was occurring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It kept flashing repeatedly, around 20 to 30 seconds between each flash.  The longer we watched the more apparent it became that this was not lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what this could have been but there didn&#39;t seem to be any red/amber tint to the sky or clouds to explain the amber color of the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred over a rural wooded area where many oil and gas drilling sites are located and the lights were much too high in the sky to be associated with the drills.<n>

One red light, one green light, alturnatelyaacross in a perfect line, red...green....red ...green red green.  The lights were up high about 70 degrees.  They hung in the sky, then moved up, stayed there, 10 seconds, then down, exactly.  Sort of teasing me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, all, jump up, once, then jump up again, again, then up high then 180 degrees due west then.........gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That morning huge sonic boom, huge.

I was on vacation with my brother, (55), my sister-in-law, (51), my niece and nephew and 2 of their friends.  My niece, nephew and their 2 friends are in there mid-twenties.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the date above we were all sitting on the beach having a bonfire and roasting marshmallows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were facing east, towards the Atlantic Ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, at approximately 11pm, my sister-in-law saw an orange glowing ball in the sky to the north above the land were the fishing pier meets the land.  She yelled out: “Look at that!”, “What is it?”  We all turned in the direction she was pointing and watched the orange, glowing ball move silently towards us and then out over the ocean, on a southeast trajectory.  It grew brighter (larger), as it moved towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 1 minute another glowing ball, (exactly the same in appearance), appeared from the same location, (above where the pier touches the land) and began following the first ball’s trajectory, exactly.  Meanwhile the first ball moved out to a location over the sea and simply grew fainter until it disappeared totally.  The second ball did the same thing and then a third, fourth, etc., until we had seen a total of 7 orange fireballs move along the exact same trajectory and disappear over the ocean in the exact same location.  Each ball was visible for about 45–60 seconds.  These ball were exactly equidistance apart, as they arrived and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All seven of us witnesses were in awe.  We tried to capture the glowing balls on cell phone cameras and video, but they just look like specks on a black night sky as it was so dark there are no reference points in the images.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of the witnesses had had a few beers with dinner, but were not intoxicated.  My sister-in-law and I were 100% sober as we don’t drink alcohol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should mention later that night, I believe around 2am, (technically Sept. 4), my nephew and his 2 friends report seeing blue neon-type streaks of light flashing before them on the beach, at lighting speed and then going into the ocean, towards the same location the fireballs had headed.  They said when they ran towards the ocean to get a closer look the blue neon lights, now under the water, they slowly disappeared.  I personally did not witness these blue neon colored lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should also mention that earlier on the same day, Sept 3, 2014, at 9:30 in the morning we heard an incredible “sonic boom” type sound that was so loud and caused such a vibration everyone on the beach jumped up and was looking around in panic. There were no planes in sight or anything else to be seen in the sky or the ocean at that time.<n>

I was driving toward an intersection and stopped at red light. Bright white light in distance was brighter than any planets, but not as large as moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon starting to drive from red light, I noticed white light approaching pretty fast until trees on side of road obscured it.  Then as I drove, I saw a flat-triangle-shaped (point facing up) object that was larger than a plane would be, flying relatively low to ground, about as high as the highest treetop and then a little higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Red and yellowish/white lights (2 on each side of middle point) blinked in a radiating pattern outward toward sides.  Object passed diagonally at a 45-degreeish angle from one side of road over and was then obscured by trees on left side of road.  Not sure of sound as my vehicle is loud.  No other witness in car (I was alone.)<n>

The soft orangish white light seemed to hover about a 1/2 Mile in the air, slowly dimming out and eventually it reappeared with the full brightness it had before dimming out. The time frame of it being lit in the sky was about 3 minutes slowly floating to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a year earlier I was in the town of Pueblo, Colorado, filling up on gas, and I looked towards the north, yet again to see the same floating lights, not one, but a total of three slowly floating in the night sky for about 3 minutes, and disappeared then reappeared for a final time for about 3 minutes before dying out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have tried doing extensive research on the mysterious ghost lights, but unable to fine answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stopped and watched it pass by for approx 30 seconds and I was almost expecting it to blow up or crash but it just slowly went by and disappeared.  It didn&#39;t appear to go down towards the Melbourne airport as I would have expected.  The sky was clear and a neighbor walked by the other direction but she did not see it object, it had disappeared at that time but I told her my observation.  She mentioned other sightings in the area which is why I am reporting this one.  I seriously thought it was a sessna aircraft on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I decided to take the long route just to enjoy the night and drive around the neighborhood a bit (opposite direction as my usual route, wouldn&#39;t have seen this occurrence had I not taken new route). As I pulled out of my driveway and turned to progress down the street, I noticed a large (perspectively about the size of a pea held in your hand) green light in the sky absolutely railing Southwards. It progressed in speed for a matter of a few moments, grew in brightness, and then abruptly disappeared as I kept my eyes peeled in the direction that I saw it in with no avail with the intentions of another sighting. I have communicated with a few acquaintances of mine, and apparently they have experienced the same thing. What absolutely astounded me was the clarity of the light, it was quite blatantly either very low to the ground or a type of lighting that I have not witnessed bef! ore in my life. Equally astounding, though, was the apparent frictionless flight that this object had attained. It was the cleanest moving, brightest object I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. Others that have seen the same thing claim that the same two details, being the frictionless flight and the brightness of the light, were aspects of the sight that stuck with them and astounded them as well. It was an odd feeling night, at that. Had a very different feel to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is one of many experiences that I have had witnessing UFOs, not strictly of this sort (this is the first of this sort that I&#39;ve seen). Also, the first I&#39;m reporting. I often go outside with confidence that I&#39;ll see something astonishing in a matter of minutes admiring the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for reading, hopefully this gets out to anyone else who&#39;s seen the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watch the sunsets nightly, weather permitting. This particular night, the sunset filled the western sky with a brilliant orange, fading to the color of a blood orange. All of a sudden, I noticed what looked like a fluorescent light tube in the sky,in front of the sunset. It was perfectly vertical, appeared to be emitting it&#39;s own light and not moving, although the sunset was sinking below the horizon behind this tube. The tube remained illuminated in a white light. It remained stationary until the sunset was gone and at that point it began to fade until I could no longer see it. To get an idea of the size of the tube, I held my arm out at full length and it was the size of my little finger at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Within minutes the storm was right on top of my house, and so was the silver object, which I can now see was a huge ball!

Location 39&#39;46&#34;15.15 degrees north latitude and 107&#39;19&#34;8.20 west longitude.  The sky was almost completely clear and the moon was in the 1st quarter and quite bright.  As usual, I was doing a sky watch as I have had several good UFO sightings up here in the past during previous camp trips here.  At about 22:35 hours I noticed a bright light below and to the right of the &#39;pointers&#39; in the Big Dipper, about 10-15 degrees above the horizon.  Knowing there were no bright stars in this area I watched the light, which appeared motionless at first.  After a minute the light began to move slowly towards the west, too slow for an aircraft or satellite.  During this time an aircraft did fly over, moving much faster than the light.  I remember thinking that I hoped it would ! do something to show me it was a UFO.  After a minute I turned to grab my binoculars to get a closer look at the light and when I turned back it was gone.  I scanned the sky with the binoculars in the area where I had last seen it and there was nothing there.  No flashing lights that might have indicated a conventional aircraft, no clouds around that it might have gone into.  I have seen lights like this several times before in CO and also in AZ, so I believe this was a probable alien craft.<n>

On Tuesday night while watching from the top floor balcony of the motel I was staying at I observed an orange light in the sky a little left from straight out in front of me at about a 30 degree angle up.  I estimated it was at cloud level about half way between me and the horizon.  The light came on and grew in intensity quickly then maintained that brightness for about 2 seconds then faded out just as quickly. It appeared about pea size at arms length.  At 9:43(21::43) it appeared again but this time at the horizon a little to the right of center.  Then once again a little to the right of it a few seconds after.  I did not see any again until around 10:00(22:00) Friday night while fishing at Freeman Park in the inlet.  Two orange lights appeared just above the buoy that! has the white blinking light out in front of the inlet near the horizon.  Again they only appeared for about 2-3 seconds each, one after the other.  During none of these sightings did I hear any aircraft, plane, jet, or helicopter.  I did not have my camera pointing in the right direction during any of the attempts to video them.  These orange lights are completely different from the red dividing lights I saw at Avon, NC on the outer banks in 2004.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I reported to 911 as we were observing it.  The 911 operator called back about 40 minutes later advising that she reported our sighting to the FAA and suggested I submit a report to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:05 PM, about 30 minutes after sundown my wife and I were in the back yard.  The sky was clear, half moon very bright.  Light from the sun was still glowing in the western half of the sky.  No stars were visible yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife pointed to a very bright star almost directly overhead.  It was a Venus type brightness.  I realized that it was too early for stars and is Venus currently visible at dawn.  I then assumed it was a satellite reflecting sunlight which we often see.  I quickly realized if it was a satellite it had to very large, like the International Space Station which we are familiar with.  The ISS is not visible for us at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately recognized the “star” object was not a satellite because it seemed stationary almost directly overhead.  It was absolutely not moving across the mid-point of the sky at the pace we often seen evening satellites moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at the object for ten plus seconds it suddenly became several times brighter.  The new brightness lasted about five seconds and then quickly dimmed to less brightness than it was originally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds later a white cloud appeared around the star like object.   We describe the size of the cloud as 20-30 diameters of the “star” object.  I arrived at that diameter simulating the size of the “star” object with an ink dot and thereby extrapolating the size of the cloud.  The cloud was semitransparent rather that a very solid white; however it was definitely white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly a bright “star” like object moved out of the cloud area at an angle to the right and from our perspective it appeared to be moving downward as if falling toward earth.  The “falling” object was far less bright than the original object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my cell phone in hand so I dialed 911 to report the sighting in case it was some type of high altitude explosion.  The cloud and falling object were visible as I made contact with the 911 operator and gave my report.  The cloud and then the object faded from view while I was still on the phone, which I assume was about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the exact time of the sighting by my cell phone record of the 911 call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the sighting faded, I looked around in the sky and because of the fading sunlight, there were no stars or planets visible.<n>

First left erratically then right then it moved up and down unlike any airplane I have ever seen.<n>

9/1/14 22:00|Hudson|WI|Unknown|45 minutes|Multi-colored object spotted hovering, speeding up and stopping quickly for 45 minutes, multiple witnesses.|9/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113172.html|798|ndxe201409| Multi colored object spotted hovering, speeding up and stopping quickly for 45 minutes, multiple witneses<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10pm I saw a bright round light moving quickly at a 15-20 degree angle over the north horizon.  Originally believed it to be a plane, but it seemed too bright and I didn&#39;t notice any blinking lights.  Object came to a full stop in the sky and that is when I started to pay closer attention.  At this time it was the size of a bright planet or star but distinguishably different by its rapidly changing color from white to red to green to blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching for a few minutes, I noticed it begin to move erratically in several different directions at a start/stop speed no plane can move, and no human can sustain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife to the window and we both observed it act like this in the same spot in the sky for over 30 minutes.  We also noticed several random pinpoint strobe like flashes in the sky surrounding it during this time.  My wife commented that it was moving like a humming bird or fly would - zigging/zagging and stopping on a dime.  It eventually moved behind the trees and we lost sight of it after 45 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several commercial planes passed by during this time and were obviously different than what we were observing.  It would seem logical with it&#39;s brightness and position in the sky that it (the object) was visible from those planes.<n>

We were approaching exit 8 near Monroe township when I, sitting in the passenger seat, witnessed a bright blue-white star-like shape descend rapidly from the sky and disappear a second later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately asked her if she saw that to which she responded, &#34;Yes.  I didn&#39;t want to say anything because I thought it was a streetlight or something.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It clearly was not a streetlight as it was well above earth.  The star-like object was about 50-60 degrees from the horizon when facing north.  It appeared stationary until it rapidly began to fall towards the horizon and disappeared at around 30-45 degrees.  There were no clouds in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire event lasted only a second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We quickly ruled out a falling star as there was no visible tail.  Also, it was too bright and far too fast for it to be any sort of aircraft, commercial or military.  If it was an airplane then it should h! ave been visible until it went over the horizon but it simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only conclusion I can make is that it is indeed a UFO.  It was unidentified.  It was flying.  And it was an object.  Alien or not, who knows.  I just hope other motorists may have witnessed the same thing.<n>

I was standing outside, looked up and saw a large, glowing, light greenish, object traveling across the sky off to the south, and my right side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately, I thought the object was a meteor, but then it was too large and it had no tail.  I have been a sky watcher for a long time and have seen many tremendous meteor showers, but never a meteor this large, if that’s what it was.  It scared me because it seemed to be just above the tops of the pine trees, it was traveling silently and had no tail.  It went over my head and then over the house, traveling toward the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it seemed to dissipate and there were orange colored sparks behind it or around it, but that’s the only thing that could be called a tail.  The half moon going down in the western sky may have already set, or was behind a cloud, and it seemed almost as large as the half moon, but slightly smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not perfectly rounded in shape, I would call it a smooth blob shape, and there was no sound at all.  I would say the whole episode lasted  approx. 7 to 10 seconds and the object passed over my head so it was directly up in the sky and not close to the horizon at all.<n>

The lights where off in the distance but the way they were moving immediately struck me as odd..they were positioned cade corner from eachother .by the way they were moving in a way that caught my eye..I asked my friend what he thought they were and we watched the lights for about 5 minutes..we both threw out suggestions of what we thought it was..my best description was that it moved like a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching for a few minutes and calling my brother to come look at what we were looking at the 2 lights that appeared close to eachother a moved one left one right in a blink of an eye to either side of the sky..<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother was spooked and went inside in a hurry.me and my friend stayed outside ..The lights were now accross the sky from eachother..The one that moved to the left appeared to be coming in our direction.the one that went to the right was farther from us and our attention was on the one nearest...<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this single white light come closer at a very low speed.i couldn&#39;t see any shape at this point but from the way it moved and how low it was flying I knee something was very odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keep in mind.i do live by an airport and see planes all the ttime and never seen one move this wsy..The movement was more of a hover.the speed was very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> we could tell it was coming towards the area we were at.i don&#39;t know the exact distance it was from us but it was getting closer and closer and we still didn&#39;t hear any noise coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend was then spooked and tries to run inside .I grabbed his arm and asked him to wait with me .We stood there another minute and it was getting closer to the point where I agreed and we both ran inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I get inside my curiosity just starts eating at me and I ran back outside .I look towards where I last seen the object.nothing there.i look straight up in the sky and it was directly above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a triangle shaped aircraft.i didn&#39;t see the white light anymore but red lights that lined the front in a v shape.the rest of the craft was pitch black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents property is is a little over an acre and this craft looked every bit larger ..it seemed to be so low I could throw a rock at it.it was completely silent and moving at a low speed.i was in shock or awe from what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing that I still don&#39;t understand is why I didn&#39;t see it fly away.i forget if I ran back inside or what I did.my mind was running a thousand mph it seemed. I just remember looking back up at it and didn&#39;t see it any more.there was no noise or vibration for me to look in its directiom.it was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started talking to the neighbors right after this took place when 2 jets with huge spotlights .I mean lights that lit up the land huge ,started flying in a big circle around this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never has anyone heard jets that loud fly so low or jets with massive spotlights on them around here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was definitely an odd occurance.i mean those jets were odd due to the fact that no one has seen those either but the triangle shaped craft that flew directly over my mom&#39;s house without a sound was scary odd.it was like watching a paper airplane in the air.not a noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

She assumed it was a lantern, but I have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting on the bleachers to the right of the youth center, facing towards the Ferris wheel.

At approximately 13:30, I was laying on my back with my feet pointing nearly due south.  I had on a pair of high quality polarized sunglasses that allowed me to look up into the afternoon sky.  I was watching cumulous clouds roll and build in the afternoon heat when a black object appeared in my field of view from high and right, moving down and to the left.  This would be a Southeast trajectory.  My immediate opinion was that the object was a large black bird, riding the wind at a very high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A split second after the object entered my field of view, however, the “Bird” appeared to have its wings folded in.  Birds who ride the thermoclines at that altitude very rarely flap their wings so I thought this odd.  I waited for the “Bird” to open its wings.  It never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I describe this at the luxury of taking the time to sit in my living room and record my memory of the event, please bear in mind, the entire event was over in approximately 5 seconds.  When my eyes became fixed and focused on the object,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped up from my chair and moved to the right to prevent my view from being blocked by a tree that is next to the pool.  What I was looking at was a solid black sphere.  I got an extremely good look at the object and could judge altitude better as it passed under a large cloud.  My view was never obstructed by the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not appear to have any lights on it, nothing flashing, and it made absolutely no sound.  It left no form of contrail, but at that low of an altitude, neither would a commercial or private aircraft.  No contrail, moved under a cloud so my estimation of altitude would be at or under 1000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The direction of the object never changed.  It continued out of sight on the same Southeastern trajectory it was on when I first saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work in the aviation field and I am familiar with what a fixed wing and or a non-fixed wing aircraft looks like in the sky.  I also know that any aircraft I am aware of, short of a non-powered glider can be heard from the ground at a below-cloud altitude.  This object was absolutely silent.  This object appeared to be a perfect sphere.  There were no wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not claiming the object I saw was of extra-terrestrial origin, but I know what I saw was no typical aircraft that I have ever seen before.<n>

9/1/14 09:30|Southwest desert|AZ|Triangle|5 minutes|3 brilliant bright orb  lights observed in the SouthWest desert parked on a plateau in the middle of nowhere.|9/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113214.html|818|ndxe201409| 3 brilliant bright orb  lights observed in the Southwest desert, parked on a plateau in the middle of nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to  report that I saw  3 brilliant bright orbs of light at about 9:30 am on September 1, 2014.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.	  I was on a United Airlines flight from Denver to Orange County.  These bright blinding lights were flickering out in the middle of nowhere in the Southwest desert.  I believe the location was somewhere between the Grand Canyon and Nevada. It was in an area minus of any trees, rivers, or lakes. Only miles and miles of dry, arid brown and red soil in all directions  which looked as it had once been the bottom bed of a deep ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear on the morning of Sept. 1, 2014 and I saw three blinding bright lights flickering from a plateau.  These lights remained grounded in a stationary position on this plateau which was in an uninhabitable arid area with no sign of life for at least a hundred miles in any direction.   I saw no river or lake, on signs that once in the prehistory of the region that an ocean had been present.  This region looks as if it can support no life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were lined up one in front of the other with smaller blinking lights, just as bright blinking.  The  3 large orbs of lights glowed steadily and did not flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn’t able to get a photograph of this sighting  but I did go online to see if anyone else had witnessed this strange phenomenon in the middle of nowhere.   I did find a video posted on  youtube.com which appears to be exactly within the same region and of the same type of vehicles that I sighted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred on  June 10 2014- and can be f! ound on Youtube under :  STRANGE- THREE UNUSUAL BRIGHT LIGHTS   The person recording this sighting also observed the lights while in flight to Los Angeles.  The only difference with his sighting  is that these lights he filmed appear to airborne whereas the lights I observed were stationary on a large plateau.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given that the lights were so bright it made it difficult to see to what these lights were attached.  It did look as if they were attached to some large dark triangular shaped  aircraft sitting all one in front of the other.  I only know that the area where these parked vehicles were emiting the brightest light I have ever encountered most probably did not originate from any human being, as survival in that area would be next to impossible without the aid of aircraft to transport anyone to that region.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This region is the most desolate and uninhabitable region of the U.S. and can not sustain life.<n>

9/1/14 05:00|Silverton|CO|Other|~20 minutes|Silent, stationary (maybe) object; open V shape, tube-like arms/wings of pulsating light.|9/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113255.html|820|ndxe201409| Silent, stationary (maybe) object; open V shape, tube-like arms/wings of pulsating light<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was camping in the meadow across CR2 (W) of the Maggie Gulch outhouse.  Somewhat before dawn (4:45ish?), I noticed a very bright “star” just above the horizon to the east.  Figured it was a plane, but it didn&#39;t move and the light(s) didn&#39;t blink.  Rather, the light (looked like a single light) seemed to keep changing from white to green and back, somewhere between twinkling and pulsating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for 10 mins. or so and finally dug out my binoculars (small B&amp;L, don’t know the specs).  When I looked through them, I saw an object shaped like an open/wide V, with the curved apex of the V pointed north.  The apex was black (or unlit).  The arms looked like long, thin fluorescent tubes that were both completely illuminated with pulsating light, which was variously green and white (as I saw with the naked eye) and some red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched (15 mins. or so?), dawn started to break and the stars all faded, but I could still see whatever it was ( a variant of the relativel! y common V-shaped UFO?)  Perhaps it had moved very slowly a little to the south.  At that point, I stopped watching (tired of peering through the binocs) and went back to sleep.<n>

The first phenomena I experienced is what looked like an unusually bright object also usually colored that seemed to originate from one point in the sky and stretch to another point and vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 30 minutes later with the continuous bombardment of space debris I started to notice what looked like a star, not pulsating erratically, moving what seemed relatively slow but at such a high altitude that it was moving at a remarkable speed.  Either the same craft would appear and fly across the sky and vanish or multiple craft were flying across my field of vision. (I was facing south west).<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was unusual about the crafts movement was that it was seemingly flying straight as though trying to appear to be an airplane but it would make sudden erratic turns that passenger aircraft were not capable of.  There was no sound coming from these craft, in Maui meadows every sound echoes and you can clearly distinguish the cars on the highway about 3/4 of a mile west of where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most usual thing that I saw was an actual commercial flight fly across my field of view and another spacecraft appear and maneuver dramatically to almost intercept the plane and then follow it out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have tried to rule out other possibilities but it could not be space debris because they were directly contrasted next to each other.  It also could not be an airplane for 2 reasons, Maui is quite isolated, there are only 2 airports, the closest of which is 15 miles away, and comparing these lights to an airplane confirmed my theory that they could not have been airplanes because they moved across the same airspace at what appeared to be the same altitude in incredibly short intervals.  Also the commercial flights would not have been able to reach such great altitudes in such a short time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please do with this what you can and if any answers could be made clear to me that is my ultimate goal in reporting this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our experience suggests to us that the visible re-entry of space debris, put into orbit by man, is a relatively rare event.  We do not know what the witness was observing.  PD))<n>

I was looking into the air, I noticed three orange lights.. in a triangle formation.  I&#39;d initially thought they were all separate, until I focused my vision and could see an actual ship.  A ship with some kind of camouflage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had seen this same ship in my dream, a lucid dream.  The dream was a few seconds long.  I was in the woods naked, for some reason..  Then I look up and see two saucer type ships, and that same triangular ship above them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 7 my cousin often see these orange lights, and have heard cannon fire from a local military base shortly before/after seeing them.<n>
