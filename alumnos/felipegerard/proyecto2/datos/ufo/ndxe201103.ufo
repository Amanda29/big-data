So it caught my interest.  The object was hovering and then started to move to my right after I noticed that it wasn&#39;t a helicopter.  I was driving when I saw it so I just started following it.  I didn&#39;t think it would move very fast but it started going so fast that the lights vanished in under a minute.  While I was following one of the lights disappeared and then I could only see two lights. I believe it was because when I first spotted it I was seeing it from the side and as it moved I ended up behind the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was following the craft, it seemed as if the whole thing turned over on it&#39;s back while it flown away from town.  The lights on the craft changed from being horizontal to each other to being vertical and back to horizontal just before moving beyond seeing distance.  Also, while I was following this first craft I s! aw my girlfriend that was in the car with me saw a different one.  They were both headed in the same direction.  The crafts was in the shape of a triangle but with rounded edges and it seemed to have a dark gray color to it.  The lights were located at each end of the triangle and were halfway from the top and the bottom of the craft.  The crafts also looked like they changed shape while turning over but they were too far to describe the shape it finally formed into.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after the little chase one of my headlights went out.  It most likely wasn&#39;t from the sightings but I&#39;d just thought I&#39;d add that because I thought it was weird for it to burn out after that.  Russellville has a lot of cops so I didn&#39;t drive over the speed limit chasing the crafts, I probably only drove around 40 mph at most. This is the second time I&#39;ve seen anything like this but my first for this town.<n>

There was a big light on the top and directly under it was a smaller one they were perfectly aligned up and down.  We watched there were 3 in our car, it didn&#39;t move as we moved closer it stayed still in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove for about 5 minutes watching and we were going to follow the light to see what it was, when we turned away for a second because of the trees the one disappeared the one that was on top, the little one started to move we ended up pulling in our driveway and our kids pulled in behind us we all got out   I was just in awe as this craft or whatever it was went directly over us, no sound just lights it looked like a hoovering car, it had a flat bottom with one light on each side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disappeared when we turned to watch.<n>

A huge dark thing was floating sideways and up into the air.  I told the person on the phone, “oh that’s odd, kinda’ looks like a metallic balloon has been let go into the sky by someone.  And it did look like that, a grey/black sorta’ metallic looking with an occasional extremely bright light omitting periodically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rationalizing that it is a balloon I let my attention stray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes pass and I look to the sky to see the progress of flight. To my surprise, the “balloon” is not where I thought it would be. In fact, it appears to be stationary and not as high as expected. Now it has my full attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watch as the dark mass with the bright light glided horizontally towards the North West of the valley. Watching in disbelief and curiosity, after a few minutes, I witness it angle and then turn back towards the SW, towards me. I am now talking to my mom on the phone (trying to direct her view to see what I am seeing), the unidentified flying object is now heading directly towards me. I am sure it was just my perception, but the object was flying then stopped, what seem to be directly over me and then began to hover. A full minute passed and I noticed the bright light was still as intense but the dark matter was dissipating. I realized the craft was now starting to ascend. Several moments passed as it continued to hover and rise. Then it slowly drifted towards the North East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My experience was over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always believed, just too much credible information not to, I just never thought I would get the opportunity to experience such an anomaly with my own two eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not looking for validation, I am just sharing my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your forum to share these stories, you allow us to truly be “not alone”.<n>

At first I thought it was an unusually bright star in the north west sky. As it got closer I realized it was a bright green color (like a green laser). I called my wife out with the binoculars for a second opinion. It was a single point of intense green light that pulsed on and off at different speeds and intervals (almost like morse code at times). It slowly traversed directly overhead in in a southeast direction, slightly changing velocity and direction as it went. Its movement was slower than a passing satellite (taking about 10 minutes from horizon to horizon). When it was overhead it was much brighter than Sirius. Even with binoculars it still looked like a single point of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound, but it did frighten my wife. She was grabbing on to me and hiding behind me. I have never seen her react this way to anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting happened over a year ago. At the time we saw it, I documented all the details. Hearing Peter Davenport on the radio motivated me to file this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The brightest LED like light was flashing over the western horizon.  Then the flash turned into 3 flashes, each at the same time about a mile apart for one flash, and then back to the same 2 second pattern of one light flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both felt chills down our spines as we watched this spectacular event.  There was no way this was a airplane. I have never seen lights this bright, and it would move like lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We parked the car at a field and watched this amazing event.  We then noticed a abundance of what seemed to be planes or satellites bunching around the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left the scene because it was cold out and we were freaked out.<n>

This event happened near the fire station in North Bismarck.  There is a small park in the area that you could probably see them at.  In the sky they first appeared to be flying in a formation.  And later by themselves seemingly on a schedule.  I saw the formation at about 10:10 pm the first night. I ran to get my family about ten minutes later we saw a single object it looked like a 3D triangle that you could see through with glowing orbs on each tip.  This one had about six orbs.  They were very dim and were glowing from within.  The orbs were connected by skinny bars of blackness.  The objects were hard to see because they were mostly darkness except for the orbs.  This craft seemed to rotate as it floated across the sky.  It made no noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later we saw another with only about 3 points of light and later another with two it looked like a dumbbell shape with one orb on each side.  We also saw one that was a single orb.  The appearances lasted for an hour and the crafts seemed to be on a schedule one going this way one going another direction.  All eventually moving over us at the same point. They seemed really small smaller than a car and close.  Definitely under the cloud line.  I know that because before they disappeared a dense fog moved in directly over us one appeared under the fog moved into it and they they were gone and the fog moved out.  The same thing happened the next night. I looked for them that time to see if they would come again.  I asked my dad to go back and look for them again since I don&#39;t live in ND anymore. Hopefully he can get some video and pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I were to have any interpretation as to what they were it would be that they seemed like some sort of surveillance to me...<n>

I stepped outside to take the call.  I sat on the stacked bricks that delineated one side of our RV site, facing west.  I glanced up to the sky to see a very bright light surrounded by a firey glow flash across the sky from due east to due west and, after maybe two to three seconds, it vanished from site.  It was still dusk outside, and the sky was still quite well lit.  This light ball was very, very bright and appeared to be much lower in the sky than the usual shooting stars I normally see after it is completely dark outside.  No sound was present.<n>

March 30th 2011.  I go to my car and get my cigarettes.  I light one of them and get up out of my car and turn around.  And there is a Black pyramid/triangle shape floating above the back end of my neighborhood over the Fire Department and in front of a Water Tower...   The best way to describe it would have to be like a perfect symmetrical pyramid and/or triangle.  Like if you cut off the top of the Great Pyramid of Giza...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was all black.  It made absolutely no noise.  It floated parallel with a major road in my town over the back end of neighborhood.  It was incredible…  There were 4 lights... there were 3 that were you know the normal white light on the 3 corners, 1 in each corner.  And in the center there was a red light.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the only difference is the first time I saw this same similar object with my friend; the red light wasn&#39;t blinking.  On, March, 30th 2011 the RED light was BLINKING...  Not sure if it means anything. (I saw a similar object on a separate occasion with a friend, a few years ago probably 2 but in the same county) I called 911.  I have no idea if they took me serious or actually followed it up.  But, I was in shock just for the fact it was so close to my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another example is if you look at the back of a One Dollar bill.  The eye in the pyramid-that is the closest thing I can think of, but the lights were on the bottom of it... but at the same time it was such a Dark Black that you could see the outline of it perfectly... and in my situation I had a humungous water tower as a backdrop and this thing just floated in front of it..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stand by what I saw. And I also stand by the resume that my short life span holds... 4 years military (Active)... 1 year Iraq, 1 year Korea...  I’m now a Disabled Veteran.  Like I said I&#39;ve seen many things from airplanes to helicopters to balloons and missiles.... and for the sake of the term UFO this was an Unidentified Flying Object...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whether or not it is Alien or Extra Terrestrial I don’t know.  I know what I saw and I know it was a Black pyramid/triangle floating very slowly over my neighborhood heading towards Route 50 in the state of Maryland.  I will tell anyone what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have to estimate the size as pretty decent considering it bloated out a good portion of the water tower when it floated by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have to say the incident lasted for approximately 10-15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred in Easton, Maryland.  On March 30th, 2011 around 1:50 am Est.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said I called 911.  I connected to Talbot County dispatch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You<n>

It had red and green rotating lights as if either the craft was rotating itself or the lights were moving around the craft (clockwise motion).   Now I AM aware that all small planes have green and red lights, but the way this thing was moving really threw us off... enough that I ran inside and woke up my wife.  The object appeared to be hovering in one spot but once in a while would get kind of shifty, as if as if it were banking hard side to side, and when it would do this it would expose the bottom of what we believed to be either a disc shape or a mushroom shaped craft, either way the bottom was lit up yellowish, about the color of like a street light.  Around the craft there was a very faint green glow to it.  The craft hovered for about 30 mins. or so and slowly moved away from us.  Both my friend and I are chefs at a local restaurant, and my wife! is a waitress, we are by no means experts on air crafts, but I have seen many planes in the night sky and this was not a plane.  Its movements were strange ... it moved up and down very quickly with a curvy pattern simular to an &#34;s&#34;.  I am sorry that is the best way to describe its movements with out being abale to show you.  Ufo, i don&#39;t know for sure.  Airplane - NO. Either way I was wondering if anyone else saw this???  We tried to take pictures but our camera wasn&#39;t able to pick up the lights... we tried all of our phones with no luck and then we ran inside to grab our camera (fujifilm finepixZ5) not the greatest camera but we tried anyway... no luck.  Just at the end of us watching this craft hover above what would have been a farm field, there was what appeared to be a falling star, if that has any relivence. The time was 12am on the nuts the object appeared in the sky slightly southwest of Floyd, IA.  There wasn&#39;t a cloud in sky and just before the craft disappeared! there was a thunder like sound.<n>

It doesn&#39;t move up or down nor side to side. It doesn&#39;t get bigger or smaller but just hovers in one spot and then is gone in the blink of an eye. Actually, I video&#39;d this experience but it ended when I slipped off the bed (laugh, it&#39;s okay, I certainly did) and the five to ten seconds it took to get back in the window, this thing was gone. It disappeared in a flash just as it did the first time I had seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen a plane over the Basin and living in the area of the city, I hear all the noise from helicopters or the rare plane that flies over.  I live close to a container yard that was directly below where I saw the object.  I can hear the containers being loaded and unloaded onto large ships but I could not hear any noise coming from this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was one white/orange ball of light that looked fairly large in the night sky.  While watching the video it looks like there may be three distinct lights horizontal to one another and very close together.  Aside from the white and orange, I could also see reds and blues flashing from it.  Blue is not a normal colour from an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I posted the video to my Facebook account and everyone who has watched it, cannot identify what the object is.<n>

It was so dim that I could barely make it out at all.  If I hadn’t been looking up at that exact moment I would have missed it. It moved silently and very fast. As I moved, turning my head and sidestepping  to follow it, I tripped on the dogs chain (the dog moved because I startled her with my sudden movement) and lost sight of it behind the neighbors tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t even guess at the altitude. I have no clue at all. If I was forced to make a guess I would say it was flying no higher than 1,000 feet but for all I know it could have been at 10,000 feet or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate the “sighting” to have lasted around two to three seconds and definitely no more than four seconds.  As far as the size goes I can only hold my arm out and guess that it was taking up a space of 1” to 1-1/2” inches at arm’s length in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nobody else could have possibly seen it unless they happened to be looking up at that exact moment and exact place.  It was barely perceptible against the night sky.  Even if someone was next to me they would not have had time to look up and focus on it to verify it.  I did see what I just described.  No doubt in my mind at all.  None.<n>

So I pulled off I-25 (mead exit) on the off ramp.looking toward the east (three in a triangle shape,at first they were all white then changed to one  Red, Green and White.each) constant, not flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I shut off the motor and lights,got out  and just watched. ...then it changed from three evenly spaced lights to an elongated triangle.. (the lights at each corner, kinda like clearance lights of a truck) from the distance it had to be maybe a half mile long.  (I seem to be the only one who noticed. no one else stopped. ....after about 10 min it still hadn&#39;t changed.  So I was. (getting ancy about being late for work)  But still watching, then all of a sudden…   It turned up on one side,moved 90 degrees (turning away from me) all in less than a second. (remember very big) and started moving away.(no sound) to the East. At the rear of it was two white clam shaped pods,with little dotted lines thru the middle of both.(assumed it was the propulsion system..... I could see heat waves between it and me. As it got further away,it turned SE.  Then beyond it there was a horizontal plane of white light with an red opaque top to it in the shape of a cockpit. (much larger than the triangle) and flashing red lights swarming all around it. moving further away.  Did i mention where I first saw the triangle shape was in the close vicinity of a decommissioned n power plant.... I have heard before of sightings around things of that nature<n>

We were walking on the beach to the north and it was dark.  Looking out over the ocean to the east I noticed a bright yellow colored light moving parallel to the beach toward the north.  The light slowed to a stop and went out.  I had shouted for the others to look at the light and they also were able to see it going out.  The next we saw was a single yellow light appear and it was stationary. A second light appeared south of it and then another and another.  A total of four lights were in a row and all stationary.  Then a fifth light came on further south of it.  The lights then went out in sequence and reappeared in sequence twice more.  My daughter said it appeared to her to be rotating.  This all took approximately 30 seconds.  The lights then disappeared.  We stood watching that area of the sky fo! r another minute or more when we then saw another yellow light appear further north and travel toward the south.  Two more lights then came on toward the south and one of them moved north until it appeared to joining with the other light coming south.  The lights went out again.  We stood there for another several minutes and saw two more yellow lights appear in the same area and then go out.  Each time the lights did not appear to flicker or loose altitude due to falling or drifting.  It was also pretty windy that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son-in-law was able to capture the second set of lights on his camera video.  We watched for quite awhile after this however we did not see the lights again.  Upon doing a search in my computer I learned that there had been other numerous sightings of these lights by others in the Myrtle Beach area.  One of these posts is where I found your website address.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I and our daughter and son-in-law are all professionals and none of us has ever witnessed anything like this before.  These lights were definitely not flares, stars or lightning in the distance as some have suggested of the other posts.<n>

It was closer to the earth then the stars because it would pass over a few of them. It was very bright, about the same brightness as a normal star would look.  I really hope someone else has seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my first sighting ever of a ufo but i have been looking for them for a long time.  I finally got my chance.<n>

It was silent and it reflected the suns light at certain points and flashed a soft red and white light once or twice.  about 5 minutes after it disappeared in the distance, there was a plan traveling very slowly in the same direction as if it was tailing the ufo. i tried to video tape it but it was relatively small and somewhat far from us and nothing showed up in the video itself.<n>

On my way home I stopped to look up at the stars, like I always do.  While sitting there looking up I saw a fast moving flashing thing glowing between bright green and bright silver come shooting straight down from space and I knew right away it had landed somewhere in the USA because of its trajectory.  I was facing south, south west.  I was located in the neighborhood behind my apartment building facing SSWest.(more south than west) After the object fell I looked up to where it had originated from to see a bright light slowly close, or turn off.  It looked like a beam being turned off or a door closing or a ship leaving.  The object that came down was a lot slower than a shooting star but faster than anything I have ever seen.  It looked exactly like a triangular firework that you can launch yourself  bought from a store only it came from orbit and faster and it twinkled bright green and silver flickering.  No noise heard when it landed but it was way too far away to hear anyhow.  I know it landed I could just tell. It came from that light in orbit whatever it was. It came down in a straight line, what does that?   I know what I saw and I now know that we are NOT alone it is now impossible for me to believe we are alone, no way !!  The feeling I got was that something got transported down, is what it felt like. I got that feeling, you know.?  Creepy…<n>

This was around 3PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly something caught my eye and when I looked I saw 3 small super bright round (could not really see the material, only light) objects playing around in a fast pace, above the seashore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew I never saw something similar like this before and I decided to rush upstairs (I live in the 14th floor) and try to take a picture if they were still around (I don’t have a great camera with a big zoom).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took me about 30 seconds to spot one of them above the ocean, and one of them going along the shore in opposite direction (later in the poicture, I could spot a very bright light on the sky and a black shadowNotice that they were really small.  From my terrace, they were no longer bright but yellow and orange shaped as a blimp and were now going very slow. I could not hear a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no one at the beach at that time that I could see.  (I thought about remote control toys but no one was there controlling them and I also, later on, did a research about remote control toys that are similar to the ones I saw.  I could not find any)  Suddenly I lost one of them and the one I took a picture, was flying very close to the water horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly it stopped and started to go up in the sky until I could not see it anymore.  I saw no strings, no fire, no smoke, no sound.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photo provided by the witness, and we see an object in the frame, which appears to be floating on the surface of the ocean.  We are unable to identify it, although it seems to us that it could be a buoy, or perhaps detritus.  We cannot certify that it has anything to do with an alien space craft, but we cannot be certain.

As I approached the building where my mother resides I noticed two very bright, large dark red lights almost burgundy in color that were pulsating in the cloudy sky.  At first glance, the size, brightness, shade of red and distance when I first observed the lights compelled me to stop and observe.  In the sky foreground I observed a couple of small planes and a couple of larger possibly commercial aircraft which were easily recognizable because of the shape, wings and green and red colored lights that all aircraft display. In what I determine to be about a ten second interval, I observed the dark red lights separate and I focused my attention on the dark red light! flying toward my direction and I quickly stopped my motorcycle and got off in order to have a better view standing up.  Within a few seconds I noticed that the light went behind a cloud stopped illuminating red and suddenly out of the cloud I observed a dark grayish looking object in the shape of an octagon which quickly peeked through this white cloud.  I then observed that the octagon was not the shape of the object but rather part of the surface features that it exhibited and I watched as this object emerge completely through the cloud and display the shape of a perfect circle with incredible detail at the bottom of this disk. There was a small, broad rimmed circle in the center of the bottom and wedge shaped lines that extended from the center of the smaller rimmed circle towards the outer edges like an evenly divided “pie chart”. To determine the size I could best describe it as being the size of the full Moon or approximately one inch in width at arm length.  Here I ! am standing in shock, looking in disbelief at this incredible ! object t hinking to myself, Is this really happening, is this a real UFO? And instantly I observe it moving smoothly but fast, westward towards the Everglades. Then suddenly it occurs to me to quickly grab my cell phone and photograph it, video record it QUICKLY, and I start to fumble with the cell phone, and I hit video and point it towards the disk but looking through the monitor I don’t see anything, so here I am trying to reset the phone for a still photo and nervously I hit the video record button again and I cancel it and on the third try I manage to reset it to take a still and I do so, then I remember that the camera lens has a zoom function and my second still shot was taken with the zoom maxed out. By the time the second photo was taken I see the UFO traveling out of my line of sight over some nearby trees and I quickly jumped on my bike and started racing after it with hopes that I could situate myself possibly ahead of it or at least near it to take some more still photos! . I observed the UFO flying away quickly so I raced as fast as I could towards US-27/Okeechobee Road trying to get ahead of it but I lost sight of it while maneuvering around traffic on Pines Boulevard so I quickly raced towards State Road I-75 towards Naples, Florida because that was the direction of travel that the UFO appeared to have been heading when my motorcycle motor started to abnormally misfire.  I eventually made it to the toll booth but after looking up at the sky and scanning all around and not seeing anything unusual like strange lights I decided to turn around and head home. Had the motor performed as usual, I would have definitely raced across Alligator Alley all the way to Naples hoping to cross paths with the UFO.  Strangely enough as soon as I started heading back on the bike towards Fort Lauderdale the bike stopped misfiring.  As soon as I arrived home I grabbed a pen and paper and drew what I had seen then documented the time and location of my sighting! .  Next I got on the internet and searched for photos of UFO’s! and nea rly fell out of my chair when I observed a couple of photos that looked identical to the UFO that I observed.   The photo that most resembled the UFO that I encountered is a photo posted by someone named Alex Nolan.  I attempted to contact Alex Nolan and have e-mailed him with my telephone number so I can inquire on where he obtained the photo in question.  Immediately following my arrival home I attempted to contact Perry Airport in Miramar, Fl. and Fort Lauderdale International Airport and left messages for their staff to contact me. I contacted Channel 7 WSVN TV to inquire if anyone reported any strange aerial phenomena but was advised that no reports had been filed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have waited for thirty four (34) years to experience something like this and it was over in just a matter of a minute, but what I observed was the most astonishing, incredible, mind boggling experience that I have ever experienced.  I have watched documentaries, movies, seen countless photographs and read many stories but nothing could have prepared me for what I saw, a REAL UFO that displayed so much detail and it was flying directly over my head.  At first I could not believe what was actually happening right in front of my eyes. It was so surreal that I was in shock and at the same time mesmerized that I almost forgot to take photos. I ended up fumbling with my cell phone but did manage to get two pictures, one of which you could definitely see the dark grey color and circular shape of the UFO. What I experienced earlier today was indisputably the most fantastic, amazing and mind blowing experience I ever had.  I use to be one of the many who thought, agreed and believe! d that there is no way that we (the human race) cannot possibly be alone.

The sighting took place in downtown Ann Arbor.  My friend looked up and exclaimed, “What the **** is that?”   He pointed directly upwards to a triangular object who’s three points were each designated by a soft, blue light.  The object seemed not to cruise a regular speed, but to sort of float and pivot slightly back and forth, headed in a general northwest direction.  The object itself was barely discernible, except the back looked slightly concaved, or fish-tailed.  We saw the object floating for about 15 seconds before it disappeared behind the buildings in the city.<n>

I woke up to go to the bathroom at 6:40am and the bedroom was dark. Just as I lay back in bed, the sky lit up with a bright blue light which filled the room. I got up and looked out the window—It looked like bright daylight, blue in hue, not yellow. Then it stopped and was back to darkness. I say dark, even though it was morning, it had been raining and was overcast (no thunderstorms), so was definitely not naturally light enough for what I was seeing. It lasted about 15 seconds total. My wife also woke up and saw this light. Our first thoughts were that it was some sort of security light, or perhaps someone drove up the driveway, but the bedroom is on the second story, and my daughter lives on 180 acres out in the country—there is only a security light by the barn, but it comes on automatically from dusk to dawn and was still on when the bright light quit and returned to darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought maybe someone shot a flare-gun off and was waiting to see the sky light –up the way it would from a flare.  Well nothing happened and the orange glowing ball was coming toward my house from the west going east.  We knew it wasn’t a plane, no red or green lights.  It was just this glowing round ball.  My friend said to me “are we expecting a meteor shower at all?”  I said to her, “are you stupid”?  If that was a meteor it would drop out of the sky.  Whatever this is, is traveling parallel to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it past by the side of my house the orange glow went away and you could see nothing behind it.  No light following it, nothing.  Just plain weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First it fell like a shooting star, then it began to jig jag...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside with two friends atop a higher hilly region a few miles off of Del Mar Heights Road in the Del Mar area of San Diego (more inland about 5-7 miles East of the 5 Freeway).  We had all just finished admiring the panoramic view and the various skylines when something drew my eyes back to that part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, I saw what appeared to be a very low shooting star way off in the distance. It is hard to decipher where it was exactly in San Diego, as it seemed to be over 10 - 20 miles south / southeast of where we were. Immediately, I told the others and they watched what initially appeared to be a shooting star begin to rise back up in the sky. I found myself saying, &#34;Wait a minute, that&#39;s not supposed to happen.  That&#39;s not a shooting star afterall.&#34;   The object was glowing red and green and was hard to identify the shape.  Instead of dissipating into the atmosphere after it fell, it began to move close to the ground next to a few tall buildings (5 - 10 stories in height).  It then moved back up in a jig jagged way.  It went about 5 stories above the taller buildings and then swooped back down near the ground again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all looked away as we joked at what it could be.  &#34;Hopefully it&#39;s just a very nicely made remote control toy or something.&#34;  But then I realized it had impressively bright lights.  We all looked back a third time to see if it was still there, and found it was very high up in the sky - about as high or even higher than a commercial airplane flies.<n>

They were more of an orange color and much too large to be stars; I didn’t count them, I guesstimate around 9, always staying an equal distance from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw them one end appeared to be below the tree line so I thought someone must be flying a string of something from their house (this too didn’t seem likely but in my head I was desperately trying to make sense of what I was seeing), however as I proceeded along the highway I got to where I was right underneath the lights (Seward Highway and Stony Creek Ave) and found they were not below the tree line and in fact were very slowly moving along in a southerly direction (toward town).  They were not in any formation, more like a string of lights moving along together although when I first saw them and was ma! king my way closer (and therefore the angle of my view changing as I went) some of them formed into a pentagon for a short time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped when they were right above me, as it was night I can’t really say how high they were but maybe another trees length above tree line.  After I stopped I tried to focus in on one to see if I could make out the shape but it was too bright, also noted there was no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to go the rest of the way to my house and get a neighbor to look with me but as soon as I got just a ways down the road they were out of sight below the tree line and I did not go back for another look.<n>

The sun had already set. I noticed lights moving strangely behind our neighbours tree(in the southern sky). I asked her if she noticed it too and she said yes. Then, whatever it was, moved upwards and we could see it clearly. Whatever it was had 5 lights. Three yellow lights at the centre, a blue flashing light on one side and a red flashing light on the other. The lights were the same size and the flashing lights flashed out of sync.  The way this thing maneuvered tells me it could not be a manned aircraft.I am a pilot and I know these maneuveres cant be done.  For about 3 minutes it flew up, then shot left at high speed, then right again then shot up. It moved very fast, very erratically. My wife ran into the house to fetch a camera, but by the time she was ready to start filming it had dissapeared behind the treeline again. We stayed outside and it appeared again at about 21h 30, but this time only for a few seconds.  We spent the next 3 hours outside hoping it would return again, but it didnt.  The only logical explanation I have is that someone was flying a R/C aircraft at night, because it moved too fast and changed direction too fast for it to have been manned.  The only problem with this explanation is that there is an airport to the east of my home and flying R/C aircraft in the area is not allowed. This thing also didnt make any sound.<n>

I saw what I thought at first to be a jet liner way up and a bit of the chem-trails behind it, until I realized that it was not, in fact, a jet at all, but rather what I would describe as an oblong shape standing vertically in the sky with the sun reflecting off what appeared to be a silver surface. Neither of us could figure out what it was, so we turned to get a better angle. The object would go back and forth between its oblong shape and what seemed to be a small light. The light would fade, but never completely disappear, then it would go back to the shape we originally saw it in. Soon it quit returning to the oblong shape, and we saw what we at the time thought were two dark clouds about it, until we saw the &#34;clouds&#34; rotate around the light. Eventually, the light was no longer visible and we drove the rest of the way to my house with no further incidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was somewhere around 10:30 am.  The sky was clear blue, not a cloud in sight.  The &#34;ufos&#34; were directly above the interstate northbound lanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed them they were spread out evening to form an arch shape.  When I saw them in this formation they looked to be an oblong shape and either metallic/reflective.  They then quickly transitioned into a different formation... more of a comet tail, but now they looked more triangular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then then moved to a random pattern and sort of individual disappeared but before they disappeared it almost looked like they were flashing lights except it seemed to be more of a reflective light (like a mirror in the sun)... all within a second or two.  Then I looked over towards the south bound lanes of the interstate and they appeared in the random formation past that side of the highway and then disappeared again.  They literally disappeared in one spot and reappeared in another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first when I saw the oblong shapes I thought it might have been wings from a small plane but then when they changed shaped and moved at such rapids speeds I threw that theory out the window. From what I could tell it couldn&#39;t have been planes at the speed the had to have traveled to get from point a to point b.  I for sure counted 6 &#34;ufos&#34; but feel like there might have been a 7th one visible at one point, but I&#39;m unsure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that evening I tried googling UFOs sightings in Texas and nothing came up.  I have continued to randomly search the internet to see if someone else might have reported something but it still looks as if I&#39;m the only one.<n>

Ahead of me, over the median came a very large square and very flat grid of lights.  The grid was almost as wide as the median about a 100’ +or- and twice as long, like a football field.   There were bright white marker light’s at evenly spaced intervals and lessor light’s making up a grid pattern within the square perimeter.

I observed a steady point of light looking south from Chaco Canyon north of Fajada Butte. I thought it was a star at first because it didn&#39;t appear to be moving, then a planet because it wasn&#39;t twinkling and it was so bright, then a plane or helicopter when I noticed that it was moving slowly from my vantage point. I have seen many satelites and knew it was not one because of its brightness, low position on the horizon and that it appeared to be coming closer to my location as I kept watching. It appeared to be about 3-5 miles away at an altitude of between 600-1000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see any blinking lights on it that would signify a known flying object and the light was steady and bright (brighter than any stars in the sky). The object came to within 2 miles I would guess continuing east and north towards me until it shot off towards the sky in an upper southwest direction at a speed that was so fast that if I had blinked I would have thought it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I saw the object shoot off at an incredible speed, the only man made object I thought it could have been was a helicopter due to it&#39;s low altitude and slow speed. This occasion is extremely rare considering the remoteness of the location (Navajo Reservation) and proximity to nearest town (at least 50 miles) or known military base (Kirkland AFB 170-200 miles away.)

I was sitting on my roof looking at the stars. I see many planes flying, so what I saw next was kind of surprising.  As I was looking at the stars I noticed one of them was moving.  At first I thought it to be a plane, but as my eyes fixed on the object I realized it definitely not.  It was way too high in the sky; it literally appeared to be a moving star.  The light was steady.  Even when viewed from different perspectives, the light remained constant. It lasted less than 10 seconds and then it simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many shooting stars (in fact I saw one two days later) and this was definitively not in that category.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  For some reason, witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As I watched, it went out and as soon as it did another one would appear next to where the original one was and it repeated this five times until it no longer appeared.  They were very large lights and if it was one craft it would have had to have been at least 1/2 mile to 1 mile wide.  But there is no way to tell if it was one craft or five separate crafts.<n>

As I came up to the area the craft was above a housing development about 150 feet.  The craft was black except for the two white lights on the underneeth of the craft on either side.  The lights were not shining down they were as if they were contained to the craft itself.  It was approximately 100 feet in length and 50 feet in width.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over thinking it was from the airbase near by but it made no sound and was just sitting still above the houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the craft for approximately 5 minutes.<n>
3/24/11 21:50|Coral Gables|FL|Diamond|1 minute|Diamond Shaped object seen crossing the view of Orion's Belt in Miami Night Sky|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88008.html|69|ndxe201103| Diamond Shaped object seen crossing the view of Orion&#39;s Belt in Miami Night Sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I viewed a Diamond shaped object while facing the west sky; it came in from the south and was heading north.  It appeared to be flying at least 40K-50K feet high and from my vantage point it appeared to be about 4-5 inches long/wide.  There were approx 16-20 lights that were visible at all times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most disturbing item to me and one that has caused me to submit this report is that the object look &#39;translucent&#39;.  The only example I can give is the way you view a jellyfish in the ocean.  You see it, but not at first as it blends in as part of what is around it.  This particular object caught my attention from the left corner of my eye.  I was facing west, looking at Orion&#39;s Belt from my balcony.  The night sky today is crystal clear from my vantage.  When the object caught my eye, at first I thought it was a &#39;cluster of moving stars&#39;, which I thought was odd.  Then I realized the &#39;cluster&#39; was actually moving in tandem and very smoothly.  As I watched what I thought was a cluster of stars go across the sky, I then saw that it wasn&#39;t stars at all; rather it was a large Diamond type craft.  I thought &#34;What.  What stars are in the shape of a huge Diamond?&#34;.  As the object continued to move I was able to figure out that the cluster of &#39;stars&#39; were actually some type of l! ights and were a part of a bigger object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it came in from my left (south) it moved across my view of Orion&#39;s Belt and continued to go directly north (right).  I watched it until it was so far away that I could no longer see it.  It did not zig zag, speeed up, slow down or anything odd.  It just moved across the sky as would a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone probably says &#39;please don&#39;t think I crazy&#39;, but I really don&#39;t want anyone to think I am crazy.  If I had to say what I saw in just a few words, it would be a Diamond Shaped object, flying at least 40K -50K feet high, moving across the sky no faster than an airplane, having 16-20 bright lights, being 5-6 inches (top to bottom, side to side) in the sky and &#39;masking&#39; or &#39;hiding&#39; itself with some type of translucent type film or cover.<n>
3/24/11 20:45|Marana|AZ|Light|30 min|A series of bright round orange lights appearing in 5-10 minute intervals high in the sky over Marana, AZ|4/3/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80591.html|70|ndxe201103| A series of bright round orange lights appearing in 5-10 minute intervals high in the sky over Marana, AZ<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 20:45 from shopping center at Tangerine/Oracle Rd in Oro Valley, AZ I saw a series of orange round lights in far, far distance looking West. The shopping center is in a &#39;bowl&#39; so the lights were high on the horizon, but from our position in the bowl, it was probably a 15 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light appeared, lighting up one by one, stayed momentarily, then disappeared. Five minutes later lights returned, I told friend, who turned and saw them too. Lights disappeared. We stood and waited, they reappeared again, in a series of 2-3 round orange lights, one set of three lit up, then the other set which was near but not attached to the other set. At best from far away it looked like two different objects each with three lights, but this is an assumption, we didn&#39;t see object, only the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 20:55pm we drove out along Tangerine Rd towards the adjacent town of Marana, we would see the lights on compass setting West. We continued to head West, taking the new Twin Peaks Rd from Tangerine down and over Interstate-10. Along this time we continued to see the series of lights intermittently. We could now tell they were not a plane nor helicopters, not a tower. (They were much higher in the horizon than a tower.) We lost track of them around the intersection of Coachline and Silverbell in Marana. When we lost site of them we felt as if the lights were still slightly West of here, but we felt we were in the immediate area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lights were definitely high in the sky for us to see from so far away.<n>

At first, a slow blinking of lights off in the distance in front of me: red on the right, then green on the left, back and forth, blinking as slow as the lights you&#39;d see warning you of an incoming train, but high into the air, and large.  My first thought was obvious, a low flying plane with unusual lights?  But no, for i was approaching it at a speed and closeness that seemed wrong, so then my next thought was of one of those towers, warning the low flying planes of danger, those big flashing red ones high in the sky.  (Even though this was green and red, and way too low, i settled for that answer.) Although I settled for simplicity, for some reason my gaze did not waver and as i approached it, i stared still doubting myself.  Then suddenly it came starkly into view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A solid disk, (almost predictable) shape spinning like a top from chaos&#39; hand.  Spinning so fast and yet moving none, just hovering right above the dark tree line to my right.   Although around me everything was dark, i saw plain as day, the silver exterior forming the eye shaped object to the right over my head.  The top and bottom of the strange thing was still, non-moving but the mid section spun amazingly fast to the right. (like G-force?)  It hovered only 10ish feet above my car, it couldn&#39;t have been much bigger than two vans side by side, not a goliath but bigger than me and my vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately pulled my car off the highway, hit my warning lights and without even turning off the car, jumped out, shaking and crying with fear and excitement.  I stood by the side of the road, cars blinding past, and looked longingly and fearfully to where the magnificent and strange thing once was... but nothing.  No sign in the sky that anything ever happened, and though i studied the skies all that night, they did not visit again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (This happened a mere 8 hours ago and I&#39;m still shaken, the whole ride home I couldn&#39;t help but look up to the tree line and a sharp pain would enter my heart and i&#39;d be struck with genuine fear and start once more shaking.  It was a beautiful and simply horrifying experience. One, if not the strangest thing to happen to me in my young 23 years.  On the way home, only the soothing voice of my family, boyfriend and George Noory could soothe me.)  To the stars!<n>

It slowed down, then changed its direction away from our observation point, then accelerated and quickly disappeared in distance at 11:30 o&#39;clock. i.e. from north/norh-west to south/south-east, then to west/south-west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not disappear because of an obscured view. But quickly disappeared in the haze of light pollution (got less bright and vanished, in a bit less than a second).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best guess: All this happened in about 5 seconds, indicating very high speed. There were several regular airplanes in the sky (not close to the object). They were much, much slower (about 10 to 20 times slower).<n> <n><n> <n><n> OBJECT: 2 distinct orange/orange-red lights (constant, not flashing - just like regular stars, less bright than regular airplanes). They appeared to belong to the same object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not hear any sound. Our surrounding area was quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best guess: The object seemed to be massive in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The regular airplanes were smaller relative to the size of the object (about 10times smaller). In contrast, the lights of the various airplanes were difficult to distinguish (also they flashed). The object&#39;s lights however were clearly distinguishable with space between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The regular airplanes could be clearly observed despite the haze of light pollution. The object however disappeared westsouthwest in the haze of light pollution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was bigger by sight but appeared to be further away than regular airplanes in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AREA: Center of small town, planes fly at high altitude (no airport nearby). Airplanes can be seen in the sky througout the day and evening. Regularly a helicopter from the nearby hospital is seen. We are familiar with both.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds in the sky, but a haze of light pollution. The belt of orion was to be clearly seen, the object appeared about two to three fists on the right of these stars and disappeared left of the first bright star on the left of orion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WITNESSES: 28.f. and 30.m..  Clear state of mind.  No disposedness to esoteric or religious worldviews.  Doctor and University degrees.  Little time to observe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SUMMARY:  The object was no regular airplane. It was too big to be a military craft - also still too fast. It was no shooting star or comet.  It changed its direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Speed, distance and size of object were difficult to guess, but were way out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish not to be contacted about anything unrelated to this incident.

I noticed a small dark object in the sky and it was moving above the Ambassador Bridge.  So with my camera I captured the image of the craft, along with the bridge, for reference purposes.  The photograph showed what appeared to be a &#39;disc-like&#39; object, but when I zoomed in on it, the object was not a disc, but rather something that looked almost like a fat &#34;kayak&#34;, navy blue in colour, with one end of the object appearing rounded and of a shiny, light toned silvery metallic material.  From the top of this &#34;chubby kayak&#34; appears a light, rounded object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Since the latter part of 2009, I have taken well over one hundred photographs of unusual/unidentified flying objects - a very wide variety of shapes and sizes - from this location where I live in Windsor), along with numerous pictures of EBEs (extraterrestrial biological entities, most, but not all, of them, &#34;humanoid&#34; in appearance.)  This is the first time I have reported one of my sightings - but if I was to go back and report every single one of them, they would number 100+.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Happy Skywatching, friends..!<n>

NUFORC has looked at all of the photos, and although we cannot identify all of the anomalous objects captured photographically, but most of the objects we believe are birds.  In most of those cases, we are even able to determine the type of bird involved, and its position in flight.  We believe that none of the photos is of a genuine UFO.

Then I didn&#39;t see any aircraft strobe lights blinking on them either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my friend if she could see what I was seeing, and she replied &#34;yes and that&#39;s really scary&#34;.

As i looked up i saw it comming down at a high speed blinking a bright white light when it had stopped in its tracks. It then shot back up, came back down at an angle , shot to the right and headed back up forming a triangle shape at a very high speed then disappered.  That was not an aircraft or shooting star.  From what i recall aircrafts or falling stars do not form triangle shape then just vanish.  This thing was just going way to fast and. . . I cant explain it this was just very strange and disturbing to me.<n>

I instantly knew we were not looking at a helicopter because of the strange shape. I also saw a few flashes of fire but I am very sure it was not a Chinese lantern because it was much larger. I would say it was the same size as a helicopter but of a flat shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Humidity 81%.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was stationary when first sighted, 100-150 feet above the water of a small pond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The viewing angle was up about 15 to 20 degrees.  Distance to the object was 300 to 600 feet (or more).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Closer than 300 would have put it in thick trees, farther out then 600 is possible, but only if the object was extremely large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Viewing time was between about 8 or 10 seconds, looking out a small window, in a door about 4-5 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking up a basement stairs, towards the door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The visible parts of the object were it&#39;s lights.  There were around 15 bright lights, red, green, blue &amp; white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some looked like a car&#39;s headlights in brightness and size, others seemed slightly smaller and a bit dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When first sighted, the lights appeared to be slowly rotating horizontally around a fixed central axis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rotation only lasted a few seconds before stopping.  It turned about 1/4 of a turn or 90 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights moved in unison, maintaining their positions relative to each other, as if they were all attached to one solid object, hidden in the black sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Viewed rotation lasted 2 or 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be a &#39;V&#39; or a triangle shaped craft that was pointed directly towards me, and then turned towards the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sat still for 3 to 4 seconds and then accelerated toward the west (into Lexington MA).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s speed was moderate. The rate of acceleration wasn&#39;t fast, and it appeared to be about 25 mph, when it went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it got much faster, because it was gone when I got close to the window seconds later. (Or, it&#39;s lights went out).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got the impression that I was looking at the belly and edge of a flying wing or triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a wing span that was a bit larger than the wings of a Gulfstream G350.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it went out of my field of view so quickly, I believe it was within about 300 feet of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had it been farther away, I would have seen more if its slow westward fight, due to the wider angle of view at that distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This area is a busy air space for the local airport, (Hanscom AFB) many aircraft make their base leg turn to final approach right here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, the first second I saw this group of bight lights out over the pond, I assumed that a jet was about to crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, there was no noise at all.  I did hear the sound of a distant truck engine a few seconds after the object had gone.<n>

Seeing very &gt; few clouds and lots of stars. From the southern horizon I noticed &gt; three lights that were the size and brightness of Venus traveling &gt; north in a triangle formation. They started joining to form one light &gt; then back to triangle (this happened several times), then just one of &gt; three made several in/out/up/back movements. It disappeared over the &gt; north horizon. I put my hand up and moved it across the sky in the &gt; same line the lights had traveled, counting up to 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no engine noises, no sonic boom, and they traveled the &gt; south to north horizon in just 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning I looked on www.historychannel.com for the UFO Show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Under sightings I found another sighting similar to mine in the USA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was an amazing thing to see, even at only 3 seconds.<n>

Its motion was steady and traveled in a northwestern to southeastern path, moving in the direction of Summers County from Shady Spring.   It offered no noise, no change in trajectory, and constant speed of travel.  The glow was a bright, burning orange; yet it provided no illumination to the ground or any surrounding trees or landscape.<n>

I thought it was a downed plane.  There was one other guy that saw it and walked over to me to ask me if I saw it.  I picked up my wife and we tried to drive to the spot where it looked like it fell without success.  I didn&#39;t think it was anything supernatural or unexplainable.  I just wanted to find out what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were staying at the Best Western Executive Inn.  Our room was opposite side of the space needle. We were on the 3rd floor looking towards the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 5pm that evening my husband was taking a nap, myself and my 2 children were looking out the window, watching all the aircrafts descending for landing.  We were also watching the local king 5 news helicopter taking off and landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the helicopter take off and go up and down the free way, and then land.  I guess it must have been around 5:45pm - 6pm when I was looking out the window and spotted a strange white/silvery ball to the upper right of the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like it was spinning and then a smaller black circle would appear and disappear, in the middle and to the bottom.  It was strangely odd.  I called my husband over; he saw it...we all saw it.  Just then a passenger aircraft passed right under it, a total near miss.  Judging by the size of the passenger jet, it was about the size of a car.  We watched it for about 5 minutes as it moved from the right of the window, to the left, diagonally going upwards, and into the clouds, then out of the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did try to take a picture with my iphone, but it couldn’t pick it up.  I’m certain we have see a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just wondering if anyone had reported this.<n>

We heard a thunderous noise and went outside to see 3 black triangle shaped aircraft.  Following these were 3 more. All made very loud noise.  These had to be military in origin.  It was facinating as each of the 3 were in triangle formation one out front followed by 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in the forest and this was very unusual.  So no UFO to report. Perhaps you might know what these craft were?  They were headed from NE to SW, and there is the Lemore Naval Station 60 miles to the SW.  We&#39;re about 4,500&#39;.  So these were perhaps 6-7k feet.  Real close.<n>

Appears to be star like but have seen one fly over, about a thousand feet up.  This has been going on since the year 2005.  When I first started using my telescope. I started seeing things in the sky all the time.  So I flashed them with a flashlight and they have flashed back and seem to know when I&#39;m looking.  I hear them all the time, day and night.  I started using a laser light and they move very fast, when I find them.  The first time I used the laser, one was going away from my direction. I hit it with the laser and it turned so quick and started enlarging back in my direction. So I flashed my flash light, my two blinks, real quick and it started going away.  That one that flew over me in the early morning sunrise.  Really looked me over, then flew straight toward Orion, which was very visible.  I really had so much fear in me when I started but, now I&#39;m so used to them. I saw one in the fifties when I was about 9 or 10, a jet was chasing it and my stepfather, a USAF Sargent was standing next to me.  I&#39;m in Awe!  They cloak and their speed and turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well had to talk to someone about it because, wife and child don&#39;t believe me. Descriptions of all that I have seen, range from small orbs flying through the back yard, one triangular, one huge saucer to star like and sometimes a hazy movement going very fast.  I know difference between satellites too! I&#39;m a night person.  I love sitting on my stool with my large binoculars on tripod looking up to a very starry night, well for the Bay Area. I have seen so much at night.  I just don&#39;t have the space to write it all down. I want so much to ask my neighbors if they know whats going on above their houses but, they probably already think I&#39;m crazy with all the flashing[lights]at night around my house from me.  I just can&#39;t believe that no one saw the Orion ship [it, as I said flew just up over our houses].<n> <n><n> <n><n> Believing Retired Sky watcher of the 5Th kind<n>

I often look at the stars, planes, etc.   This caught my eye right away.  It was a solid amber light to the south, far brighter than any aircraft light.  When I first noticed it, it was very bright and oval shaped, very far away and about halfway up into the sky.  It was moving at what appeared to be a slow rate straight across the sky towards the west from my location.  Although the rate seemed slow, it only lasted about 2 minutes from when I first saw it, and slowly faded away, giving the appearance it may have been moving very quickly due to its apparent distance away.  There were no sounds, no flashing lights, just solid amber.  I was in the Coast Guard and also fish in the ocean frequently at night.  I have NEVER even thought I saw anything resembling a UFO, but I can say without a doubt I have NEVER seen anything like this.   My gut reaction was to go get my wife to come loo! k at it, since I knew she would think I was crazy, but I was afraid if I did, I would miss something, or it would be gone.  Awesome experience!<n>

She did not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped up and ran to the front porch to see what it was.  I stepped out on our front yard and it was now over my neighbor’s house.  I watched 3 white lights flying together in triangle moving together with no sound.  The 3 white lights had a little flutter but were not blinking.   I continued to watch the 3 white lights moving east for about 10 seconds.  I ran back in the house to see if I could find a camera or cell phone to record it and I shouted to my roommate to come see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I got back to the front yard 15 seconds later the 3 white lights were fading in the distance.   My roommate did not see it and only witnessed my reaction to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back inside and described it to my roommate and even made a diagram on a note pad.  I could not believe what I just saw.  I just kept talking about it and grabbed my laptop to find out how do I report what I just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found this website called the phone number to report what I had just witnessed and finished the call about 10:19pmET.

It was late dusk, 7:40 PM, and the sky was not completely dark.  We knew it was not the moon; it had been extremely huge and bright the night before.  This was not nearly as large as the moon, and much brighter and larger than a star, although it was the bright goldish white color of a star.  We realized that it could be neither of those, and that it actually wasn&#39;t very high in the sky.  We both kept repeating that it wasn&#39;t a plane, and what was it? The light suddenly dimmed. We were getting closer to it.  I was driving and the light was getting close to the top of my view from the windsheild.  It had been heading to the top right corner of my windshield when it turned and passed directly over us.  We were leaning forward (I was barely driving at this point) and it flew slowly above us.  At that point we could see very clearly t hat it was a craft but was not a plane. It was triangular and had no wings and no sharp edges.  I&#39;d say it was a triangular disc.  The circular lights went around the parameter of the object and they pulsated from bright to dimmer.  Three of the lights were a lot brighter than the others.  I think there were seven lights in all, the three brighter ones were a bit more of a yellow white than the lighter, whiter ones.  It did not stop; it continued to our left at a moderate rate of speed, lights still blinking as it slowly disappeared.  Fortunatly for us, when we got home and told my husband and sons, they believed us.  I&#39;m not saying this machine was from another planet, but it definatly is not like anything I have ever heard described anywhere other than by others who have seen what they call U.F.O.&#39;s.  And, if it is some highly advanced aircraft secretly developed by our military, why are they flying over a rural area of Pennsylvania so slowly?<n>

3/19/11 23:45|Winnipeg (Canada)|MB|Other|3 - 4 Hours|Double sighting on night of "Super Moon"|4/3/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80589.html|115|ndxe201103| Double sighting on night of &#34;Super Moon&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my report concerning the night of March 19th, 2011 in River Heights, Winnipeg, Mb, Canada.  I will separate facts, things I know for sure, definitely saw and could find no other explanation for.  The rest will be put in a category for speculation, what I may have seen, what might have meant something, things with potential other explanations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Summary of Events Sitting in a friends place at around 23:45 that night, my 2 friends and I decided to go out to the hot tub in his backyard. We got to talking about the sky and how unusually red it was; I attempted to explain that it might have something to do with low cloud cover that night and the reflection of the city’s street lights. The conversation continued, we get to talking about UFOs and my friend recounts his encounter with one. I firmly believe him to be telling the truth though his is another story.  My other friend says that she doesn’t believe in that kind of stuff; we just start to discuss it a little more, trying to convince her that they are indeed quite likely real. All of a sudden, two impossibly bright blue-green flashes one after the other accompanied by a small buzzing sound from the south east interrupts our conversation. All of us very surprised at the odd timing of such a flash begin talking about it; at this point we start to hear sirens. The odd thing about these! sirens is that they don’t seem to be moving, nor do they sound like any emergency vehicle that I’ve ever heard. We hear no thunder and yet the flash was quite close, I’d say at most 5 kilometers away. Logically, had it been lightning, we should have heard thunder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though the night is cold, we get out of the hot tub and run to the street; we have to know what it was that we saw. At the end of the street, it becomes clear that we aren’t dressed properly enough to continue searching. We run back to my friend’s house quickly, where we change and dry off in a rush. My friend who owns the house decides to stay behind. Me and my other friend then quickly get our shoes on and run back to the end of the street. We see nothing and decide to walk in the direction of the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we get closer to the end of the block nearby we start to hear that same buzzing noise that accompanied the flash of light. Our eyes leap to the skies in case we happen to see something. At first there is nothing, and then suddenly we see a shape in the sky moving quickly, from the direction of the flash and with only that same buzzing sound. At first it appears to be saucer-like in shape but as it gets closer, it begins to look more like a helicopter with some fairly notable differences. No rotating chopper, nor is there any sound that would suggest it was a helicopter. The sky still a bright red color created contrast against the dark vehicle above us and allowed us to see its shape quite clearly. On one side there was a red light and on the other was a green one. At the tail end of the UFO, there was another kind of light between a long narrow cross section at the back, this one clearly different from the others; it had a luminescent glow to it and seemed to be white at! times and at others it would appear to be every color I could imagine.  It flew right over top of us with speed I’ve never seen by anything in the air before. It flew low, at most about a kilometer above us. We noticed that though it moved at least faster than the speed of sound yet there was no sonic boom to follow it, similar to the flash of light which also should have been accompanied by a loud noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we struggle to wrap our heads around what we’ve just seen. Once again we hear these similar sirens, no audible movement nor, do they sound normal. We decide to continue in the direction the UFO came from and walk up to a nearby field behind a community center. Once we arrived, the sky seemed to have lost its characteristic red glow. We noticed that where there happened to be a baseball diamond in this field, the ground was completely covered in fairly smooth, unnatural ice, with a pitcher’s mound that seemed to be made of snow. The ice was quite wet, as if it had been melted recently; another odd thing about it is that there were 2 ice rinks nearby, so why the extra ice? My friend, a hockey player, tells me that the ice would do no good for skates and would quite possibly ruin them. This raises further questions; why would the snow have fallen only on some of the field or if it did fall, where was the snow that had to be moved for such a thing to be? Why was it ther! e if there seemed no obvious use to it? At this point, we look at the sky and notice the red glow seeping back in to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We start to hear an odd ringing sound nearby and begin walking over to it as it seems to draw us closer. We get closer to the sound and can almost identify it when we see a car out at approximately 1:00 AM. Someone goes to the door of one house and stands there for a bit; no one answers the door, nor does he go inside. We start discussing this strange car when it starts to get closer to us. I suggest we simply go back as we’d likely seen all there was to be seen and the car was starting to freak me out a little bit. The ringing sound again, we see the man at another door down the street. Once again, no one answers, nor does he go in. We start heading back and he immediately gets back in his car, he seems to follow us, going a walking pace alongside us. Finally when it seems like he’s about to stop and do or say something, he drives away, turning right on the major street in front of us. Though this was majorly relieving, as it drove by in plain sight, I could almost swear th! at the car was completely empty. We sigh our relief and continue walking and then, we see the car again; he must have turned around in a hurry. He goes just beyond our view and seems to disappear, though we can still see the light projected on houses and street signs that seemed to come from a car stopped, just out of our vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decide to take another way back; hopefully we don’t see the car again that night. We follow the apparent labyrinth of back lanes that were our new route back, still hopeful that we see no cars. Every time either of us mentions that we should go back, we hear that sound again which we soon recognized to be wind chimes, though this wasn’t the windiest night. On our way walking back, neither of us could shake the feeling that there was definitely something behind us and though we looked back frequently and often in unison when that feeling seemed strongest. The sound of wind chimes accompanies us all the way back within a few houses from where we started.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started to hear a sound that seemed to come from above and to the east. This time it was different than the buzzing, it was more of a rumbling, as if this object were much bigger. We stand at the street corner and wait for the sound to approach and get clearer. We start to think that it might be a train, though it comes from a direction where the nearest train tracks are quite a ways and I rarely hear trains from that direction while in this neighborhood. The sounds starts to get louder and more rumbling, we start to feel as if it’s coming from above us, though the sky is completely covered in those ominous red clouds. It starts to pass when we actually do hear a train, though this time from the south. I cannot say if they were separate or one and the same but my gut says they were different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the sound is gone, we cross the street to go back; once more there were wind chimes, it seems as if they don’t want us to go back. I glanced to the west in instinct and though it was a passing glance, I thought I saw a man standing in the middle of the street. When we reach the other side, my friend looks down the sidewalk to see if there was indeed a man. What we saw seemed to be of humanoid shape though in the darkness it was hard to tell. A notable characteristic of this shape was that in darkness, one’s eye might be attracted to brighter objects and areas but with this shape, it seemed as if it were the darkest thing I had ever seen. Even though it was at least 8 blocks away, it stood out very noticeably.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lose interest in this shape which does not seem to move and finally finish our journey back. We get back at approximately 2:30 AM and at this point, the sky is no longer red. After arriving we decide that neither of us wants to be inside, in case we miss something else. We head in, get changed back into our bathing suits and sit in the hot tub for the next hour and a half or so. At first there is nothing we see in our watching of the skies but after about 20 minutes in the hot tub, the wind picks up, the sky reddens once more and we start to see something, once again, flying low on the horizon, in the North West direction the UFO had first flown. It had a similar appearance, those same tell-tale red and green lights, the saucer like shape when perceived from a distance. It began to sweep across the horizon from west to east and then would turn around at some indeterminate point and travel from east to west. It continued this patter for close to an hour, getting lower with! each new sweep. When it was low enough that neither of us could see it anymore, we continued sitting in the hot tub, hoping that something else might happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at that point that we had our 3rd (at least) sighting of the night. This time the UFO we saw was travelling from the west, not from the airport, though at first it looked like a plane flying low, it soon became clear that this was no plane. It was an odd shape that’s difficult to describe. It looked as if its front was its broadest point and that was where the wings started, they slowly got narrower as it got to the rear of the UFO where they attached at the back forming an almost acorn-like shape. At the tip of one wing was a green light, at the other was red one, and in the middle was a cluster of about 6 much brighter red lights. These formed a line of lights at the broadest and front-most point of the plane and right in the back was that same, whitish, rainbow colored light we had observed on the other UFO. Like the first, it passed directly over us heading east south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observe the first UFO, the one doing the sweep to our north is visible again shortly after, continuing its sweep, though this time getting more elevation with each passing sweep for another 5 or so minutes. Finally, it seems to disappear and the sky seems to blacken once more becoming what it is characteristically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a few things about this night that stood out for me even before seeing any UFOs in the sky above us. First of all, the initial flash of light happened under a minute after my friend said she didn’t believe in UFOs. Second, this was the first time in 19 years, a little longer than my whole life, that the moon was this close to the earth at the time of the full moon. It was on this specific night, where the moon was 15% bigger and 30% brighter, that we happened to have all these sightings and strange occurrences. One might say that it’s simply a coincidence but in my gut, it seems far from coincidental.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FACT The flash of light was an uncharacteristic color for lightning, blue-green, not blue-purple, though it lit up the sky. The lack of thunder also discredits this information. The UFOs, to my mind, defied logic and physics in the way the moved, the speed of it, the silence of it and the maneuverability of it were beyond anything I’ve ever seen in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Speculation As much as the sky, the car, the chimes and the shadow man seemed related, all are possible coincidences, things seen wrong or unnecessarily matched with the other factual occurrences.<n>

I was walking with our cat in the driveway and looking up at the sky again around 11: 45.  As I turned to go back to the patio at the rear of our home I spotted what I thought was a large star/planet  I was looking to the east and watched it pulse quickly as it moved to the North/Northeast,  I could here no sound from this object but did hear a jet engine from another passing commercial jet traveling from east to west at a higher altitude just south of where I first spotted this object.  The light of the object was a bluish-white color much like twinkling starlight.   The light was bright like aircraft landing lights, but pulsed slowly as the object maintained a fairly straight path as it traversed the eastern sky.  There were NO green or red flashers and only the one slowly pulsating light.  When the light dimmed, I could faintly see a structure that was apparently circular (but this is very possibly due to the limit ! of illumination of the radial light source…the structure could have been cylindrical also…hard to say for sure…but definitely a structure was visible.)  This was not a meteor/fireball/plasma lightening/ natural light source/object.  There was no visible exhaust or condensation trail.  The moon was VERY bright and nearly full, so only the very brightest stars/planets could be seen.  The object was a bit larger than the usual size of Venus when viewed at about 40-45 degrees above the horizon at my lat/lon for this time of year.  It’s magnitude was about that of Venus, perhaps a little brighter.  This is the 4th sighting I have had in my lifetime.  I am interested to see if anyone else saw this object in the Houston/Tomball/Hockley, Texas area.  It appeared to be traveling about as fast as the ISS when it passes over us here, but seemed much closer.  My 15-20 second view covered about 2/3 of the visible eastern sky.  I am not certain of its size or altitude. I will be watching more clos! ely for the next few nights.  Peter, perhaps you can shed some ! light on this one for me ;)<n>

We watched it for a few minutes while it moved in the sky, up, down, and side to side.  There were no flashing lights, no sound and it was pretty bright, about the size of a street light from a block away.  After a few minutes, it started to move away from us and within 30 seconds or so at the most it was gone.  It moved away toward the northwest and went up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He saw all seven lights with me and then we both saw them proceed to turn off, one-by-one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He told me to grab the camera just inside the door, I was so mesmerized with the lights I didn&#39;t want to look away, they were very large, all of the same size and of a yellow/white light, no form was visible besides the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were at random in the sky, no special order or formation but pretty close to one another.  They were about 60 degrees above the horizon, totally still, not hovering, not making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They then proceeded to turn off, one at a time but with perfect synchrony.  I grabbed the camera as the next to last light turned off and started to film but the last light turned off.

When the second glow came, I was really surprised.  I immediately told my girlfriend in the adjacent room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked outside thinking that maybe a transformer blew.  There was no noise outside of the whipping wind and rain.  I waited for the familiar “pop” of a transformer while looking at the sky.  Puzzled, I thought that it could have been an airplane or something else that, if the green glow was a catastrophic event, I should be able to see something.. Anything..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to my PC and did a web search for the glow…  strange things.  I read up on this Thundersnow but the web sources pretty much said that the colors were blue and a sound followed.  This did not seem to fit..<n>

I was so happy to get information of where I could report an incident that occurred to my family a year ago to day, March 19, 2011.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family consist of my wife my self and our 7 year old son.  The date of the incident is easy to recall as it was our anniversary.  We had just returned home from my wife’s brother’s home who lives in Flint Michigan.  We live in Elkhart Indiana.  It was 9:30 p.m. and my wife and son were in the back yard walking our dogs as we had been gone the entire day visiting her brother.  They called out to me to come quickly there was something in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I approached them they were pointing to the east towards a little town called Bristol.  In the sky there was a sphere shaped object about 50 yards long and 30 feet wide completely engulfed in flames at a height I would estimate to be one half mile.  It was traveling very slowly and gaining altitude as it traveled.  We were then surprised of the appearance of a second object with the same exact description as the first.  As we watched the two crafts five more eventually appeared and all were spaced the same distance apart, about a half mile.  They were all traveling west and slowly climbed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all occurred over a time period of about 20 minutes<n>

All 7 did this same thing in a parade like manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/19/11 20:52|Griswold|CT|Light|5 minutes|Two glowing orange lights traveling west over Griswold, CT.|4/3/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80584.html|123|ndxe201103| Two glowing orange lights traveling west over Griswold, CT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my drive home from work I saw a bright orange light moving extremely slowly across the sky.  It was lower than the planes that were in the air at the time, and not blinking.  It looked initially like a new street lamp had been installed (same shape and orange color), but very bright and too high up over the trees to be a street light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned the corner onto my road, I lost sight of the light. It was traveling west at a steady slow pace.  I saw a second orange light about 1/2 mile up the road, traveling parallel to the first light in the same direction.  These lights were very bright and non-blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled into my driveway and parked quickly, getting out to watch it move over the yard into the woods.  My husband came out to see it and concluded it was a helicopter, then went back inside.  I continued to watch and heard my neighbors remarking about the orange light in the next yard.  They also didn&#39;t know what it was.  The light glimmered, like it was sputtering out, then disappeared over the edge of the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were planes in the sky at the same time, and these were all much higher altitude than these lights were.  The planes all had white and red lights and were blinking.  I could hear the sound of the planes passing, but did not hear anything I would have attributed to these flying objects. If I had to guess altitude, I would have said about 300 feet to 1 mile up at most.  It was hard to gauge how big they were since it was just an oval glowing light.  The planes seemed much much higher in the air.<n>

I have been making calls and doing research online and have not been able to find out any information. We are all just regular folks with no prior UFO sightings. I certainly hope someone can explain to me what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a group of blue lights in the sky. They looked like blue balls and we have estimated there were one hundred or more of them.  They were traveling in a group similar to a school of fish. They weren’t changing directions like fish.  They were just scattered within a group like fish. They made no noise and appeared to be around the altitude you would see a plane.  They were slowly and steadily traveling East to West and were not ascending or descending.  The only movement was horizontal. The lights were steady and did not flicker or flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this spectacle for several minutes.  When the group of lights had almost passed out of sight, we noticed 2 more balls of blue light traveling in the same direction.  These 2 blue balls of light were traveling faster as if to catch up with the first group.  They quickly traveled out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one had a camera with them, only cell phones.  Unfortunately, the pictures taken with cell phones did not turn out good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a side note, we had a Super Moon that night. However, it was so cloudy you couldn’t even see the Moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have heard that at least 11 other people in the area saw the same lights.<n>

At first,what he told me to look at, I took to be a star which was about the size of a head on a ten penny nail.  He next told me to look at it through binoculars.  I did this and this &#34;star&#34; was blinking red &amp; blue or green (don&#39;t recall if it was blue or green) which stars do not do that I am aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next he said to look a little below that &amp; I saw what I thought was just a small airplane.  It was blinking red &amp; blue/green.  I watched it circle &amp; land, I guess, as it went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before it landed, I saw an area light up bright for a few seconds. This landing I estimate to be about 2 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this object came in to land I saw a motor vehicle going into the &#34;landing area, &amp; soon coming back.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> This same occurrence happened 3 times before my friend took me home.  He said it goes on every night all night. THERE ARE NO AIRPORTS IN THIS AREA.   This is why whatever is happening is ODD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From Silva Rd., Belen, NM, I was looking East &amp; slightly North. There are no airports there.  There are 2 airports way south of Silva Rd. named Skywagon, &amp; Burris Ranch. The last 2 nights have been somewhat overcast/cloudy, but I want to go back on a clear night &amp; see what happens, if anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I did see is not normal, this I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My address is: ((personal information deleted))<n>
3/19/11 20:00|North Bend|WA|Other|10-15 minutes|12 Orange glowing kite-shaped fast moving objects flying one after another; north bend, wa; very low|4/3/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80653.html|126|ndxe201103| 12 Orange glowing kite-shaped fast moving objects flying one after another; north bend, wa; very low<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last Saturday night, March 19th, about 8 PM, I went outside to see if the full moon was up over the mountain yet. I saw a bright orange object moving fast towards me from the southeast. It looked low on the horizon but when it got over me, it looked like a big type of kite or parachute, with an arched rectangular- shaped top and a bright orange bright light underneath it. I was able to look right up at the shape as it passed over my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object kept moving toward the north, seeming to get higher and then disappeared upwards into the sky. I turned my head and saw another one moving towards me. This one also moved to the north, but headed more west, disappearing upwards into the sky. I turned my head, and another one was coming, appearing so low that I wondered if it was going to land somewhere.  I was thinking that a bunch of extreme junkies maybe planned a jump off Mt Si with lights on their kites but they must have been motorized because they were moving fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The big kite-shaped objects  would then hesitate a little directly above me and then gain altitude as they moved away. More and more kept coming from the same direction, from the south east side of the mountain. A couple stayed above me for a half-minute or so and then went straight up, disappearing into the sky. At one point, I watched one begin to move away, towards the west, and a small plane’s lights were right next to it and I wondered if the pilot was going to hit it. The small plane had been much higher in the sky than these objects, but the object quickly gained altitude next to the plane before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now, I figured out that these were not kites and called my sister, telling her that I was watching some very strange things in the sky above me.  Several more came my way, one even appeared to turn and go backwards before it went straight up. A couple others hovered longer over me and then went straight up. I just remember watching them one by one and then turning my head to see another one coming and could see others behind it, like they were all behind each other, following each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size was hard to tell. When they first were heading my way, they looked about the size of big kites or parachutes but the bright orange glow under them distorted the size. They actually looked bigger when they got right over me. Then, it looked like the size of a small plane maybe. They were totally silent and moved very fast as they approached and left, appearing to slow down sometimes before they hovered. I think I counted 12 before they stopped coming. The whole experience lasted between 10 and 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have a Masters degree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not something that I would ever have anticipated doing as it would not occur to me that there was even a site to report &#34;UFO&#34;s.  In other words, I&#39;ve not been one to seek out flying objects in the sky except for meteor showers.  My religion does not account for aliens or UFOs and frankly, I would be laughed out of my town if they were to find out that I am reporting a sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was returning home from my small town bordering south Georgia when traveling north towards the Georgia line, I happend to look up into the beautiful cloudless blue sky and there on the north northwestern sky, I saw what I initially thought to be a wispy cloud which immediately vaporized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking this odd, but cool, I was amazed when it reappeared in the same location but this time it looked, upon closer inspection to be a huge flock of white birds.  I soon realized that it couldn&#39;t possibly be birds as the bird-like objects were giving off a metallic shine, appeared stuck into a shape, were not moving independently and the thing suddenly disappeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over on the side of the road and parked my car so as not to wreck.  The object reappeared again and this time I was able to see that connecting the hundreds of bird-like shapes, was an almost invisible tear-drop or triangular shaped substance which appeared to be moving and reflecting the sun.  It reminded me of items placed in clear jello or glued to celophane.  Understand that this was not a flock of birds in the traditional V shaped formation.  This was a flock of hundreds of bird or boomorang shaped objects forming a white tear-drop, which suddenly appeared in a clear sky, disappeared then reappeared and disappeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been a nature and sky watcher, but in 50 years have never seen anything that I couldn&#39;t explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

THEY GOT IT ALL ON TAPE ALONG WITH SOME OTHER WITNESS WITH CELL PHONE VIDEO FROM OTHER WITNESS THEY COULD SEE ON THE TAPE.  A TRUCK DRIVER WAS PASSING BY AND FLASHED A PHOTO AND THE THING DISAPAREAD INTO THE HEVAN EXTREMELY FAST. THEY DID NOT REPORT THE INCIDENT.  BY THE TIME THEY RETURNED TO THE STATION IN DALLAS, FEMA REPRESENTAIVES WHERE THERE WITH HIGH MILITATY BRASS WHO CONFISCATED THE CAMERA AND CELL PHONES, AND ASK THEM QUESTIONS.  TOLD THEM NOT SAY ANYTHING.  THE OTHER WITNESS ON THE TAPE WERE CONTACTED IMMEDIATELY BY MILITARY OR CIA UNKNOWN PEOPLE AND SHOWED UP AT THERE HOME AND THEIR CELL PHONE WERE CONFISCATED IMMEDIATLY.  VERY STRANGE HOW THE MILITARY AND FEMA NEW THIS AND WAS ALREADY AT THE STATION AND KNEW THE ADDRESS OF OTHER WITNESS HOMES.  ALL NEWS TRUCKS TO HAVE TO REPORT TO THE STATION WITH GPS ON THERE TRUCKS.  ALL EVIDENCE WAS CONFISCATED AND THE VIDEO.  MY FRIEND IS GOING TO FILE THIS REPORT ALSO WHO WAS THERE.

3/18/11 23:47|Cabo San Lucas (Mexico)||Unknown|7 days|Regular appearing and disappearing blinking lights over Cabo San Lucas, Mexico|3/23/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80521.html|130|ndxe201103| Regular appearing and disappearing blinking lights over Cabo San Lucas, Mexico<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the past 7 nights I have stayed in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico for spring break I have witnessed multiple UFOs.  I got here on the 14th of March and have stayed until the 18th.  Every single night I have witnessed blinking lights outside of my condo, La Finestera.   Every night more UFOs appear and some disappear.  The first night my boyfriend and I witnessed a UFO over the Pacific ocean, which according to the locals has been there for a long time.  This UFO has remained in the same geographic location since I have been in Cabo San Lucas.  The first UFO I noticed was stationary for a while, then we noticed the UFO making circles, sharp 90 degree turns and many other erradic patterns.  This UFO attracted my attention and the attention of other people staying in these condominiums.  It was blinking many colors including purple, red, green, blue, and orange as if it were communicating with the other UFOs in the area.  Initially we only noticed the one over th! e ocean, but over the other nights we have stayed here we have witnessed as many as 7 at a time.  It is still unknown to us if these are satelites, but after the research I have done I have concluded that satelites do not blink colors and are slow moving, which means they do not stay in the same place every night.  These UFOs appear and disappear in the same geographic location every night.  I do not have the utilities necessary such as binoculars or telescopes while on vacation to view these blinking lights.  At first they appear to be the brightest stars in the sky, but after further evaluation you can tell that these are not stars and they are not man made.  There have been clear skies during every viewing of these UFOs.  The shapes cannot be determined by looking at the lights since they are viewed in the night sky, but they are so bright that they are easily seen.  Any information about satelites in this area are of high interest.  If you happen to travel to Cabo San L! ucas, Mexico, more information is greatly needed on these unid! entified objects.<n>

They were in a pattern like a triangle so it was either 3 UFOs or one in a triangle shape.  They were moving very, very slowly through the trees but high above from West to North East.  There was no sound and no flashing lights.  A plane was coming from the North East to the west and the UFOs or UFO was above the airplane.  I had my camera and took a picture and the minute I did and looked, all three of the lights had disappeared.  When I took the picture it was against a dark side of the sky and many pine trees so after enlarging it, I did not see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This ends my report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

It was a silent and calm night, but the green circle, didnt make one sound.  It would of been approximatley 70 meters away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, another orange cirlce came down the river, but it only put it&#39;s light on every minute or so, and everytime it put its light on, it would be further down the river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasent a jet ski, a boat or any water craft because it was dead silent, and it was going way too fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1 of the friends&#39; i was with also said he was with his friend ( who is a pilot), just the night before, and he was on top of the hill, when a circular green/orange thing, was just hovering over the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend has a short video on his phone, but it dosent turn up because its too dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wondering if there is any chance of knowing what it was.<n>

Not uncommon in AZ but the thing that seemed odd was how long it was going.  The big fire ball with a large flame following it looked to have come from a very high place in space. After we watched it fall for about 45 seconds it then just STOPPED. It sat there and did nothing but glow.  Then it went to the right and started to fall again with the fire like tail behind it.  After it fell some more it then stopped again! This time it just stayed there for what seemed to be a minute or so.  Then just like before it started to fall with the fire tail behind it.  It eventually went down too low by the mountains of what I think is Buckeye or Goodyear City and we lost it.  Called around to the news stations and Luke Air Force Base and no one saw or heard anything about it.  Wife was a little freaked out but I thought it was cool! We are trying to find out what it was.<n>

They started moving further south, then one disappeared, a couple seconds after the other two disappeared, as soon as that happened the fourth one appeared same color but cigar shaped, it seemed to be coming down while doing so it was moving left to right like a grandfather clock.  As I got closer the fourth object disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we drove closer we saw other witnesses that were stopped on the side of the road, we also stopped, and a man stopped to talk to us and confirmed the sighting that we had just seen, he talked to us about what he saw, and he said that when he first saw it he witnessed 7 fireballs coming down at rapid speed from the sky, and they suddenly stopped and merged together into one then he stated that they disbursed and formed a single line hovering in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He also advised us that he has been studying planes for the past 17 years and that his father was in the air force and he had never seen anything like that.

I turned onto Frier DR and 67th Ave in Glendale, AZ at 7:35 P.M when I noticed a light falling from the sky.  I stopped and got out of the car.  It looked like a single Firework falling from the sky instead of going up in the sky.  It was falling from the sky at a fast pace.  It then split into 2 falling “Fireworks” and continued to fall from the sky at a fast pace.  From the speed it was falling from the sky, I figured it was a meteorite.  All of a sudden both falling lights ran into each other and formed 1 falling “Firework”.  It then stopped and formed 5-6 steady lights that just stopped and stayed in one place.  The lights were not in a straight line.  I then started driving towards the objects in the sky.  It felt like I was getting closer to the objects and I thought I was about to see one of the lights up close but some trees got in the way.  By the time I got by the trees it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea how far away I was from the initial sighting and how high in the sky it was.  From what I saw it lasted about 4 minutes.  There is an Air force base around the area of where the lights where coming from.  From where I was at, at the time of the sighting, I&#39;d say I was about 10 miles from the Air force base.  The steady lights that I saw were big.  It was not an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so curious and so quick to pick up the phone that I don’t remember if I saw 5-6 or 7 lights.  Like I said I thought it was a meteorite at first and didn’t think I needed to video tape it.  And I thought that my mind was playing tricks on me after seeing that horrible movie Battle Los Angles.  But I know what I saw and it was defiantly strange looking.  The speed that these lights were falling at and then to just stop and turn into steady glowing lights and sit in the sky was amazing.<n>

About 60 yards from the house we left, 4 of us in total, noticed a formation of lights and at first just figured it was a passing plane.  However we then noticed it was flying beneath the storm and at a very slow speeds, as if it was gliding, and the closer we walked we also noticed no sound.  Talking to each other, we joked about how the object is an alien and a friend then blurted out. &#34;Don&#39;t juuuuuuuuuuudge me&#34;.  As if on que, the object actually stopped which caused the 4 of us to stop and watch, the object then shot out then beam of light that moved at least 90&#39;, you could see the light actually reflecting off the clouds, the beam shot upwards then went off.  Right after the object then shot itself upwards! at unknown speeds, fast enough to have myself and the 3 others basically shit out pants.  From what it seemed, the object was hiding between the clouds for as we stood there trying to recollect what just occurred, a passenger plane then flew by above the storm, this time its engines clearly audible for a group of people enjoying a walk in the sleeping suburbs of Fredericksburg.<n>

I really never realized that it was there during the time I was taking a series of bracketed photos, but what turned out in my digital images appears to be moving in each shot.  The long thin-lit object about 30-40 feet wide, appears to have two lights set in the middle, as it was flying over the bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking these photos while staying at this condo for a convention in Seattle.  I took a series of photographs off the balcony on March 18, 20011, Friday morning at about 5:20 a.m.- 5:21 a.m. before the sunrise, showing the full moon over the bay near Smith Tower.  I focused on the buildings to make sure my photos would turn out and did not pay any attention to an object moving!  Actually, this thing is like a ‘flaw’ to me in my photos and is an inconvenience to me.  I’d like to know if this is a plane (but I heard nothing).  Here is another part of this that is really strange?  One of my last frames showing the UFO at the end of this minute there is another light to the far right of my frame on one photo, a really bright light that is round in the sky.   I am going to assume that is a plane?  Why?  I didn’t know that planes are able to fly over the port area of Seattle like that?   I’ve no scratch or dust on my lens as I took a couple hundred photos in my camera with no patterned mark like this.  Also, this thing is moving in each shot.  Do you have any idea if this is an anomaly or an actual UFO?<n>

The lights I spotted were near Beverly, Washington just south of the Wanapum Dam a mile or so.  The time of the sighting was 12:40 am, on March 18,2011.  I watched the lights for 3 minutes or so and then the lights appeared to just fade out one at a time.  Did anyone else see this?<n>

Every night for the past couple nights I see a light in the same position in the sky.  It is very high in the sky seeing as how I can only make it out as a light.  It slowly rises directly up to a point and will stop.  The light will persist in the same location for varying lengths of time. I cannot ascertain how long precisely.  When I return to smoke another cigarette it can still be there or it can be gone.  There are no discernable stars in the vicinity and the light is completely gone. It doesnt flash and has a slight orange or red tint to it.  Planes will occasionally fly close to it but it seems they are just flying through.  Perhaps the light is higher in the sky than these planes although I cannot tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This part is stupid and probably just my overactive imagination but I had been watching the NCAA Tournament all night and when the commerical for the movie Paul came on, the TV blacked out several times during the commericial but at no other time at any point in the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Celestial bodies??

I then noticed about 5 aircrafts in a formation of an arrow, fly extremely fast through the sky. It then disappeared when it went behind the clouds.  I know it wasn&#39;t any kind of man made craft because it was travelling way too fast to be something a human could be controlling.  One thing I noticed is that the formation never got out of line.  It was a perfect arrow straight through the sighting.  The objects creating the formation were round white balls of light.<n>

While out a light came across the horizon.  It caught my attention since it was brighter than an airplane.  I actually glanced up at it then did a double take when I realized it wasn&#39;t a plane.  It wasn&#39;t high enough to have been planes in formation.  It was 4 round lights in a diamond pattern.  It was completely silent, no contrail.  It passed from North to South.  We have a NASCAR event here this week.  I considered it being a blimp coming to cover the race but they&#39;re normally very loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be slightly smaller in diameter than that of a pencil eraser when held at arm&#39;s length.  The object moved smoothly and in a fluid like motion through a &#34;J&#34; shape arc and then stopped momentarily continuing on with a quick start into a sort of &#34;S&#34; shaped arc before &#34;blinking&#34; out of visability.  It appeared to be flying at a fairly high altitude above the low lying scant cloud cover and its speed seemed to be about twice as fast as a conventional commercial aircraft.  It should be noted that not far from the location of observation is a rather sizable and active Army base, (Fort Sill.)  We routinely witness unique displays of military air transport (hundreds of black helicopters and fighter jets, as well as orange and yellow flares.)  This object did not appear to be a flare, or a military or civilain aircraft.<n>

Initially we thought that they might have been paratroopers parachuting, or a squadron of Black Hawk helicopters (from the nearby Ranger base) or perhaps birds.  They had no running lights, there was no sound whatsoever and they were too large from a distance to have been birds.  Although I described them to be in a loose formation, the first several were in formation, the others not so.  I have never seen anything like this.<n>

The first orange light began to dim and fade, and then a second orange bright light appeared about 20 feet in front of where the first orange light appeared.  It dimmed and then a third orange light appeared about another 20 feet in front of the second orange light, then a fourth appeared.  The first orange light reappeared, and then they all began getting brighter and dimming in different intervals.  The first orange light appeared to drop a flair or something the flowed down towards the earth.  The fourth light became very bright and then they all went out.  I was on the phone with my brother when I witnessed this occurring.  I was explaining to him what I was seeing, he said get the camera.  By then they were gone.<n>

The white light, somewhat elongated, grew larger and brighter and then became dimmer and smaller until it was a very small dull point of light in a short amount of time.  At the moment it reached that stage I saw a similar dull point of light to its left, about the distance apart as two fingers at arms length.  This point of light was also moving very slowly but towards me, not away from me as the other now dim dull light was doing, as I could judge this looking through the branches of the tree.  I quickly went inside to get my camera and was back outside in less than 30 seconds and I could not see anyth! ing left of the two objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have an 10&#34; telescope and have enjoyed studying the night sky for over 16 years.  I keep an open and critical mind about this phenomenon.  I have studied the worldwide phenomenon of Crop Circles for 5 years and have read much of Colin Andrews, Freddy Silva, Nancy Talbot and others and well as the photographs by Steve Alexander.  I mention this only to show my openness to what I think is a tangible form of communication by other intelligences than from this planet.  My conclusions come from the preponderance of data that point to a technology that is able to channel several forms of energy simultaneously to manipulate plants to create extraordinary geometric formations within a timespan of minutes and no more than a couple of hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These findings lead me to believe there are intelligences visiting us and gently trying to communicate to us through the use of symbols found in the Crop Circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have made no assumptions nor conclusions about what I saw. I am just relating what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lastly, just moments after returning with my camera and not seeing anything left of these dull moving points of lights, a jet airline with its blinking lights made its way towards my direction, following the established corridor for both civilian airlines as well as military jets, planes and helicoptors in this sector of the sky.<n>

Although, the craft, I had seen in the past, was loud, very loud, and this one, utterly silent, I believe, it was the same craft, or same type.  I watched it, until it moved beyond line of sight behind the trees and apartment building next door, in our complex.  About a half hour later I went to sleep..  At 5:10am, I was then, awakened by a very loud, low vibration.  I did not get up to see but, having seen this craft many occasions, I attributed this, less than 3 hours later, as belonging to the same craft, and went back to sleep.  I don&#39;t know if they are just interested in the area, ! which just west of my complex is very sparsely populated gor seversl miles, or me, or both but, I have had repeated visits, I hope will continue, and from the stepping up of their visit&#39;s, I believe this to be true.  The fact being that I slept after seeing the craft and was awakened by this sound, for all I know, there may have been an abduction, I really have no clue if I ever have been.  Also: reading this report just now,  I recall a helicopter followed shortly afterward.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A strange object emitting a kind of red light directly above and following Sirius (star).  We saw through our 325x telescope, the object(s) was showing a kind a blueshift, which is only seen , according to physics, when an object is coming towards us. Me and my  Brother immediately checked wikisky for any such image, but none like that was there. The Object was like two arrows pointing opposite to each other.  The object was immediately below Sirius. It looked strange and appeared to be hovering over the spot.  It remained there for around 1 and a half hours.It could be a meteroid but how could a meteoroid be of that shape and could not maintain the same distance from Sirius.  Also, sometimes, with the telescope, there seemed to be flashing lights over it.  The images could not be taken because the Mobile Camera was not working.<n>

The time is 2:00PM and it is a sunny, clear sky afternoon.  It also happens to be primary election day.  I returned from voting and as the temperature was mild I went out to the patio and sat in a recliner to enjoy a bit of sunshine.  The houses are two stories with chimneys extending approximately  ten feet above the roofline.  Between my house and the one next door is full bushy tree of about the same height as the roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was gazing up at the sky and speculating on election results when an object emerged from the behind the tree moving slowly but steadily from west to east.  It maintained consistent altitude, speed and was silent.  The appearance was that of a large tall aluminum can turned on its side.  The surface was dull silver with an area along lower rear in black.  No wings, other protrusions, markings or obvious means of propulsion was evident.  It certainly didn’t seem to be aerodynamically designed for flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was somewhat drowsy when it first appeared and I immediately assumed that it was a banner or hot air balloon relating to the elections, which is not an unusual site in Vegas.  I immediately dismissed this assessment, as the altitude was so low that a plane hauling it or the apparatus needed for it to be a hot air balloon would be visible and was conspicuously absent.  I then considered that it might be space debris, perhaps part of a satellite that was falling to earth, but it seemed to be moving too slowly and steadily at a maintained altitude for this to be the case.  The altitude was so low that the object was occluded from vision when it passed behind the chimney.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I am about to report now is going to make me sound crazy or hallucinatory.  I can only say that I have never been subject to hallucinations; and neither was I drinking alcohol or using any form of drugs, prescription or otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object began to pass behind the chimney, I got up and proceeded along the left side of the house to get a better view before it would pass behind another tree to my left.

My daughter went and retrieved me from my room and told me to look out our window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked east and up, saw a few blinking lights right above our town.  Nothing out of the ordinary...until the lights slowed down to a crawl and almost stopped without losing any altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately ran outside to get a better view.  I saw the same thing, but did not hear any engine noise. It was extremely clear out, no wind and there was not visible moisture in the air.  It appeared to be approximately 600 or 700 feet in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my brother and asked him to look out and see if he could see anything, after looking for a short while he described exactly what I saw.  The object slowed down and sped up at different intervals and sped up as it past our town.  It continued on a straight path for a while then changed direction towards the town north of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not identify any shape, it was too dark.  The outside lights were bright white and the blinking lights changed from red, white and bluish green.  I have a 20 second video of the blinking lights, can&#39;t identify anything other than there is lights blinking.<n>

I suppose some incredulity upon my part prevented me from doing so but as time has passed I can&#39;t seem to forget about it and upon looking up the NUFORC web site and seeing your request for reports of such sightings I have decided to make a report even though it is after the fact.  As quite a bit of time has elapsed I can&#39;t remember exactly when it occurred. I do know that it was 2011 the end of Winter, early Spring. I can also not recall the time, although am fairly certain that it was between 10:00 PM and 2:00 AM.  I had gone outside to make a trip to the nearby 7-11 and had noticed how remarkably crisp and clear the night was with the stars very visable. I decided upon returning to go and sit outside for awhile and stargaze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out a lawn chair and before I could even sit down noticed an object directly above me. It was a disk-like glowing amber light flying from directly overhead to my 11 o&#39;clock disappearing over the roof of my house to the north.  I then noticed another object just like the first to my 3 o&#39;clock flying south/ southeast which disappeared from sight behind the tree line.  Both objects emitted a steady muted amber glow and flew at a constant velocity similar to the speed of a commercial airliner. The height of the objects was indeterminate.  There were no flashing lights.  Each object was roughly 1/8 the size of the full moon.<n>

3/14/11 19:30|Lake Havasu City|AZ|Other|45 seconds|Orange Orbs on multiple nights and finally a large Mother ship also Orange.|3/23/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80495.html|166|ndxe201103| Orange Orbs on multiple nights and finally a large Mother ship also Orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Orange Orbs March 14 2011<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an avid sky watcher.  I want to make that point clear.  Since my first sighting in 1979 I have been quietly obsessed with our universe and the many cultures that abound throughout.  I want also to be clear that I rarely ever report what I see to anyone other than my friends and family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In August of 2010, I began to see Orange Orbs at fairly close range with the lot of my home either front or back yard being my vantage point.  The first one I saw was after sunset but prior to the dark of night.  While talking on the phone standing on my patio when, as if directed in some way, I turned my head and focused directly on the orange orb heading my direction and saw it clearly.  I told the person on the phone what I was witnessing, stating that this was a “good one”.  At best guess I would say the real size of the object was about 2 to 4 feet spherical.  The orange glow at least gave it the look of being spherical.  I figure it was at an altitude of 75 to 150 feet and maybe 200 yards downrange.  I always have binoculars on the table so I told my party I was reaching for them.  As I reached I knew that the orb was watching me.  I knew that it was reading my thoughts and when I grabbed the binoculars it, as best as I can describe, folded into thin air.  The total e! lapsed time was maybe 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next visit was just two evenings later.  This time I was in the front of my house.  While playing darts with my nephew, I received a phone call.  My dartboard is in the garage so I took my call to the driveway in the front of the house.  I am a pacer, especially when I talk on the phone: While pacing up and down my driveway, just like the last time, I was almost summoned to turn my head and look up.  I did and there it was again, the orange orb.  This time it was much closer to me.  It was visibly about three times the size of a basketball, slowly moving about twice the height of my one story rooftop, between my neighbor’s house and mine.  Again I told the party on the phone, “There is that orb again”.  “Wes check it out!”  (Wes is my nephew) I told him to hurry and grab those binoculars.  All the while I never took my eyes off of the orb.  It was communicating with me.  I could feel it.  And the moment Wes grabbed the binoculars and started toward me it, once again, fo! lded into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was two sightings in as many days and I could feel that the orb was aware of me and it knew that I was aware of it.  I might also mention that I have had a number of sightings; I have lunched with Bob Lazar at a pizza place in Vegas.  Been to black box road several times, and so on.  These were the first “Orbs” that I have witnessed.  Well three nights later I had another visit.  This time I was just pacing in the driveway waiting for my pup to handle her business when I, as if someone called my name turned and looked right at the hovering orb.  This time it was a good 200 feet in altitude and over the middle of my street.  I stared for about 10 seconds, pointed to it and said, “Please don’t disappear again.” And backed into the garage trying to keep my eyes fixed and at the same time reaching for my binoculars and at risk of sounding insane, I felt it smile and just like that it folded into the night sky again.  At this point I am sure that there is something big happ! ening.  I do not mean in general.  That is obvious.  I mean specifically with me.  I thought finally after all these years of trying to telepathically reach out, someone is picking up the cottin pickin phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nights   turned into weeks, they quickly turned into months.  Each night diligently going out to call to the orb while stargazing and nothing except for maybe one sighting about 1000 yards down the street and higher in altitude but I am only 70 percent sure that was the orb.  That is until tonight.  While playing darts again in my garage, I stepped to the driveway and pointed calling, “Dude, tell me you are seeing that.”  This was not the orb but a huge ship!  Much higher, I would say 1500 to 3000 feet in altitude, maybe 1.5 to 3 miles down range, and glowing like a mini sun but it was longer top to bottom then left to right, it split into 4 equal size large orbs that slightly angled toward the ground, then, immediately went back to one, back to two larger at an angle again back to 1 large round, then stretched upward and blipped out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have witnessed some very awesome stuff.  This ranks in the top three for me of all time.  My nephew could not believe that finally after hearing me talk about ufos and aliens for years he finally saw that.  It was a short sighting but a very fantastic one.  Of course I checked out all of the obvious possibilities knowing full well that what we had seen was genuine.  I have seen almost the identical thing on a post on some website, and I believe it was a film from Norway.  I could be wrong on that.  Needless to say it was significant enough to warrant this report.  I would like to hear of the many comparisons that are out there.  I know that we are and have been visited here since the beginning.  My being is fully aware of the endosymbiotic relationship that we all share with one another, with our Creator, and with the Planet, Galaxy and the Universe.  I spend countless hours as a crack researcher from UFOs to Mars anomalies, to alien races, underground bases, and the whol! e lot of it.  I throw out most hang on to some and dig into others.  I have always had a connection with space for some reason, as a child I was so afraid of ufos I would not sleep in my room alone until about the 8th grade and that was in 1979 I think.  I do not think I was ever abducted at least I do not think I was.  I may be privy to something I am not yet aware of but that is yet to be revealed.  I have the gift of sight and can see things in people that freak me out still.  Most of my closest friends know me as “The Profit.”  I simply can see through some sort of window when prompted to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I just felt compelled to put this one on the record.  I will continue to look for them every night and will report back if they continue.  If you are in the know keep digging, if you are skeptical, look up once in a while, you will eventually be shown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you are a government official, I feel sorry for you.  Just kidding, but if you are, help bring full disclosure.  We as a race deserve the truth.  Peace to all and may your spirit find its source and one day know it.<n>

My family and I were hiking in the Sitting Bull Falls National Recreation Area of the Lincoln National Forest in New Mexico, about 42 miles southwest of Carlsbad, New Mexico on 3/14/2011 in the afternoon.  We hiked the trail to the top of the 150 ft waterfall and my husband took a picture of me and my son resting on the rocks.  The photo shows objects in the sky that reflect light and have oval shapes when zoomed in on.  There were no planes in the sky at that time and the only birds flying around were swallows which were not flying that high and stayed in the valley near the bottom of the falls.  I am submitting the photo to you for analysis.  I don&#39;t know if the resolution is good enough for the photo to be of any use but I thought I would at least report that there might have been unknown objects in that particu! lar section of sky at that time.  The ufo&#39;s in the photo are located just above the clouds over the figure on the right side (me).  When zooming in the photo, I count about 6 objects in the sky that may or may not be ufo&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have examined the photo, and we are unable to identify the object.  However, it appears as a tiny, blurred object, so we are unable to certify that it is a genuine UFO.  It could be a bird, or an insect, we believe.  PD))<n>

First thought they were a flock of birds, because a small Piper Cub or Cessna, which was passing by at probably a few thousand feet under VFR, suddenly revved its engine, which caused me to look up, and then I noticed what appeared to be a flock of birds, directly in it&#39;s path, so I mention to my friend, that the Cessna  was probably trying to avoid that flock of birds, but my stated they weren&#39;t birds.  So subsequently, I took out my camera, and started to try to zoom in on the objects, but because the sky was bright, was unable to film the entire even, which lasted, approximately, 3 to 5 minutes.  But did manage to capture approximately 10 or 12 frames, with the lights, objects clearly visible.  The object, subsequently, slowing drifted approximately, 15 or 20 degrees, across my line of sight, then slowing gained elevation, until they were no longer visible.<n>

I popped the hatchback to sit and put on my golf shoes.  As I was putting them on my attention was drawn to the really large American Flag almost directly above me.  I could see a normal chem. Trail going right behind it and thought it was cool looking.  This is why I was looking up. I have (knock on wood) great vision. 20/20 – And I saw two objects in the sky near another jet (not the same one that had the chem.  Trail behind the flag but a similar jet that I see in Atlanta all the time).  These crafts seemed very silver – at times the sun reflected off them – and slowly.  They seemed small, but far and very silver.  I knew right away that they were not normal crafts that I see in the air.  They were very very high in the sky.  They hovered like helicopters but didn’t look or move (left, right, up, down) like a helicopter would.  The other point I really want to underscore is they moved tog! ether.  They seemed to keep the same distance from each other and traveled in the same direction – but that direction was not just east or west – more like zig-zag –quite slowly.  I never saw anytime of spinning or jets – they were real still. I watched them as far as I could as they got smaller.  It was something I will remember forever.  It was such a clear day and such a clear image to remember. And so unlike anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We were discussing life, in general, when a large flash of white light interrupted our conversation. We both stopped talking and looked upward, thinking that someone had turned on a light on their home’s exterior or lit a firework, but as we looked into the sky, a large green circular object streaked across a small section of the sky and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was bluish-green and had a glowing intensity to it. It was larger than the half-moon that was present for the whole night. One of us saw it as a C-shape, almost like the curved, solid side was slicing across the sky and the green light filled the “cavity” behind the edge of it. I saw it as a disk with a small space in the front, very similar to the “Millennium Falcon” from the Star Wars films. I saw green-lit patterns on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both know it seems crazy, but after both of us viewed the phenomenon, we sat for about 10 seconds. Then both of us asked if the other had seen the same thing. Our stories lined up perfectly and we were a bit doubtful at first. Then after 2-3 minutes of discussion, we heard a sound very similar to that made by a plane breaking the sound barrier. It was also synonymous with the “thud” made by a large object making impact in the earth. We both heard the noise as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of us are fanatics about UFOs or extraterrestrial life, but we aren’t completely closed-minded to the possibilities of not being alone in this universe.<n>

3/12/11 22:00|Morgan Mill|TX|Light|25 minutes|Suicide after Alien/UFO sighting near Comanche Peak Nuclear Facility|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86138.html|183|ndxe201103| Suicide after Alien/UFO sighting near Comanche Peak Nuclear Facility<n> <n><n> <n><n> March 12/2011 My girlfriend and I decided to go out to the middle of the 1,400 acre ranch that she lived on out side Morgan Mill Texas and do some stargazing. Well around 10pm we notice a strange group of ligts that appeared to be marker lights similar to conventional aircraft but blinked in multiple colors and in a random pattern. After watching this for a few minutes I realized the speed this object could move across the horizon and the speed it could stop and change direction was something more than a conventional aircraft.  We continued to watch this for 25 minutes and were both convinced we had our first UFO experience and we decided to keep this information to ourselves. This was a Saturday night that we witnessed the UFO and when I returned to work Monday morning in Granbury Texas the president of my company called me to her office to notify me that my best friend a 59 year old man that was well respected in the community had committed suicide on Sunday morning/Saturday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course I was upset about my friend and no longer was thinking of the UFO I had sighted hours before.  My friend that had committed suicide was  not mental, was taking no drugs and had no reason to step blow his brains out on the back porch of his $250,000 home that resides near Comanche peak Nuclear Power Facility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later was the funeral, he was cremated and the event was standing room only and had many well respect members of the community.  After the funeral I stood outside hoping to give my condolences to his brother mother and family and as my girlfriend and I were waiting I was confronted by another close friend of the deceased.  He pulled spoke softly and asked if I had seen the deceased the week before and I replied no, that I was planning on a visit this week, he continued and said that the decease had been historical about an alien encounter Saturday night march 12/2011 and had the neighborhood security searching the area behind his home and was convinced of alien activity in his neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were blown away and believed every word of this because of our experience, but I also know that this area the people are close minded and this would be swept under the rug and never investigated. Rick (the Deceased) was a good friend and a good person that would not likely believe in UFO/aliens and would poke fun of anyone that did. Suicide was not something he would do, and after speaking to the security at his neighborhood and hearing their stories I am convinced he had an experience that lead to his untimely death that is worthy of further investigation.<n>

It was a warm evening with good visablity. While I was playing my flute, all of a sudden I saw in the corner of my eye a bright white light coming in to my view from the southeast part of the sky. I stopped playing and watched as this bright white globe streamed across the sky from  (southeast to north), desending from right to left at about a 40 degree angle towards the ground. It was very close, not far away. I did&#39;nt know what it could be. I really didn&#39;t have time to think about it, it happened really fast. It looked like it was just above the greenbelt behind my house. It appeared like the full moon, yet it was at least twice as large as a full moon. Also, the moon was behind me and was only partially lit, maybe a 3rd of the moon was lit. So it definitly wasn&#39;t the moon.  It almost seemed like it was just east of the house next to me, maybe a little further, maybe a 100 yards, where there is a green belt that separates our houses from the apartments that are on the top of the hill. As it streamed across the sky, after about 4 or 5 seconds it produced two little white flare like jets of fire, one on the top, and one on the bottom of the globe. The outside part  of the globe then started spinning in a clockwise motion while it was descending, the inside of the globe was stationary. This lasted about 3 or 4 seconds. Then, it fell towards the ground. When it was about to hit the ground I, stood up and screamed &amp;quot; Oh My God &amp;quot;, as I expected to hear a large explosion. But it went behind the trees and dissappeared with no sound. The whole time of the sighting, there was no sound coming from it. I looked at my watch and it read 10:35 PM CST. I want to repeat that this globe was large and moving slowly at a 40 degree angle downwards. It wasn&#39;t the moon, it wasn&#39;t an airplane or helicopter. I&#39;ve never seen a ufo before,and I never expected I would ever see something like this. It&#39;s ! the most incredible thing I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. In regard! s to my feelings, I started thinking about the events that are happening around the world. In Japan, New Zealand, and the volcanoe in Indoensia erupting. I started becoming concerned that this was a sign or a warning. I was worried that more was about to happen, but it didn&#39;t.  At least not last night.  These were just my feelings.  The experience was very intense and I still have so many questions.  That&#39;s really all I can convey at this time.<n>

This rules out Chinese lanterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [Extra info&#39;s] There were a few higher trees further behind the dots. And also some trees between the dots and us. This rules out Airplanes. There was no sound either, until a passing airplane that also had blinkers passed right over our house. It came from the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also a cover of Chemtrails on our atmosphere, so that also rules out things outside of our atmosphere. The distance was approximately 900-1100 metres, as the Stadium (Abe Lenstra) is about that distance removed from my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up at YouTube and Google and there are more sightings of UFO&#39;s today all over the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All showing something similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These are the same lights, but not the same location, so I doubt it&#39;s the same lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smrIU0tBGZU<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope more people. in my hometown are seeing this website and saw the same thing.<n>

Myself,  my fiancee and my 11 year old daughter were all witnesses.  We first saw a very bright light in the sky, then as we got closer we realized it was a helicopter.  Odd to see it with what looked like search lights on.   A few moments later, we saw a bright, flashing white light in the sky farther ahead of us.   As we got closer, we also could see red and green lights.  The white light was HUGE and flashing intermittently, the green and red ones seemed to remain on..but it seemed as if the object was spinning in the sky. We continued to get closer, and could not figure out what it was.  It wasn&#39;t really moving - sort of hovering.  We came upon it, looked directly up at it from my sun roof - and it was nothing we have ever seen before.  Definitely not an airplane or a helicopter, and it seemed to not be moving at all, since we approached it and t! hen it was behind us as we continued to drive.  It was fairly dark out, so it was impossible to detect any shape, color, or size, as we could only see the lights.  They were very bright, and their pattern seemed to indicate the object was squarish or diamond shaped. When we were directly under the object, I slowed down on the highway so we could take a  good look at it, to about 40mph.  It seemed to be about 500-1000 feet above us, but it didn&#39;t look very big, so it may have been flying higher than that.  The object did not seem to move - it didn&#39;t disappear, we simply drove past it and could still see it in the same position behind us.  We have NO idea what this could have been, and frankly, feel silly reporting it, but would like to know what it may have been, or if others reported it.  Traffic was light but there were many other cars, many breaking as we were, as if they also saw it.<n>

About half way to our destination there&#39;s an S curve that cuts through a little valley. It was a Clear starry night, we weren&#39;t under the influence of any type and were going about 45 mph when I look up and Instantly my heart Froze, every hair in my body was sticking straight up (goosebumps), absolutely SPEECHLESS and shocked my world stopped for about 5 seconds looking at this  BLUE glowing Round object as it hovers and spinning clockwise and in the middle there is a ring with smaller Circles illuminated blue was spinning the opposite way.  When I first saw it, it was descending slightly, then ascended and took off in a zigzag pattern, almost felt like we were about to be abducted with the car, FAST like from 40 to 100 to 200 mph.  I said to my friend,  &#34;That was a UFO, right?&#34;  The only thing he said was &#34;I don&#39;t know what else it could have been&#34;.  If only I c! an PLUg my thoughts on a Screen and produce a CONFIRMED Visual IMAGE of this Amazing thing.  Hook me up to a lie detector and ill pass.  I am an honest man and I am not lying and haven&#39;t told anybody, because I know what they&#39;ll be like all typical and stuff.  I thought this site would be good.  I know what I saw was real and it is not from this earth, I can guarantee that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object was going in front and behind of a small cloud in a weird zig zag manner moving from one side to the other, then going in, out amd arpund te cloud.  The movements it was making was nothing any man maid object we know of can make.  At one point it stopped in mid air for a couple seconds then went back around the cloud.  It was going at a fast pace but not to fast and the last time it went behind the small cloud it wasn&#39;t seen again.  The other clouds were random and not close together for it to move behind another one without us seeing it.  It was diamond shaped with a blue streak of light tailing behind it that was coming from what we believe was the back of the craft.  It also had some red and green lights but were very light and at the back of the craft but was not making a streak like the blue light was.  It just disappea! red behind the cloud and we didn&#39;t see it again.  It lasted about a minute or or two.  The craft looked to be not that big as the clouds were pretty low clouds.  It was making 90 degree and 180 degree moves almost like it was flipping over on itself to change direction.<n>

My neighbor and his brother knew of this sightings as I told them.  My neighbor texted me on the 27th of March and asked if I&#39;ve seen his brother?  I said no and why.  He proceeded to tell me that his brother saw what I saw this morning. (3/12/11). and he can&#39;t find him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He thought he may be over to my house telling me what he saw.  I drove over to my neighbor&#39;s house that morning to find out what was going on.  Only thing he knew was his brother was awaken my his dog and he let his dog outside that morning thing that he had to do his business.  His dog ran back back in and got under the bed.  His brother went outside and seen nothing but felt his hair stand up on his neck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He went back in and came back out and look around and saw it. Interesting enough as he was telling me what his brother was telling me, I explained that my dog at 4:00 - 4:15 started barking wildly as though there was an intruder in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped out of the bed and found nothing.  I didn&#39;t go outside at the time.  I went back to bed.   Around 5:00 am, she woke me up  this time I went let her out to do her business.  This time I went out with her and looked around but I didn&#39;t see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that day, I got a chance to speak to my neighbor&#39;s brother and he explained to me what he saw.  HE didn&#39;t describe the object only to say it was larger and it was coming from my direction and moving just above the tree tops with no sound.  It was pitch black outside but he was able to make out how larger this object was.  It was large. The size of a cloud and just above the tree top floating with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said he froze and watched this object glide and turn the same time as it continued to move just above the tree tops heading west north.  Than it started to shimmer as if it was being bath in water and it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve being in touch with my neighbor since than wanting to talk to his brother and he tells me that he told his brother that I want to talk to him again since his sighting knowing t hat after a couple of days he would remember more of what he saw.  My neigbor told me that his brother won&#39;t even talk on it and he said that which I do remember him telling me the same and that is if we tell other people and they come and ask him about it he will denied it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor also told me that his brother is different ever since he saw this.  I explained to both my neighbor and his brother that what ever is going on in the Pigeon Hills it will be back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog apparently is keen to protecting me or aware of what his going.  Because she is awaking me.  I know what ever is going on it will be back and I have my camera ready.<n>

It was in the area of 695 where there is construction and the speed camera installed in a vehicle.  Was driving through the construction zone and noticed two oddly bright white lights sitting over the beltway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never noticed too many planes flying through the area and since the lights were not moving I automatically threw out the idea that it was a plane.  It did not move at all and was at an odd height.  Too high to be any sort of pole or something used to light up the immediate area.  When I was driving uder it, I could not make out any shape but may have noticed a red light that flashed.  Not entirely sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Either way the lights were very suspicious given the area (695 beltway in the Baltimore area), so I doubted it was military craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure many others who were driving noticed this as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date above was flawed.

These were the size of aircraft but did not move as normal aircraft.  They appeared to be in a horizontal multi-level pattern and moved in sync. with one another.  There was no sound and they seemed to hover in the sky then move to the north and separated from one another and disappeared from our sight into the horizon.  They seemed to disappear a few at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a local airport in the area (David Hooks Airport) and we called them to see if they had any aircraft in the area of this description or picked up anything on radar.  The airport personnel stated they did not have any aircraft of that nature and did not pick up any thing on radar.  This statement was quite alarming as these aircraft should have been picked up on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not hold to the belief in alien/extrate! rrestrial aircraft, however this is very unusual.  I also have questions if this could be military in nature.<n>

I was amazed! I unfortunately was driving and started to slow down and had to look back at the road and when I looked back up they were gone. My mind raced to find a rational explanation but could not come up with one. It was way to high for street lights, and to was not planes.  There was no sound at all but it seemed far away so no sound didn&#39;t seem out of place. Regardless something that I will never forget and the date burns in mind because it was the same day of the big earthquake in Japan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It took me a few seconds to find my phone because it was dark and I didn&#39;t know where I put it but once I found it they were gone.  I didn&#39;t see them leave I just looked up and it was gone.  This happened at like 10:58pm, it was right by the Oyster Creek Nuclear power plant except it was on the east side of route 9 over the woods.  This all happened so quick I only saw them for probably 10 seconds.  We were the only car on that road when this happened right after we saw that we drove to the bay to look around and see if we could see anything else but there was nothing.  There were a few planes off in the distance but what we saw was definitely not planes.  So after looking in the sky over the bay and the woods where we saw it we turned around and drove the same route when we saw the lights to see if it was just a glare on the window or something.  But it was not a glare, it was not a plane.  What we saw was definitely UFO&#39;s, I just couldn&#39;t believe what I saw with my own two eyes.  I believed in aliens before I saw this but I never thought I would see anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As it was moving, the back half of the object separated and got smaller until disappearing completely.  It was as if it just &#34;melted&#34; into the sky.

I seen two large objects with a size that was relative to the moon.  They were so large that I first thought it was a blimp of some sort.  I continued watching and they moved relatively slow going from left to right.  Left to right in my case would be that they were moving north.  The objects were at about a thirty to forty degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the two large objects headed north, they came together side-to-side and became stationary.  I knew the objects were saucer shaped because there was many red lights that made it known, they were this shape.  Once stationary, the objects were seen for about five more seconds when they slowly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up and could clearly see a V formation of lights all moving together, the light the moon was giving up gave enough light that I could clearly see the craft was in the shape of a triangle not a boomerang. I am not good at judging altitudes but I will assume it was high because we could not hear a thing. it zipped over out heads and as it turn the lights level out and we could tell it was turning and by that time it completely disappear. It did not shoot up or just keep going it turned and tilted up and was gone. i went for my phone instantly to get a video but by the time it load up the craft had disappear.  I am a firm believer in what I see because i can rationalize what I am seeing and what I saw in the sky last night was something I can rationalize in my own mind. nor could my friend who po! inted it out first.  It would have flown right over our heads and if he did not see it it would have been gone and we would have never known it was there it moved so fast and was completely silent.  williams field air force base is about 5 miles south of my dads but this was not military there is no way we have crafts like what i clearly saw last night. i will tell any one who asks me if i believe we are not alone that we aren&#39;t in this universe something is out there from yesterday on my life will forever be changed after this.<n>

The night was very clear and you could see millions upon millions of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, in about one second, a very large, very low object flew from my back right shoulder to my front left shoulder.  I would estimate about 180 degrees across the sky, much lower than ANY aircraft EVER.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And here&#39;s the weird thing. NO NOISE!! AND BRIGHT!!  But not bright like headlights coming at you.  It didn&#39;t cast any light.  It didn&#39;t light up the sky. And it was every color I have ever seen.  Like a rainbow all at once.  It glowed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, here&#39;s this thing, very fast, very low, very bright but no radiance.  From the southeast sky to the northwest sky immediately.  Like a speedboat across the sky pulling a rainbow.  Instantaneous.  I have never experienced anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry if my report is short, so was what I saw.

Please help<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am such a skeptic; I went outside to smoke a ciggy at about 23:45 when this red light caught my eye.  To my eyes was a good size but I could not give a shape other than a glowing circle, before i took the picture.  It was not flashing light, blinking, it was a steady red glow.  Was not airplane or helicopter.  It was completely silent.  It was low enough for me to see its speed.  It was going at about the speed of a low flying helicopter.  It stopped dead in its tracks when I stood up.  Came back a ways then become still.  Then it went back the other way. I followed it into my back yard and watched it fade into the distance.  I do not get scared easily!  I am such a skeptical person when it comes to things like this.  But I was bone chillingly freaked out!!!  After i regained my thought process i ran inside and woke my girlfriend up in tears.  I thought I was going crazy.  She reassured me after I showed her the picture that I was not.  If you zoom into the picture you ca! n see the object outline.  It looks diamond shaped. It is weird because this happened the same time all of the stuff in japan started.  Please help me prove that I am not going crazy.  I am scared only because I have never seen anything like it!<n>

I saw out my car windshield window I saw a hazey, glarey, white colored cigar shaped U.F.O. going right to left in like a 45 degree angle and I saw it for 4 seconds because either trees,homes or clouds made me lose sight of the U.F.O..  It past a clear section in the blue sky.  It look like how a plane takes off and never saw one take off this fast and was bigger than a plane + had no wings.  The glaring bright sun was out towards the back left side of car.  I might be mistaken for the sun glaring on a plane taking off near midway airport and I am not sure because never saw anything like it as I took a right on 95th I called someone to tell them about what happened and saw a plane 55 seconds later going down that same direction the U.F.O was going.  First it looked like almost like a fireball,than thinking like the surfboard of the silver surfer marvel comic and than after thinking about it I say for sure cigar shaped.  There was scattered clouds on the left and right of the clear blue sky section I saw the U.F.O. at.  It just moved to fast and was to big to be a plane.  I was talking about it all day and I am gonna sumit this report at 12:45am on 03/11/2011.  The plane traffic was higher today and planes were flying lower than I normally see.  This happened around 4:47pm on 03/10/2011.  It looked like a failed attempt to blend in the sky.  I saw another U.F.O. in the past in this same area like 10 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

For the full space of time we watched the disk it moved westward at a slow pace (100 kn?).  The object itself was not remarkably proportioned, just the size of a typical Cessna prop. aircraft.

3/10/11 07:46|Lake Havasu City|AZ|Disk|3 Minutes|Bright Amber Disk - Travels Across The Desert Sky|3/23/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80432.html|219|ndxe201103| Bright Amber Disk - Travels Across The Desert Sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thursday night at approximately 7:46 PM, I spotted a brilliant amber light in the North/ Western sky. I was sitting, facing East and the California side of the horizon from my home in Arizona.  I am very, very familiar with the flight patterns from L.A. to Phoenix and back.  Those travel East to West and visa versa and only shift latterly North and South depending on weather and other circumstances.  I&#39;ll say that I see A LOT of interesting things in the sky and often around here.  This one was absolutely amazing.  Once I realized it was not a plane, I thought it could be the space shuttle.  That had landed the day before so that was out.  I then reasoned that it was the Mir.  I ran and grabbed my binoculars to confirm. Not so much.  I&#39;ve seen the Mir 3 times in the last 5 years - Once with my naked eye at about the same time at night, once through my 12&#34; dobby telescope and one other time just after dusk with my naked eye.  This was not the Mir to the best of my know! ledge.  It glowed more brightly than any star in the sky.  It was a distinct orange &#34;glow&#34; which looks similar to reflected light from the Shuttle and Mir but through my binoculars, the light was steady, unwavering and stayed the same luminosity across the entire night sky.  It travelled at approximately 1400 mph.  I am basing that on what I have watched hundreds of times, commercial airliners traveling at anywhere from 600 to 700 mph.  I could not tell altitude beyond about 30,000 feet.  Through the binoculars, I could not make out any formation of wings, additional lights/strobes or physical features.  To me, it looked exactly like a brightly glowing disk since the light was not round.  It was very slightly oval.  There was no atmospheric disruption that I could see.  There was no propulsion or exhaust that I could see - Just a very bright and very steady moving object traveling from North to South in the clean night sky.  The moon was visible but only a quarter-moon washed out the stars.<n>

I put a leash on my dog’s collar so he could relieve himself on the tree in the back yard. I heard a bang and my dog got creeped out and jumped.  I tried to console him and he (my dog) was looking up to the sky, I could not believe what I had seen.  This object was hovering above the trees and houses.  This object was in a triangle formation with about seven reddish/orange lights.  These lights were not probing and this object was not making a noise.  This object looked as if it was in a vee formation much like what ducks looks like when they flock together.  It hovered over the treetops for close to a minute then moved east, slowly.  It was a clear night and oddly quiet all around me.<n>

I walked outside didn’t see anything but heard it.  I walked down my front  porch and into my yard  and looked over and in the distance saw and  thought it was one of those dual helicopters that have two propellers and it was flying west from a south easterly direction.   So I thought no big deal, and went back inside.  5 minutes later I hear d a sound of a louder lower something.  So I went outside expecting another helicopter and looked up and saw a triangular craft.   It had one green light on one tip, a red light on another tip, and white light on another tip,  and somewhere on the outer rim was a red light which I assume was the cockpit.  It flew over at 11:31 central time.  It was flying low.  I went back inside thinking I had seen the last of it, and it proceeded to fly over my house, an additio! nal 5 times.    At one point I watched it fly up near a commercial craft high up in the sky, and it was at least 10 times bigger than the craft from my vantage point.   I was on the phone with the Highway Patrol seeing if they could get a patrolman out on Hwy 72 to see this thing.  The last time I saw it it was going back east and following a large what I thought was a helicopter with a huge red light,  back towards Salem.  I watched this thing for an hour.  It was dark metallic, and loud<n>

I looked out my door, walked down the steps and looked over the roof of my house where I saw a large craft flying west.  I assumed it was a plane flying low towards Ft Leonard wood. then went back inside and finished my game.  Then I heard the loud noise again, and looked up and a large dark object was flying over my property, it had lights on all three points and a bright red light in the middle of its front.  It was huge!!!   I stood there with my mind racing and I went inside and grabbed my camera, and I saw it bank turn around and fly over me again.  My camera&#39;s battery was dead.  So after it passed I ran in and grab my spare battery.  Came back out, and it flew over once again.  I took pictures but the flash didn&#39;t go off and it was still on VGA.  on its fourth pass over I tried taking picture but it couldn&#39;t get it because a tree obscured my view.  I did get a picture of it I thought but once again didn&#39;t turn out.  The video did though.  I called the highway patrol and when it came back through again I heard a loud helicopter like sound but it didn&#39;t have the shape of a helicopter, I had a large red light on it, but the triangle was following it!!!<n>

We were sleeping outside looking up at the stars when we noticed a large, bright, yellowish orange light moving from West to East in the Southern sky. The light was constant, meaning it did not blink. It moved at the speed of a lower flying commercial aircraft, but emitted no noise. It travelled at a constant speed and we watched until it disappeared on the Eastern Horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have both seen hundreds of satellites in our lives and this was definitely far too bright, moved too quickly, and appeared to be too close to be a satellite. It was especially odd that it made no sound. We had seen many planes, and every single one even those at large distances and heights were very noisy due to the remoteness of the wilderness we were camped in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The timing is correct for a sighting of the International Space Station.

3/9/11 19:30|Apache Junction|AZ|Light|3 min.|Helicopter chases white light  at high speeds over Apache Junction, AZ near Mesa border.|3/23/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80435.html|225|ndxe201103| Helicopter chases white light  at high speeds over Apache Junction, AZ near Mesa border.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came home from my parents house and my neighbors are outside.  I am talking with my neighbors when I stop them mid sentance because I see several hovering lights and one that is very close.(mabey 10 miles away). I came to find out later that the other lighs were jets on a particular flight path, and are completely explainable. But there is one light that is not. the one that was really close. I hear an apache, well what I am assuming is an apache coming from the southern part of the sky, from what I am guessing is williams air force base. I thought at first that the white light was the helicopter until the helicopter came in to view and started to chase the white light. It chased the light at very high speeds probably 200+ miles an hour and was as close to him as one football field at times. I remarked that it was strange that the light wsa heading in the opposite direction as us yet we could still see it&#39;s headlights. I also said it is strange because plan! es aren&#39;t allowed to get that close together. The only was it makes sense to me in my head is if an orb of light with intelligent control was either being held by a silent helicopter which had no flasher and pretty good but not to fantastic maneuvering capability better than the one that was chasing it at least.  or being moved under it&#39;s own power.  I think mabey the light was something that the helicopter was supposed to follow as like training or somehting it didn&#39;t make a lot of sense in my head so I thought i would report it. I googled it before I came here and see that alot of people have seen what I have, there is even pictures.I don&#39;t know if this is explained or not actually. But it was really strange. On my way to work in the morning there was an commercial on the radio that talked about car accidents , news and aparently they said that there would be planes doing training excercies, at wiliiams throughout the day. was it the night before too?<n>

It made no sound what so ever.  When I saw it,my first reaction was to scream, but I couldn&#39;t even move because my body was paralyzed.  I screamed the best I could and when I did,it left the room, I mean it shot out of the room in a blur, directly toward the opening above the door to get outside.  When I finally got my right arm to move toward my husband, I tried to wake him up by squeezing his arm and then pinching him.  While this was happening,strangly, I could hear the sound of something like a small propeller or rapid flapping, (like a bird stuck in chimeny,I  DK?)  in the room in front of the door it must have left through.  But, my question is, how did it get out of the openeing above the door?   Its only about 3 inches wide and 2 and a half ft. long.  I don&#39;t understand why husband wouldn&#39;t wake up through all of this,and why my body was paralyzed.  This was something I really can&#39;t explain and I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this or heard of anything like.  I wished I could say to myself it could be a bird or something because of the sound at the end, but it was solid and structured,  It looked like some kind of machine.  When my husband finally woke up, I told him everything that happened and we moved my daughter to our bed.  I didn&#39;t go to sleep after that unil after 6:30 am.  I felt like it could still come back.<n>

The account below sync&#39;s with the picture I have attached.)  -Tuesday, March 08, 2011 -9:00 pm EST -West Springfield, Pa. (Just beyond the Ohio/Pennsylvania border on Rt. 20) -Facing Northwest<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heres what happened:  The second witness and I were on her back stoop putting a dog on a chain before we walked down to the barn for the night.  She looked up and pointed to the front of the house next door and said &#34;LOOK!&#34; I thought she was looking at the stars which were all amazing, since it was a completely clear night.  You could see every star in the sky as well as very distant and purposefully moving southbound planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked over quickly and my eyes focused on three lights in the shape of a boomerang that were the length of the height of her neighbors&#39; house, which is a two story home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lasting a total of four or five seconds, the lights continued moving across the neighbors side of the sky, in sync with one another, horizontally.  It was moving fast, what seemed like 65-75 mph from left to right.  As they moved from front of the house (south) to the rear (north), they shifted from flat and horizontal, to completely vertical (like in the picture).  It didn&#39;t just slowly become verticle, it snapped straight up in less than 1/2 a second with no sound, and no hesitation.  The craft continued northbound, and when it passed behind the brown porch pole in front of us, it completely disappeared. Poof.  Into nothing.  It didn&#39;t get smaller, fade out, or disappear over the trees.  Just gone.  Again, this was all completely silent, aside from the other witness asking where it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was large and by the looks of it, if it were a plane banking at an extremely sharp angle, it would have surely hit its wings on the ground or the trees ahead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also learned that less than a mile towards the neighbors yard and beyond is a prison that, according to a former prison guard at the facility, is a no-fly zone.  There is no small near by airport there either.  Less than a mile beyond the prison and to the north is a set of railroad tracks and a salt/sand mine and harbor, docked directly on Lake Erie.<n>

After passing the Greensburg/Mt.   Pleasant exit, I noticed a red light sitting stationary in the sky towards the left side of my windshield in the distance, which would put it over the South Greensburg area.  I told my mother if she noticed it, but she said no.  Soon after, as we approached the Cedar Street exit, she finally noticed it after taking another look, which actually appeared to be two red lights hovering stationary over a residential neighborhood.  The lights, which remained steadily lit the entire time, didn&#39;t appear to be close to each other nor did they move apart, which makes me wonder if it could&#39;ve been a large craft hovering above the neighborhood.  We continued on our way towards the US Route 119 exit but didn&#39;t notice anything else as we continued heading west. This occurred within a one minute timeframe, although I had slowed considerably when I not! iced the lights in the vicinity of the Cedar Street exit.  A few minutes later, we noticed a helicopter flying towards the direction of the sighting although it appared to be a medical helicopter.  Traffic in this area was relatively steady, weather conditions were partly cloudy in the low 40s.<n>

They at first seemed to be horizontal to each other in the sky, and they then turned vertical and moved to the north then disappeared.  The shape it turned into was almost like a boomerang.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where the lights appered in the sky was behind a neighbors house, you could see it clearly and it made no noise.  I&#39;m not sure how the object was able to move around in that area due to the closeness of the houses and the wire from the poles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights seemed to be glowing almost a bluish, green yellow.  The color combination was strange. There was a shading that could be seen in between the lights, a dark color that gave definition to the object a mile away from my house is a correctional facility.  It is a no fly zone under 500ft, the object that i saw was under the 500 ft for sure.<n>

We both stopped we were speeechless.  We watched it fly past starts i wondered if it was a plane or a satitlite but it was moving WAY to quickly, passing many stars.  then it stoped and i said to my friend either its moving further into space or coming towards us.  as were both pointing at it.

3/8/11 18:30|Belle Mead|NJ|Light|~1min & 30sec|Glowing orb ascended from my woods, hovered above the trees, trailed behind a plane, stopped, than finally disappeared.|3/23/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80471.html|240|ndxe201103| Glowing orb ascended from my woods, hovered above the trees, trailed behind a plane, stopped, than finally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier that sunset around 6:15pm, I was coming home from the DMV, and as I was driving I noticed something odd when I looked over towards the sun; there were these white comet like streaks, about mid horizon altitude in a cluster of 3 or 4.   At first I thought I saw a comet, about the size of an Inch held out at arms length, but It seemed practically stationary, or at least 10x slower than an airplane would move judging on the intensity of the lights emitting from the objects.  The tails were strange too because they didn&#39;t disperse at all as smoke would.  Rather, the length of the tail would correspond to the speed at which it was moving, leaving behind no remnants of its track.  However, as they slew down the tails would retract, and when they sped up the tail would drag along at a constant opacity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1min later at another red light, I looked up and saw that one of the comet-looking objects now had 2 tails facing towards one another as if it had divided; one of which was facing towards the sky and the other slanting downwards.  Another one soon appeared out from a cloud that was above the one facing the sky.  At that point I didn&#39;t know what to think of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I pulled into my driveway at 6:30pm, still thinking about what I had saw, I stopped midway and glanced over towards the horizon, and that’s when I saw a white glowing orb through the woods.  After I was sure of its unnaturalness when it slowly ascended from behind and hovered over the trees, I quickly pulled out my phone and captured a video of it until my phone memory was full.  I reviewed the my video and it includes a plane passing it while the object it trailed behind and then at the last split second when my phone stopped recording, it appears to have taken off at the speed of light looking like an inverted television screen when its turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My curiosity got the best of me and I ended up watching the sky all night since I couldn&#39;t sleep, and at 2:30am I witnessed another Ufo on the opposite side of my house from where I saw the first one.  I had a video camera nearby and shot it, but the video doesn’t show much detail because of the lack of light.  From my perspective, I saw a star sized light above the trees that jumped different directions and than it jumped to the edge of the woods closest to me at tree level, where I was able to see a shadowy oval outline with the light at the tip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to slowly hover towards my house and came within 20 ft of the rooftop, and than just as it was about to pass over head it flashed two lights on each side and disappeared in the direction from where it came from.  When It disappeared a faint flash of light can be seen at the top left side of the screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night, 3/10/11 at 1am, I yet again witnessed another above the woods where I saw the first at.  This one was seemed to pulsate and hover just as the others did, except it looked more like a glowing disk with an orb underneath and a small flashing light on the side in a triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to investigate the woods the next day and found two questionable clearings of trees in the densest parts of the area.  There were trees pilled that had been ripped out from the roots and the trees in the ground surrounding the perimeter were pushed outwards on an angle, making a full sky clearing above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a nice clear sky as I looked up to check on weather clouds, plenty of stars out.  I looked to the North and noticed a formation of flashing lights not in sequence in a circular formation at about a 30 degree angle of view and a single flashing light trailing the circular formation.  I would say about a dozen lights or so. There was a pattern of the flashing white lights that appeared to be those of white NAV lights of airplanes or helicopters.  The single trailing light was close to the formation at first and as I kept watching for about 3 minutes until the circular formation disappeared behind the trees the single trailing light trailed even further traveling in the same path.  They were moving relatively slow to be airplanes. I would say the formation and trailing light were at high altitude and rather far from my location I would guess 30 miles or so towards the Savannah area.  I am prett! y sure they were not military helicopters or aircraft as they were just white lights and no red or green.  I was a crew chief on helicopters in the army and flying NVG there would be no lights on aircraft or if flying unaided all lights would be on including the green and red.  Formation flying in that formation I have never done was usually staggered left or right or V formation. I can’t explain what I have seen but I have not seen anything like this.<n>

3/7/11 22:00|Thamesford (Canada)|ON|Rectangle|5-10 minutes|Bright, unidentified hovering object, Thamesford, Ontario|3/23/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80485.html|244|ndxe201103| Bright, unidentified hovering object, Thamesford, Ontario<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving eastward on Highway 401, heading to Toronto and had just passed Chatham, Ontario, when my car began to shake violently, forcing me to exit the highway.  My husband was in the passenger seat and my daughter and her boyfriend were in the back seat.  I thought that either the engine was acting up or I had blown a tire.  Luckily we were able to get off the highway quickly as the exit was not far from where our car began to shake.  Once we were on the ramp to exit, the car immediately began to drive smoothly as if there was nothing wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove to the nearest service station where my husband checked the tires and then under the hood trying to find the cause of the shaking which had ceased on the exiting ramp.  He couldn&#39;t find anything wrong with the tires and everything looked fine under the hood.  He checked the oil level and it was down a quart so he added some new oil.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to continue our trip on a smaller, less travelled highway (Highway 2) which ran through small towns and cities, just in case we were to run into car problems. We passed through London Ontario and approached Thamesford Ontario.  My daughter noticed a very bright light in the night sky through the front car window.  She described it as being a &#34;very large bright star&#34; and it confused her because &#34;it was 20 times brighter than any other star in the sky&#34;.  My husband assured her that it was most likely an airplane and that it would be gone within a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove closer to this bright object, we all realized that it was not moving at all and was just hovering about 100 to 150 feet above someone&#39;s farm property at the east end of the town.  Because I was driving, I did not get a very good clear look at the object as we passed by it (it was to my left, now just north of the highway, but my daughter, her boyfriend and my husband were able to get a much better view and were able to fix their eyes on it for about fifteen or more seconds.  Here is our description of the actual object:  It appeared to be rectangular shaped (the colour and material was difficult to determine as it was nighttime), about 40 to 50 feet long and 20 to 30 feet wide, with many bright lights including 2 large white headlights, a red pulsating light at the back and a few bluish lights on the side.  Because it was higher than us, we didn&#39;t see the top of it, but the bottom (floor) of it had about 8 or 10 &#39;panel-like sections&#39;.  Because it was so low to the ground, we assumed at first the possiblity of it being a helicopter, but after observing it&#39;s shape and size, the extremely bright and colourful lights and it&#39;s lack of any sound, we immediately realized that it couldn&#39;t have been a helicopter or any other familiar aircraft for that matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to drive for a few minutes eastward on Highway 2 but turned around and headed back towards Thamesford hoping to stop and get possible video footage of the object.  When we reached the area where we had seen the object, it was no longer there nor anywhere in the sky.  This confused us because, under normal circumstances, something this large and bright would have remained visible in the sky for a long period of time, and there were no airports nearby.<n>

Yakima, WA West Valley UFO Sighting|3/23/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80540.html|245|ndxe201103| March 7, 2011 Yakima, WA  West Valley UFO Sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> RE: Questionable-UFO SIGHTING<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 59 year old male.  Mentally and physically stable and retired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 7, 2011 at @ 9:05 p.m. I was proceeding in a WESTERLY direction on TIETON DR.  I got to 60th AVE and turned right.  After making my turn, about ½ block, I stopped my car and called my wife who works 1 block away, on 60th Ave.  The evening sky was clear and the stars were clearly visable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up in a SOUTH-WESTERLY direction I saw some amber lights coming in my  direction. There were 9 Circular Amber Lights coming towards me.   At first sight they were coming at a sloping down-ward direction in a uniformed manner.  There was one at the front and 4 rows of two in each row.  They were moving in a SOUTH-EASTERN DIRECTION toward Ahatanum Ridge and toward the lower Yakima Valley.  They seem to be on a landing position in a down-ward direction, as if a plane was about to land at our airport.  It was just in front of me when they leveled out and all began to fly, in unison, straight towards Ahtanum Ridge.  The one thing I took note of was the fact that I could hear NO sound.  I have heard a lot of Jets fly over and a lot of helicopters, since we are so close to the Yakima Pomona Military Firing Center.  I did not hear the roar of jets or the rotor sound of a helicopter.  It was silent with no noise before, during or after seeing them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The end object (looking at the formation to the right rear of my sight) veered off slightly and came in my direction. It veered off for no more than to the count of 5 when it resumed its position of the formation.  The formation then continued straight toward Ahtanum Ridge.  As it got past the ridge the formation, in unison, began to move in an upward direction and in a matter of seconds they, one by one, began to disappear.  They all maintained speed and direction in unison.   I was trying to approximate their size and distance and thought them to be over the lower valley  before they disappeared from my sight.  I held my fist up to them, as they were in front of me at the initial sighting.   With my arm extended and  my fist in a ball they all disappeared, as they did with each appendage.  As I put up the small pinky finger it barely covered the front object allowing me to see the rest of the formation, a trick I learned in the Army.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted my wife, by cell, and she saw the whole scenario. I tried to get my new cell phone activated to shoot a picture or movie but was unable to do so before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got into my car and it was about 09:15  ((sic.  21:15 hrs.)). I called 911 and they said there were no other reported sightings called in and they advised me to call the UFO CENTER. I called the local paper, the Yakima Herald Republic, and was told that there were no other reports, like mine, and that they found it &#34;Not News Worthy.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite serious-minded and credible.

He was very excited and said step outside and look at the sky towards West Valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out and looked up and there were several bright orange lights flying in formation. I thought at first that they were helicopters because of the altitude they were flying and at the speed they were going.  They were flying in a way that made them look like they were floating.  I carefully listened but could hear no noises I would normally hear from a plane or from a helicopter.  One started to veer to their left as they were flying eastward looking as if they were going to fly over the location I was.  It immediately got back into formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very spooky no knowing for sure what they were or what they were doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back inside the house and waited for my husband to arrive, which was only a few moments since he was only a block away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You,   ((name deleted))<n>

Radiating from the spots were long rays of light,flashing yellow, green, orange, and red. I saw it in the south eastern sky not far above the horizon.  I thought it may be an airliner and waited to it move based on reference points I marked. In two hours time, it barely moved at all on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/7/11 21:00|Culpeper|VA|Triangle|2 hrs|Slow-moving, noise-less craft seemed to be surveying the area.|3/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80385.html|248|ndxe201103| Slow-moving, noise-less craft seemed to be surveying the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9 pm, we saw multiple lights in the northeastern sky.  They were moving erratically and slowly and we could hear no sound. One approached and flew a few hundred feet over our house.  As it approached, I thought I saw a spotlight hit the ground not too far away, but it did not remain. As it flew over, from what I could see, there were three lights in a triangular pattern, a red one towards the front and two blinking white ones toward the back.  I actually could not make out the actual shape of the aircraft.  As it flew over, I could hear a very slight humming noise but that was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking up casually, one might have thought they were regular airplanes, but what was strange was that they all seemed to have the same flashing lights pattern, and they were moving too irregularly, too slowly for an airplane, and with no sound.  Also, another strange thing that happened a few times, one of the lights would get very bright, almost brighter than a star for a few seconds, and then the light would disappear and be replaced by the red and white flashing they all seemed to be doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for two hours and they never left.  They would fly from one end of the sky to the other and then back again (distances of what seemed to be hundreds of miles). It was almost like they were looking for something or surveying the area.  We never heard a noise, not like you would think you would hear from so many aircraft in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was really strange, I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.  This was the first UFO sighting of my life and it was one of the most exhilarating moments of my life.  I kept waiting for them to fly over my house again so I could get a picture but they didn&#39;t.<n>

I am used to seeing planes, jets &amp; helicopters &amp; have many years of orientation of what they look like at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 3-07-11 I stepped out for my cigarette break, looked up &amp; saw this large star which I thought was a planet.  A passenger jet was flying west from Raleigh airport in the east.  As I&#39;m watching the jet, I noticed that the star was moving above the jet from south to north.  If the jet was flying at 2,000 feet, I re-evaluated that the star was an object flying above the jet around 3,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was round, very bright white.  From looking at a typical star, the object was at least 20 to 30 times larger.  There was no beacon, no typical red &amp; green lights.  I thought it may be a plane&#39;s head lights, but the headlights were pointing down &amp; the plane must be flying backwards???  As I continued looking at it, it seemed to be flying higher then it slowly vanished.  I was and still am convinced that that was nothing I have ever seen a man-made aircraft do.   It was not a meteor, or a weather balloon, or swamp gas....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came back in &amp; told my wife &amp; daughter what I&#39;ve just seen &amp; they laughed.  I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else reported this?<n>
3/7/11 19:45|Van Nuys|CA|Disk|3-4 seconds|Fast moving lights seen over Van Nuys California|3/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80386.html|250|ndxe201103| Fast moving lights seen over Van Nuys California<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking North over the city of Van Nuys California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw 3-4 four lights, non blinking, red and yellow, can&#39;t remember the numbers exactly but I think more red than yellow, it was only for a period of 3-5 seconds, so really not sure of the exact quantity of lights. The size is hard to say as I have no idea how far or close it was, but it moved very fast. The shape I did not see, only lights, and they were shaped in the proverbial oval/circular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is my recollection,  I was looking out of our sliding glass door, as I do every night while having dinner. I watched these lights come into view and they banked in such a way, my initial first second or two  thought was, something might be blowing in the wind, as we had winds tonight, but then I realized the lights weren&#39;t blinking and they went up and out of my view at a severe angle and in my mind I instantly knew this was not a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped up and went to the sliding door, 8-10 feet away, all the while looking in the same sky area. I opened the sliding door and nothing was there and everything was quiet, ruling out a helicopter or even a plane. It all happened so fast, I have to say, for a few minutes afterward, I wondered what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But on reflection, all of my moves were instinctual and that I saw something out of the ordinary. It has clicked in me- that this wasn&#39;t what I&#39;ve been looking out of this window for years at, the various planes, helicopters, even asteroids/meteors. This moved very differently, smoothly and then quickly. From my POV, I see the planes that are on approach to land at Burbank airport and I&#39;m use to seeing things move relatively slowly through the sky. If you have ever been to an RC plane park and have seen how fast the planes fly by in the sky, that is similar to what I saw, though, in this case, no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had anything to add, I would only add that, it was initially moving like how a helicopter would bank on a turn at low altitude, but this bank was still on an upward incline and then the lights rose up at a steep (maybe 45 degree angle) out that initial circular pattern.  I also called the local police and said, just in case anyone has reported seeing something and they said, well you have (hmmmm okay, I guess just me!?)<n>
3/7/11 19:00|Lynnwood|WA|Sphere|3-4 min|Two lights gold and blue distinctly separate, low.|3/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80387.html|251|ndxe201103| Two lights gold and blue distinctly separate, low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was between 7 to 7:30pm. I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette facing west. The moon was in a cresent shape that&#39;s what drew my attention, I observed two bright spheres heading east. One of the lights was an amber/gold in color the other bright blue but half the size of the other. They were at what appeared to be the average altitude that i&#39;ve seen most helicopters in this area flying at, just much faster. It&#39;s hard to say how far apart they were but the kept a perfect distance from each other, in a semi arc toward the south east. It&#39;s fairly dark and quiet where I live and they made no discernible sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/7/11 18:50|Wakefield|RI|Formation|30-60 sec.|Two White Lights Fly Simultaneously WNW to EAST|3/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80384.html|252|ndxe201103| Two White Lights Fly Simultaneously WNW to EAST<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saw the moon earlier as a crescent setting perfectly, so I went out about 6:50PM with the dog in the yard to take a better look at the moon.  I walked into the middle of my yard about 50 yards from the house, and saw two bright lights traveling from the WNW travelling East almost directly.  The two lights were travelling at identical speeds with no perterbation or change in speed.  The lights were just white but about 20 to 50 times brighter than Sirius, which was clearly visible behind me.  They traveled at identical speeds about two-thirds through the sky when they faded into blackness.  At that point, they were quite bright, and took about 2 seconds to fade.  As they faded, one faded, then the other as it approached the exact same place in the sky, then faded and disappeared.  As it faded there seemed to be a moment where it appeared (on both lights) that there was a glowing ring that could have been pointing down either toward me or toward the earth.  Bu! t the fade to darkness was strangely slow.  As the two lights traversed the sky, a typical satellite passed right through the line between the two crafts.  I often see satellites in the yard on clear nights.  This light was much much smaller than the two lights that were moving throught the sky.  I could actually compare them as they appeared very close in the sky at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were planes visible in the sky at the time as well, both far and near.  I live in the landing path of Providence airport and see the planes very commonly.  These unusual crafts were traveling almost exactly perpendicular to any landing planes.  They had no directional lights.  The only thing I can imagine is that the space station and the space shuttle were passing over and were 100 miles apart.  But the way they faded has me completely puzzled.  I checked the website for the space station flyover, and it says the craft would have appeared at 7:14PM...25 minutes after exactly when I looked on the web to check the time of that possibility.  I know I saw this at 6:50 PM give or take a minute or two only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did disappear at what appeared to be the exact place in the sky.  So I can imagine that the sun&#39;s light may have still reached to about 75 degrees above the horizon toward the east.  What is mostly strange is that the light did not change in any way as it flew over, but it wasn&#39;t any particular shape either.  It&#39;s very difficult to explain.<n>

I went back to the trailer to use the restroom. Usually the area is lit from lights attached to a generator so water trucks can see to pump water into a pond. When I stepped out, I noticed 2 Star like objects moving in the clear sky. They were not blinking, flashing, or anything. They moved in perfect unison and a great speed. They were travelling North North East I believe. I watched them for about 2 min and they disappeared. While this was going on I also noticed a smaller and not as bright one moving pretty fast North west and crossed paths with the two star like objects. I tried to take a picture with my camera phone, but it was too dark. Any feedback appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was audible and was very intense. It seemed to have a repeating pattern (e.g. like an engine idling) and you could feel the vibration in your body. Our dogs were barking fiercely at the sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never determined where the sound was exactly located. It just seemed to be behind and above our house. Strangely, when my wife exited our bed to look out the bedroom window, the sound immediately stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, I went to our living room to look around the house, and found our two small dogs in a state of fear. The dog&#39;s hair was standing on end. I felt really spooked, as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The neighborhood was extremely quiet and I never heard another neighborhood dog bark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very positive that this was an event outside the norm for my area. It was not typical aircraft noise (or noise from the highway). It had a strange &#34;subsonic,&#34; sort of effect.<n>

Two seperate crafts sighted.|3/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80380.html|256|ndxe201103| Comet-like UFO. Major air surveilance at time of sighting. Two seperate crafts sighted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You for your time. Please excuse this for its minor length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw two objects. The first object was heading north bound, actually flying across the little dipper constellation. The second object appeared immediately to the north when the first object flew over the tree line. The sky was clear and bright with stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few miles down my road is Historic Camp Milton. I looked on Google Earth a few months back and saw that they have an air strip. It is not uncommon to see helicopters flying a perimeter around the base.  So, I assume the base is active.  But there isn’t much plane activity going in an out of Camp Milton.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 6, 2011, at roughly 4:00 p.m., I was alarmed to hear low flying planes, so I went outside to have a look. I saw two radar planes, flying at least a mile apart, circling a huge perimeter around Camp Milton within 200 ft from tree level. I also noticed various planes at various clearances moving at various speeds, with the fastest I guessed was moving at around Mach 2. They were peppering the sky with activity. The spectacle of seeing so many planes in the air, with a lot of them moving in formation, was enough to be in awe over, or at least enough to make me question.  It also gave me a lot of things to compare my sightings to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I did question. I figured they were looking for something, so I kept looking up, hoping to maybe catch a glimpse of what they were searching for. These radar planes were circling for hours. At around 9 p.m. after checking the scene out a few times, I just stared up in no general area thinking something would catch my eye. That’s when I saw the first UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting lasted 3-5 minutes. It caught my attention much as a shooting star would, but it was moving much slower. Light put off was a constant when it was visible, but would fade in and out, much like a comet, but the trail lasted longer. The craft was still moving at a fantastic rate for its altitude. It looked as if it were among the stars. When it would appear, it would be further than I had saw it, but its position did not make sense in relation to its speed. It never blipped or blinked, only faded in and out in no apparent pattern. It took anywhere from 3 seconds to 10 seconds to reappear. Each time it appeared, it looked like a shooting star. I know it wasn’t a meteor shower, because it kept a path. It was a yellowish light that had a haze to it, not a definite shimmer as a distant light might have within our atmosphere. It moved directly north, but after a few appearances, I lost it for around 10 seconds only to see it reappear, heading directly east and over th! e tree line. I was astonished, but saddened that I couldn’t watch it for long. That’s when a bright light caught my eye to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting lasted around 10 seconds. The light from this UFO was blue, much like the new types of headlights for automobiles. It appeared and descended a little past Camp Milton, maybe a couple of miles above the tree line, which is within 8 miles from my house. The light was huge. I thought it was a helicopter, but it was moving much faster. The light had an aura, much like any flashlight shined in your eye, then it seemed to dim to as faint as a distant star, never blinking; remaining constant. It curved down, then flew off in a 45 degree angle, away from the horizon, until I could see the light no more. This sighting happened within 10 seconds, so I guessed that this craft was moving at a stellar rate of speed. There were no clouds in the sky at the time, so I was able to see it fade to nothing as it seemed to ascend into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both sightings combined happened within minutes. I stayed outside and kept watch. I noticed one other thing, which was a blip of light around Orion’s belt, which I dismissed.. But then I saw that blip in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could hear the planes circling on until midnight. I went outside for a late cigarette around 1 in the morning and there were NO PLANES IN THE SKY. I sat there for a while to try and see another plane, but there were none to be seen for my duration of looking at the sky. A thick fog rolled in around 3 in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My rational explanation for the first sighting would be that it was a stealth plane. I may have saw its propulsion. I know they move at incredible speeds.  But, for the other, I have no guess. It was amazing.<n>

As we observed the moon, my roommate pointed out a light in the sky coming from the northwest.  at first we thought it might be an airplane, but it was just one solid white light, no flashing lights whatsoever.  there was no sound coming from it either.  as it passed overhead we thought we might start to hear the sounds of a small airplane, but still we didn&#39;t hear anything.  As it flew overhead we noticed it was making small, instantaneous slips to it&#39;s left and right.  It passed over us at a relatively low speed, headed to the southeast.  Right around the time we figured it would have been over Austin-Straubel Airport, the light slowly began to dim and changed from white to a orange that got darker as it dimmed.  Within seconds it was gone altogether.  We have never seen anything like this before, hopefully somebody can read this an shed some light on our &#34;sighting.&#34;  What! ever it was, it has us pretty excited :D<n>

It wasn&#39;t too high, but it was high enough not to be confused as one of the Tower lights or attached to any structure from the ground. It was very bright. As if metal was reflecting off the Sun&#39;s light casting a blinding glow.  It appeared to be flat and circular, but long..almost like a &#34;Cigar&#34;. Almost as soon as I noticed it, from down the street riding in my vehicle, it appeared to have been &#34;spooked&#34; or scared away. It ascended away from my direction so fast from its hovering point (Point A) to it&#39;s secondary point (Point B) but left a trail of light stretching behind it that connected the two points, and then from &#34;Point B&#34; it &#34;zipped&#34; away at an unbelievable speed until it simply vanished completely once it reached the clouds as if it entered what I can on! ly assume was some type of &#34;Warp Speed&#34; at a speed I have never seen any man-made aircraft reach in all my military years. This &#34;light&#34; went from a &#34;Hover&#34; state, to a darting light, to an unbelievable speed until it vanished, all within seconds. Its&#39; physical appearance was as real and apparent as any other &#34;aircraft&#34; in the sky would&#39;ve been. This happened in broad daylight in the early afternoon, so it could not have been mistaken for any &#34;known&#34; piloted aircraft that I&#39;ve ever seen or came across for it was &#34;too small&#34;. And it moved almost instinctively, as if the craft itself had its own &#34;ability&#34;. The conduct of this unidentified object was definitely &#34;abnormal&#34; flight behavior, darting or zipping across the sky from one point to another in one second, then halting; taking off from a halted position at great speeds; vanishing or disappearing out of the sky. There was no noticeable sound, no smoke trail from any visible or known thrusters or engines, Just a sreak of br! ight, white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was about 4.6 miles into the trail and I saw what I thought was ground light over the next summit on the trail. It looked exactly like HID lights from a new car but I&#39;m 4.6 miles away from any road. I had just called my wife and she sent me a text so I had my iPhone out while I was walking. I took the phone out and i tired the hi res camera on and started to take video. As I came over the top of the hill I saw a very bright disk.  As I saw it I yelled out loud, the disk took of instantly from the ground with no noise more  rapid then anything I have ever seen. It was the size of a black hawk helicopter and as it pushed off the ground it displaced all of the air in the area making a soft wind much less then a chopper. It was insane and I have never been on a site about Ufos before and never have really thought about them but this was 100% the real thing. The m! ost insane part is when I went to the spot about 35 yards away from me where it was it was hovering over what I thought was an abandoned mine shaft. You can&#39;t even see the bottom of this shaft and it&#39;s on old government land. I have absolutely perfect video and sound of this. What do I do. Is the government going to come after me for sending it to you. I need you to see this so you can tell me what the he&#39;ll I should do.<n>

At first I thought it was a plane but it didn&#39;t move.  I kept watching and after 20 minutes I thought it merit to wake up my husband so he could take a look at it. He was impressed by it as well since it couldn&#39;t be an airplane or a star.  It was just a big bright stationary light in the sky.  He decided to call KUSI news just to have somebody else take a look at it.  As he was talking in the phone the light started getting smaller but we can still see it.  My husband is a real estate agent and I&#39;m a stay at home mom.<n>

We proceeded to my truck in the east side parking lot, when one of my family members had gone to the restroom.  I then hopped on the bed cover of my truck to wait for her.  I laid back with my hands behind my head looking straight up with my legs pointing north and the mountain to my left.  When I stared at the clouds I seen what looked like bugs flying around but realized that the objects were not bugs, but were dark and circular. I could not determine the size, if anyone can hold a pencil strait out it would be the size of the tip of the lead but in a circular shape.  It was roughly 4-5 objects flying like as if they were playing and with great speed, they would even stop in mid air and were flying in and out of the clouds. I stared at them for about four to five minutes while trying to tell my wife what I was looking at but unfortunately  my wi! fe has really bad eye sight and could not see what I was seen. Finally my eye sight was getting bleary from focusing too hard and look way to recuperate my eyes, after one or two minutes I looked again and only seen one and it wasn’t event five seconds when it bolted with tremendous speed north toward the red rock scenic view and disappeared after a few hundred feet. Never had I seen with my own eyes anything in any nature that fast in my entire life and will always remember this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was out with some friends watching sunset on my boat in Islamorada, FL.  It was one object but hard to actually tell the shape, if anything it looked sort of oval to my friends, but to me a little more rectangular.  It looked as if it was reflecting the sun off 2 parts of the fuselage (2 separate sections and both silver and sunset red in each section), but it didn’t seem to have lights.  At first we thought it was a plane (hence, my rectangular comment), but it had no flashing lights, or red lights, just what seemed to be the reflections.  The colors were consistent with the sunset we had just seen.  It moved right (southwest) at first then without hesitate, or any curve, move at about 90 degrees left of where it had been heading.  It then shot straight away from the earth and was out of sight in less than 10 seconds.  It faded to a little red spot and then to nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were looking due south from just north of Indian Waterways, mm 89 on US 1, on the bayside.  It was relatively close at first, about 1 mile away.  It wasn’t the shuttle, it goes across the sky, I’ve seen it and it takes minutes to traverse the entire sky line when it goes over.  I’ve seen military and shuttle rocket launches too.  Not the same thing and much faster and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So his daddy diverted his attention to colourful lights in the sky, asking him to look at the aeroplane.  When he stared longer he said it the lights do not look like aeroplane.  As we watched, the object has flickering lights with blue, green, white, red and the object was seen hovering.  At first we thought that it was a helicopter.  Then we took out our binoculars and digital camera.  Viewing with the binoculars, the lights were colourful, blue, red, green and white and the object was hovering.  Nolan says it changes shape when he viewed through the binoculars. Then I took a few pictures with my digital camera. As I did  not have my tripod and it was dark and my zoom lens was only 80-200mm, the image was not sharp.  I wanted to take some video shots but was not in time as the object started to drift further and suddenly it disappeared.

I watched the light for 5 minutes or so before alerting my friends to it, not wanting it to be a plane or a helicopter and appear stupid.  As far as I could tell I couldn&#39;t hear the sound of an engine or whirring of blades such as a helicopter.  After I told my friends, they confirmed my beliefs that it was a UFO.  It continued circling the lake for 15 minutes or so before heading off towards the north.<n>

I ask them if they saw the bright light and they did .  We all observed the light, planes were flying by from Laguardia airport it was not moving. Two other co works came out and saw the light one said it was a weather balloon,the other said it was a satellite.I told them they do not use balloons by the airport,and told the other coworker satellites can not be seen in the day time. we were looking north elevation was about 50 degrees,blue sky very clear day we observed it for about 20 Mins , it all started 11:15 am I took a picture with my cell phone and emailed it to my self then went to lunch.  Later that evening I looked at emails and saw the object no bright light ?  I cannot describe the object.<n>

The object became brighter and slowley gained elevation.  The object began to emmit a long orange tail but the actual craft was unseen.  The object continued to gain elevation traveling to the east eventually leaving a cont trail.  At a very slow speed the the object turned south and disappeared only to re appear a short time later still emmiting a long orange trail and second cont trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Fishermen along the Thames River in Groton,CT saw a triangular ship pass overhead silently. Two other witnesses in another part of town proclaim to have seen the same craft w/o knowledge of other sighting. On Old Buddington Road two young adult males (as told to me by one of the same) were outside when an app. 300Yd triangular craft slowly and silently passed overhead at a hgt. of 1000ft.  Witness said oddly silent but felt an odd vibration throughout his body as it passed directly overhead. He also described it as seemingly like a helicopter until it got closer.  It had a light at each corner and a large round light in the center which  beamed to the ground. This is all Ive heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We had our cat with us that we were bringing to my house. we entered his car and he started it up.  we both turned around simaltaniously because we were in reverse and thus were looking where we were going. at that time we had discovered that the entire night sky had been illuminated almost as if it were day.  at this time our cat started to meow and claw at the seat viciously. were then abruptly turned back around to find a disk like craft hovering only a hundred yards away from us.  it was very low to the ground right above the tree line but still in plain sight.  the craft emitted a great intensity of light that it was almost hard to observe. as we looked closer we could see five light around the object that were abruptly changing into multiple colors as if it were syncronized. our cat then became histerical running from one side of the car to the other as if trying to escape or make contact w! ith said craft. my friend and myself took notice in her behavior and then made eye contact with eachother from shear curiosity and astoundment. we then directed our attention back to the craft only to discover that it, and the light that accupanied it, had dissapeared almost as if it weren&#39;t even there. now i had had one other previous un-reported sighting a few years back that had brought almost a euphoric efffect on me. only when the craft had dissapeared did the euphoria as well. this night i experienced virtually the same euphoria as before. i felt un-easy as this had been my second sighting and was becoming a bit skeptical as to if i was an any danger at all. but nothing since has occured. i find utter excitement in these experiences and hope that there may be more to come. our earth is at a delicate stage as to warn of a coming catyclysmic event. i embrace and encourage such events because mankind today has become nothing more than dispicable and therefor our planet i! s to be cleansed of such faults.<n>

I am a Cum Laude graduate of the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York. I am a retired sea captain who spent 27 years at sea traversing the whole world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of March 3, 2011, I was standing in my open doorway having a cigarette when I noticed a bright red flashing light through the trees approaching from the southeast and tracking towards the northwest.  Fort Brag is the jump-off point for San Francisco area air traffic beginning or ending their Great Circle routes to and from the Far East and we occasionally have some military flights off the coast so I am used to seeing air traffic, but this light was unusually large and bright to be a navigational light so it grabbed my attention.  It was a beautiful clear night with no clouds or haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached, white lights became visible and I saw that there were six white lights, much dimmer than the pulsing red light, in the shape of a triangle.  The red light was located between the second and third white lights on the starboard (right) side of the craft, which is the wrong side for a red navigational light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate the altitude to be between 5,000 and 10,000 feet and it moved rather slowly, more like a propeller driven plane than a jet. It passed nearly directly overhead, at an elevation of about 80 degrees from the horizon and I observed it for what I would estimate to be four or five minutes.  As for size, it would have filled the lower half of a full moon.  I heard no sounds from it as it passed by overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When its course took it offshore, it seemed to &#34;eject&#34; a smaller craft out of its starboard &#34;bow&#34;.  This craft had a smaller pulsing orange light and two small white lights.  The smaller craft continued on a northern course while the larger craft continued northwest until it disappeared from view behind some trees.<n>

3/3/11 19:15|North Dartmouth|MA|Light|7 mins|2 light emitting objects splitting from each other and having sporadic movements in north dartmouth|3/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80323.html|292|ndxe201103| 2 light emitting objects splitting from each other and having sporadic movements in north dartmouth<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 7:15 p.m in the evening on Thursday March 3rd 2011 while i was walking back home i saw at an altitude of slightly lower than what aircrafts fly, two light sources splitting apart from each other one a little bigger and one comparitively smaller than the other. These two objects were moving parallel to each other with some considerable distance between them(I had to turn my head 90 degrees to see each object).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bigger light source had a constant motion throughout with a slow pace.The other smaller light object had a sporadic movement (i initially thought i was looking at a bird which emits light on its tail). But it was not, as this was at a higher altitude than what birds generally fly and this object was definitely bigger than a bird and had a light emitting with a luminosity which definitely cannot be a light emitting bird or any other man made remote controlled flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This smaller light object&#39;s trajectory(towards orion) was flying just over my head when i observed the movement was wobbly (left - right -left - right). I tried capturing some video of it but couldn&#39;t as my phone camera was not good enough :( . After it passed over my head(of course at the altitude i specified before) it started moving slightly faster(no aircraft/chopper can move at this pace)before it sped off(a touch lesser than jet speed without sound!!) at a faster pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially when this light object split from the other bigger object before, it moved so quickly away that i couldnt possibly miss it and is the reason why i started getting curious in the first place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now i saw the other large object from which the bigger light had initially split from was moving at the same exact slow speed in a rectilinear trajectory as it was before ( Again i would like to clarify that this was not a aircraft/chopper as i have never seen an aircraft or a chopper move so slowly). This object had 4 lights on it. But its trajectory was nothing interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spanned my neck just to make sure that these were not the only ones flying in the eastern sky. But to my surprise i saw 3 more objects in the north-eastern sky much further away from the bigger object with the same or higher altitude but i couldnt see these objects clearly as these were pretty far off from where i was and i am not sure whether they were aircrafts or otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am clearly stunned with this event that i witnessed.<n>

They looked like 2 cars side by side in the road.  I drove an additional mile and realized that there were no lights like that in the trees.  I came to the top of a hill that is above the tree line and saw the white hue from the lights in the sky that looked like it could be another 8-10 miles away (in the direction of Donalds, SC).  I went home thinking I was crazy, and then my neighbor contacted me asking if I saw it as well.  She saw it coming from the same direction with her husband.  I picked her up and we retraced our path and no longer saw the lights.  I asked the Rescue Squad if they knew of any military activities in the area and they did not.  It was 9pm when we went investigating and found nothing.  I had a friend of 15 years tell me that her son and daughter saw the same thing last week.  I have an actual picture from when I first saw it.  If you zoom in, you can actually see the 4 lights and see how close it looked.  I do not know of any lights that can be that big and bright and be so far away.  The lights never moved or twinkled or any of that, but were the brightest white lights I have ever seen.<n>

I reached a dead end and was forced to go back to the main highway. I saw a cow in a corral and decided to stop and look at the cow and granary, as I think that skeleton architecture and pastures in residential areas are a very quaint phenomenon of the Mormon landscape. As I was looking at the granary and the cow, I saw a shadow move swiftly from my left side to behind me. A feeling of dread came over me and I got a strong feeling that I should leave. I always listen to my instincts, so returned to my car immediately. As I began to drive away, a strong feeling of dread washed over me. It was so strong I could cut it with a knife. I looked behind me and was surprised to see an orb of light in my rearview mirror. The light was about the size of a small cantaloupe, suspended in the air about 4ft high. I saw nothing but the light that wa! s rushing towards the back of my car.  It looked something like a bicycle headlamp from my rearview mirror, so I assumed someone wanted to talk to me to see what I was doing. They were probably bothered by my presence or suspicious of me looking at their property. Looking in the mirror, I saw it was about 5 ft behind me before it veered slightly to the left side of my car. I stopped my car, rolled down my window, and was going to greet the person on the bike with the large bright headlamp. I then looked over my left shoulder to talk to them and there was nothing there. By the angle of the swerve and speed of the light was traveling, by the time I looked left to greet them, it should have been at my left rear fender and taken another second or two to be at my window. But by the time it took me to look from my rearview mirror to over my left shoulder the orb of light vanished! I opened my door, got out, and looked around at disbelief that it had vanished into thin air. Again,! I was overcome with a very malevolent feeling, got back in my! car, an d drove away as fast as I could. No light followed me as I drove away for the second time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have the habit of always looking up at the sky whenever I go outside, it&#39;s something I do all the time.  I had one cigarette in my hand and I was thinking or where my lighter was and all of a sudden as I looked up at the sky I saw something that left me speechless.  It was like an oval, saucer type shaped ball of light, bright white light. It was emanating light from itself, not reflecting it. It moved horizontally as if it was going into the sky´s darkness.  It left a white trail of light or perhaps it was that my vision saw it as a white trail of light because of it[s velocity. It moved so fast I couldn&#39;t even tell my 3 girlfriends about what I just saw. I  just gave out a tiny scream and looked at them in amazement. They didn&#39;t understand what was going on. I asked ¨Did you guys see that?¨ and they didn&#39;t know what I was talking about. As I watched them look at me with doubt, I felt tears in my eyes and sta! rted to cry. I didn&#39;t have a reason too but if felt right to cry because what I saw was too amazing for words. So I really wanted to report it. I was completely sober at the time. Had no glasses or sunglasses on. Had not recently taken a picture with flash, I had not consumed any hallucinogenics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I truly saw a UFO.<n>
3/2/11 22:00|San Marcos|TX|Chevron|a few seconds each|3 Large objects seen fliying overhead while studying for astronomy class - lights, sounds|3/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80298.html|301|ndxe201103| 3 Large objects seen fliying overhead while studying for astronomy class - lights, sounds<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 9:45pm I went outside to look at the stars to study for my astronomy class. As I&#39;m looking into the sky I saw objects flying in the sky (it was obvious because they would cover up the stars as they passed by). All of the objects seemed to be close in proximity to where I was. Also, they all had tiny dim lights all over them and wear flying pretty slowly, almost like they were gliding. Also, there was a soft &#34;swooping&#34;/ &#34;gliding&#34; sound as the passed over head. The only thing that varied between them was their shape (or at least I was uncertain of their shapes, which lead me to believe they may differ).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first sighting I wanted to dismiss because it was (or what I saw of it) was a crescent shape, therefore I wanted to label it as a bird or something.  I took another look and noticed there were dim lights all over the object - ruling out it being a bird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later I spotted another object.  This one was kind of in the shape of a plane or a chevron (its hard to tell because these objects were dark so some parts of them blended in with the night sky).  I knew it could not have been a plane because the object was way to close and there aren&#39;t any airports near by for a plane to be flying that low.  This object like the last had the unusual lights all over it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third and final spotting of these objects I wasn&#39;t able to make clear of because it started to concern me.  I did notice the lights and also the speed remained the same.  The first two objects were flying from south to north and the last one i have forgotten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am certain that what I saw was UFO&#39;s because I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I even phoned my father, who was a pilot for many years in the military and he could not think of any aircraft that fit my descriptions.<n>

I knew I couldnt be the only one who thought this was strange and unusual.  It was im guessing motionless about 200 or 250 feet in the air.  As I approached it I noticed the three white lights and just thought it was a plane patrolling the freeways.  But as I got closer it became clear this was no plane nor was it a blimp due to its shape which was honestly dark and was only viewable due to some overcast skies reflecting the city lights behind it.  To me it looked like a soccer ball shape with 4 courners that seemed to flare  By this time im now very close to it and can see 3 more new lights that were red and staggerd between the first lights I seen from the front.  Passing it at well below the 65mph speed limit along with everyone else Im trying to make out what im looking at.  But I couldnt. It was just yards away on the oppisite side of the freeway so im lo! oking out my driver window stumped and somewhat suprised it was just sitting there.  I would argue til the end of time that it was not a blimp. Ive seen plenty of them to know this was much smaller and not elongated.and it was not a helicopter as it made no sound and was definately not equipped with rotors.  Oh and it wasnt a weather balloon or flares. Its something else and I just wanted to share what I saw in the sky last night.  Peace.  ((name deleted))<n>

Sitting in the passenger seat I noticed a flame like object hovering over an empty field.  As my friend and I made the left turn onto gougar rd. the flame became more visible, as we got to an opening in the trees  we parked our vehicle to observe the object.  Now our position was right in between 151st and 147st on gougar road.  During this time our vehicle was facing south and we were observing the object to the west of us.  To the west of us is the I-355 extension and the object was across the highway about a quarter mile.  When we first parked our car the object still had a flame shooting out the top of it.  At first it had seemed as if the refinery flame was lit.  But this was not the refinery.  The flame began to diminish and a very dimly lit spotlight appeard at the base if the object, at this point the shape of the object was unclear.  Everything up to this point happened in the first five minutes.  Now things get a little frightening, the spotlight on the craft had dissapeared and a bright green light turned on.  We were about 3/4 of a mile away from the object when it started to approach us, the green light was still on and the craft was approaching the highway heading east.  I couldnt believe my eyes as I saw this spherical shaped aircraft with six tentacle like legs under its body.  The craft was getting closer and now I can resemble the lights, there was one single light bar across the center of its body consisting of 1 green light on the right side (the brightest one) a white light next to that light, then three red lights that flickered as if they were being manipulated manually, they did not seem to have a set pattern and finally a dimmer green light on the left of the arrangment.  These light features were extruded from the front of the body of the vehicle, the aircraft was now about fifty feet over our heads silently hovering over.  Our car was off and not one noise! came from the aircraft.  As it passed over us we lost sight panicked and left.<n>

Upon arriving at the lease I saw lights moving about the tree&#39;s.  I took several photo&#39;s and video.  Then the lights began moving at me.  I was concerned but figured I would discover it was something explainable.  That was not the case.  As it got closer I could see parts of the craft. The top looked like a disk with a compartment underneath it.  It was absolutely silent.  It was within 50 yards of me.  I knew if it was a helicopter I could have heard the blades chopping through the wind.  I looked up and saw the disk shaped edge of the craft about to move over my head.  I had a gut feeling it was time to hide.  I came off the catwalk on the tank battery and hid behind a separator after I shut the tank valves to stop the loading process.  A white light came on inside a compartment under the disk.  There were objects in the light but no movement.  There was a red glow next to the compartment.  Like red taffy stretching out like it was being vented but had the appearance of light.  I snapped a picture with my cellphone and it occurred to me I may have to throw my phone if something comes for me.  I was relieved when the craft backed away.  There was the sound of an approaching jet. A F-16 looking jet passed right above my head.  The craft went dark before it reached its location.  The jet circled back and left the area. I could still see the jet lights when the object reappeared over the tree&#39;s.  There was a series of 4 light clusters circling my location.  One of the lights appeared from the North and was going to pass right over me.  I knew my camera memory was getting full. What looked like a flickering airplane light revealed it was something hot reacting to the air moving across it.  There was something big coming out of a steam or fog.  It was massive and looked like rock.  I believed it was a giant meteor.  I watched as a wall of solid rock passed over my head. I coul! d feel the air getting hotter.  It looked like it was at least ! 300 yard s wide and much longer. I believed there it would impact the ground a few miles past me.  As it passed over I could see what looked like impact craters.  Then I saw what appeared to be a large tube. Then I saw another one.  The whole thing slowed and banked upward to the east. It slowed to an almost stop and then took off at a 90 degree angle to the west.  It accelerated so fast it made what looked like twin vortex&#39;s underneath it.  I thought I might not get the opportunity for a shot. I struggled to find this huge thing in my view screen.  I finally just pointed the cameras eye at the thing and hope for the best. Luckily the craft banked back to the east and was coming straight back at me. This time I could see the top side of it. It had many light sources and building structures and even huge flares burning brightly.  The area the most light up was well above the crafts surface. I could not tell if was on a tower or simply hovering above the crafts surface.  There were glowing blu! e power lines strung across the surface. I was getting frightened again it was coming at me. It slowed and went to the south of me without banking this time.  It circled to the south of me and exited to the North on the east side of me.  As it climbed in altitude I could see the 4 light cluster I had noticed before its pass.  I finished my loading process. I told my friends and family about what I saw. I was leaving the location with my eyes glued to the sky.  My camera memory was full.1 mile down hwy 206.  I could see a light above a rural home.  It was just sitting there not moving.  I was concerned for the folks living in the home.  I stopped my truck. I shined my spot light at the craft.  It was too far away to see the crafts shape.  The craft started moving slowly.  The bottom of the craft was a triangle shape with lights embedded in the triangle framing.  The inside of the triangle was visible.  It looked like the inside of the hood of a sports car.  Interlaced tubing and turbo ducting.  It looked very elegant and high tech.  It drifted off a ways then the lights could not be seen anymore.  I wanted to drive my truck to the house to check on the people but could not get my truck into there driveway.  I talked to the people later and they knew nothing of the events of that night or had seen anything strange.  They said they would look for landing signs in there fields.  The images of this event are not high resolution but nothing short of amazing.  The video of the large craft has yielding still frame images that can not be explained.  We have identified alien architecture, creatures, buildings, and believe there is a refining process going on with unwanted products being burned off through flaring.  We have identified star field backgrounds of the craft that give it an enormous size and prove it was in the area spotted in the night in question and of a clarity level for that area, location, and time.  We seek the radar imagery for this amazing discovery.  Any help in this area would be greatly appreciated.  We will provide video and! still frame images of this event.  Thank You.<n>

Others were observed flying independently North and South of 1-10 mainly between Fry Rd and Mason road. One craft flew directly over my wife&#39;s vehicle and she put her head out the window and heard a tiny swoosh sound. We then came home and watched the crafts appear spontaneously in the sky over our backyard at a rate of 1-2 craft every five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft actually looked like fighter jets from the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s but seemed to have a circular formation around them and pulsing red and green lights and a yellowish orange light that remained constant. The body of the craft also seemed to concave upwardly and outwardly like an upside down pyramid but much more subtle.  The white/off white jet fighter part of the craft(s) looked to have a very fat fuselage and had a very distinctive cross shape.  It was hard to see the circular part of the craft but you could see that it extended out from the main body and was much darker in color.  One would think it was a normal aircraft other than the fact that some of them seemed to sit still and no more than the minor swoosh sound could be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing that really stuck out is that they just kept coming from the west almost like bombers on a test run, many of them continued into Houston and some seemed to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that this could be some type of Harrier craft of even a type of silent helicopter but nothing really added up. I have never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We (my family) watched them for about an hour, checked the news reports, made a few calls and really found no explanation.<n>

We were all in my backyard I randomly was looking at the sky. I initially saw what I had thought was just a jet gleaming in the sun towards the Northeast.  When I kept it in my sight and focused on it more I realized it was actually a ball of light, similar to a star. It looked as if it were reflecting the sun off and on, being visible one second and then not the next.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What threw me off and caused me to point it out to my friends is that it crossed the flight path of a westbound plane (right over the top of the plane.)  It also had no contrail or jet stream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yet the most spectacular thing, and what really blew my mind, was that the ball of light at one point multiplied into what seemed like a countless number of the same ball all moving together within the same area; as if they were flocking together around the original ball of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it as it was to the East of us moving Southbound across the sky and it continued to expand and contract into various numbers of balls of light, again all of the same size and moving in the same pattern.  We observed it continue to move south and at one point it stopped above a treeline and one of friends said that it formed a triangle.  It disappeared for a moment and then appeared again at one point above us moving Southwest diagonally across my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that we didn&#39;t see any more unidentified activity, however we did see a FCPD helicopter fly in the general direction of the balls of light at a rapid pace.  I don&#39;t know if the helicopter and what we saw were correlated but the helicopter did seem to be in a hurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Looking northeast from our apartment balcony we saw three individual fireball pulsating objects.  They maintained vertical position  close to the horizon for over 10 minutes and then one went out slowly.  The other two remained for about another 5-8 minutes before going out as well.  They were almost amber in color but flickered frequently and were extremely bright. There were normal air traffic patterns with helicopters but this was extremely odd.  We have planes coming overhead all the time and this looked nothing like them whatsoever.<n>

When I reached the top of the hill at Racho Bernardo, I saw a small (far away) dark (grey) cloud-like shape suddendly appear on the sky over the San Pascual Mauntains. The dark shapped &#34;cloud&#34; changed shaped very quickly and it streched to a funnel-like shape and then back to more rounder shape. a few seconds later it split into three round shapes that started moving left and right slowly and they appear to fade in and out. the round shapes then started moving faster in short, random directions like a pinball getting smaller and larger, and then all three shapes &#34;flew&#34; or disapeard from my sight behind the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seriously????? I even took off my sun glasses to make sure it wasn&#39;t anything stuck to them..

The extremely bright object traveling south was creating a vapor trail that was reflecting the sunrise light extremely bright.  This object being viewed for 40 seconds had traveled about 20 percent of the total length of the existing vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made an absolute immediate 90 degree turn east, as I watched; the vapor trail also followed the path of the object.  An L shaped vapor trail appeared, and the object disappeared in less than two seconds after the turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stopping my vehicle I watched the length of the vapor trail reflect light brightly by the rising sun.  As the vapor trail dispersed it widened.  The area of the newest vapor trail including the L shape dispersed to nothing observable first.  At the same time the beginning of the vapor trail that had looked like regular airliner vapor trail widened to about 10 times the width.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now with the vapor trail quite larger, the beginning of the vapor trail looked like a round splash of paint with 10 or so loops sticking out (image clay pottery suns but the points sticking out were rounded and not the same size)  in the sky, with a perfect circular hole in the middle. The hole size was about 20 percent of the total area and was absent of any visual vapor trail.

In the middle of the sky was a contrail line that was comprised of no less than ten distinct, fine lined z&#39;s. These were very straight and sharp, there were no curves whatsoever.  It appeared very fresh yet there was no craft to be seen anywhere. I thought it looked like the sky had a huge crack in it. I continued walking but also kept looking up to the contrail.  Suddenly, a fair distance above the Z contrail a shiny oval shaped craft appeared and was leaving a much different trail behind it...almost looked like it was coming out of it (fairly high in the sky). It continued like this for about 20 seconds then vanished. It left behind a puffy very irregular cloud, like mentioned before much different from the one below it. I maintained my watch and after a minute or so I saw a shiny object which had not been present before. It appeared to be a star, but I had thought all morning stars ! had faded by that time. Not sure could have been a star...but it was in such close proximity to the fresh clouds that I had to wonder.<n>

Which now I think was the same craft. It is not very obvious unless you stand there and watch it with a reference point as, like I said it just looks like a very flashy star.  But it steadily but slowly descends.  I can see red in the color but only after looking at it for a while.  It is in the Western sky, slightly south.  Has been in the same spot both times I have witnessed it descending.  Like a said, it looks very much like a star except it descends slowly, however, faster than the night sky changes.<n>

As I was looking up, I looked in the direction of the big dipper and just stared for maybe 5 seconds and a white light literally appeared out of nowhere and began to just hover and flash!!! I ran back inside and got my girlfriend and showed her, and she, in her half asleep state, said it was indeed flashing but she didn&#39;t know what it was (and didn&#39;t care.) I continued to look for a few more seconds, the light still in the sky, flicked my cigarette, finished at this point, looked once more and went inside.  Less than one hour later, I went back out for the same reason, and looked in the same spot as before.  Nothing was in the sky, stars barely visible from the constant lights on campus.  Then as before, the light appeared bright in the sky, and this time, i raced down to the sidewalk to get a bet! ter look.  Funny energies telling me this was getting worse as I got closer, I got to the sidewalk and the light was still there.  As I stared in disbelief at the fact that it was still actually there, it began to move closer!!! My heart began to race, my cigarette trembling in my hand, and no one else witnessing this but me, I watched, the light moving toward me but jerking rapidly as it moved, and as it got closer, ironically, 3 police cars drove by and I&#39;m sure they wondered why I was wide eyed and mouth open looking in the sky.  As the thought to stop the last officer came to my head, the light that was moving toward me, just as it was blinking before, ceased instantly, less than a few hundred feet from my apartment building.  Chills and a worried mind were the last two things I took in as I went back inside, for the final time that night.<n>

I stood in front of my bedroom window gazing out as I always do before getting ready for bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming from the southeast, I saw a commercial airline preparing to land at DFW International Airport, I live about 45 minutes to an hour from the airport, depending on traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Off to my right of the commercial airline, I saw an object I have never seen before in my life.  I ran into the family room where my son was and told him to come outside with me, and we walked outside.  I showed him where the commercial airline was, and then pointed to the object on my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked him what is that, he said he did not know he has never seen anything like it.  It was somewhat shaped like a bell, and the whole thing was lit up with amber light, and pulsating.  It was not moving very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason I saw it for about 30 seconds was because for some unknown reason I went back into the house, asking myself at the same time why I was going into the house instead of watching where it was going, but I could not stop myself, and I went straight to bed, and to sleep immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if my son followed me in or not.  I remember it as if it was yesterday, my son does not remember any of this happening.  He said I must have been dreaming it.  I know I was not dreaming it.  I saw it, he saw it, and I cannot explain why this happened.<n>

The area is mostly woods and the trees are quite tall. I noticed 4 green non-blinking lights through the trees to the left of me.  The object passed over the road near the treetops. It appeared to be descending.  At first I thought that it was a plane crashing. As it was above me, I realized that the lights were squarely in the center underside of a huge object. It appeared to be rectangular. The surface was dark-gray or black and completely non-reflective.  I don&#39;t think I would have noticed it if there were no lights.  I cannot really estimate the size except to say the area with the lights paralleled the width of the road.  I glimpsed it through the trees on the other side of the road for a few more seconds. I got to the top of the hill and pulled into a parking lot but did no see it again.  I did notice a plane flying in that area but much, much higher up.  I watched! for sightings on your website for the next month and finally noticed 2 separate ones for the exact date and time.  One in Waterbury and one in Wallingford/Meriden.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not decide whether to report it or not.I wish to remain anonymous.  Thanks, Liz<n>

3/1/11 17:15|New York City (Manhattan)|NY|Other|perhaps 5 minutes|formation of lights seen overhead|3/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80289.html|325|ndxe201103| formation of lights seen overhead<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:15 pm last night, I walked out of my office building at 55th Street and Broadway in Manhattan.  I’m an amateur astronomer and I often look up at the sky, and I did so as I left my building. Almost directly overhead I saw perhaps 6 to 8 hazy and indistinct lights— that’s the only way I can describe them. The lights were in a roughly cruciform shape, but just roughly.  The lights at the “ends” of the longer axis would brighten occasionally, then dim again, but in all instances the two end lights were brighter than the other lights of the shape. The color of the lights was a grayish white, never varying. The shape was, as I say, almost directly at my zenith, somewhat to the west of an imaginary line drawn between Castor and Pollux at the north end and Betelgeuse at the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was confused, because I knew the sky was supposed to be clear lasnight (I’d just checked it on the New York Clear Sky Chart, http://cleardarksky.com//c/NYCNYkey.html, as I often do). And indeed I saw numerous stars in the sky, including just around the light formation, so the sky did seem to be clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked away, to see if anyone was near to verify what I was seeing, but (surprisingly) no one was. When I looked back, the lights were still there. When I looked away again perhaps 30 seconds later, then back, they had disappeared entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later I noticed two of the lights once more, for perhaps 30 seconds, then they again faded; they had seemed to move slightly to the west in the time since my initial observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing I can think that could cause this display would be a set of narrow-beamed lights pointing straight up and reflecting off a cloud layer I could not see. However, if there were any clouds there, they did not cover any of the stars in my field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to say, though, that it did not &#34;feel&#34; like lights reflecting off clouds, to my eyes. It looked more like bright lights shining through a cloud, but as stated there was no cloud layer visible. The only logical explanation is lights reflecting off clouds that I could not see, but I don’t think that’s what it was. Even so, I probably would not have submitted this sighting but for something odd that happened a few years ago and that this event reminded me of. At that time, perhaps five years ago, I was behind my apartment building and I had again looked up; as I recall it was late evening twilight. I saw, again overhead, four bright lights in a square or diamond formation. These were pinpoint sources, and looked like bright stars. As I watched, over the course of perhaps a minute, the lights faded, in unison, and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this may make me sound odd, as if I have a habit of &#34;seeing things.&#34;  I do not. As an armchair astronomer, I take an active interest in the sky and tend to look at it often.  Thus I’m not surprised that I should have seen these things, which probably have prosaic explanations, but which for the life of me I can’t figure out. I’m a rationalist, a skeptic, and I have to admit I can’t explain these events.<n>

It appears to be a craft that kind of looks like a beetle?  I measured it at more than 1/2 a mile long and 1/4 mile wide at the wings.  It&#39;s also 300&#39; tall.  This object has swept back features and appears to be aerodynamic. I realized this was a manufactured vehicle so I searched for more.  I found an identical vehicle approx 800 miles away.  Both vehicles have huge hooks in the front with two small prongs sticking out underneath.  The hooks are over 500&#39; long, I believe I found more items close to the object that indicate a mining operation.  This is the most compelling evidence I&#39;ve ever seen!!  Compare vehicles side by side.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On 3/1/11 it was an overcast day and cloudy.   I was smoking and lookng north when i saw a small plane flying to north west and as i was watching this plane an oval jet black object popped out of a cloud behind the aircraft and followed the plane behind and above the aircraft for two or three secounds then went back into the cloud.when i saw this the first thing that went through my mind was ufo but i then thought it may have been a bird but the object was as big if not a little bigger than the plane and it was a symetrical oval turned on its side and jet black.  I said to myself, i wish i could see it again to be sure of what i saw and as i was thinking about that and looking at the cloud that the object had went into it poped out again.  I was able to view it for another 3-4 secounds before it went back into the cloud.   I was stunned.   It was so incredieble. It felt like it came back out just for me to view it again.  If you took my sighting with the plane/object and then just the sighting with the object by itself if made a figure 8 in the way that it first followed the plane and then when it came back out for me.  The oval looked so perfect, and it wasnt standing up, it was turned to the side.  It was so perfectly symmetrical and so jet black that i would compare its color to the deepest black i have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was truly an amazing experiance i felt like it could sense what i was thinking and came back out for me to get a better look at it.<n>

One mile before the Northwest Tech college, I spotted a bright light in the sky to the left.  It appeared to be a street light, but as I came closer, I thought maybe its on top of a water tower.  Quickly, I remebered there is no water tower at this end of the city. I was talking on my cell phone at the time.  As I got closer I could see, it was a triangle shape with three bright lights.  It looked suspended in the sky. I was telling the person I was talking to on the phone the description.  I opened my window because I thought maybe this is a new Helicopter of sorts.  However, I didn&#39;t hear any noise that accompanies a helicopter. I was close enough to hear any noise.  I could see it, and it was not a Helicopter.  I remembered I had a camera in my purse. I was reaching for it and I pulled over to the shoulder of the road, which was not a good idea because someone could have crashed into me.  As I reached for the camera, the lights changed to a dim yellow and turned directions slowly south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m the only one that saw this thing. I wonder if people even notice the sky at night?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
