When I came out of our house it was hovering over our neighbors one story house. It was daylight and I could see it very well. I remember thinking its too small for a tall man to stand up in. It had small porthole type windows all around it. And I couldn&#39;t look in them first because I was afraid something would be looking back out at me. I looked at the edge of the disk.It had red blue green and white lights that strobbed all around it. It was silver but not shiny. No seams at all and no noise. I finally looked at the windows and the inside of the ship was lite up like a bright light bulb. There was nothing inside. It looked empty. Just a brightness like the sun. I remember thinking. I wish I knew about machanical things because I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m looking at. The bottom was smooth. Then all of a sudden I came out of what I thought was a stupid curiosity I took off running to anouther neighbors house. I remember I was the only one outside when this happened. but it was in the newspaper the next day. Alot of people saw it. I think I was the closest though. If anyone else saw it too. Please email me. It has haunted me for all these years. I just wish I could make anyone believe how important it was. No one will know what its like until it happens to them.<n>

Something made us both lean forward and to look through the top of the winshield at the same time.  It was as if a door opened in the night sky, rectangular in shape.  The light coming from the door appeared to be white.  Out of the door dropped an orange beam of light that did not touch the ground.  Distance could not be determined, but it appeared to be overhead at a high altitude.  Don&#39;t remember how it disappeared, but remember we both leaned back in our seats at the same time and we were still driving on I-80.  Don&#39;t know how much time elapsed between first sighting and our leaning back and resuming the trip.  To me, the experience was not frightening, but the driver of the car became very aggitated and said he &#34;never wanted to discuss what had happened again.&#34; I found it odd, because, to me, nothing had happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I watched it and it watched me.it was very large-at least two football fields and organic looking black,with what appeared to be windows down the sides. it was quite beautiful. my thought was: this is someone important! suddenly it ignited from rear and shot off into the distance out of site in approx 1 sec. I had seen the stealth just previously-no comparison. my husband then worked for the local radio station so I had access to various military bases and had seen some of the latest military and experimental aircraft up close and being tested(flown.) have been to many current airshows so I feel I have enough exposure to what we have developed on earth. this was not of this earth,it came from the stars. it did have some kind of lights but they were indescribable. no one believed me-but I don&#39;t care. I saw it and I believe they wanted me to see them. maybe they liked the little volvo sports car I was driving. at any rate I know we have extraterestrial visitors and they want us to know . remember this happened in 1976! can anyone explain this away? I keep looking for the same description and experience.anyone else see a craft like this ?<n>

Dever State School grounds (now Myles Standish Industrial Park) in Taunton, Mass.  Dates approx. Oct/Nov 1976.  Myself and 2 others driving through heavly wooded back roads of state school came across large orange/yellow sphere, which was stationary in the sky appears almost liquid with pulsating energy or sparks,or aura(almost like line patterns in it,constantly moving).  It&#39;s distance I would say was approx. 300 ft away-it was huge like a sun! We were just teenagers at the time and were goofing around flashing the car lights, opening the cars windows, waving at it and saying &#34;over here, over here!&#34;Unsure of the time duration but the sphere imploded, disappeared, then exploded returning to previous shape but seemed larger. We obviously got very frightened, screaming (the only male there cried uncontrollably) we drove away with it following us,it then seemed to disappear over trees. This is something that has bothered me for 23 years. Also around 94/95 my ex-husband &amp; others spotted a similar object on roadside(Tremont St.Taunton)3-4 cars observed the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in November 1976 is approximate.

While trying to pull start it we observed a star in the sky which would become very bright and then dim again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute of watching this odd star it dimmed out and dissappeared.I got the machine started and we rode back towards home through the forest. As we reached the opposite side of the ballbark that we were crossing our machine quit again, no surprise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the other side of the field which was about 300 yards away the saucer shaped craft came up over the trees and proceeded to cross the field at an angle about 10 feet above the ground. It was silent, about the size of a large truck and had a ring of lights around the bottom. It also had two search lights which were also on the bottom spotting the ground independent of each other in the direction it was headed.  I would say that we were about 40 yards away at the closeest point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend kept repeating that she was  about to faint. I could not beleive I was actually witnessing a flying object.The object proceeded to the opposite tree line and went up and over and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course when we got back to the house since we were taking turns on the snowmobile everyone just laughed at us, but we knew what we saw.The next day we ran to the library and checked out some books with photos of UFO&#39;s. I still have one of them that I did not return.I remember this just like it was yesterday but until now havent thought much about writing anybody about it.<n>
11/15/76 20:00|Cambridge (Galt) (Canada)|ON|Formation|15 mins|Nov. 1976, straight line of 7 or 8 red balls travelling northward, absolutely silent, moving up and down, changing positions|2/5/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27421.html|10|ndxe197611| Nov. 1976, straight line of 7 or 8 red balls travelling northward, absolutely silent, moving up and down, changing positions<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just left a friends apt. and was warming up the car as it was cold, and my attention was drawn to a large chimney stack from a foundry nearby. Above the stack, and I believe some distance behind it, I saw two or three red lights. At first I thought it was an airport antenna, but then realized I had never seen one in that area, and I looked again, and noticed the position of the lights had changed, and they appeared to be coming toward my direction. I then saw about 4 more behind them, in a straight line, and still moving toward me. I tried hard to listen for the sound of an engine, or helicopter blades, but there was none. I ran to the intercom of the building, and yelled at my friends to get onto their balcony and look up in the sky toward the foundry. I then ran around the back of the building, below their balcony and pointed up to where the lights were. There were 7 or 8 red balls, moving silently, and quite slowly, (perhaps 2 or 3 miles per hour), some were moving up and down, some would &#34;fall back&#34; and the one behind would move ahead. They were not blinking, and again, I cannot stress enough, they were ABSOLUTELY SILENT. By now they were directly in front of us, and steadily moving past us in the sky.I have no idea how high up they were, but from a layman&#39;s visual standpoint, they looked a little smaller than a soccer ball (if I were to hold one in front of me). They proceeded toward a nearby lake and conservation area, and we jumped in the car and tried to &#34;follow&#34; them, however, they continued travelling (south west to north east), and disappeared over the horizon. We went back to my friend&#39;s apt. and called the radio station, and when we finally got through, the person answering the phone said &#34;Are you reporting the red lights in the sky?&#34; They  said their phone lines were &#34;lit up&#34; with people reporting them. I believe it was the following day on the local 6pm news (Kitchener Ont.) that the anchorman reported the lights had been reported from the southern US to northern Quebec. Also,  he ! said tha t a Regional Police Officer, or an OPP, had stopped his car and got out to look at them, but he claimed they were the Snowbird Jet Team, flying to some air show. However, they did not appear to be attatched together on any surface, but were definitely separate, and while &#34;interchanging&#34; their positions, almost touched each other. A couple of them would go up and seemingly wait (hover) until the ones below moved ahead far enough until they could drop into the middle of the formation, or at the back. Some of them seemed to &#34;circle&#34; backwards to change positions with each other. I have never reported these lights before, have never seen anything remotely similar (or anything disk shaped or otherwise unidentifiable in the skies), but when I looked at some of the reports listed on your site, I saw a pic or illustration of the red balls I saw, except the ones on your site are in a &#34;V&#34; formation, and these ones were not. I&#39;m certain the year was 1976, as I was borrowing my friend&#39;s car every evening so that I could attend trade school. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Object first sighted coming out of the east, then slowly descended into a large wooded area where we could see lights between trees. When object came overhead it was about 500&#39; to 750&#39; above ground. Glow of underneath lights (red, green,and white) highlited outline of object.We first observed object after exiting my home. After passing overhead to settle/land in woods nearby (300-400 yards west of home). Lights observed shining inside tree-line. We stood out in vacant field watching this yellow to white glow when we then noticed smaller twinkling white lights zig-zagging in and outside of the treeline. We ran back towards home when we observed strange person floating near creek, Time noted at home arrival- 7:30PM. Light source in treeline was seen for almost 2 weeks.

Additional witnesses were my wife ((name deleted)), tour guide ((name deleted)), and a taxi driver.  The day was sunny and the sky was clear of clouds.  The landscape was arid, barren and obscure of any vegetation.  I could view approximately 25-30 miles of horizen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The taxi was directly west of Tangier moving in an easterly direction.  I observed a bright, stationary light in the sky in the direction of the city.  The light appeared as a large conventional aircraft with running lights on and that would be flying directly towards you.  I asked the tour guide &#34;where is the airport?&#34;  He indicated to the right and south of our position.  I noticed that the light did not change in intensity or altitude as a descending/ascending plane would have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing the bright light for about one minute, I observed three silver disc move out from the light and stop.  They remained stationary for approximately 20-30 seconds before they maneuvered slightly outward and upward from the light.  They moved very rapidly, almost in formation, and became stationary.  Two additional sets of three silver disc moved out from the light and jockeyed around in different positions.  They moved rapidly to positions and became stationary, other than an occasional adjustment by singular discs but basically remained in sets of three disc per formation, comprising a total of nine disc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I approximated the size of the craft to be 30-35 feet in length and 6-8 feet high.  Their movements were basically smooth and in formation.  The first set of three disc moved slightly in their formation and I had the perception that they were playing or were ready for a &#34;drag race&#34;  After observing the entire formation of ten craft for approximately one minute, the first set of three disc took off at a very hight rate of speed towards the south.  They had covered approximately one-third of the 20-25 mile horizon, when the two other sets of three took off.  Nothing appeared to be any type of mirror reflections of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three sets of disc after taking-off were only visible for approximately 4 seconds before they moved out of my range of view to the south.  As soon as I lost sight of the flying disc, I looked back to the area of the lighted craft, expecting to see the light or a dark silouette like a plane would appear with its running lights off.  Nothing was visible.  The craft was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have a video camera, or camera.  Of course, this type of photo or video would be valid proof of aircraft technology far beyond public comprehension.  I would be a millionaire and very famous individual had I possessed cameras that day.  The vehicles traveled in excess of several thousands of miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired Navy Commander and have been in association with current technology that the military openly possessed.  These vehiles surpassed the military SR 71, F-16, stealth bomber, Aurora or any other fathomable aircraft that we could imagine.  The incident I observed in November 1976 might also correlate to the contact that the Iranian military pilot had in September 1976 in which a spherical disc came out of a light and circled the Iranian pilot prior to rapidly disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard that additional sightings may have occurred in Portugal and England during the fall of 1976.  I have nevery observed any military aircraft equal to the speed and maneuverability of what I saw that day.  I did relate this story to several military colleagues at my duty station in Rota, Spain but was not prompted to file any official report to any higher authority.<n>

At approximately 22:00hrs whilst leaving Auckland New Zealand by ship, I witnessed a very bright light rising from just above the sea up into the clouds.  As the object rose up the light became brighter and very large.  The ship was about fourteen miles off shore and the light about ten miles from the ship between the ship and the land.  The light became so bright that no man made object at that time could have been powered by batteries that would have given off that amount of light.  As I watched the light became smaller and I was aware that an object was moving towards the ship.  The object was circular and looked like the classic type of flying saucer depicted in magazines and was about eighty feet in diameter.  It flew up and along the port side the ship at a height of around one hundred feet.  It was grey in colour, I could see red, green and a yellow lights flashing in sequence anti-clockwise around the circumference of the disc.  The sea was calm there was no wind and no sound from the disc what so ever.  It flew at the same pace as the ship for around two minutes then turned to port (towards the north)  and moved away slowly at first then sped off at great speed.  I have never ever seen anything remotely like it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

First thought it was a plane but the object was moving left to right  stopped and reversed direction just like that. then just dissapeared. It was about 20 degrees off the horizon. I was about 14 at the time and knew I had seen something odd. It was over the town of Keego Harbor, Mi. This may not be the exact date but it was fall of 1976.

We lived in a typical residential development on a cul-de-sac.  While I was outside, I looked up because a spotlight caught my eye.  It was then that I saw searchlights being beamed onto housetops up the street - maybe about 6 or 7 houses away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there and stared because the lights were coming from this large, circular disk that seemed no more than 35-50 feet off the ground.  The disk was moving very, very slowly, if at all, as the searchlights beamed down upon each house.  I stood there somewhat shocked as I tried to make sense of what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the disk started coming closer to my house, I became frightened out moved from the cul-de-sac sidewalk to the front step of our house, where I could still clearly see the disk and the lights.  Then, suddenly, the disk took an abrupt 90 degree turn and totally vanished.  The thing was COMPLETELY silent, which was odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, I ran into the house to tell my parents, who clearly did not believe me, what I had seen.  I felt insulted and frustrated, of course, because what sane person would make up something like this?  I was an honor student, for heaven&#39;s sakes.  Well, the next day our sweet, elderly neighbors who lived across the circle from us were speaking with my mother and happened to share the same story, as they had seen it, too.  Obviously, I was happy to hear that others had seen it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was most puzzling was the absolute silence of the craft and its ability to simply make a left turn and vanish. I&#39;ll never forgot this, and while I can&#39;t say that I do or do not believe in extraterrestrial lifeforms, I know that what I saw was something inexplicably out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

THE 3 OF US WERE LOCKED INTO A MIND GRIP, I GUESS YOU CAN CALL IT, WITH A SPACE SHIP LITERALLY LESS THAN 50 FEET AWAY HOVERING ABOVE A TREE.  I WOULD GUESS IT WAS ABOUT 50 FT WIDE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AT THE TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS THERE FOR 5 MINUTES THAN LEFT, BUT YEARS LATER, I REALIZED THAT WHEN WE GOT THERE IT WAS LIGHT AND WHEN I LEFT IT WAS DARK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I WAS FROZEN SOLID PANICKING INSIDE MY MIND THEY WERE COMMUNICATING WITH ME.

11/1/76 16:00|Fujisawa (Kanagawa prefecture)(Japan)||Other|30 seconds|A big, black, round, & spinning UFO with a WAVY EDGE slowly moving across the sky in a straight line in Japan.|4/11/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108516.html|18|ndxe197611| A big, black, round, &amp; spinning UFO with a WAVY EDGE slowly moving across the sky in a straight line in Japan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was probably the fall of 1976.  I was 11 years old living in Japan by the Sagami bay in the city of Fujisawa in Kanagawa prefecture, about 10 minutes from the beach by walking.  (I am half Japanese, half American, currently living in America.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in the afternoon, probably around 16:00.  I was at the living room of my house, feeling dull.  I got the inclination to go to the back yard and breathe some fresh air.  So I did and looked up at the clear sky.  The UFO was slowing moving in a straight line in the direction of the ocean.  The direction was south west or south south west.  It was about 90 degrees above the ground (I looked right up at the sky).  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was pitch BLACK, no shine; a &#34;mat finish.&#34;   Its apparent size was that of a FULL MOON, so it was quite big.  The shape was unique and unusual.  It was like a dinner plate with a WAVY EDGE.  Imagine a sine wave with eight to ten cycles and make it into a circle/loop.  And the object was SPINNING fairly quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed it until I could no longer see it.  The timing of my sighting was impeccable.  I went to my back yard at the perfect moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In hindsight, I wonder if I was telepathically called me to come out of the house.  (Just a speculation.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
