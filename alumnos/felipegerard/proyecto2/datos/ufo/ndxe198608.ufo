I watched for maybe 10 seconds before it went vertical at speed I can&#39;t describe then horizontal and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The land that my granparents live on is an acreage close to an amish comunity with no crops or anything,just trees and grass.  There is a railroad that runs very close to the house and acreage.  When me my cousin and uncle arrived at the house aroud 10:00 or 10:30 pm we exited the car.  I was in the backseat on the drivers side.  My cousin was on the passenger side and ran into the house in a hurry to use the bathroom.  As i was shutting my door to the car an object dropped verticaly down above me and my uncle.  It had to of been moving at the speed of light and stopped on a dime.  The object spun around,paused for a second then shot back off into the sky as fast as it came. The object looked like it could have been a salelite or similar but not as bulky as ours.It was triangle shape with three red lights. The red lights were attached by what looked to be poles or bars. These bars joined together at looked to be a circular object in the upper mi! ddle that was maneuvering the satelite looking object.  I have only told but a few people because of all the false and fake reports in the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im reporting now because im getting older and its been bothering me.  Someone may have seen this also.  This is not a made up story or imaginary.  My uncle also seen it. He has since passed away. I hope someone else has seen this.  I put Eldon as the town but we were in the country not in town that was the closest town to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

8/20/86 02:00|Anchorage|AK|Disk|3 seconds|Three black saucer-shaped objects quickly take off from the woods.|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37133.html|3|ndxe198608| Three black saucer-shaped objects quickly take off from the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event ocurred when I was a kid, and I&#39;m unsure of the exact date.  I do know it was toward the end of summer vacation so it must&#39;ve been in mid to late August.  I was riding my bike up the street with my friend to my house and just when we reached the edge of my driveway, my friend yelled &#34;Look!&#34; and he pointed to the sky ahead of us.  I saw three black or dark gray saucer-shaped objects rapidly flying up at a roughly 45-degree angle, one right after another.  They looked like they had come from an area of woods north of my house that is now a neighborhood.  They were moving so fast and quickly disappeared in the clouds.  My friend and I were stunned because they definitely weren&#39;t airplanes.  They made no sound that I could notice.  My dad was right there in the driveway washing his car.  I asked him if he saw the objects, but he was looking down at the time.  The weird thing is that I had deja vu right at that moment.  I remember having a dream before where I asked my dad &#34;Did you see that?&#34; while he was washing the car.  Probably just a coincidence.  This was during a summer when UFO sightings were quite common in the Anchorage area.  There was even something about it on the local news and in the newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There are no Hotels and no lights on this area of the beach.  It was a clear night.  We were sitting on the beach looking out toward the ocean when my friend pointed out the light that were coming up the beach. 6 Balls of light.  All playing follow the leader.  The Balls were of different colors Blue, Green, Red, and Orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first 3 balls were the size of SOFTBALLS held at arms length. The last 3 were the size of a golf ball held at arms lenght.  We saw the Balls travel from the south going north follow the coast line. The Objects were about 200 Yards out over the surf.  The water was very calm that night and there was no breeze.  The Balls were casting no reflection on the water.  They were at most 100 feet above the water.  We heard no sound from the objects.Speed of objects above 100mph plus or minus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The six Balls passed by and went another 50 or son yards and went straight up. They traveld upwards for about 10 seconds and were gone.  About 1 minute later small red ball was seen travling at a HIGH rate of speed following the same path as the 6 before came by us, went up, and was gone.   Total time of sighting was about 3- 4 mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a LifeGuard on the Beach not far from were we saw these Objects.  My friend i meet that week on the beach.

I was facing north and he was facing south.  We were located between 11th and 12th street. I lived on 17th but on the same ave “B” as my friend. All of a sudden we heard a really, really faint breeze sound. I don’t know how we both heard it since it was so faint.    We both looked up and saw a traingle shape object moving northwest. It wasn’t very high in the air. I would say maybe a 1-1/2 neighborhood block up in the air. I couldn’t begin to tell you how big it was. It was made up of small faint lights. I don’t remember seeing the third part of the triangle. Just the “V” shape. It was made up of maybe 7 or 8 lights on each side.  We pretty much ran inside and told his parents what we saw and then came out later and did not see it again.  About 7 years later I was living in dallas and saw a show that Larry king was doing in area 52 with a bunch of UFO experts. He was broadcasting from the desert. I was really freaked out to see that one of the sightings that they were showing was an exact description of what I saw. Only in a different state.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember what it looked like that night in del Rio, like it was yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

I got out of bed and thats when he said there were strange lights in the sky.  He said he looked out of the kitchen window and saw some triangle shaped object with 2 red lights ascending up towards it.  So we got the binoculars and went outside.  There was a farmers field behind our backyard with a bunch of trees on the other side of the field.  Thats were we saw this pure white ball of light(roughly the size of two cars stacked on each other) which was moving slowly just above the tree tops.  I tried looking at it through my binoculars but I couldnt keep my hands steady enough to make out any detail.  We lost sight of it went behind a bunch of trees.  That was all we saw that night.  I dont remember what time of year it was but my guess is late summer.  I do vividly remember looking at the clock and seeing 11:55 pm after we came back inside.  Also I remember there was a big full moon which lighted the sky a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I stepped outside and observerd a triangle shaped large craft cross directly over me heading south. the craft was only 100 ft or so above me it was silent and made of a metalic substance. It moved from north to south accross my path at about a walking pace. and then i observed it on the top of my parents roof as it circled my town. for nearly one half hour. as it went over me i noticed 3 large circles of light at each corner of the trianlguler shape with small osolating lights which were olong all sides of the craft as a peramiter. it also had large bright search light simuler to head lights on what apperad to be the front of the craft facing out in the direction the craft was propelling. then after abserving this craft for a while through my binoculers I started to here a rumble in the distance heading in the direction of the craft. the craft made a sudden move the stoped the three large lights came together at the center of the craft got very bright and in a flash of light heading due east vanishied with a streak of light . a moment later i heard what appeared to be military jets then saw them as the flew over my town in the direction of the craft but i imagine never cought sight of the craft again as it was way to fast compared to our jets. as the exsightment was gone i left the rooftop and turned on my fathers scanner floods of reports were being iterceped by the local dispatcher and i herd him say it was a blimp !  ok  but the next day i spoke with several eye witnesess to the sighting and the reported to my the exact event conclution were not alone .. thankyou ((nickname deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was clearly visible for about one minute. It had 7 red lights in a circular formation. The lights were equally spaced from each other near the edge of the disk and recessed into something solid. The surface of the disk was not visible. I could see the stars in the sky behind the object but I could also clearly see that the lights were recessed in a solid surface. There was no reflection on any surface of the lights. The disk was turned on it&#39;s side with the axis (going through the middle of the disk) parallel to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disk moved exactly like a wheel being pushed across the ground because as the disk rotated at the same speed as the object moved forward. It also maintained a constant height above the ground, moving up as it approached and cleared a hill and then down as it went down the other side of the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed of the object was 5 or 6 MPH. The size was at least 60 feet across (from one edge of the disk to the other). The altitude was at least 60 feet. It easily cleared a group of 40-50 foot tall trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I describe it as a disk because that is all I could see of it but it might also have been a cylinder and I could only see one end of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no sound from the object and there was no visible exhaust or disturbance of the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen all manner of man made aircraft in the Seattle area from military helicopters to stealth and B1-B bombers. While I don&#39;t know the origin of the object I can say it had none of the chracteristics of any man made craft I have ever seen or heard of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My career is in software development.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I called the airport but was laughed at and I but it out of my mind for a number of years until 1995 when I finaly went to the police, I was interviewed by the Lt. as well as some one from your office.. I believe this was before you came to take over. Any way.. to stream line this.. it was a black object with a big red light on top that went slowly on and off while it moved.. when hovering it would cease all together and rotate a black and white checker board center while tilting left and right.. then it would level out and stop rotating the center and the red light would come on again. It did this for a long time.. this even has traumatized me and my mother for years. My mother is very religious.. she saw it first. My dad is retired Military but he wasn&#39;t home.. anyway I can draw images and maps if you are more intersted with this.. you may still have the recording from 1995. The guy said it was to old for a report.. but it is NOT in my mind.. it is burned in memory and I relive it alot.. I gues I have post traumatic stress from this.<n>
8/15/86 21:00|Banff National Park (Alberta, Canada)|AB|Diamond|10 seconds|LARGE Black Diamond shaped craft with three rotating lights on extended arms|12/20/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15517.html|10|ndxe198608| LARGE Black Diamond shaped craft with three rotating lights on extended arms<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been in denial for several years about this incident , but for the sake of informing others, I will share my report with all of you. Essentially I saw a black diamond shaped UFO that was the size of a football field (no kidding). I was so close that the detail of it will never leave my memory. I happened to be camping in Banff National park, and I was hiking in a glacier valley when I saw the craft. It had a marble type smooth black surface, with triangular geometric interconnections, which when attached togehter made up the large diamond/triangular shape craft. At the base or bottom of the craft were windows that were lighted up , and positioned in each corner of the triangular craft were three rotating lights (blue/red) which were attached to long extended arms. The craft was silent and seemed to move as such a low speed that it seemed I could probably outrun it. It sailed gracefully in the sky, like it was floating. I&#39;ve researched to see if others since have seen what I saw and &#34;yes&#34; , others have reported seeing the exact same thing locally and internationally (example Belgian UFO incident 1989). It&#39;s really hard to summarize in words what I saw, but believe me when I say, this was not from our known technology existing on Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The craft was flying ahead parallel to the car and once I saw the craft, it appeared to fall back and fly side by side, looked to be a one man triangle craft with dull blinking lights and was completely silent. No one else in the car saw it and appeared to be watching us for the duration of the drive on Dishman Mica Road (about 5 min). I looked away to tell my parents and looked back and saw the craft fly away slowly. It didn&#39;t look to be in a hurry, though I was able to make out a shape in the cockpit. I have never seen a craft fly so low and be so quiet. That is why my parents probably didn&#39;t notice it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this happened in the mid 80&#39;s while I was a kid, the whole family was in the car. The date above is very approximate. I&#39;m sure it was Fall because of how early darkness was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/15/86 13:30|Ogden|UT|Cigar|15 minutes|Early afternoon siting of cigar shapped object, August 1986, Pineview Reservour, Ogden Utah|12/14/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40945.html|12|ndxe198608| Early afternoon siting of cigar shapped object, August 1986, Pineview Reservour, Ogden Utah<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this afternoon I and my sister-in-law, who was about 17 years old at that time, were swimming at a local reservour, below the Wasatch Mountains. This place, later would also be used as one of the Olympic event sites. My siting occured almost directly across from what is now the Trapper&#39;s Loop by-way across the back of Mount Ogden. The road ends in a tee onto the main highway and there is a campground almost directly across the road from where Trapper&#39;s Loop comes down off the mountain. We were camping at this camp- site as we had for about 5 years as my ex-wife&#39;s Grandma lived just down Ogden Canyon from our yearly campsite. My ex-wife&#39;s mother, her husband, my sister-in-law and my ex and I would go up to this campground so they could go and visit Grandma more easily. At the time my ex-wife and I lived in Farmington, Utah and it just made things more simple to go camping so the women would have acess to Grandma. At approximately 1:30 pm on the afternoon of August 15, 1986 while sunbathing, I offered to go to our campsite to fetch something cold to drink. Where we were swimming was a converted boat ramp. Converted to swimming while Fish and Game had moved the boat launch down the shore a little way because of increased use by swimmers. The launch had origianlly been carved out of the bluff / canyon that Pineview Lake was claimed from. So, the ramp did about a 130&#39; semicircle down to the lake, with the campground up above about 20 to 30 feet. As i was going up this old launch ramp, back to get sodas, my head had just cleared the depression of the ramp and I could look out into the campground and across the highway to the foothills. These foothills are farms mostly, and grazing land that then just continue up as part of the backside of the Wasatch Range east of Ogden, Utah. Anyone familiar with northern Utah would know immediately where I am talking about, as Pineview Reservour is a major play place for fishing and boating. At any rate, as I was looking into the coumpground and across to the hills, which are no more than 250 yards away, I heard an explosion. Like to when a farmer is blowing stumps. And so thinking I had heard a farmer blowing stumps looked closely at the hills to see if I could spot  any flying dust and wood in the air. I was convinced it was a farmer blowing stumps. As I scanned the hill directly across the street a cigar shaped craft approxiately 100 feet long and possibly 30 feet thick,  that looked as burnished silver, but intensely bright even in the full August afternoon sunlight that Utah has at that time of summer, was just leaving the creast of the hill I was looking at. This object just seemed to appear in the sound. I was absouletly stunned. I said to myself, Oh my God there it is. I watched the craft glide perfectly silent, out over the valley floor no more than 500 feet away from me as it headed in an east direction toward the Trappist Abbey and towards Evanston Wyoming over the mountains east of the campground. About 5 minutes agfter spotting the object which was moving slower than any flying craft should be able too, I heard another very large boom and the craft seemed to shimmer, like when one sees a heat mirage. All around it the air moved like that and it picked up speed. Then it started to fly about as fast as a conventional helicopter, still headed due east. About 2 or 3 minutes later this object seemed to stretch out to basically over the horizon, like Star Trek&#39;s going to warp. It actually looked like a rubber band strtched out forever and in a huge explosive boom, this thing was gone. Booooom! Gone! Just like that. The perfection of the object is what struck me at the time. It was very litteraly, beautiful. The metal glowed without flaring sunlight off it&#39;s shell. I was in nuclear weapons during the cold war from 1971 through 1974 in Europe so this daylight event I have described was not and I mean not, the first time I had had daylight sightings. It was not the last sighting either. I have two sons who became avid skywatchers, also. it is truly interesting, Peter, that when people take the time to look at the sky, they will witness something inexplicable. Peter, I now live in Aberdeen and would like to help in your quest for disclosure and knowlege. I hope you sense that I am no crack pot and it has taken me many years to report this one event.  I have listened to you on the radio for years and have wondered if you could or if you actually would accept an offer of genuine concern and interest. I don&#39;t even know if you will see this report or if you want assistance. I have better things to do than have my motives questioned. So, if you need some certain help, I offer this to your endevour. Thanks for the forum.<n>

I was walley fishing with my grandfather on Malcom Lake Ontario Canada. There was a light breeze which drifted the boat between an island shoel and weed bed. Where we cast our lures hoping to land one. The moon light seemed to dance across the water.  Which soon became like a sheet of glass. The wind stopped and it became eriesomely quiet.  Sounds of water clapping the side of the boat stopped and off in the far distance, I heard sounds of a wiperwill and lune.  This soon faded to be replaced with silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing heard was each splash of our lures hitting the water followed by the turning sounds of the fishing real gears.  Then suddenly, a gust of wind and off in the distance about 1/4 of a mile away we saw an oval gray shaped object the length of a bus and about 16&#39;-18&#39; in depth huvvering approx 50&#39; above some tree tops along side the lake bank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I didn&#39;t believe what I was seeing. I looked at my grandfather for confirmation and he looked me in the eye straight back. I then said, do you see that?  He said, yeah.  I said, what the hell is that?.  He said, I don&#39;t know? I said, mabey its a cloud. He said, the tree tops are moving underneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sure enough, tree tops were moving beneath the object. They sway and swished back and forth in small circular patterns within a larger oval pattern beneath the object. Wind passed through the tree tops beneath the object. The object was oval in shape, black in color and huvvered motionless. The object was blacker than the night sky with a haze around it. Keep in mind it was a clear star, moon lit night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion, we got the hell out of there and back to camp.  Where we told the  camping party about what had happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

As he told to me look at it I asked if it were the International Space Station but we noticed it was too low and another one was coming behind it.  The objects were a reddish-orange color and looked like two fireballs.  Both objects were coming from the south and going towards the north.  They did not hover or fall from the sky but were flying in a direct path. We watched them both continue to fly until they disappeared behind the houses.<n>

I wrote down as much as I could remember back in 1986 and saved it. It was suggested by a local man who had been studying UFO phenomenon since the age of 13 that I write it down. This is only one entry I wrote in a Journal over a two month period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> August 2, 1986 I went camping overnight at Clarks Fork. It was at dusk when I noticed a small bright light directly above me, the sky had no stars out yet and this light was close and glowing. It is my 21st birthday and my boyfriend and I are going to go to Kennedy Meadows for a drink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is dark now approximately 9:30, we are driving toward the main hwy to go to Kennedys. We both see a very large bright glowing light up to my right of the car, just above the treeline. It is moving along as we do then over the mountain and it waits. It moves ahead the waits, then moves ahead then waits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now I am telling my boyfriend I do not want to go anywhere. I want to watch them.I can feel that they are here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are approaching the bridge at Clarks Fork I asked my boyfriend to park facing the object because it is in front of the car, low in the sky its very large and glowing. We watched it for what seemed forever. It is hovering there, moving to to the right then back in front of us. It is much larger than the one I have seen at home maybe because it is closer, like the night on the way back from Tahoe, really big and close.I asked them in my mind to come closer so I can see them then it comes closer then stops. I feel they do not think it is time. I don&#39;t know how I feel that, I just do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend actually agrees it is really a UFO, he sees the way it is moving. Now he believes me. While we have been watching, he noticed  a yellow one to our left side, not moving,glowing big just like the white one to our left side. Then the yellow one moves slowly away back toward the mountain as we decide to go back to the campground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They are both followed us. The yellow one stays more in back and the white one moves more in front. I am looking up and around to spot them. They are here, I am comfortable with that. As we went to sleep in our sleeping bags in the back of the truck, I am watching the white one up through the trees toward the Dardnells. The yellow one is behind us but still in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden a disk shaped craft with red lights all the way around moved past the white one circling, its spinning as it hovers horizontally across the tree tops; moved past the white one circling in the air. It has landed I believe, but it came from nowhere and went very low. God, there is no noise. Oh my god I can&#39;t believe it. It is round. I looked for it but it was gone I believe there are several crafts here, I feel the presence. I am to tired to stay awake. I hope they come see me tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a cup of water in a white styro foam cup and set it on the edge of the truck bed toward the cab and asked them in my mind to take it so I&#39;d know they were there. It was gone in the morning, nowhere in camp to be found anywhere. I never did have that drink and no alcohol this night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attended a MUFON meeting here in the area many years ago. One man wanted to put me under hypnosis, but I had lost time and been visited in my bedroom and felt scared, part of me still is afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do know that they meant me no harm because they kept me from panic, they stopped that physiologically in my body, but they used their minds to do it. Now I am ready to find out what happened all of those times. I have had sightings since the age of 8 or so and then visits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please contact me. Please, I am 39 going on 40 this year and I want to know finally.Thank you for your time.<n>

Why? becuase it happened in 1986 and I dont think the flying triangle was seen or reported at that time.. That didnt happen until 1989 over Belguim.. Similiar cases after 1989 have detailed wavy air or something seen coming out of the object.  In other words, this is one of the first. Michigans chapter of Mufon did investigate but know one claimed to have seen the object except for these two people.. I know for a fact that more people did see this object becuase they are the ones I heard it from.. One described to me a diamond shaped object that reminds me of the Cash Landrum case of the early 80&#39;s. In the Cash Landrum case it was reported that the victoms had burning and watery eyes caused by exteem levels of Untra Violet light.. Makes me wonder if the two people mentioned in the article below were exposed to the same kind of UV lighting..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the story of the Bankson Lake Triangle From the Kalamazoo Gazzete and featured in the newsletter page of banksonlake.org  Here are some highlights from the article that was put into the Kalamazoo Gizzette on September 1986  Not Everyone will believe John Long and fishing buddy Richard Jandura, story about the huge UFO they saw over Bankson Lake near Lawton on the evening of Aug. 1st 1986  Both witnesses eyes burned for days after watching the silent triangular object fly over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;It is a very credible report, Very credible,&#34; said Shirley Coyne of Flushing, director of MUFON&#39;s Michigan chapter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What the two fisherman claimed to have seen around 10:30 that clear night was a giant spacecraft about the size of Wings Stadium Long said . The object had a bright light in front and three red lights blinking on each side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft moved slowly from the southeast toward the northwest about 200 to 300 ft over the lake, the white light in front suddenly flashed brilliantly and went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several other fisherman on the lake, apparently none of them saw the UFO because it moved with absolute silence. The flash of light ws beamed toward the front of the craft, so it did not reflect off the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jandura heard a young boy on the shore yelling &#34;What is it?&#34; What is it?&#34; as the UFO traveled slowly across the lake for about 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the person who was yelling what is it? please feel free to contact me with what you saw, if you are out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft moved off in the direction of South Haven the two fisherman saw a wavy pattern in the air behind it, as though somekind of exhaust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Kalamazoo county airport was contacted and nothing unusual was reported on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that 30 minutes prior to this event a similiar objects was seen over Jamestown Ohio. Aproximately for 5 minutes. Earlier that day over Texas yet another stranged shaped object was spotted and reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I collect more information on this case including witness testimony I will update you through this submition form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ps it was nice talking to you today Mr. Davenport.. Thanks for listening ((name deleted)).<n>

He then stopped his truck and got out to see it just before where the powerline crossed the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He watched (from outside his truck) as the craft went over the road right in front of him.......I remember him telling me it was bigger than a 747 and going 10 to 20 mph.......(floating!) From what he said, he was only a 100 ft or so away, he saw it VERY CLEARLY!  He never told me about it until 10 years later when we just happened to be talking about UFOs, one thing about my brother, he doesn&#39;t lie or embellish stories! If he said he saw this, he did! I did know about the Bankson lake sighting, he told me it was on that same day. I am not sure how far Bankson lake is from Marcellus, but I think they are fairly near to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just thought I would share this, since I think the truth is about to be revealed to everyone............very soon&#34;)  aloha from Hawaii<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My friend had gone back to CA as we had rented a car and I lost the keys in the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I was alone and walking along Lake Powell.  A bald headed man attacked me.  He was trying to molest, or rape me.  He had me pinned down on the ground, half in the lake and half out.  I was looking up at the sky and saw what looked like two shooting stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the shooting stars did what shooting stars do, Shot across the sky and disappeared, but the other one seemed to land at the end of the lake.  At this time I was thinking it was an amphibious airplane.  It started coming towards us and I could hear the wind pick up and getting stronger at what looked like a big ball of fog was coming at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon the bald headed man got up.  He was scared and rocks were hitting his back.  He ran up the hill and yelled at me we better get out of here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at him and the ball of fog and decided I would rather go with the ball of fog.  So I started walking out into the water towards the ball of fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it just vanished.  Just instantly.  The water and wind calmed down and it was quiet again.  I did not know what to make of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not heard of many reports like this, but it seemed like it made a special trip down from the sky just to rescue me from this man.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is my one sighting.
