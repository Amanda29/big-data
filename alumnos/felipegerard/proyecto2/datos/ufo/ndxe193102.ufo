I went over a small hill and down to a draw that was about 25-30 feet deep.  I was heading South and I got to the middle of the draw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up to the west and I saw an elongated oval shaped flying machine in the air.  It was an aluminum color and a door that was transparent like a glass opened.  It looked like a doorway and a man appeared that looked human but was not as tall as a normal human.  He looked down at me and he had a uniform on that was darker than he was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back down because I was on a horse that stumbled quite a bit.  When I looked up again ASAP there was nothing there so they must have left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate, although the witness is almost certain the incident occurred in 1931.  We spoke with the witness at length, and he seemed to us to be exceptionally reliable and credible.  PD))<n>
