8/20/60 21:30|Pittsburgh|PA|Sphere|about 5min.|A white sphere 5-7 ft. in diameter was viewed by about 35 people going form a stationary position to high rate of speed.|5/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28676.html|2|ndxe196008| A white sphere 5-7 ft. in diameter was viewed by about 35 people going form a stationary position to high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a child (9 yrs. old)  I was playing with about 25 kids and 10 or so adults watchin over us on a late summer evening.  Suddenly one of the kids yells out: Wow, look at that.  As I turned to look at him, he was pointing towards the western night sky.  As I looked in the direction he was pointing, I saw what I initially thought was a full moon that was partially obscured by the corner of a house.  Maybe an odd site at night but nothing that unusual.  I turned back to look at the kid as everyone was moving in unison at this point. The kid re-asserted his position to &#34;look at that ball&#34;!  I and the group of assembled kids and adults,(mostly mothers) turned to look at this &#34;full moon&#34; again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only as we were looking directly at this object, it slowly moved behind the house and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now everyone takes off for the house, looking behind it and over the adjacent hillside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seeing nothing, everyone stood around processing what was it that we&#39;d just seen.  Summarily, some of the kids began throwing rocks over the hillside, presumably protecting the neighborhood from aliens.  After about two minutes of this discussion,  this object (a white sphere about 5-7 ft. in diameter) zipped from the hillside, right in front of all of us, moving up at about a 45 degree angle, making no noise at all, not even air displacement,  from south to north, then back north to south, south to north again, and finally north to south and off into the night leaving a trail much like a meteor would only this thing was moving up and was obviously under some form of intelligent control. The trail dissipated much like a meteor&#39;s trail would leaving the 35 or so people standing there in stunned silence momentarily. This sighting remains one of the more powerful and steady memories from my childhood and several of the people who witnessed this have over the years spoken about it as though it was a recent sighting.  I have since seen footage ( N.A.S.A) of objects that were seen while one of its craft was orbiting the moon I do believe during the Apollo program that look and moved exactly like what I saw that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At lunch time (20:30 hours) most of us shipfitters and welders would go to our main shop (Building 128) for lunch, card playing, naps or whatever we could do in only half an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the week after Echo I had been launched and was scheduled to be visible over the Los Angeles area.  I think it was Tuesday the 16th when lunch ended and one of the welders called for us out to the front (South side) of the shop to watch Echo I pass overhead.  It was a very clear night and was easily seen as a silver dot (about the size of a pencil lead held at arm&#39;s length).  It&#39;s orbit from West to East was easily tracked and we all felt thankful to have had an opportunity to see it on one of the few nights it would be seen in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night there were scattered clouds and as I left the shop building after lunch and walked toward Dry Dock 2 I looked up at the clouds and thought to myself, &#34;Much too cloudy to see Echo tonight&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then from above the clouds on a Southerly course I saw four crescent shaped objects &#34;flying&#34; in a reverse &#34;V&#34; formation.  Being crescent shaped and not too long after sunset I first surmised it was the sun (now over our horizon) that was reflecting off of some type of aircraft like the Vought V-173 &#34;Flying Pancake&#34;.  I could only see them for about 4 or 5 seconds before they disappeared above another cloud.  I tried to listen for a sound of aircraft engines but heard nothing except for the leaking air from low pressure air manifolds down in the Dry Dock.  If they were the Vought aircraft, I would certainly have heard their twin propeller engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked my glasses for dust, backed up and stepped forward again to see if they were a reflection of something on the ground off my glasses.  I did this for one or two minutes without being able to duplicate the apparent sighting.  In size, and if circular or &#34;saucer&#34; shaped with the reflecting sun on their West edges, they would be the size of a pencil eraser held at arm&#39;s length (as opposed to a pencil lead in my description of Echo I).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I mentioned this to a couple of my fellow workers they just laughed and said I&#39;ve been reading too many Science Fiction books (actually I was reading Harold Lamb&#39;s historical novels at that time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have modified an historical map of the shipyard (that no longer exists) that I reconstructed from old maps and aerial photos for a book I am writing on the history of the Shipyard, Naval Base and attached Naval Air Station.  In accordance with your instructions of electronically uploading images, I am emailing this map both as an insert and as an attachment for your study.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I transferred over to the Design Division 4 years later and eventually was the structural configuration manager of the 1980&#39;s reactivation of the Iowa Class Battleships I kept the story to myself - except with friends who like stories like that.  I retired in 1994 but did not decide to file an official report until now when I realized the accuracy of my shipyard map may be of value.<n>

After about 10 minutes the light began to make its way towards the zenith, but it didn&#39;t travel in a straight line and it moved relatively slowly.  It zigzagged from side to side as it moved upwards. Taking roughly 15 minutes to reach the zenith.  It then made a right angle turn and headed down towards the western horizon moving in the same back and forth manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 minutes it changed course and in a straight lined zoomed away from the planet.

My parents, brother and myself were outside in our back yard. Dad was painting the house. I looked up and saw a large cigar shapped object moving very slowly directly over us. We were looking up and directly underneath the object - from that angle it looked cigar shapped. It was grey/brown in color and had no windows and made no sound. We were trying to figure out what it was. We lived only 10 minutes from Newark International airport and we were very familiar with aircraft since our house was in a flight path. It was not a plane, helicopter of blimp. I ran into the house to get my camera to take a picture but unfortunatley I didn&#39;t have any film. I came back out of the house and the object passed over us and was heading towards the direction of Staten Island NY. It started to climb higher and suddenly with tremendous speed took off and in a few seconds was gone from our sight. There was never any sound upon acceleration of the object. It did have a trail of some type of light shinny dust or light behind it as it vanished. This happened a very long time ago but I can still see the object in my mind as though it happened yesterday. My family still talks about it. We thought that perhaps the military was experimenting. We watched the newspapers for an artilce about it but we didn&#39;t see any reports about the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I remember looking directly across from where I was standing on the hill and seeing an object there above the church steeple. It was a clear day with a bright blue sky. The object stayed there for about a minute, so I remember it well. It looked like two white dinner plates,one upside down on top of the other, which gave it a saucer-shape. As I was staring at it, the craft seemed to just fade out, as though it were moving away very rapidly, then it was gone. There were other children on the lawn whom I am quite sure saw it, too..but my memory isn&#39;t too clear on that. I DO remember our local paper reported some incidents of UFO sightings around that period of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I think that was in 1960 or earlier.  Up in the sky over one of the cloverleafs was a shiny metallic object much like a blimp but it had no gondola and at one tip was a circular area of air turbulence. I had heard from someone in college back in 1966 that a UFO had hovered over the PA turnpike on its opening day. The PA turnpike was a big event for the people of the region and the UFO  presence a few hundred feet up made it all the more noteworthy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We believe the Pennsylvania Turnpike was operational at least as early as the late 1950&#39;s, although it may have been formally dedicated at a later date.
