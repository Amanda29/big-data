It was 11:55pm (23:55) and we were getting ready to countdown the New Year. I was behind a bar making drinks when my friend said, &#34;You have to look at this&#34;.  So I got out of the bar area in his garage and everyone at the party in the backyard was looking up at the sky and trying to figure out what these 2 very bright dots were. They mentioned one was moving pretty fast and then just stopped.  When I went outside the 2 bright dots in the sky were just hovering in the same place.  I couldn&#39;t hear any sound from them.  They looked like a Roman Candle (firework that shots red fireballs) but very hi in the sky and were not moving.  Some of the girls at the party started to get freaked out because no one could make out what the bright lights were.  I first thought they could have been a helicopter but they seemed to be 5 times higher then any helicopter I have ever seen.  One of the lights seemed to blink a little but then stopped. I am very skeptical about UFO&#39;s and I started making a few jokes like, &#34;HOLY SH!T, its like Independence Day (Movie) and the aliens are going to blow us up!&#34;  After a couple minute, I actually started to get kind of weird about the situation because I couldn&#39;t think what the lights could have been.  About 1 minute before midnight, one of the lights slowly faded out and all of a sudden was gone.  Right at midnight the 2nd light disappeared.  It was very strange. This morning I woke up and went to www.signonsadiego.com to see if there might have been a story about it.  I typed in the search &#39;2 red lights in the sky&#39; and nothing came up.  So I did the same on yahoo.com and came across a news story from 2002 that started freaking me out a bit because it sounded kind of like our experience.  They had a link to this website and I noticed it had a &#39;report sighting&#39; so I thought I would add my comments.  I would have never known how to report this weird event to anyone except word of mouth to my friends.  Is there any way you could somehow look into this event?  I would love to see what it could have been.  I could round up most of the people at the party if needed.  I tried to take a photo from my cell phone but you can barely make out the 2 dots in the photo.  I am not sure if anyone else took a photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

12/31/04 23:15|Santiago (Chile)||Rectangle|10-15 minutes|Very bright red-orange "blinking" light in northern horizon (west of Pleiades) - brighter than Mars, two sightings, Santiago, Chile|1/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41329.html|3|ndxe200412| Very bright red-orange &#34;blinking&#34; light in northern horizon (west of Pleiades) - brighter than Mars, two sightings, Santiago, Chile<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about ten minutes, approximately 23:15 hours Santiago, Chile time (21:15 hours EST time)a very bright orange-red light, way too big to be a planet, and certainly not in the right place or time for Mars, at approximately half-way between the horizon and the Pleiades (but further west) stood still but shining on and off.  At first I thought it may have been related to early New Year&#39;s celebrations, but there were no noises, no fireworks at all.  I ran into the house to get my wife and three of my children.  All of them saw the strange sight, but did not give it much importance.  I ran into the house a second time to get my binoculars, and remained focused on the bright light for a few minutes.  The light then started moving for the first time, and disappeared, turning white.  Even my children could see it fading with the naked eye.  There is no way that this could have been a plane, or a satellite, or a helicopter.  It was stationary for too long, and then disappeared too fast, turning white as it faded.  This is the first time that I have seen such a strange object.  Despite being New Year&#39;s Eve, I have to add that I have not had a drop to drink, and neither have the rest of my family!  After I wrote the above, my children called me, just before midnight (Santiago time) to report that the light was back!  We all rushed outside, and just before the official midnight fireworks, there was the bright orange-red light again, in the same place!  At about 24:05 Santiago time (22:05 EST time), the red-orange light started fading again, turning white at the end, as before.  This was not in the place of the fireworks, and was completely unrelated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This lasted  almost 10 min. One looked like it began to fall.They disappeard. I had a sigaret and decided to go back. They were back and flew in formation making a circle horizontally then one vertically. The one to the left shot off at the most amazing speed, then reappeard. It looked like one object split and in some of the video footage there is other things as well. The 3 lights at the botton are street lights<n>

A slow moving bright orange cup shaped disk very clear and visible<n> <n><n> <n><n> At9.20pm on Friday 31 December 2004 we saw a  bright orange glowing large updisde down cup shapped object. Like the shape of an upside down tea cup on a saucer. Moved under clouds quite slowly and very low to us then darted up on an angle and then turned letf and headed straight upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was clearly visible for around 15 minutes. We took photos but strangly all photos on the film berfore the event turned out as did all the photos after but the five photos taken from different positions etc came out totally blank on white paper with just the date on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a pretty clear day. A few clouds in the sky, but pretty blue. As I was looking up I saw a disk-shaped (or oval) object high in the sky, glowing near one of the clouds. At first I thought it might be a plane (the O&#39;Hare airport is near here) but as I watched the object it faded, disapearred for a few moments and then reappeared in the same place. It glowed again, a very white bright light(roundish), slowly faded and then disappeared again. After the first time I saw it I had been trying to point it out to my husband. It reappeared for a third time in the same place and my husband and I watched it for a few seconds as it glowed and faded twice and then disappeared. We have been going over this, trying to be logical, but we are very familiar with seeing planes in the sky. As far as we could tell the object did not seem to have any type of wing structure or tail structure. It was silver or metallic. There was no fume trail (all of the other planes we saw had one). There were other planes in the sky at various heights, but they were still distinguishable(we could see wing and tail signs). This was not. We can not come up with any logical explanation other than this was a ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then my computer blinked off and so did my T.V. i thought there might have been a powercut. I went downstairs to check that all the power was out (which is was) so i went back upstairs and decided to go to bed. As i was getting undressed i heard a curious humming noise, that didn&#39;t sound like a plane. I leaned out of my window and saw it, a cone shaped flying object that had lights all over it. As it flew off all my power came back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The weather was fine.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was dark, but you could see the clouds were low.  I was in my backyard, just letting my dog through the gate when a bright light caught my eye.  It appeared to be a large orange glowing object.  It moved in straight lines across the sky, back and forth both hovering and desending.  It had gotten smaller by the time my husband came outside and I pointed it out to him.  He ran to get some binoculars and I watched the object move away and down, then it disappeared.  My husband tried to get a look at the object with the binoculars, but it had moved too far away.  At first I thought it might be a meteorite or worse yet some type of plane crash, but there was nothing on the news of any events of this nature.  This has to be the strangest thing that I have ever seen.  When my husband first came outside I said to him &#34;you see it too, don&#39;t you?&#34;.  If I had not seen it, I would not have believed it, so I have not told a lot of people about this.  My husband and I are both in our mid-40&#39;s, we are working professionals and were not under the influnence of alchol or drugs of any kind.  I have not visited this website before seeing this object and would not have if I hadn&#39;t seen whatever this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was a helicopter but there were no noise coming from the two lights. I got to a grocery store parked in the parking lot and took a close look at the lights.They were hovering in a small circular motion, one of them slowly moved around the other one, then they both started moving extremely slow towards the north. As I called the authorities, and all my family members, and told them to look outside and record with a camera if they have one.One of them disappeared then the other one, but before they disappeared they were flashing with a bright red to orange then to white and disappeared one after another. My brother in law caught the two objects in the sky on his camera but it wasn&#39;t a good recording of it, the camera didn&#39;t focus in well enough to get a clear recording.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a bright white light in the southern sky at about 40-45 degrees above the horizon--the same area where I saw it on Monday, 27 December 2004. The sky was not cloudy. The light looked as if the sun&#39;s light was being reflected off a metal object. Had it been night time, I would have thought it was the planet Venus, because that&#39;s what it looked like. I only saw it for about 30 seconds. About 1 minute later, I parked the car in the Sebring Square parking lot, got out of the car and looked for the object. I could not see anything in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time however, I saw a jet with a contrail flying northward about 20-30 degrees east of where I saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First I thought it was a plane because I live less than 5 miles from LAX.  As I observed the light for a moment, it was moving from the NW to the SW.  At about 06:02 it had passed my location, I did not see it when it had passed over because I was getting my binoculars out of my car.  When I observed the object through the binoculars, I could never hold them steady enough to make out any detail or to better define the shape of the light.  At about 06:04 the light was far in the SW sky and still traveling away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other Factors, I was able to make out the planet Saturn thru my binoculars, and the object I saw was much brighter. From my perspective, Saturn was to my South.  I recall seeing the International Space Station many years ago when its fly-by was mentioned on the news.  From my recollection, seems like the object that I was brighter that I remember it, but the object that I saw this morning was kind of on the same flight path that I recall the space station being on years ago.  So it could have been the space station.  Im located at N33 degrees 55 minutes by W118 deg 18 mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possible International Space Station Siteing<n> <n><n> <n><n> *** This is a correction to my posting.

At the time I was living with my parents, so my bedroom window was facing South. It was about 2:30, or so, in the morning. I was suddenly awaken by nothing in particular. What I mean is there was no sound, no light, no nothing that would have woken me up. It was only the overwhelming feeling of urgency. When I awoke nothing seemed out of the ordinary, although my gaze was immediately drawn toward the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon seemed very far away, further than normal, but very bright. As I stared at it, it seemed to move closer and closer. It turned into nothing but light, no longer a shape. The light filled my room, illuminating it with a light blue light. However, this light was unlike anything I had ever seen. It was very intense. I turned away and noticed everything in my room was also lit up. Then as soon as it happened, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was drawn away the same as it came, ending with just the full moon seeming very far away. It was as if it was trying to trick me. The next morning I thought that it had all been a dream, but when I looked around, all of my things were in the same place as when the initial incident happened.  This was all the proof that I needed. However, this was not all that I got.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nine months later I had my first daughter. I did have a boyfriend at the time, however we were not active. I was not aware that I was pregnant until I went in on the night of her birth. I only gained 15 pounds and had no signs or symptoms. I even had my menstrual cycle every month. She was born on October 4th. She was and still is extremely healthy. She is also very smart and a bit larger than most children her age. However, besides that she is pretty normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we were leaving her house one evening, I glanced up into the night sky and was startled to see a formation of square-paneled amber lights in the shape of the number 7 gliding swiftly and silently across the night sky. I immediately said something to my friend to look up and tell me what that was, but it moved too quickly and she did not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say it was shaped like the number 7, but I wonder if it was actually a triangular shaped object and the lit amber panels were making it appear to be in the shape of the number 7. However, there were also a couple of amber light panels in the middle left portion of the number 7, which makes it seem more like a distorted, backward capital F.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say it was gliding at about the altitude of a small private plane, though it looked to be as big as a city block.<n>

The object must have been 500 to 1000 feet above the ground. as we came closer we thought they where helicopters but there was two light which looked to be parallel to each other. one passed over and we thought it to be a double bladed helicopter. we stop and listen and there was no sound what so ever. So we thought it was alittle strang but drove on as we came in to the two itsself we saw another object which was the same as the other one which we have seen. this time I saw the shape of a triangle and about three lights on either side. it was moving slower then a plane and seemed slower movie then a helicopter, and this object also made no noise. after about 5 mins it flew off. Each object left in different directions. about ten minutes later my friend noticed three jets flying in the direction of the objects that we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly to my left just off the beach bout 100 yards a dark triangle shape craft flew by quickly! Looking Past the craft I could see two military fighters about a mile out keepig pace with craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was nothing I had seen in 20 years in the military! Ahead of me the coast took a jag to the west toward Mugu Rock this craft followed the coast line and as it did it turned it side exposing it top side. I could see no tail fin and no cock pit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft made no sound and I was very close! It scared the heck out of me because I thought it would crash but it did not. It came to Mugu Rock and very easily negotiated around it keeping the same distance away.Scared and curious at the same time I accerlated and got past the rock as fast as I could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once past the road was straight for a distance of a mile and so and I could see the air station clearly. no planes were seen in the air. I hurried down the road to where the road turned east and I could see down the road and too the city of Camarillo. no planes in sight.I kept searching the skies but saw no planes.It was a very unusal event. The only reason I am reporting it now is because some one else reported a similar incident in the same area 2 years prior(June 2002).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

THINKING IT WAS A STAR I PAID LITTLE ATTENTION BUT KEPT NOTICING IT. THEN AS I REALIZED IT WAS LOWER THAN THE CLOUDS AND STILL BRIGHT WITH IT BECOMING DAYLIGHT, I NOTICED IT WAS  IN A DIFFERENT POSITION. THEN THE BALL OF LIGHT MOVED STRAIGHT UP TOWARDS THE SKY VERY SLOW, THEN JUST DISAPPEARED AND WAS GONE. I SAT AND WATCHED FOR ABOUT 6 MINUTES IT MOVING UP. IT MAKES ME THINK MAYBE THE CAMOFLAUGE THEMSELVES LIKE STARS THINKING THE NORMAL HUMAN WOULDN&#39;T TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then, I noticed it move.  There was an irregular pattern to its movement, sort of up and down in a zig-zag motion at times and at the same time, for the hour to hour and twenty minutes I watched it, continually moving from left to right across the sky.  My best guess is that this was somewhere over Constant Friendship or Bel Air.  I was thoroughly intrigued by this light,  I knew it was not an airplane or helicopter.  I live in Havre de Grace and everyone in Harford County is familiar with Aberdeen Proving Ground, and we are even more familiar with their aircraft and flight plans.  Also in the time I observed this I counted about 4-5 planes go by in that direction.   I could assume these were planes passing because they all had the flashing red or red and green lights, as well as, they seemed to maintain a constant rate of speed.  Whereas, this object I saw moved at a snails pace or just seemed to stop right where it was at times.  Unfortunately, I have a small forest out back and this object fell out of my sight through these trees.  I would have liked to have seen it dart off at some amazing rate of speed, that would have confirmed it for me, and likened my story to those I have seen on television.  However, all I have is a &#34;dancing star&#34; moving very slowly across the night&#39;s horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a bright white light in the southern sky at about 40-45 degrees above the horizon. The sky was not cloudy. The light looked as if the sun&#39;s light was being reflected off a metal object. Had it been night time, I would have thought it was the planet Venus, because that&#39;s what it looked like. I only saw it for about 30 seconds. About 3-4 minutes later, I parked the car in the Fairmount Cinema Square parking lot, got out of the car and looked for the object. I could not see anything in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This highway connects Bend with eastern Oregon (Burns) and western Idaho.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my state vehicle, turned off the lights and the engine, stepped outside and stood on the shoulder of the highway.

Then all of a sudden in the background, I seen a Red Light that seemed to appear from behind the house in back of me (past my lot).  It didnt come from that house, but a fair distance away.  The red light rose at a pretty fast pace (but not extremely fast) almost a perfect line, but wiggled a little bit from side to side (not drastic).  It looked like it left a small trail from its path, but it was snowing out, so cant say for certain.  Then all of a sudden it stopped in mid air for a second, then it was gone.  I didnt see it after that second, because I turned around to open the door and yell to my parents.  It left In my words a red circle where it did stop for around i would say 10 seconds then the red circle &#34;Trail&#34; disapated.  I thought after scrutenizing my sighting that it might have been a firework, or maybe a flare.  We do have a small airport where we are, but not near the direction where I was looking (North).  It did not make a sound, no explosion, nothing like a firework makes.  And if I remember, aeronatical flares stay lit for much longer than what I have seen.  It was very spooky!  I had goose bumps all over my body.  If anybody seen this light at the same time I did, leave a post.  It might have been a flare, but it didnt &#34;Feel&#34; like one.  And it definetly wasnt a small airplane, no flashing lights, no noise and it was much to bright.  Any information regarding this sighting would be very useful and put me at ease.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light that I was observing was in the to teh southeast, but it continued to hold my attention because of the intensity of the light and it seemed to change from a white to blueish to green hued light. I thought it may be a aircraft due to the intensity of the light.I arrived at my parents house and remained visiting for approx a half hour, when I was going to leave I noticed the light was in the exact location as when I arrived. I knew it could not be a aircraft as it had remained stationary in the sky. I asked both my father and mother to take a look at the light to see if they had any idea as to what it may be. It was then that I remembered that in early August of 2003 we had a observed a similiar light in teh sky in the exact location and had reported it to our local sheriff department becasue through the binoculars it seemed to be a spining object with red, blue &amp; green lights that remained in the same spot before abruptly disappearing. My father and I observed the object through 10x binoculars, at this time we observed an object that seemed to spin (as if a conical shape - imaging a short, fat ice cream cone on it&#39;s side) with every color of teh rainbow being emmitted from the circular end. With your naked eye you could continue to observe colors changing, but only in hues of red to blue to green. We then called a friend who lives on the outskirts of Green Lake, he also saw it to teh southeast, slighlty abov ethe horizon and observed teh similar movement and colors that we did through his spotting scope. I then departed my parents home and proceded to a my boyfriends home between Green Lake and Markesan, WI. I watched the object remain stationary in the sky the entire drive and it continued to change colors. At this time, my boyfriend and his nephew and I sat on a hill and continued to view it through binoculars at 10x. The object continued to spin and emit colors from the circular side. At this time we also noticed 4 planes flying from west to east (at a very fast speed) within very close proximity to each other. They seemed to fly right in front of the object, though the object seemed to be quite further into the atmosphere. At about 9:30 we stopped watching the object. Several of our neighbors have reported of seeing the same object until 10 pm at night. No matter what it may be. it was definetly an experience I will never forget. If anyone else has seen this object, please share your experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The movement of these objects seemed like a flock or birds but it accured to me that it could not be as they were traveling way to fast across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to move in front and back of each other till they disappered in less than 5 the most 6 seconds.  They object were wider apart at the begining and moved closer to each other as they travelled south.  Almost a brownish orange in colour not to bright but noticeably with the eye with little strain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was amazed of how fast it was travelling and if i had to pick the exact location I would have to say it travelled between the Orion and Tarus consetallion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope someone could shed some light to what I saw! Ther where no sounds or aircrafts in the area<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the sky was dark at the time of the sighting, as I suspect it must have been, it is possible that the witness may have observed three birds, probably migratory birds, flying rapidly across the sky.  I, too, have been startled, momentarily, when first witnessing birds flying rapidly through the night sky.  The lighter colored feathers reflect illumination from the ground, giving an observer on the ground the impression that a peculiar object is streaking across the sky, when in fact, the birds may be much closer than the witness perceives to be the case.  That is just a guess, a possible explanation for the sighting.  We may well be wrong about the nature of the event.  PD))<n>

A silvery, whiteish colored cylinder rounded on both ends flying north to south, thought it was a jet banking as there were no wings visible. It didn&#39;t come out of a bank and continued to fly due south, from the rear before the tree&#39;s blocked the view it just looked like a round ball. While I am pondering what I had just seen another craft just like it followed the same path and at the same speed. My impression was that they were about the same length as a 747 but about three times the diameter, flying at about 15000 ft. somewhere between 200-400 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the sky for a while after that, was able to make out wings or tailfins on jets I saw even when they were at altitudes high enough to leave a short contrail, also could hear the jet sounds of all the jets I watched even the one flying south with the wind. The ufo&#39;s left no contrail and made no sound that I could hear. If they are a new blimp, cudo&#39;s to US, very fast for a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I could see a dark aura , sort of pointed, above and below craft, may have been an illusion as I hadn&#39;t been looking at the sky before the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

12/26/04 04:00|North Little Rock|AR|Other|~1 - 2 hours|I remember being dropped off into my house.  I was so exhausted when I "fell" into my bed.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42284.html|43|ndxe200412| I remember being dropped off into my house.  I was so exhausted when I &#34;fell&#34; into my bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my best friend after this happened.  I truly do not know how much time had passed before telling her. I feel like the time has just gone in my head.  After I told her, I wrote it in my journal on Dec. 26, 2004.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is my entry:<n> <n><n> <n><n> I truly believe I was abducted by aliens  a couple of weeks ago.  I don&#39;t remember what day it was but I did have to go to work.  (I work Mon- Fri).  My &#34;dreams&#34; of my house were too vivid to be dreams; something happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember standing at the patio door looking up.  The ship was huge with 2, 3 or 4 big lights.  I remember a red and a white light.  I knew I was looking at the back.  But, instead of seeing my backyard, there was a field with 2 cars.  I think the one closest to me was a red convertible with the top down.  There was a woman leaning against the car.  I think she had dark curly hair to her shoulder.  Darker than mine and softer curls.  I think there was 1 or 2 men sitting in the car drinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These details are too vivid and too memorable to be a dream.  The ship was a very strong material; gunmetal grey in color.  (Here I drew the picture of what I saw).  Backend - what I saw, the house blocked the rest of the ship.  (I was looking up).  The clencher is that I was jolted &#34;awake&#34; (in bed).  I turned over and the clock read 5:26 am.  I felt like I had just gotten in bed and I was exhausted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t want to have to get up and go to work.  I turned on to my left side and my first thought was that I&#39;d need to get checked out for any implants.  I tried to find something on the internet to tell my story but didn&#39;t find anything in that short time.  I told [my best friend] last night and she doesn&#39;t think I&#39;m crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I wrote it, I wrote things going on in my life before and after.  There was no break.  Also, I remember when I wrote this how calm I became.  To clarify how I saw the ship, I have two sliding glass doors going outside.  I have to open both of them.  I remember seeing everything in the den as it is right now (not like a dream where everything is distorted or made up) and I was standing in the house, at the first door, with both open, in my, probably, nightgown that night.  I was looking up and if I had stepped out and jumped up, I could have touched the ship it was that close.  I have metal awnings but that night, it was like they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because the ship was so close, and the view I had, that&#39;s why I could only see the back.  It was like I was being dropped off.  I didn&#39;t feel strange or funny or have any weird things.  (Supernatural things do happen to me at night but as long as I pray,  it helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now wear a St. Michael the Archangel medal that was blessed by the Pope and pray to him each night also and that has helped tremendously).  To clarify being exhausted.  Have you ever gone out one night and partied and got drunk (not too drunk but enough to know you&#39;re drunk) and you came in at 4 or 5 or 6 am?  Then, you throw yourself in bed and you&#39;re asleep before you&#39;ve stopped moving?  That&#39;s what I felt like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had gone to bed the night before, as usual, but when I was jolted awake, I looked at the clock (see above) and literally felt like I had been dropped into my bed and that I had not gotten any sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best friend is the only one I told about this because I&#39;m too scared to talk to anyone else.  Maybe I watch too many tv shows and movies but I have not spoken to anyone about this.  I&#39;ve thought long and hard and I wanted to report this but I don&#39;t want anything bad to happen to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the Peter Jennings show tonight on ABC and you were mentioned at the end, with no contact information but I wrote down your name and was able to google it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve considered being hypnotized to dig deeper but I don&#39;t want to be alone when it happens to avoid any muddying.  I hope in some way that you do take me seriously and can help me to come to terms with what has happened to me.  I will state now that I don&#39;t party, I don&#39;t get drunk, I don&#39;t do drugs, I don&#39;t take any special Rx medications.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

They hovered over the lake which created a slight swirling motion in the water.  They rotated there for about 20 min. before slowing to a dead stop after the ufo was completely stopped it shot about 1000 feet into the air and continued the swirling motion.  After, a thunderous bang causing car alarms to whistle loudly in the nights calm air.  Neighbors stormed out of their suburb homes to see the object for only a sort time before they vanashed into the nights darkness...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The 2 triangles started to move slowly toward the constellation of Orion.  The 2 triangles somehow burst into several 4.0 magnitude stars that did not stop, but sort of floated near the belt of Orion.  I watched for about 5 minutes, then felt terrified and felt like I needed to be in the house.  I went in to the computer to check the Heavens Above website to see if there were any satellites in the area.  They moved slower than a satellite, and hovered, which I have never seen a satellite do.  After I checked the computer, I went outside (about 5 minutes had elapsed) and the area was completely socked in with cloud cover.  It was partly cloudy at the time of observation, making a precise report impossible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seem to be the same object I had seen maybe two years earlier on studebaker rd in long beach around 12 midnight.  Ever since the first sighting ive been keeping my eyes open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I made the turn I saw the UFO and it was flying low and was extremely quiet/ hovering over some homes, some 40 feet in the air maybe higher. As I was heading east on stearns the object was parrallel to me and was heading west. I noticed there were no cars around, so i slammed on my brakes turned off my radio and rolled down the window. I heard no sound coming from the object and since there was no traffic I made a quick U turn. As soon as i made the U turn (now heading west) I was trying to intersect it to make sure it was the same object i had seen before but as I hit clark st. The object made a quick 80 to 90 degree turn and just disappeared. My vision was blocked by some trees and as I was on the corner of stearns and clark the object just vanished. It seemed like it knew what i was doing. This area is near the long beach airport and I know for a fact that this is not a place to do testing of military planes. Ive never called the l.b airport or authorities since I know they wont do anything about it but it was a triangular shaped object, black, it had some lights on each corner of the triangle and was extremely silent. This happen to be the second time i saw this object in the same area. The first time i saw this object was about 2002-2003 at around midnight Iam not to certain of the date. I was staring into the nights sky and was driving south on studebaker when all of a sudden i noticed the object dropping altitude rapidly. I figured it was a plane since the airport of long beach is so close. As the object dropped i slowed down.Since there was no traffic i completely stopped my car in the middle of the road and another vehicle traveling beside me was also slowed down but kept on going. I a stared at the object it must of been close enough to me that i could of gotten out of my car and hit it with a baseball. As I sat in my car with the windows down and looking up at the object which had to be hovering was going so slow and there was NO sound whatsoever coming out of this object. I could clearly see the details of the triangular object. It had lights on the tips of the triangle and was extremely silent.As it kept heading towards me by the time it hovered over my car for a brief couple of seconds it made a 45 degree turn and started going towards the residential homes. Thats when i made the same turn in my car trying to follow it but as I made the turn the object took off over the homes at a very very fast speed. Something a plane cant do. As i made the turn west I hit a school with a tall fence which I jumped out of my car and climbed the fence so i could get a better close view of it,I also did it just to make sure i wasnt going crazy but all i saw was the back end of object hovering over the homes at a high rate of speed and it vanished. Once again i didnt call the authorities since i didnt want to cause any problems for myself.<n>

I observed what seemed to be an object with a haze of lights moving in from the west. The closer the lights came the more it became brighter and more hazey. Once the object was at it&#39;s closest point my wife mentioned that she thought it was egg shaped, and made the comment,&#34; It is strange, isn&#39;t it!&#34;. The object appeared to shift off to the NW and headed off at an even speed, not too fast but with no sound and moving a bit faster than planes I&#39;ve witnessed at night. I managed to shoot about 6 digital shots seeming we were headed to a Xmas gathering and I had my digital camera. After I took the shots the object continued to the NW. Not sure what I saw. I can&#39;t really trust a digital camera in lowlight with no flash, but, I&#39;ll submit a few pics anyway. The pictures are interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was a little freaked out and got up and reached my hand to her to help her but she was dazed from the light. The light sooned went infront of me and i became dizzy and fell on the ground as if paralyzed. I then saw a unfamiliar alienotic face in the light. I soon passed out and woke up in the middle of the night at the same place we were at, my girlfriend by my side. I woke her up and we panicked and i drove her home, when we got to her house her mother was freaking out becuase we were missing for 3 days. We explained our situation but she didn&#39;t believe us and sent me home. I went home and tried to tell my parents but they didn&#39;t listen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had the glare of the sun, it was initially in the shape of a sun 2/3 exposed above the horizon.  However, the truncated flat bottom was above the horizon.  The object changed shape to something resembling a bowler hat, the a disk with a dome, and then quickly went to a small point of light (one hundredth the size) and disappeared.  It was definitely some way in the distance, 15-20 miles is a guess.  The only thing I could compare it to (after a distant &#34;sun), was the type of flame emmitted from an oil refinery.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It then began moving across the sky northward until it was out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was too high to be an airplane and it moved quite fast and looked simply like a star moving across the sky but very fast. It was solid white like a star, no blinking lights. It maintined the same altitude when moving, this was not a falling star. There was also no trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I surely don&#39;t know if this was a space craft or a craft of any sort but it was an Unidentified Flying Object, thus this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Didn&#39;t know about your site until seeing the Peter Jennings report.<n>

When we first saw it, the location from where we were positioned was at about 2:00 position in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But a number of factors observed quickly ruled out a jet plane: 1). the entire bottom side of the body and wings glowed a faint orange color, 2) there were no strobes (the flashing green and red lights at the wingtips, and 3) the altitude appeared well over 70,000 feet, and 4) the speed, the object traveled across the entire sky in about 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to resemble a space shuttle return to earth due to the shape of the craft, the orange glow, the altitude, and the speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I rolled window down and shut car off to listen closely for a Engine of a small airplane but there was no noise being emitted from the craft as it slowy turned to the North East and no flashing Nav/ Beacon lights as is required for A/C flying at Night. we watched it and the light just quit completely without any trace!??

As I was walking out heading southeast in the yard, I noticed in the direct southeast what looked like at first sight to be a star falling 90° down to the earth. It fell in one to three seconds. It was antifreeze green maybe blue green. I distinctly noticed and mentally noted at that moment that there was no trail. I have seen large meteors and small ones; they had trails. I always look up because I am an amateur astronomer and photographer.  This object was about the size of a -1 magnitude star; about the size of Venus on a good night, but it was blue green. The other thing I noticed that was interesting was that the moon was nearly full and the sky was cloudless. The night sky was very bright because the moon was high in the sky. This object that I observed was about 40° high in the sky when I first noticed it. I am in southern Ohio and it would put this object over Africa or maybe the Indian Ocean or somewhere abouts in this region based on what I know about where the moon is when it rises in the east. It can be directly over Africa and be hanging in the lower eastern sky in Ohio.  The moon was about 60° high to the east of this object in the east. I also remembered hearing on the a.m. radio of an asteroid scheduled to hit the earth but later discovered it was for the year 2029. I also heard something about this asteroid being so large that if it hit the ocean, it would cause a tsunami. So, I thought, if I hear of a tsunami on Christmas Day then it was an asteroid perhaps. I obviously got the 2029 asteroid and tsunami confused with what I thought was a prediction for an asteroid this week. Anyway, this is what I saw and it is my duty to report this siting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, I thought it was a helicopter but when I went to look closer,I saw a classic saucer,gun-metal black, but I could see it clearly because a beam of light was coming down from the center of it.  It hovered there for 45 seconds or so, then it moved slowly east.  I could red lights around it. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was the brightest  I have ever seen.<n>

In the car was my mother; we were on our way to visit my grandparents for the holidays.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking due east down the highway I spotted a large white light about 45-60 degrees above the horizon. I was pointing out to my mother that it sure seemed awfully bright for a star. It wasn&#39;t much bigger than a star but it was much brighter. At first I thought it might be a hovering helicopter with a searchlight (although no other lights were flashing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after I pointed it out to her it streaked towards the ground like a shooting star. It left a streak as it fell. My fears of a helicopter crashing suddenly evaporated when the light stopped at the horizon.  I have no clue how high it was due to its distance away from us. We were continually closing on it but we never got close enough to see anything other than lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Miffed at the speed of the fall and the sudden stop, I still was trying to figure out how a plane or a helicopter could have recovered from such a quick descent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly it streaked horizontally from in front of us to 90 degrees from the front of the car on the drivers side door. It seemed to hover over a tree line across a field off the highway. Suddenly the bright white light went out and a smaller red and blue light alternated on and off for a few seconds. Then the white light came back on brighter than before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole time I was trying to watch and drive at the same time as my mother watched from my right. I eventually had to stop watching as I was having to look back at this point. It was still there the last time I looked. Never moving but just hovering over the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a CAD/CAM Administrator and have never seen a UFO before (although I believe in them). My mother is a hairdresser and she fully admits that she whitnessed the whole event as well. The relatives later that night were not as amused.<n>

It had been snowing a little earlier and probably will again tonight from the looks of it, although it was not snowing during the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother was driving and I was in the passenger seat. We were near Wendy&#39;s restaraunt when I saw what seemed to be a large, orangish-red orb of light just below the clouds in the southern sky perhaps a few miles away. It was really bright and I immediately pointed it out to my mother. She wondered at it, too. However, within maybe 5 seconds it vanished, perhaps overtaken by the thick clouds. I searched the sky for several seconds, hoping it would reappear, but it didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving our car with our son in the back and my wife in the passenger side. We were travelling down Treadway Blvd headed north getting ready to turn at a light onto south 7th street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife had said something and about that time I looked up.  Granted we were near the airport, but as an avid aircraft fan, I know a plane and chopper when I see them.  This wasn&#39;t either.  It was oval in shape and just sat there in one spot.  It was so shiny that you really couldn&#39;t look directly at it because of the sun glinting off of it.  From what I could see there were at least three lights situated around the top and a black thin line through the middle as if there were a line of windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to my wife and asked her what the thing was, and when she looked she said she didn&#39;t see anything.  I looked back, and it was gone.  there was no way of knowing which direction or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it hadn&#39;t been for ABC&#39;s show, I wouldn&#39;t have known about this.  My wife keeps laughing at me saying I have lost it.  Hopefully there are more people in this area that saw this.  It makes me feel so alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Traveling East on Hwy 34 at approximately Malvern IA, I witnessed what at first appeared to be a shooting star in my peripheral vision. My eyes followed it and at approximately 25 degrees from the horizon it suddenly stopped and shot upward at about 45 degrees and then disappeared. Though I don&#39;t really believe in UFOs I can&#39;t possibly imagine what kind of aircraft would produce this type of flight. P.S. It had a red light upon its flight path upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was one block away from my house when I saw the all too familiar Boomerang Formation floating across the night sky slowly, and silently.  The shape shifted from a Y formation, to a classic Chevron shape as it passed by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to &#34;follow&#34; the formation, but after a block or two it disappeared from my vision.  Total time aproximately 15 Seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back home to wake my wife, who has witnessed these formations several times since November 18, 2001. However, she was fast asleep, so I went out with my video camera and stood across the street in a local park where there is no light.  I scanned the sky to see if more formations would occur.  Almost as expected, within minutes another Formation appeared, it was coming from the South, and heading North West. In all my sightings, they always come from the same direction.  I suspect that I might live in the flight path of something.  The craft appear to be very high in altitude and very difficult for my video camera to capture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation was a V formation that floated across the sky silently.  The moon was bright and after about 15 seconds I lost site of the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited a few minutes to see if more would pass by, then I came inside to write this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I used to live northwest of the reporters location closer to downtown, and could still hear it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The neighbor who clued me in to this was an employee of AA.

What he had seen was lights in the sky, unlike stars or plane lights but 3 flashes each one directly below the other and very quickly; as one went off the next came on, each one on for the duration of about 0.1 seconds. The lights were white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is also a possibility that it landed as my brother could not see below the houses in-front of him; the lights went down vertically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

It was definitely an engine noise. We went outside to see what it was, and saw a formation of lights hovering some distance away. The lights were not in any pattern that we had seen on an aircraft before. There were three visible lights: reddish-orange, blue, and strobing bright white. The white light appeared to be &#34;towed&#34; by the other lights. It was hard to make out any shape of the body of the thing. It hovered for a few minutes and then moved very rapidly southeast. The noise continued to get louder as it came overhead, then got quieter as it moved away. The object stopped suddenly and hovered again for a short amount of time. It then shot off southeast again. Each time it moved it moved extremely smoothly and quickly. When it hovered, it seemed to stay perfectly still. The weather was cloudy with very little wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM MR. TOM BOWDEN, STATE DIRECTOR OF MUFON/OREGON))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Probably helicopter or ultralight aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a follow-up of a report previously submitted. Based on the information given in the report, it is probable that the witnesses saw and heard some sort of helicopter, ultra-light aircraft, or experimental aircraft.  The presence of a loud engine noise similar to a helicopter motor strongly suggests this explanation. I would be glad to investigate further if the witnesses have more information to add to the initial report, or if they feel strongly that this explanation does not fit the profile of the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

The first pair consisted of 3 cigar shaped object were flying in and out of the  the clouds. They seemed to be a little bigger than 747 from that distance. The discribed objects had same size and same shape (this was proven when the picture of one of the objects was moved on top of the other ones which completely covered the other ones). These objects were flying near Vancouver International airport and over south vancouver near UBC. There were two pictures taken one 2 minutes before and another one 2 minutes after the sighting has occured and in none of these pictures there is any object of that sort visible. The next pair are moving over downtown vancouver. they are more like the cigar shaped object sighted in Iraq. After close look, there are some curved lines visible around each object.These lines seem to be related to the propulsion system of the objects. these objects were high above the clouds so there was a good chance for them to be above 6,000 feet. This second group was visible from above 6,000 feet, so they should a significant size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the six objects were clearly in some sort of formation and they were going oppossit way, first pair to the south east and the second pair to the north west. There pictures avalible on request. During this sighting, there was no flight show of any kind and the cigar shaped objects were dangarously close to each other flying on top a populated area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The odd part was that I could not see them when I looked directly toward them. They appeared to be moving very quickly and changed directions often, staying in the area directly in front of our home. It was not raining where the objects were spotted, as the rain was still over the mountains at the back of the photos. I was able to record them on several photographs. I&#39;ve ruled out any lens flares, as there was no direct light hitting the camera, and there was no water on the lens. I&#39;ve taken several thousand photos with this camera and have never seen any thing like this before. At a friend’s suggestion, I&#39;m reporting them to see if anyone can explain what the objects might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is in computer science from University of Baltimore, I&#39;ve worked in research and development and academic computing most of my life. I&#39;m currently consulting for several companies here on St. Croix and I&#39;ll be teaching a computer class at the University of the Virgin Islands in the fall. Basically, I am pretty much a skeptic of anything that can&#39;t be explained by science and I’ve done my best to explain what these lights could be. However, I&#39;m at a loss to explain what I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It loked as if it had perhaps entered the atmosphere.  The head was colorful, purple and green.  The tail was yellowish like a &#34;normal&#34; shooting star.  I exclaimed my amazement, and my husband looked up in time to see the tail end of the streak.  I came home and checked the news to see if anything had crashed, but apparently not.

Looking east over the ocean, about midway between the clear night sky and the ocean was this satalite shapped thing that glowed a bright gold color. It blinked on and off a few times.  Then it went real dim, like it was powering down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then three (3) round shaped bright gold colored objects came out of the bottom.

It was following the hill that was located behind our house,then stopped and began to hover over a field on the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked to the area carrying flashlights to find our way through the woods.  When we got to the field, we saw tht the light was above the treeline on the other side, and was fairly large.  We signalled the light with our flashlights and to our amazement, the light reacted by flashing, then changing shapes (pyramid,star,square-as if it was some kind of laser-light show).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it returned to its circular shape and began to glow in a purple light, until the whole field was glowing purple also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed what appeared to be some kind of entities coming out of the top of the globe, and they were gesturing at us with their arms. Then one came out of the globe completly and floated down until it stood in front of us.  It was shaped like a human, but was made completely of the purple light-like a hologram-and had no facial features, fingers on its hands, and wore a long robe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to communicate with it to no avail, so I reached out my hand in a friendly gesture, and the being reached its hand out and put it on mine.  I felt no pressure on my hand, no feeling of a presence at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then noticed these four red blinking lights appear around the field, surrounding the field on each side.  One moved to the large  glowing purple globe then back to its position.  I had glanced up to see these lights and when I looked back at the being in front of me it was gone.  Apparently I had a lapse of memory once I touched the creatures hand, because I learned later from my nephew that the entity had floated back to the globe once the red light moved out of its position. I do not remember this happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the being of purple light was gone we began to get very cold, and got a strange feeling of paranoia, like there was something else in the filed with us that we could not see.  So we went home rather quickly at this point. We found our dog hiding in the woods, it had ran off when the being floated down from the globe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this  incident to MUFON, who sent mr hartinger from RUFOS and two other guys, to interview us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident was also published in the MUFON journal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else ever had contact with this type of entity?

We documented this event via camcorder for approx. 1 hour 30 mins.  The largest ufo appeared yellowish in color around the perimeter and had a redish center.  The two smaller ufo&#39;s where mainly red in color and were only visible for a 10 min period. The objects often moved and changed shapes and sizes.  The larger ufo at times resembled the moon, other times it would appear to break apart into multi objects and other times it appeared to rotate into the shape of a half moon.  This sighting was clearly the most out of this world my family has ever had.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

12/21/04 00:05|North Miami|FL|Oval|90 seconds|I have never seen anything that could move that quick and make a 90 degree turn, then  go backwards!!|1/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41208.html|88|ndxe200412| I have never seen anything that could move that quick and make a 90 degree turn, then  go backwards!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was monday night football, 4th quarter, like a min to go, so I went outside to smoke a ciggarette.  I have to smoke outside since my wife is 7 months pregnant.  She was in the bedroom waiting for me to come to bed.  So as usual, I went out to my back yard to have a smoke.  I always look up at the stars, just an old habit I quess, from when I was younger looking for shooting stars.  Anyway, I noticed a bird like shape gliding north, swaying a little left, swaying a little right, just like a bird.  I was surprised I was able to see it, but with clear skys and a bright moon, I figured the bird was white and it was just a reflection from the moon.  Well, thats when i relized that it passed above a high altitude cload.  It took my brain a second to realize that there was no way i would be able to see a bird that high in the sky at night.  So i wacthed with more attention.  Thats when the object changed speed and moved in the same direction at a much highher speed.  I basically was thinking a plane since I live about 15 miles from MIA, and thats when the object made a left turn (west) 90 degree turn, at a speed that is not possible, at least in my head.  I was very confused.  I was looking right at it, it must of been way up there, and it seemed to have light, not blinking, but going from dim to brighter and back in a slow duration.  And then it went backwards just as quick, made another turn, and continued north up the coast till i could not see it anymore.  I could not believe the way it was moving slow, then would move so fast, then slow again, then the high speed 90 degree turn.  Anyway, I have never claimed to see a UFO before. I have always looked up, seen high altitutde planes, satilittes, and other things, but nothing that could move and change direction like that.  I just could not come up with any other answer.  I came in side, told my wife, and went to sleep with one eye open, scared for the first time as an adult.  I am 32, professional.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned N onto my home street and realizedther were actually 5 stars all of a magnitude as large or larger than those of Orion  and positioned below and curving up and to the left of Orion, These &#34;stars&#34; were never there before and were not moving. The upper star was smaller and they increased in magnitude as they got to the horizon as they are just &#34;rising&#34; now. I don&#39;t know what they are but they look like 5 ships coming in for a landing. Go out and look at them<n>
12/20/04 20:00|Indianapolis|IN|Disk|one hour|Drove directly underneath a UFO in Indianapolis, saw the underside and inside of the UFO.|2/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41742.html|90|ndxe200412| Drove directly underneath a UFO in Indianapolis, saw the underside and inside of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were driving cross country from Missouri.  We drove over a hill on I-70 and saw 2 lights in the sky.  We were both immediately drawn to them, and we assumed that it was just a plane.  I commented on the size of the plane considering how far apart the lights were.  We kept watching it and realized that it was not moving.  My friend said that it must be an airplane tower, but as we kept driving we realized that it was directly over the highway and it was not moving.  All we saw was two lights until we were directly in front of it when we realized that it was a ufo.  It was very flat and cylindric and sort of a gray color.  We were both mesmorized by it and everything seemed to just stand still.  The entire trip it had been very windy and the car was knocked around a lot but for the time that we were driving underneath this the wind stopped, there didn&#39;t seem to be any weather or temperature.  Neither of us were even paying attention to driving, we were just staring upward at this ship.  As we entered the middle of it it went up into a dome.  There was a flashing red light at the center of the dome, and I don&#39;t remember anything after that until we were a few miles away.  We then noticed that there were a lot of lights in the sky and we could still see the ufo in the air behind us.  THe new lights turned out to be a swarm of army helicopters that were all formed together throughout the sky all headed toward the ufo.  I watched the ufo sit there, and then all of a sudden shoot up directly into the sky.  It zoomed around the sky for a while shooting back and forth, almost like it was messing with the helicopters.  It would come right back down to being 200 feet off the ground right behind our car and then it would shoot back up in the air.  We then pulled over and got a hotel room once the ufo vanished for good, but for and hour afterward we saw the apache helicopters in the sky in the same place the ufo was.  There were alot of police officers out also that night zooming down the highway in the same place the ufo was.  My friend had his window down when we went underneath it and when we arrived at the hotel we noticed that he had what looked like a bruise on his face and we were both nauseaus and had very bad migraines.  We took blood tests to test for radiation poisoning and both were inconclusive.  My friend didn&#39;t sleep for 3 days after this happened.  Also the same night that we saw it we heard very unnatural things in the air all night, sounds that we have never heard before and things that we can&#39;t explain.  The next day my friend and I checked our cell phones to see what time this had occured, since we had made several phone calls and received several in that hour timeframe, and found that our cell phone call list had been deleted.  The calls made before 7pm were still in there and the calls made after 10pm were in there, but the calls during that time were not even in the record.  Also 1/2 tank of gas was gone for some reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/20/04 20:00|Fairbanks|AK|Unknown|About 15-30 Minutes|A Cluster of Fixed White Lights Hovering Over Fairbanks Alaska is Seen From Wal~Mart.|10/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46986.html|91|ndxe200412| A Cluster of Fixed White Lights Hovering Over Fairbanks Alaska is Seen From Wal~Mart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Memory is fuzzy.  However, I think it was about 5 - 8 PM after work, sometime between December 2004 to January 2005.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just finished work at Wal~Mart and myself and another coworker were warming up our vehicles getting them ready to leave for home.  We both noticed a cluster of white balls of light in the sky to the South of us.  We conversed a little bit about it and concluded that it must have been an Airplane coming in to the Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our location is at the East end of Airport Way.  The Airport runway is at the West end of Airport Way.  We assumed that it was an Airplane preparing to land coming in from the East.  It was moving slowly.  The Lights seemed Fixed.  In other words, if a person were to measure the distances between the lights during the 15 - 30 minute period I observed the phenomenon they would have stayed at a constant in relation to each other.  So the cluster of lights seemed to be from one solid structure.  There was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a crystal clear night with temperatures well below freezing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we determined it was an Airplane I got in my car and drove home.  My home was to the south so I was able to watch it as I drove home.  At the time I arrived at my appartment I went inside and then went out onto the balkcony.  The object was still there and had not moved as fast as I would believe an airplane would coming into the Airport.  I began to realise that it was not an airplane.  It was just moving to slow for it to keep itself up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a short period of time and further concluded that it was something conventional that I was not used to.  Having some understanding of Government, Military, and Area 51 Research I thought it was of no concern of mine and that even if it was a UFO it would only be another video tape of Balls of light against a Night Sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did notice that it seemed to be larger than a Conventionsl Airline Aircraft.  However, there were too many variables to make any opinion of what it was.  But there was definitely something there, whether it be conventional or non conventional air or  space craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later my coworker agreed that he thought it was a UFO and not an Air Craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

12/20/04 18:00|Salome|AZ|Circle|five minutes|Three motionless orange lights appear, disappear, then reappear above Salome, Arizona.|1/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41207.html|92|ndxe200412| Three motionless orange lights appear, disappear, then reappear above Salome, Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were traveling northeast on highway 60 near Salome, Arizona around 6:00 PM PT when we were startled by two very bright orange lights in the sky ahead of us.  They appeared to be the size of half-moons and they were about a half-finger length apart from each other (as we saw them) along a horizontal plane.  We immediately noted that numerous stars were visible in the sky and that that there were very few clouds.  We also noted that there were no mountains in our line of sight.  We concluded that these two lights were clearly in the sky and not, for example, car lights coming down a mountain in front of us.  About five seconds after these two lights appeared, a third similarly sized light appeared above the one on the left.  The three lights remained motionless for about five seconds, then all three disappeared at the same time.  We continued to watch the sky as we traveled.  About two minutes later, the three lights appeared again in the same L-shaped configuration, although this time they were lower in the horizon and they had moved to the east.  They remained illumined for only about five seconds this time and then disappeared again.  The lights from two small planes were visible in the sky near the second sighting and the three unexplained lights seemingly dwarfed the lights from the planes.  I recalled seeing a documentary on the Phoenix lights of 1997 and after reviewing pictures of this event online, I would say that the lights themselves which we saw closely resembled the so-called Phoenix lights, although they remained motionless while lit and they formed an L-shape rather than a horizontal line.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was outside looking up at the south west sky and the moon&#39;s light could be seen shining through the clouds.  then all of a sudden, it appeared that a streak of lightning struck the earth not too far away (not too close either).  I assumed it struck the earth, but there was a small garage obstructing my view of the ground.  The flash of light was blue and looked very similar to lightning, it just seemed to go straight down.  it didn&#39;t look like a perfectly straight line either, it was sorta jagged, similar to what lightning would look like.  There was absolutely no sound associated with the blue lightning and the flash was less than 1 second.  It didn&#39;t illuminate the sky either.  it was absolutely not a meteor, comet, shooting star, plane, helicopter, mars, pluto or venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I first sighted the object it looked like a bright white star, at very high altitude, and was motionless.  Then it started moving at a steady speed which appeared to be slow, and then stopped and remained motionless again for a couple minutes.  It then proceeded to continue on its course when another craft, which looked much smaller and at a higher altitude traveling in a direction toward the first observed craft at a much higher speed, intersected with it and continued on its course until it disappeared. At this point another object that was egg shaped and wingless with no contrail was sighted coming from the south going in a direction towards the first sighted object it did not appear to be chasing the first object or even related to it, the main aspect I noticed was the absence of wings. (Over Santa Monica there is a lot of conventional aircraft traffic and it is easy to see wings even on very high altitude aircrafts).  The first craft&#39;s flight path consisted of a huge triangle pattern over the skies, covering almost the entire field of view:  the first leg of the flight path was the high altitude part in a northerly direction; it had almost traveled out of the field of view when it came to a stop for about five to ten minutes, then changed direction and came back toward us in a southwest path, lowering its altitude, moving slow, getting brighter and bigger until we could observe it as  a delta shaped object with constant rotation; a martini glass shape would best describe it (without the stem), with one side of the triangle being rounded and the other two sides coming to a point.  While observing the object at this lower altitude and rotation another dot of light object could be seen closing on it and intersecting with it, after which the main craft hovered a while and then started heading northeast, eventually traveling out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded exceptionally credible to us.

After setting up decoys for the morning hunt I sat down in the blind to get my shells and gloves out. It was clear this morning so I was looking at the stars. Directly to the west of me was what looked like a star but it was a yellowish color and the light refracted different on the water, then it moved. At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me but it began moving faster in random directions, up, down, side to side but it always came back to the same general area.I was freaked out and by my self without a camera and knew no one would beleive me. My hunting buddy was supposed to show up at anytime and I kept hoping it would hang around for him to see and it did. I watched it for a good 45 min before he showed up then we watched it another 30 before it was daylight. It was definalty NOT an airplane. I would have given anything for a camcorder this morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed.

This light was what I believed to be a star but was only several hundred feet above the mountains. I watched this light for a while as it changed colors from Green, to Red, to Blue. I believed it to be from X-mas light reflection, but then I noticed the light would move quickly from right to left. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me so I got up to see what it was and if it was windy outside. No wind and the sky was bright like a full moon. When I noticed that the light could not be from X-Mas lights or anything imaginable I took out my binoculars and noticed the light was bright white and moving in a circular motion vertically and would shift from right to left hundreds of feet and stop. Occasionally a bright white light would reflect off the mountains below this light lighting up the entire top of the mountains. I watched this light for about 20 minutes then woke my wife to see what I was watching. Within five minutes of this the light dimmed into a glow and suddenly disappeared.  The next morning at about the same time I looked out the window for the same star or light, and there was nothing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Husband&#39;s name deleted))  At around 5:25 a.m. on Sat. the 18th, 2004 my husband woke me up and told me he wanted me to see something.  We went into the family room to the sliding door and kneeled down on the floor.  Outside above the mountains, what seemed to be south and several hundred feet away, was a huge star.  This star was larger than any star I had ever seen and seemed to sit not far above the mountains.  The sky seemed to be well lit and it changed from white to blue and then green.  My husband was trying to focus the binoculars for me, and as I continued to watch it, all of the sudden the light turned off and there was a faint glow of light in the sky and it was gone in the blink of an eye.  It was gone by 5:30.  The next night and morning I couldn’t sleep and was looking outside every hour for the same thing to happen.  There was nothing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Wife&#39;s name deleted))<n>

However we were in bed watching it with the lights out and it caught my eye. Then we proceeded to watch it for 45 mins until it ent out of view as it was moving with the star contstellation as mentioned. The ufo was moving eratically, a rythmn was hard to determine but smaller pins of light were evidently working with the main star shooting towards and away from it like a worker bee. The main star also formed a halo of light around it that built up of about 2 seconds then the halo would shoot out like a ripple in a pond. The experience was profound and has left us both very excited, they were without doubt using the star constellation as a disguise so not to attract too much atention. This moved far to eratically and quickly for a plane, heicopter, satallite - this was definate magnetic kind of movement as if being dragged along by a magnetic force. It was amazing!<n>

I could only watch it for around 10 seconds before it passed over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft was black or gray, with no lights at all and only visible due to the slight reflection of city lights on the underside. I could just make out circular patterns on the underside of the craft, one large ring or circle in the middle and smaller circles at each corner.  I estimate each of the  three equal sides were around 100 feet in length. The black craft was very low, just over the trees, making no noise that I could hear. The first thing that occured to me when I saw the black triangle was that it was man made, some sort of top secret black stealth.  There are air bases, NASA, Lockheed Martin and government agencies dotted around the Northern Virginia and Washington DC area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can understand why a black stealth would fly low, to evade radar, but why would a top secret aircraft fly or hover over a city so early in the evening while people are out and about?  This black triangle looks more advanced than any man made aircraft I&#39;ve seen before, perhaps the fact that it looks alien provides a cover in itself.  How many witnesses of the black triangle would risk telling others about their sighting?  The risk of losing credibility from a black triangle sighting will keep many quiet, others may get labeled as UFO weirdos, perhaps the government is counting on this as part of the Black Stealth&#39;s cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

She says she was looking out her window which faced a field behind her house. There is around an acre of land between her and the tree line where the object was seen. She states that she saw an object just above the tree line. It was like a triangle standing with the point facing up. She first thought it looked like a pyramid but it was only three sided. In the center of the object was a white light. The object looked all white. She does not know if this was due the center light or if the object was really white. On the three corners were red and green flashing lights. She says this object moved very slowly and began to rise up higher as it went out of view heading from the East going to the Northwest. It made no noise. The object was in sight for about five minutes. She said that the object was about the size of your thumb at arms length which would have made this object very large.

While going east to west in Binghamton, I was watching what appeared to be a twin engine military transport type plane make circles over the valley by Broome Community College, and Otsiningo Park by the Binghamton/Port Dickinson line.  It was spewing thick black exhasut only intermitantly as it flew.  To note&#34; the plane was only 1000 ft above the city.  After about 10-15 minutes of this, it flew off towards the NW over Endwell and Maine, NY. This is becoming a frquent occurance. The plane is usually grey with no symbols, tail color, or numbers on it.  Once it was seen as white with an orange tail.  I find these colors to be very peculiar.  About a year and a half ago, I saw this plane do the same thing even lower over the city.  It was a warm day, and I had the window open.  It was spewing out the same thick smoke.  After a little while, I started to have throat iratation, and sinus pain.  Very unusal for me.  Is anyone else seeing this? Please let the world know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, this plane comes around whenever there is UFO activity in the area like Bainbridge and Vestal in the last month.  Also, when this plane is around, there are no other aircraft in the sky, and Binghamton is 5 miles from a regularly used airport that services major cities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

There were a few cirrus clouds and mostly sunny. The object appeared to be moving North and I was gaining on it slightly. Then it started to turn slowly towards the West then South West and crossed over the interstate in front of me. I looked closely for wings but never spotted any even while it was turning. The sun reflected off the object. It finally came to a complete stop to my left. I stopped my car and watched it for several minutes. Finally, it started moving again in a South-South Western direction as if it were headed towards the mountains of GA. It took the object only about 20 seconds to go from it&#39;s stopped position to a small dot in the sky. I can only speculate at the distance. From where I was standing/driving the object appeared to be the size of my pinky fingernail. It was long and slinder but slightly oval. Clearly not a plane (no wings), not a balloon (too slinder and metalic-like). It had almost a chrome finish. I heard no sounds. It didn&#39;t change color only reflected the sunlight. No flashing lights. It traveled away until it became almost to difficult to find in the sky. The object left no trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upon looking out my window to the west, I saw a bright randomly flashing object that was moving jaggedly about in a southward direction.  I have never seen flight like this.  In reality, looking at least 10 miles to the west, I don&#39;t think what I heard (the low-pitch) was what I saw.  However, this thing flew like an insect on speed.  It bobbed and weaved about, extremely rapidly, within a small radius, while travelling wherever it was headed.  I am a logical person, and the fact that the flashes were extremely bright for how far it seemed away and totally random (not timed like a commercial plane light), plus the fact that it was rapidly darting about (again constantly darting within a small area of space- the movement was part of this thing&#39;s flight pattern) leads me to believe it was not from this world, at least to my knowledge.  I&#39;ve heard of hovering, and rapid speeds, but this things was rapid within a short space of area, not darting expansive distances.  It was beyond weird, and I would&#39;ve woken my family had it not been 4:30 in the morning.  Also, in a big city like Philadelphia (I live in the suburbs 10 miles away), you&#39;d have to expect these things would not want to be seen, hence, they would probably only show themselves at very stategically planned times- such as 4:30 when most people are asleep, or not yet awoken.  I know what I saw, I may&#39;ve been tired, but I know what I saw.  And what I saw cannot be defined as a space craft from this world, at least to the layperson&#39;s knowledge.  This was energy, raw energy I presume from the random flashes and hectic darting pattern.  This thing was out of this world, I am pretty sure of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just outside Headland I saw a very large, very bright white light directly overhead.  For lack of a better description, it was like a strobe light but was not flashing.  It was constant and as I got closer it was so bright that it was painful to look at it (I was trying to see exactly where it was coming from).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear, cool evening with no cloud cover and there were no street lights, businesses or billboard advertising signs in the immediate area (my first guesses).  I slowed down to about 10 mph and looked for something that would give me some idea of what it was (I was afraid to stop and get out of the car).  I saw what appeared to be the an outline of dark metal (black or dark gray) several yards forward of the light which was still bright and non-flashing.  I opened all of the windows on my SUV and heard no sound other than my vehicle&#39;s engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;object&#34; appeared to be approximately 100 feet above the highway and must have been huge as I was never able to see anything more than the outline on one side.  My guess is that it was either triangular or chevron in shape and appeared to be moving south very slowly.  There were no other lights besides the white one.  I observed this &#34;object&#34; for approximately 15 minutes before I decided to continue heading north and watched it in my rear view mirror, until it was just a faint glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was almost 40 at the time and have never seen anything like this in my life. I like to believe there is a logical explanation for just about everything but have not been able to explain this one.  When I came home a couple days later I asked around to see if there had been anything on the local news or in the paper about anything strange that weekend and nobody had heard anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have reported this immediately but had no idea where to go that I wouldn&#39;t be thought of as &#34;nuts&#34;.  I recently found this site by clicking on a link in an unrelated story and after reading some of the other accounts here thought I would share this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was similar to the pinkish orange of Mars and much larger even at Mars closest point.  It radiated a kind of glow.  I watched it for about 4 or so minutes and it never moved (I had it between 2 wires for placement).  All of a sudden it went up like the opposite of a shooting star! Now this was a very clear night. I could see tons of stars and planes (there was a lot of air traffic).  I am very familiar with the flight path as I am out back every night I am in town.  This object was low to the ground and about 15 -20 degrees east of due north.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had no lights , made no sound and was travelling at a speed about 100-150 mph at about 200 feet over head . There is an airport that has planes taking off and that come in my direction and I know what they look like , there are also birds that fly around here and I know what they look like , but neither looked like the object I had seen . The only reason I took a second look at this object was because this object took a turn that was maybe a 30 - 40 degree change in direction without slowing down or missing a beat ( no curve ) . The object seemed to be following hwy 97 going south .<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
12/15/04 17:00|Montego Bay (Jamaica)||Circle|10 mins|Possible UFO sighting in Jamaica|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66858.html|131|ndxe200412| Possible UFO sighting in Jamaica<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well this happened about four (4) years ago when I was walk home from church. I believe there was some form of Christmas Celebration being held and I attend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I remember that I was walking home on a particular street where I could straight down into the town, as that was direction in which I was heading.  I remember seeing the very huge thing (well this is only word I can use to describe it) with a lot of what seem to be Christmas lights covering it, I was stunned at sighting this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I thought it was a ship.......... but then I realized that it couldn&#39;t be because it was in the sky and the Sea was way too far away for to it be reflecting clearly.  It moved real slow and I was beginning to get even scared, as I could not figured out what it is,  I looked behind me to see if anyone else was on the street and witnessing what I&#39;m seeing but there was no one.  I then kept looking at it....... I know this may sound silly but at one point I though it was Santa Clause as it was the Christmas season and the object was covered with colourful lights.  One thing I can tell you for sure is that whatever it was it was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my entire life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked closer to the town area I notice that it was disappearing and it was then time I realized that It really could not be any normal transportation.  I even started walking very fast amazed at what I&#39;ve seen, with a bit of smile and fear on my face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I reached home I told my family, but we just ignored it cause it is not sometime we believe in, especially in Jamaica.  However deep inside I always knew I witness something abnormal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I decided to share this is because I was just idling online and I found myself after four (4) years of this event reading up on Aliens and UFO&#39;s.  Then I came across this case where the man who saw the UFO and even touch it was badly burned.  Well what stroked me was when he described the colourful lights in the space ship, just like or similar to what I saw.  I&#39;m just here ! wondering how can they be so high tech as UFO sightings go way back to the 1940’s or 1960’s I believe, and if they are really visiting what do they want.......... do they live in those big ships and stuff like that.........<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I first noticed it about 2-3 miles away while I was traveling 55 mph in my vehicle while going to work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was about a mile away I noticed that it had no curves like you would expect a balloon (blimp) to have and the ends were squared off.  It was of a rectangular shape.  I never got close enough to get under it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It maintained an altitude of approx 1000 ft. The altitude, speed and direction were all consistent and I could not notice any deviation in any axis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a camera in my bag on the passenger seat next to me and I wanted to take a picture of it but I was unable to do so-weird I know but I just couldn’t do it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Physical Description: The length was in excess of 500 ft (2-C-5 type transport aircraft parked end to end)  The height was in excess of 120 ft.  Since I retired from the USAF 5 years ago and have worked on many kinds of fighter, cargo and high performance reconnaissance aircraft, I sort of know what to look for in aircraft and below are my observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The exterior was more rectangular shape with minor angled variances along the sides. The exterior composition had the appearance of sandy gray concrete. There were areas along the sides that that had several rectangular colored red and some orange areas. I specifically looked for any type of letters, symbols or markings which would indicate anything of significance and there were none. No windows, ports, hatches, panel lines or discoloration of surface could be made out from my closest approach (2,000 ft) were noticed.  No external pods, antennas i.e. long-wire, Radar-dish, directional, panel mounted, loop, adf, blade, towel-rack or anything that resembled an antenna was noticed. No engines or propulsion system of any kind were noticed nor any noise of any kind.  No electrical interference on my car AM radio was noted either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness suggests that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Can not express distance because of the dense moisture field at the lower levels, but think it was distant.Was not an aircraft as the brilliance was not a reflection from the sun and did not have have an apparent movemement. Had little time to observe, but as a meteorologist, I alwaws look up and can descern movement. Am not a ufo type, but have observed one other visual anomaly here.The brilliance was of another color of the sun, wave length, definitely was not a reflection of an aircraft, extremely white. Was very,very bright. Suggest you query the USAF Radar at this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could not make it out untill it got over the town and caught light reflection off the townn and i could see the shape. It apeared to be triangle but disc shaped on the bottom.  Soon after it sped off, only to be followed quickly by another. Then, about 30 seconds later, another.  About 10 min after that, a strange onrange boject moved across the sky, not very far before dissapearing.  Very odd, even for this area. Also no lights or sounds from  the objects. Also the next day, could be completely unaffilated, my car died 3 times in the area.<n>

In my humble opinion<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded quite serious-minded to us.  PD))<n>

I opened the balcony window and looked into the clear night&#39;s sky.  Within seconds I noticed an amber glowing flying formation floating across the sky heading north west, towards the Direction of the Stanford University Dish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called for my wife who watched with me as this formations shape changed ever so slightly from a v-shaped into a straight line, and back into a v shaped formation.  The formation was made of several &#34;dots&#34;, they could have all been part of 1 craft or perhaps they were each an individual craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately ran for my Sony Digital Night Shot video camera and ran outside in the freezing night and attempted to catch the craft on video.  My wife followed as we watched several more formations &#34;float&#34; across the sky.  Each formation was made up several &#34;dots&#34; and all had a white/amber glow and resemble flocks of flying geese.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise, and each formation was visible for aproximately 10-15 seconds before going out of view.    Each formation seemed to be followed by a smaller formation right behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to film and am reviewing the footage now to see if the camera picked up the faint images.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I have had several sightings of these &#34;formations&#34; since November 18, 2001 when we witnessed dozens of the same types of craft fly overhead.  Our most recent sighting was this past september of a pulsating Triangle which changed shape and size 3 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moffett Field / NASA Aames Research Center is aproximately 10 Miles south of our location, and we are only a few miles away from the Stanford University Dish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They always seem to fly in the same direction.  This wave lasted till aproximately 5:30AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FYI: We noticed a couple of shooting stars, most likely from the meteor shower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also find it interesting that these formations appear during Meteor Showers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to encourage investigators to look into the November 18, 2001 Mass &#34;Boomerang Shaped&#34; Sightings that occured during the Leonid Meteor Showers, and which my wife and I continue to see fly directly over our house.  I have no doubt they will appear again, we seem to be in thier &#34;flight path&#34;.  They always fly in the same direction every time we see them, and it&#39;s been several times since 2001.<n>

I had taken some water outside to de-ice my truck windshield and turn on the engine to allow it to become warm enough to use the heater. Having done so I went back in the house for a few minutes. Then I went back outside and was standing on my porch when I noticed some (?) clustered lights in the western hemisphere. I just figured it was a plane, however I stood there and watched these lights which appeared low on the horizon. After a couple of minutes they didn&#39;t seem to be getting closer, but neither did they appear to be getting further away. Then all of a sudden a single light (about half way between where I was located and where the other lights were)appeared and SHOT DOWN at an angle and then SHOT UP...IN A CHECKMARK FASHION. This particular light lasted only a few seconds. The clustered lights beyond this were still there. I was in shock...I have never seen this happen before! If it was a &#39;falling star&#39; it certainly wouldn&#39;t have shot up again!! I was in awe and shock of what I just witnessed. After a couple moments I got in my truck and headed for work. Within less than 1 minute after leaving (I was heading east), a plane was approaching from behind me and to my north and this plane was flying east. I couldn&#39;t see how this could be the same &#34;clustered lights&#34; I had seen previously because of the distance it had been during the sighting and it didn&#39;t seem possible it could have approaced me that quick. Even if they are one and the same it doesn&#39;t explain the other single light which shot down and up in the checkmark fashion!!<n>

Pleasant on the 526 or Mark Clark expressway and saw a dim gold sphere in the sky.  I always watch the skies around here and have seen some pretty strange things before.  It wasn&#39;t moving at all and then it completely vanished right where it was with no light, nothing but black sky to be seen.  Very errie to be watching something motionless over the river for a few seconds then have it vanish right before your eyes.  Almost unworldly.  Just the night before I was out sky watching because a relative came home and said they saw a falling star.  I drove out and saw two from a downtown park and believe these are a result of the genemid meteor activity here recently.  And recently in our Charleston papers, there was a story about the mysterious boom sounds of the east coast.  We learn that they have been happening for over a hundred years with no explanation yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He works at night, and after I saw the fiery object in the sky last night, I called him to ask him if he might have seen anything himself, on his boat that goes between ((deleted)) Seattle (south of where I was walking), Vashon Island and Southworth on the Olympic Peninsula near Bremerton.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((deleted/brother)) said a couple of members of his crew saw two events, just after their shift started about 21:00, and one the night before as well on his shift. He said that a crewman probably saw the event I saw, which he said was somewhere up near my house located somewhat north of the ferry dock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((deleted/brother)) said that there were in fact some clouds out of which these shooting stars seemingly came, and he said that they went quite low through the cloud cover and then burned out before they hit the ground.  He said that they were both quite low and did in fact, enter the sky below the cloud cover.  They were within Puget Sound, and the one was just where I described it.  So I also find it strange that my brother in law saw the same event, two seconds or so long, that I did.  Pretty strange.  Incidentally, my brother in law, ((deleted)), before becoming a((deleted)) captain in Puget Sound, was an officer in the Coast Guard and also had a degree in Astronomy, though I don&#39;t think that it makes him any more of an expert than the average person who might witness such an event.  Just makes it a little more credible.  ((deleted)) often says he witnesses at night lots of astronomical events, being out on the water, not close to land or lights.  Quite a meteor shower and I guess we did see some that passed low.  If you want more information, call me or write back, and I&#39;ll try to ask ((deleted)) more about what he saw from his angle, south of here and out on the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, ((name deleted))<n>

I stopped my rig on the side of the road to observe the object, turned off my engine and lights. Lucerne Valley, CA is in the middle of the desert so it&#39;s a very quiet and dark area located 30 miles East of the 15 in San Bernardino County. As I observed the object I noticed it had three red lights in formation of a triangle, it traveled at a good pace at approx 40,000 feet. It must of been very large because it seemed large. It was traveling from West to East. At 6:31 PM it stopped for about a minute and the lights turned in a circle twice, at 6:32 it began traveling East once more, I also noticed that it would block out stars in the back ground as it passed them by. By 6:34 PM the object became very faint in the western horizon to continue observing it, additionally, this was a very clear cold night and I also heard no noise from this craft at all. I took all of these notes to have a more precise report, I frequently watch the skies, and have seen many others in the past, but this is the first one I am reporting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Two of my co-workers who I was carpooling with at the time were also in the car. Behind the jet I noticed a flashing light which I took to be another jet close behind the other or in the same area. Noticing the difference that the first jet I saw had a condensation trail and the second did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I let it go for a couple minutes unwatched and when we puled off the 401 at Communication road I scanned the skies again. The reason being that for the past few days I have been watching the skies for anything out fo the ordinary. Now I know why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At apx. 5:00 pm while heading north on Creek Road I noticed what I assumed to be the jet I had seen earlier. This time it was much closer and appeared to have an unusually short condensation trail. My eyes were drawn to what I saw in the sky behind the &#34;jet&#34;. The same type of flickering I saw near the jet onthe horizon and in almost the same relative position to the jet with the con trail. I figured that this was just another jet that was catching the suns rays. Until the flickering ceased and the lagging object appeared more brilliant, even solid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I knew somethign was not normal about this so I asked the driver to pull over. Both of the other passengers had seen what I was looking at before I asked to pull over. We stopped at the corner of Creek road and Indian Creek road, got out of the car and watched as the two objects traveled in a South Southeastern direction. The distance between the two objects was apx. the distance from the tip of your index finger to the tip of your thumb while held at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend suggested that it was an airplane that had another object or craft in tow but that turned out not to be the case. As we were facing south and both objects passed in front of us, the condensation trail behind the red dot dissapeared. Both objects proceeded along their paths and then apx. three seconds later the red dot had started traveling backwards. It did not stop, or turn. it REVERSED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Up until this point I was awaiting the moment when I could say &#34;Ahh, that&#39;s just a couple airplanes&#34; I do not know of any modern aircraft that could mimick the movement I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the red dot reversed its path, there was apx. 3 seconds where it appeared as though the trailing object and the red dot were going to collide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects passed very close to each other and both travelled out of sight at a constant speed. The white luminous object heading South Southeast and the red dot, on its reversed path, and without condensation trail, progressed North Northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of us that witnessed this event can not come up with any rational explanation for what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone who reads this has any information about this incident please contact me at ((e-address deleted)).<n>

It hovered in one plave and bobbed slightly up and down and side to side as if it was in water. The light was extremely bright. After a few minutes if began to move south away from the mountain and then it increased to a high rate of speed, in an instant it was just a pinpoint of light and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was approximately the size of the full moon.  The moment I thought &#34;what the hell is that&#34; the light quickly flashed an intense white and became a tight cluster of arhythmically blinking red and white lights.  The object began to zig zag and bob up and down slowly to the southeast.  With tree branches as references I could tell that the object was bobbing up and down and moving erratically much like a hummingbird or like a boat on choppy waters.  The object then made a turn to the north until it was due east of my position, approximately where the Michigan International Speedway is located.  The object was still blinking very erratically and quickly and its motion was still &#39;jumpy&#39;.  At this point the object meandered toward the east over the Irish Hills/US-12 area of south central Lower Michigan as I lost sight of it.  The entire duration of the sighting lasted about two to three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As soon as it came it all of a sudden stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To start with I must explain that myself and my wife have a fan and our daughters baby swing on all night and they both create a loud and constant noise. Basically normally we don&#39;t hear anything outside unless a car drives right by the house or a fighter jet from columbus airforce flys by (maybe once aday but normally in the afternoon). We were woken up about 4:30 a.m by what at first we thought was a helicopter hovering above our house. However rather then the sound of blades cutting through the air in a high pitched manner, this was a low droning noise, but very loud. it stayed above our house for about 2-3 mins before I was fully awake and looked outside. My wife and I were greated with a light hoovering above a building on our land and then as I went outside to take a closer look it vanished. If there is anyone who knows of anyway we could shed some light on this rather strange incedent we would sleep much better.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is the THIRD time I have seen this craft hovering within a 3 mile radius of my house.  This craft does not look like an alien spacecraft from the usual science fiction novels.  It looks like an enourmous aircraft/ helicopter with white and red lights.  The peculiar thing about it is it Hovers approx. 250-500 ft. from the treetops.  The lights on the bottom are so bright, it seems as though it is spotlighting the ground beneath.  The second time I saw this aircraft, I was driving in my car home.  I spotted it above the railroad tracks and tried to follow it. After rounding a bend in the road, it was Gone.  The third time I saw it was last night (12/14/04).  I decided to go in the house to grab the digital camera to get a picture.  I was in the house for approx. 30 seconds (I left the car running, did not even put the battery in the camera, just grabbed it and ran outside) and the craft was GONE.  This is the strangest thing I have Ever seen.  You could see the craft from my house!  I was inside for 30 seconds and it just disapeared!  I live 3 miles outside of the city with open skies everywhere. NO airplane or helicopter can disappear in 30 seconds or less!  I need help in recording this craft.  It shows up in the sky about once a month.  If patient, a recording of this craft could be made and whatever it is, a recording might help solve the problem.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While trying to divert my gaze from its landing lights, I noticed a very dim object about 1 degree of arc in length and of an indeterminate width, moving perpendicular to the path of the 737.  It seemed to occult some stars as it travelled (about 1.5 degrees/sec) at an indeterminate altitude.  It appeared to have no luminescence except for the faintest shimmer as it moved across the starry sky.  It was travelling perpendicular to its longitudinal axis.  Its magnitude I would estimate between 4-5.  It made no noise.  I observed it for about ninety seconds until it was no longer visible.  It travelled unidirectionally North-to-South for the duration of its visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stopped and stood in the middle of the street on this crystal clear night, as I was taking my dog out for some fresh air. After assessing it was not a plane, nor sattle light, not any sort of shooting star, blimp, or anything I&#39;d ever seen before. It moved slowly to the right and up a little, and stopped to hover for a moment. It was well up in the sky and must have been just over Vancouver, Wa. as I was facing North in SE Portland. I could distinguish multiple lights when it hovered, which were seemingly white or mildly off white/yellow. It then began to move up and to the right a little more and then *swoosh* it shot out of our atmosphere, and left green tracer like streaks behind it, just like one would see on Star Trek. I knew I had seen, for just a moment, something unbeknownst to me. It was real, and I am quite sure I saw a flying saucer. Nothing &#39;rational&#39;could change my mind. Do they have something to do with planet Nemesis,.. I wonder.. sometimes I think we are like a petrie dish for these traveling beings. Nothing could shock me to find out about it all.

A boomerang of lights seemed to appear out of nowhere, close to the ground but made no sound. It turned in different directions rapidly then just disappeared. I live close to Keesler Air Force Base and figured it was probably just a plane. But I could see no outline of a plane even though it was that close to the ground and i could hear no engines. The best way I can describe what it looked like, because I can&#39;t remember how many lights, is a flock of geese heading south for the winter...all wearing orangish~yellow lights. Maybe someone out there has a logical explanation for what I saw. I&#39;m the biggest skeptical I know, but this has me puzzled and wondering.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Starting to wonder if there&#39;s military testing going on? My husband and I were returning home from Georgetown heading west on 521 near Trio. We saw three bright lights in a triangle pattern. These were not as orange as the previous lights we saw in other sightings. But they faded pretty quickly in the same way. Just after we got home to Salters, my husband stayed out in the yard to catch a glimpse of the meteor showers. He saw six lights at a time, paired in threes in three different vectors.  They were located east of us, in the direction of Georgetown. (From the direction we&#39;d just come). The lights lit up, stayed on and then faded just as before.  There was no noise to be heard as is with aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was out walking my dog, came to a spot on the bluff where I can see the Sound clearly as well as the mountains and across to the Olympic Peninsula.  The sky was scattered with clouds, probably mostly clear, but as I looked to the West, I could seen an extremely bright object fiery object, the size of a baseball, that seemed to come from above a low-lying cloud and shot downwards from a slightly easterly direction toward the West.  My impression was that the object must have hit the water somewhere west, beyond the midpoint between West Seattle and Bainbridge Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not clearly see where in the water it landed, mainly because there are some trees that would block my view, but as you said to me, and as I ponder it more, it seemed that it fell down below the horizon line.  At one point, I was certainly above it.  It took no more than a couple of seconds to move out of my sight down toward water.  I now wonder if it may have been something that fell off a plane or was shot up into the air and fell downwards?  The reason I say this is because of what you said to me in our conversation:  it made no sound or if it did, it was not much of one.  It was, however, very bright.  I looked around the water and saw a ferry crossing from Bainbridge Island going toward Seattle.  The boat was past where it might have landed, in my mind’s eye anyway.  I even checked with the ferry service to see if anyone reported it from the boat.  None of the TV news stations had any reports.  What did I eat??? It did not seem that it was something the trajectory of which would indicate that it had been shot up and then fell back to the earth.  It had a definite trajectory, east to west, and if it does not act like a meteorite, then maybe it was from an airplane.  It had that feel of something falling from the sky, not going up from earth and falling back down.  Does that make sense?  Also, if it were a flare, I would have easily heard the shot, and it didn’t act like a flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know you’re doing a show right now, but if you’ve got any other ideas later, let me know.  It sure was fast and furious, the way it landed, or maybe didn’t?!  And if it was a piece of airplane or space/satellite debris, then it was quite amazing too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)), M.A., M.F.C.C., Psychotherapist ((telephone number deleted))<n>
12/13/04 22:00|Neosho|MO|Other|20 seconds|On the night of Dec. 13th while watching the meteor shower, I saw a large, silent, and completely dark object travel across the sky.|1/19/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41154.html|157|ndxe200412| On the night of Dec. 13th while watching the meteor shower, I saw a large, silent, and completely dark object travel across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While out watching the meteor shower, I noticed a distortion in the sky.  The sky was clear, no clouds in any direction.  I noticed something traveling through the sky from south to north over our town.  I was able to track the object because the stars would disappear from view as it traveled in front of them and then would reappear as the object moved on.  The object was completely dark.  There were no lights anywhere on it, at least as seen from my angle of view on the ground.  It made no sound, despite its large size.  I waited for several minutes after it was out of sight for a delayed sound, but I never heard anything from it.  Its altitude is difficult to determine; however, it appeared to be at least several thousand feet high.  Its size was about 6 times as large as what a 747 looks like when it is at 30,000 feet.  When the object was near overhead, I was able to make out its shape against the sky despite the fact that both sky and object were dark.  It was roughly oval or egg shaped, but had a pylon or similiar structure on either side of it.  I tracked the oject for about 15-30 seconds as it moved from about 40 degrees above the southern horizon, overhead and off to the north until it was obscured from view by the trees across the street from my house. I did not have enough time to go into the house to get anyone else to come see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It definitely wasn&#39;t an airplane...it was moving too fast and its turns were much too quick.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had been observing the starry night for about 20 minutes prior to the occurrence. The air temperature was about 25 degrees with a moderate wind from out of the norwest, approximately 10 to 15 kts. I had been observing several of the star formations during this time frame in the northern sky when a movement in the sky caught my attention. I had observed several commercial airline departures from Kansas City Intl Airport, located about 45 miles northwest of my locations prior to this occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my attention was drawn to the subject craft, I thought that it was the only one. I was surprised to see another one following the first craft in a left echelon formation about 8 seconds later. Both of the craft were completely blacked out, that is running without standard FAA lighting required on all aircraft flown with regulated airspace of the contiguous United States, at an approximated altitude of below 10,000 feet. The observed craft were of a flat black surface color, with a solid structure(as they blocked out the stars) as they passed just to the west of my location. I thought to myself, (a veteran pilot with over 10,000 flight hours, in commercial multi-engine fixed wing and rotor wing aircraft with instrument ratings). What the heck are those craft flying with any markings or light designations in regulated airspace! Then it occurred to me that maybe these were stealth bombers on maneuvers and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would know about it.  The military is even required to have permission to cross active airspace utilizing a discrete transponder code as to avoid other aircraft operating in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two craft that I observed came from the north at an altitude I estimated as being below 10,000 feet above ground level and a speed of that required for jet aircraft operating at an altutude of below 10,000 ft agl.  Somewhere between 200 and 250 kts. This I estimated based upon how long I observed them for the distance traveled, having an intimate knowledge of the area from having flown in it for many years. As the two craft passed from my view of them and within about one minute of their passing, I observed a commercial jet aircraft displaying the standard FAA required lighting, having departed the Kansas City Intl airport coming from the northwest, climbing on a southeasterly heading. The commercial jet passed through the track of the two craft at approximately the same altitude I had observed them flying, on their nearly due south track.  The two craft were approximately 3 times the size of the commercial airliner with a slight V or rounded front fuselage and a flat bottom solid structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a veteran pilot, I did not jump to any conclusions as to what the craft were, but was more concerned that they were operating in controlled airspace and I wanted to know more about their mission.  I called a friend of mine on Tuesday who works with the FAA ARTCC facility located in Olathe, Kansas to ascertain if he could help me identify who or what these craft were and if they had any radar signature or transponder data readouts. The FAA approach control facility supervisor responded to my call on wednesday AM and I relayed my observations to him. He indicated that he would reconstgruct the occurrence based upon my observations and let me know if they can identify the subject craft. He also indicated that I should contact the National UFO reporting center and provide them with my observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My credentials include military service with the US Coast Guard from 1967 to 1973 as a communications specialist E-5. US government service with the Natl Trans Safety Board (NTSB) as a senior Air Safety Investigator from 1983 to 1990. As a commercial pilot from 1972 to present, an expert witness, aviation safety consultant from 1990 to 1996 and as a corporate security specialist from 1997 to present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One further note that I failed to mention is that the two craft during the track to the south made no noise, but moved silently on their flight. The commercial jet aircraft was making it&#39;s usual noise from it&#39;s jet engines as I heard it approaching from the northwest with the time frame I observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any questions, please email me at ((e-address deleted)) and I will respond when time permits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will mail a pencil rendering of my observation to you in order for you to have a clearer picture of what I observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thankyou  ((name deleted)) Security Specialist<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness on several occasions, and we find him to be an exceptionally skilled, and credible, witness.

The structure was solid as it blocked out the stars as they passed just west of my location. A calculated lat/long was made, being @lat 39deg,00&#39;-17&#34;, long:94deg,17&#39;-02&#34;.  I thought to myself, a veteran pilot with over 10,000 flight hours in numerous aircraft and helicopters, what the heck are those carft flying without any markings (lights) in controlled airspace. Then it occurred to me that maybe these were stealth bombers on maneuvers and the Federal Aviation Admin (FAA) would know about it. It should be noted that even the military are required to have permission to cross active airspace utilizing discrete transponder codes as to avoid other air traffic operating in the controlled space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two craft were observed to be flying on a north to south heading, at an altitude of below 10,000 feet agl and at a speed of between 200 and 250 knots. This speed I estimated based upon how long my observation was for the distance traveled. As a veteran pilot, and as a former aircraft accident investigator, I was concerned with the safety of other aircraft in the area, as these two craft could not be seen by commercial or other air traffic operating in the same area. I observed a commercial jet pass through at the same estimated altitude less than a minute behind the two craft, on a southeast heading of about 120 degrees. I estimated the two craft to be about 3 times the size of the commercial airliner with a shape of a horseshoe front fuselage, rounded underneath and with a smooth underside. An area of distortion just aft of this viewable side was present, precluding me from viewing the complete structure of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a veteran pilot, I did not jump to any conclusions as to what the craft were, but was more concerned that they were operating in controlled airspace and I wanted to know more about their mission.  On Tuesday AM, I contacted a friend of mine wht the FAA ARTCC facility in Olathe, KS to ascertain if he could help me identify who or what these craft were and if they had any radar signatures or transponder data. An FAA approach control facility supervisor responded to my call on Wednesday AM and I relayed my observations.  He indicated that he would attempt to reconstruct the occurrence based upon my observations and let me know if they could identify the subject craft.  To this date, I&#39;ve had no response from the FAA.  Maybe a FOIA request is necessary to ascertain the nature of this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One further note, during the observation of the two craft, I did not hear any noise eminating from them, but them moved silently on their flight. On the other hand, the commercial jet aircraft I observed crossing their track behind them made it&#39;s distinctive noise signature from the engines as I heard it approaching from the northwest and as it flew over my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Second, more detailed, report from same witness, who has impressive credentials in the field of aviation.

12/13/04 20:00|Emory|TX|Cone|Two hours - plus|I witnessed a cluster of extremely bright white, blue and red strobe type lights at a low altitude for about two hours.|1/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41136.html|164|ndxe200412| I witnessed a cluster of extremely bright white, blue and red strobe type lights at a low altitude for about two hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observation started at approximately 7:45 pm.  A cold front had recently passed through so the sky was with about a 10/15 mph north wind.  I took my dog outside as I do every night and the object caught my attention right away. I was looking east/southeast.  It was approximately 15 degrees above the horizon and not moving.  The object was an extremely bright cluster of flashing red, white and blue lights in the shape of a cone or diamond (at times it was each).  The first thing to come to my mind was a helicopter in a search pattern. As I watched it there was no movement or sound, it was way too bright and I have yet to see an aircraft with lights in this formation, brightness or colors.  I was not able estimate the size or distance of the object because of not reference points.  There was a white light on top with red, white and blue lights flashing (not blinking) randomly around and on the bottom of the object.  All of the lights had the intensity of strobes.  The lights would diminish in intensity and then get extremely bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for approximately fifteen minutes and went back into my house to get my binoculars and my wife.  She watched it for about 10 minutes. It still showed no movement or sound.  Through the binoculars I was able to better see the individual lights but not a structure.  I watched it until approximately 9:40 pm. During that time it again diminished in brightness and moved a few degrees to the south and a few in altitude.  I finally got too cold and went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night I went back out during the same time period to see if this may have been a star that had fooled me due light refraction with the combination of a recent cold front and closness to the horizon.  I check three times during the same time period and the sky was empty of any lights or stars.  Just blackness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD))<n>

About 20 degrees to the left of the moon there appeared one light, then two, then three; in horizontal configuration and equidistant apart from one another.  The width of the three lights when all of them were illuminated was approximately the distance of half of a full moon. They were brilliant white and several times larger than Jupiter’s appearance.  All three stayed on for four or five seconds and then disappeared in unison.  Five to seven seconds later and five or so degrees left of the moon one appeared again, then two, then three, in the same configuration and disappeared again.  To me, a plane or jet could not have traveled that amount of distance in that amount of time.  Then four or five seconds later it happened again, but this time they were back around the 15 or 20 degree location to the left of the moon. Then disappeared all together, again.  No trailing like a flare or no colors of green or red. Just 1,2,3 on; stayed on; then all off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since we were on the bridge we could not stop, so whether or not they appeared again we can not say because our view became obstructed by city clutter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Subsequent call to Rapides Parish Sheriff’s Dept. I was told that the military at Fort Polk was conducting flare practice.  These were not flares.  I have witnessed flares. I don’t expect anything but smoke and mirrors from the military anyway.<n>

Here in myrtle beach. The wife and I were at home when we herd a load sonic boom followed by fighter jets one minute after. As soon as we herd the blast we rushed to check the kids then we herd the jets screaming accross the sky. We ran out side as well as some neighbors .I have not herd a sonic blast since I live at Edwards AFB in California. My wife pointed out 3 lights in a straight line that just seemed to faid out as fast as they appeared it freaked us out and I blew it off as just some military practice. The local news is not very helpfull and are just as confused as myself. I have herd and seen these befor in california with the excepion of the strange lights, and sounds. To me the fighter jets sounded more like they were chasing something, not just practice. I have herd a report of an Air Raid siren going off in NC just befor the sonic blast. This come from someone in Surfside beach who was on the phone with a friend in NC at the time and herd it all. I have also watched a report on the news and one persons experiance was close to ours and she discribed the lights as flairs. Well I live around the military long enough this was not normal. Then I was searching the internet and found somewere on this site someone in Goergetown saw lights but no sound....<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD))<n>

I noticed one in particular. It moved sporadically, slightly left/right and up/down. I got a pair of binoculars. The light was too far away, probably over Cahutta or Dalton, GA which is SW of my property. I woke up my husband who probably said it was a plane, since we have a busy flight path overhead. Since I had been watching it for over 10 minutes, with no evident travel distance, I insisted he look through the binoculars. No daylight yet, so sky was black. No noise and no discernable shape of unit itself. There appeared to be blue, green and white lights most visible on the lower left side. Through the binoculars, the stars were still just white dots, this object was glared and looked like a cross shape. At one point it appeared to be lighting an area underneath it. Twice, from a considerable distance to the North and to the South of it, there appeared to be shooting stars. But they were shooting upward instaed of down. Tonight my husband informs me the news said we are having meteor showers after 11:00 pm. So did I see a prelude?<n>

It was very windy outside (25-30mph) so i&#39;m not possitive what I heard wasn&#39;t just wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The noise sounded almost like a very odd TV static. A buzzing and cracking noise if you will.  I stayed outside for about 15-20 minutes looking at the sky.  I couldnt see anything.  The sound was coming from directly above me about 100 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and got online to talk to a friend about it.  This friend lives about 20 miles away in Rockford, IL off of charles st.  He went outside as soon as I told him this.  When he came back he described the exact same noise I had heard 5 minutes earlier.  Another friend felt a very large blast then looked outside to see a very large green, white, and red light about 100 feet above the ground.  He then told me that the blast was felt before it actually happened to the best of his knowledge.  He walked outside and one of the telephone wires started to spark.  All of the lights on the block went out for about 10 minutes then came on again.  They stayed on for not more than 15 seconds then went off again.  He talked about how he could actually feel the light in his body, and how he felt very uncomfortable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after this had happened, a police car came onto the street.  Apparently he had followed the light from East State St. to Fairview Blvd.   The police officer said he did know what the light was.  ComEd know nothing of the power outage and said it was probably just wind, but all who were involved know otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyone in Rockford, IL who has seen similiar sightings please contact me at Suthrncomfrt1884@yahoo.com   I am very interested in this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the beginning, one could see a V shaped trail that moved at a speed much faster than a commercial/military type plane.  Moments later, in same area, one saw several lights flash, circle, and them move out in formation.  The lights would appear -- one in each corner of a square, and then move to the center, circle around each other in the center of the square, and then move back.  This occurred over a period of 45 minutes.  I could only say that the only reason I saw this was because my friend also witnessed the same thing...but in Falls Church.  He called me around 12:30 am to tell me to go outside and see if I am seeing the same thing he was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We note that the description provided by the witness is consistent with a sighting of rotating advertising lights.

The objects appeared in a diamond formation and at first glance I thought it might have been a large aircraft moving sideways.  The objects then began to circle randomly around each other (2 objects rotated clockwise while 2 others rotated alternate directions around the these) while maintaining course and speed south.  They moved at a steady speed from the time that we saw them from the time they disappeared over the trees on the south side of our complex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 45 seconds to a minute later, while moving around to the other side of our complex, we saw a line of 18 objects in a half V formation, in the same direction (South) as the previous 4.  The objects looked identical in shape, color, and speed as the first 4, but they remained in formation until out of sight well over the far side of the Texas A&amp;M University campus, which we can see from our parking lot.  Again, they flew anywhere from a few hundred to a thousand feet above the ground, with absolutely no noise.  They flew faster than birds and as fast if not faster than a jet airplane.  The objects were in a very very tight formation [nearly touching each other].<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/12/04 22:00|Nashville|TN|Light|30 min.|lights circling inside clouds over Nashville|12/14/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41111.html|176|ndxe200412| lights circling inside clouds over Nashville<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were driving on I-40 westbound on Sunday night, coming back to Nashville from east Tennessee. After passing the Lebanon exit, I began noticing lights moving inside the clouds closer to Nashville. As we got closer, I could tell that they looked like spot lights shining down from above or inside the clouds instead of from below, and they were moving in large circles. This night we saw two of them moving in large circles and figure eights from east to west over Nashville. One of the main reasons I became so interested was that my wife and I have seen similar lights before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I filed a report back in 8/03 about lights we saw clrcling around inside the clouds during a big thunderstorm. We had pretty much conviced ourselves that this earlier sighting was a spotlight promoting something, or maybe lights from the Starwood Ampitheater, which we&#39;re kind of near (although I don&#39;t know why anyone would have continued to shine these types of lights during one of the biggest thunderstorms of the summer). These lights looked almost exactly the same and were moving in almost the same fashion, except there were only two instead of four. So now we had a chance to try to find the source of these lights and prove to ourselves that we weren&#39;t seeing anything out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We closed in on the city from about 30 miles out and the lights became increasingly obvious. I&#39;m sure other cars must have seen them, but there&#39;s no way to know. I had slowed down a lot because I was fascinated by these lights clrcling and seemingly swooping around just above the cloud ceiling. We kept expecting one to become more visible or distinct though a break in the clouds, but it never happened. They stayed very fuzzy and shapeless. The lights would circle opposite each other, then move together and back apart or do some crazy zig zag. However, we never saw a beam of light from the ground, and that was primarily what we were looking for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got off the interstate on Stewarts Ferry Pk., when we thought we were finally getting below the lights, and went east. I was driving, but my wife could still see them northeast of us, so I took a left on Lebanon Pk and went north. Now we were very close to the Nashville airport, but the general movement of the lights seemed to be to the northwest and we could never get under them. We were also getting around more city lights and it was harder to see them, and they seemed to be farther away from us. We were tired from our drive so we went on home, but we satisfied ourselves that these lights were not originating from spotlights on the ground. I don&#39;t know that it proves anything about the first lights we saw, but it makes me wonder. I know other people must have seen these lights, as they were all over above the city, so I&#39;m hoping someone else will come forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The noodles seemed to bend and flex as if they were birds in flight. i heard the sound of jets but it could have been from the nearby airport. Having watched flights come in and out of the pheonix airport for awhile now I am positive that no airplne has ever looked like this. For a minute i thought that maybe it was birdsd flying in formation but they were moving much to fast. Within a few seconds they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Two linear groups of dim (practically invisible) lights.  One line of four or five, another of three, spinning and crossing each other&#39;s paths.  If they were small and low, they were in the low hundreds of miles per hour.  If they were high, which is how it looked, they were huge and hypersonic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were already past me when I spotted them, and faded from visibility within maybe five to ten seconds, after which they had covered possibly fifteen or twenty degrees of sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was what appeared to be a more conventionally lit aircraft (though definitely not conventional) moving in roughly the same direction, low and fast, but without noise.  Since it looked more conventional, though, all my attention was on the dim lights.  If the brighter craft was just an airplane, it was unrelated, because I think that the dim lights overtook the path of the brighter, and their paths diverged noticeably.  The brighter one disappeared first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were very dim, but appeared white.  We are near the Southeast section of the local traffiic area for Addison airport, and there were several planes in the pattern.  None were within a mile of the section of sky that had the strange lights (except for the one mentioned above.)  The sky was crystal clear.  One of the clearest I&#39;ve seen in Dallas.<n>

The first two flashes were white and the third time, it was bright green with a much wider distance and height, almost like an explosion in the sky. A minute or two later, the flashing started again as it headed south. There were about 5 smaller orange/red flashes. The whole experience was about 5 minutes. This was not lightning. The sky was a little overcast/cloudy, very windy  temperatures had recently dropped with light flurries.  This was cool! We&#39;re not crazy. We have been looking to the nighttime skies since fall after the numerous reports. Thinking back, during the summer, we (3 of us) saw a white light in the same area, but it was like a streak in the sky--not a plane.  We were surprised and all we could say was &#34;did you see that&#34;?  Tonight&#39;s experience, however, topped that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Round shape. The light was travelling from west to east at a slow pace. The light stopped travelling east at some point just north of the Santa Clarita Valley. As it hovered it lost altitude and began to hover at about 2,500 ft. It would  move from left to right in a very slow manner and then make 90 degree turns upward and gain altitude. I watched it for the better part of 30 minutes. There were many witnesses at Costco, both customers and employees. The object did not make any sound and had no visible means of propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object began to travel away from me in a westerly direction at a very shallow angle, again with no visible means of propulsion. It climbed and travelled at relatively the same speed. Never increasing speed. There were times as I watched that the object would bounce up and down and side to side as if being affected by turbulence. The most amazing thing, as I continued to watch this, is I realized the object left the earths atmosphere when the red object began to &#34;twinkle&#34;.  I continued to watch it until it was no longer visible to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very familiar with the aviation, and I am not aware of any aircraft that behave in that manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched as it travelled in a West/Southwest direction.  It moved slower than an aircraft, but faster than a blimp.  It did not have any flashing strobes that I can see.    I live in the flight path of nearby McChord AFB and have seen hundreds of aircraft follow this route.  This object appeared to be slightly higher than those aircraft approaching McChord AFB, and much lower than commercial aircraft for nearby Seatac International.  As the object moved by and was now to my South, I saw as it dropped several, 3-4, small objects that glowed and seemed to &#34;go out&#34; as they neared the ground.  I can only describe them as burning ember like, only they fell instead of rose.  The object continued West and made small, slow direction changes, at one point turning back east before going West again.  The object dropped a few more &#34;embers&#34; before it lost whatever illumination it had and disappeared.  I could hear a faint noise that I compare to mabye a blimp enjine, too quiet for a helicoptor.  I could hear the noise after the object was no longer visible.  The ojbect did not move over the horizon, but simply stopped illuminating.  I would guess this object was no more than a mile or two from my location and only a few thousand feet of altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The stars were more visable then I have seen in a while so I stopped to enjoy them. It was then that I noticed a triangular shape of lights while I was looking to the northwest. I realized that there was a solid object inside the triangular shape of lights. I ran inside and called my brother who was spending the night and he came out and confirmed that he was seeing the same thing. I then went back inside and called a friend that was visiting from Dallas and my husband. We all watched it for awhile and even took a digital picture but at that altitude you couldn&#39;t see the outline. The object never moved and the lights would blink sometimes a red or blue, though not at the same time. And a few times it would look like lights would flicker across the object. I am 5&#39;6&#34; and standing with my hands raised with a ruler from the bottom of the Dipper, the object was the distance of around 14 inches to the north and the size of the object was 1 1/2&#34; with the longer tip of the object (A light was on each tip) pointing to the WSW. There were also lights lining the sides of the object. While watching the object, it did not move that we could see, I noticed what I can only describe as two shooting stars to the south. Whether this is related I do not know and I was the only one of the four that saw them. It is only conjecture among the four of us that the object was outside of our atmosphere because of the way that the object would go out of focus for a second very hazy and then be clear . The others went inside after about 20 minutes while I continued to watch. Around 2:45 the clouds started to roll in and obscure the object and I went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were low clouds, a friend and I were walking in a field when we noticed a bright light to our right.  We turned and the light seemed to punch through the clouds.  It was stunningly bright--it lit up the surrounding woods like a slow, gigantic camera flash.  Green tail with orange sparks trailing behind it.  It seemed to come straight down (no visible arc), and seemed to disappear just before touching the ground.  We could see the shadow of trees behind it, so we know the object made it into the adjacent valley, but it seemed to go dark before it would have made impact.  I believe it was a meteor, but it was the closest encounter I&#39;ve ever had with one!  I expect the object was somewhere between .25 to .75 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD))<n>

After a few seconds, all three lights slowly faded out until they were gone.  I thought at first perhaps it was a plane that made a turn and we had simply lost view of the lights.  However, we both continued to look in the area the lights were last seen, and saw nothing else, nor were there any tall buildings or other structures around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

As I turned we all saw a formation of three lights in the western sky I would say anywhere from 1 to 5 miles from our location east of the town of Van Alstyne and about 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon.  It could have been hovering anywhere between the airspace above town center and past highway 75 above the fields to the west.  It was a very clear night, no clouds and high visibility.  At first I thought it may have been a plane or 3 planes headed in our direction with landing lights on wich is strange because the flight path to DFW International Airport has traffic that usually heads east to west in our area.  What was unusually strange is that it did not move at all for at least 10 seconds and then all 3 lights faded simultaneously for about 5 seconds all in complete silence.  All four of us definately agree to this part of the description whereas the details are mixed.  I seem to remember that the topmost light in the middle was bright yellowish white much like an airliner&#39;s landing light while the 2 lights on the side where a duller blueish green much like a street light.  My friend and his dad seemed to remember the opposite with the greenish light in the middle and the white lights on the outside.  I did not see if there was anything in the middle while the friend and his dad seem to have noticed a dark triangle in between the formation of lights.  While the other friend vehemently belives that they were 1 or 3 airplanes they did not follow the normal patterns of any airplane I have ever seen in a low approach (I live just south of DFW airport and I am used to seeing exactly how airliners behave at low altitudes).  Also there were no port and starboard running lights or strobe lights and the other major detail, no sound.  I am thinking about reporting to the local news in the area because it would have to have been seen from the highway if not seen from the locals who where at the time throwing a Christmas parade and festival.  I have seen only one other unexplained phenomenon in my lifetime on lake Ponchartrain in Louisiana and have reported it on this site but this is far more inexplicable than anything I have ever seen in the night sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There position did not change much, only what appeared to be very slight movement, changes in tint and intensity.  When the lights faded, it was as if they were turned out via a dimmer switch.  It seems that the sky between the lights was darker, thus indicating a large triangular vehicle.  It appeared that if it were a single vehicle, it would be quite large, about 400 meters across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the U. S.

Two were brilliant white &amp; one orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving west-bound at approximately 9:50pm, December 11, 2004, I noticed two bright lights next to each other straight ahead that were increasingly getting brighter.  A third light was directly between and a little above to two brighter lights.  The three lights were in a formation of an acute triangle from my perspective.  At first I thought it must be a very large aircraft approaching in my direction.  However, upon further observation, there was absolutely no movement among the three lights.  The two brightest lights were brighter in magnitude than any star in the sky.  They were exactly side-by-side of each other.  The magnitudes of those two lights were even brighter than the star Sirius (which was in the sky that night to the east) and about as bright as Venus sometimes appears.  The two brightest lights had an equal magnitude.  Those two lights slowly faded to nothing over a span of about 5 to 10 seconds, again with no movement.  The dimmer third light, which had an orange tint, remained for a few seconds then faded to nothing as well.    The lights never reappeared.  The sky was clear and only slightly hazy to the north, but stars were still visible above and around the area in which the lights appeared.  I saw no clouds in the area at the time, although I had observed a few thin clouds in the sky to the east about an hour earlier that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the sky for several minutes after the lights disappeared and never saw a reemergence of the lights.  My located was south of Fort Worth, TX and north of Crowley, TX while observing the lights to the west.  I could not tell how far away the lights were due to the lack of movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a sight of this nature.  When referencing the lights against the stars in the background, there was absolute zero movement among them.  Two of the lights were too bright to be stars; yet they had the stillness of stars.  Any aircraft would show evidence of movement unless they were ALL on a course DIRECTLY toward me or extremely far away.  However, the lights faded off with no movement, either in reference to the background stars, or each other.  I cannot explain or understand what they could have been.   The lights completely disappeared; a sharp contrast to the bright magnitude they had, especially the two brightest lights, just seconds before they faded to nothing without movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many times in the past, I have observed aircraft lights which seem to get brighter in magnitude as they approach in a path directly towards my location, only to dim as their paths change.  But their movements are always apparent in such cases and the lights never disappear.  Although I was driving at the time, the lights were directly ahead of me and I had slowed down to nearly a stop observing them because I could not get my eyes off of them.  While waiting for the lights to reappear I took note of the surrounding stars and, from my perspective, they were located in or below the region of the constellation Pegasus.  My vision was very clear in this case since I was wearing my corrective lenses at the time, which gives me a vision of 20/20.  The dimmer, background stars of the lower portion of the Pegasus constellation remained quite clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were outside jackling her up when out of no where three of us witnessed a giant green light so bright it litted up the entire sky green, turned white for a split second then changed direction and shot left.  It came straight from outer space like them movies in outerspace.  we were so winded up Os car is sat sunk in the mud until monday cuase we sat all night drinking laughing and shooting water balloons into the sky provoking them aliens to come back.  This is a true story.

It was approximately 2:30 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon with overcast skies. While driving, I happened to glance out my driver&#39;s side window at the sky over the ocean. At the instant I looked at the sky, I observed approximately 12 orbs of the brightest silver light I have ever seen. I could only describe the luminosity as being like that of liquid mercury--only many times brighter--and pulsating. These bright lights appeared to surge out of the cloud cover and pulsate in a formation of 3 stacked rows. The size of each orb was larger than a marble but smaller than a golf ball--if held at arm&#39;s length. Almost as quickly as the orbs appeared, they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a very and I mean very bright twinkle. We could see it clear being that it was a very clear sky that night. My daughter and just froze in couriosity, as we saw this twinkle in the sky going down in a 45 degree angle that back up again. As it did, it then started to proceed to fly slowly yet smooth. We could see it&#39;s shape take form as it flew over. It was diamond shape with lights at each end and more lights cemetrical to to teh shape of the aircraft. We also thought it might of been a rare shaped plane but waht&#39;s been bugging us is that at first it just appeared to huver without moving, only getting bigger and brighter, also that it made no sound (not one peep) accross the skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The shape of the craft was like a triangle. The night was very clear and the craft blocked out the stars in a triangle shape. The main thing that stands out from this sighting in my mind is the complete lack of sound. This is my first sighting and I hope my last. Object was about the size of 3 cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD))<n>

It had a bright white light in the middle of it, and extending from either side of this craft were two rectangular shaped &#34;arms.&#34;  Those were also lit brightly. (white light)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The curious thing though, as I drove closer to it, I noticed, what I can only describe as panels.  They appeared black.  and every other panel was lite very brightly. This was no plane as I noticed no beacon lights on it.  Thinking it may have been a helicopter I looked for signs of the tail.  There was none.  I pulled over on the side of the road. My vehicle was facing east and I was facing west.  It had no markings of a helicopter or a conventional aircraft.  The closes I could come to what it looked like was a satelite.  Though NO satelite hovers in earths atmoshpere especially this close to the ground.  I watched it as it hovered and it headed in a southern direction. I also noticed the traffic on the highway was also slowing down.  I estimate viewing this for at least five minutes until this craft slowly picked up speed then darted off quickly in a southern direction.<n>

As we went around the bend right above us we saw the what we would describe as the &#34;mother ship&#34;.  It just appeared above us and was hoverring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my boyfriend kept driving he turned to me and said, &#34;Tell me what that is!!??&#34;  I could not speak so he repeated &#34;Tell me what that is!!?? (even louder).  Then I replied, &#34;I don&#39;t have to tell you what it is...you KNOW what it is!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at the very minimum two football fields in size and it was not moving at all, simply hoverred.  It didn&#39;t make any noise, not a sound.  It was close enough above us that my boyfriend said he could throw a rock and hit it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the craziest thing either of us have ever seen in our lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to both of us it was extremely similar to the &#34;bigger spaceships&#34; in the movie &#34;INDEPENDENCE DAY&#34;.  There were many lights on its bottom surface and had many exterior fixtures on it...it wasn&#39;t a smooth looking craft, it was very detailed and intricate in its design.  The vision of this craft is so embedded in each of our minds due to the fact that it was so close to us in broad daylight that if we were sketch artists we&#39;d be able to draw exactly what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued around the tree lined bend it vanished without a sound, without a trace.  It was as if this UFO&#39;s cloaking device or camoflauge system was temporarily disabled allowing us to see it ever so clearly. There is no doubt in either of our minds of what we saw.  There is no mistaking what it was.  It was no small light moving above us in a dark sky. This part of our experience is very clear to us and totally the same.  For whatever reason the only discrepency in our account of this event is in the few hours following the sighting (time loss).<n> <n><n> <n><n> If we had not been watching a program on the history channel about UFO sightings, we might not have ever reported this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 30 year old woman who is in real estate and property management and I have no history of mental illness in my family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend&#39;s background: Early thirties, business professional in marketing and advertising, ex-bartender/nightclub manager in SF, CA., some college, no history of mental instability.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

He had his digital camera so he took several shots  before the object disappeared behind nearby hills to his west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He also stated that the objects size was relative to that of a basketball at arm&#39;s length and remembered the absolute silence as the object passed. In the attached unenhanced photo, he states the bright flash of light in the shot was not visible to him when he took the picture. This object may or may not be related to the earlier sighting in Kingsport Tn, earlier that same night and some 20 miles away.

I am a amator astronomer, and i was intrigged by the lights. I didn&#39;t knew any stellar objects in that zone of the sky, and they were too bright to be stars. I kept looking, and i saw that the lights were conected to each other by light, and saw the lights moving away in the sky (just imagine when you see a plane taking off from behind - it gets smaller and smaller) so did the lights, smaller and closer to each other, loosing intensity and becoming red - probably because of our atmosfere. The size i cannot tell exactly, but from the aceleration vs distance vs aparent size, i would say it had the size of about half a mile across the left and right lights (yes, THAT BIG).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife witnessed everything. The shape of the lights (remember, it was a REALY dark night, so i could only see the lights, not any aircraft) were like a triangle pointing down (3 lights): 2 on top and one in the middle of the 2, but slightly below, connected by a thin light to each other (forming a V).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were looking out of our windows and we saw 1 large amber colored orb. Then,the large amber orb,appeared to shoot out 4 more smaller amber colored orbs. The first large orb immediately dissapeared. The other four dimmed and left as well. They soon appeared yet again. They were all around the sky. One was in front of the suburban,dimmed and reappeared once more. And then 2 orbs,very closely together,appeared again on the right side. They dimmed and left. Then a few more appeared diagnol in front. They were higher than radio towers,about as high as helicopters usually fly, but lower than planes. They didn&#39;t give off a bright glow.There was no sound,or hum or flashes or anything. It made us all uneasy. It was big,brighter than airplane lights,brighter than the brightest stars.This happened from around 6:45pm CST to 7:30pm CST. We didn&#39;t really note the exact time,but those are closest since we got back to our school around 8:15. Although,the odd thing,it didn&#39;t appear over any city we went through on the way back to our school. We were coming home from Lindsborg,saw them on the way to Geneseo, saw them again on the way to Lyons.But didn&#39;t see them through Lyons,or the 3 miles before Lyons,or the 8 miles in between Lyons and Sterling,my town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a full account of what happened. Again,5 others saw the same things. There were four airplanes not far from the 1st orb that dispensed the other 4 orbs. They were not the orbs. We also saw two airplanes that looked like they were fueling up or something.They were very close. These were not the orbs either.They are just other aircrafts we saw the same time we saw the orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While driving South on IH-45 approaching the League City, TX exit, I saw (as though it appeared out of nowhere) a triangular shaped craft sitting very low (maybe 25 ft above the ground).  I had time to see it, look to my left to see if I could pull over on the side of the road, look back and up - pulling myself closer to the steering wheel of my truck.  As I went underneath it, I could see the bottom of the craft - dark, not smooth.  It was dark outside and there were lights with a yellowish global glow/look to them all the way around the craft which made it&#39;s shape very easy to define.  Looking in my rearview mirror, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was quite large.  It was low on the horizon, so low that it wasn&#39;t visible at times behind the trees.  it travelled fast, but slower than an airplane, from East to West.  I estimated it to be over Interstate Hwy. 10 or a few miles N. of it.  I saw it first from my residence for a few seconds, then behind trees, then visible again.  I drove to Country Club Drive and saw the glowing object heading west, becoming smaller and smaller, until the &#34;glow&#34; disappeared.  It was shaped like a flattened football, and appeared quite large.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be moving at high speed although we later debated the speed of the craft at some length. One of us thought that it was moving slowly and for a period was stopped, another thought that it moved at extemely high speed. One thought that it changed directions a number of times. We are confused about the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very bright, and the only object in the sky. It was roundish in shape but probably oval would be more accurate. It seemed big. It was clearly red in colour.  There were no other colours present. Just a steady red glowing light. This was what made it stand out so clearly. It was nearly time for the sun to go down, and the sky was white. Here the night hours start very early due to the location on the globe. The sun was down but there was still light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was not the northern lights, a star, the sun, a planet, a meteor or anything else we have seen before. Other people saw this object while stopped at one of the main intersections near the hospital and Wal-mart. We could see them looking at the object from their vehicles as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared, from our location, to be right over the main part of the city, and then moved off over Great Slave Lake. We were driving at the time, on our way to the vets to pick up a dog, and when we came out of the vet clinic the object was gone, but the night sky was still bright enough to see that it was gone. It was no star. It moved deliberatly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was interesting, but we were not terribly upset or frightened. Just left with a sense of &#34;What in the world was that?&#34;<n>

After a few minutes he walked back to his room;I thought he was sleep walking.  After a few minutes he came back and sat down again; then he went outside.  He came back in and went back to his room; again I thought he was sleepwalking.  When he returned a third time, I asked him what he was doing.  He told me to come outside to see something.  When I got outside he pointed to a bright light that appeared to be hovering over the tree line about 4 miles away.  He then flashe his flashlight at the light and the light moved away from the tree&#39;s and shot up the sky at about 40 degrees.  I thought to myself; weird!  He then pointed his flashlight at a second light and the same thing occured.  What were these lights.  I am a vet of the U.S. Army; worked as an Air Traffic Controller.  I have never seen any aircraft that can do what these strange lights were doing.  I went back into the house to get the cam, but could not locate a tape to record.  I went back outside and my brother was in the back yard observing a different set of lights over the valley.  We live in Mariposa CA just a few miles from Yosemite.  The lights my brother was now observing appeared to get closer when he flashed them with his flashlight.  I was spooked!!!  I returned to the front of the house and observed the 1st lights.  After a hour of observing the lights; I went on the internet to research any information of this occuring in this area.  I found what I was looking for right away.  The lights that are recorded on www.sonorasightings.com are the same lights we were observing.  Sonora is just about 1 hour from here, aslo in the Sierra Mountains of California.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was visable as it flew through the low, blowing, broken overcast. Five orange lights were visable running around the circumference of the object, none were particularly bright. I would estimate its altitude was between 1,500-3000 feet, and its speed between 50-80 mph. (quite slow) The direction of travel was east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were three orange lights aligned horizontally with a fourth light directly beneath the middle light. These lights seemed spherical, and larger than Mars, which is visible. They appeared for 1-2 seconds, flashed two or three more times, and  there was haze around them.  Then small blinking white strobes were visible in a large surrounding vicinity. I initially thought that these were multiple tiny aircraft, but it became evident that no small aircraft could follow such erratic courses. It was obvious that a few grouped together, flew off to the right, and then returned. About this time i called for my daughter to come look, because she said she had seen an orange light driving home one night.  We observed a plane liftoff over the ocean from the local airport, heading North, and a few moments after it turned, the lights reappeared, but with different formations. The first to appear was a line of approximately 3 orange lights, which quickly faded, giving way to a similar shape which immediately appeared about 5 degrees below and to the left, and soon accompanied by another similar construction of lights. After these faded away, there were about five or six strobes visible to the naked eye. They had no obvious destination or pattern until some began to closely group together and gravitate towards the center of Orion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were afterburners, then maybe engines that had caught on fire, but realized that the configuration was wrong.  The tiny strobes made me think that it might be a prank, and that the strobes were small aircraft until we noticed the erratic pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They seemed to be going pretty fast and making maneuvers I have never seen in a modern day aircraft, they flew off and i watched them until i could not see their lights anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They would hoover for a while, get bright, and then move downbehind some trees. The light illuminated the skies in the valley they were flying over (between the cascades.) Often, the light emitting from all around the craft, forming a circle, or ball of light, would get very bright, and then it would dim to almost nothing. They kept basically glowing and diming, then two of them disapeared and one remained. After about an hour, another one came back up and was gone again. We saw alot of smoke coming from the area they were around before they would disapear. Then they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first thing I thought of was a flare because of the size and brightness of the light. After that I thought it may have been a commet,but then I came to the conclusion it was nether because of its flight pattern. This object traveled a very short disstance horizonally in the sky. This object never made any noise that I heard. Soon after this happened I called my wife and told her what happenend. For something that took only a short time it really scared me and I will never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

S.|OH|Unknown|30 minutes +|Airline pilots see strange lights approaching Cincinnati|12/14/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41025.html|228|ndxe200412| Airline pilots see strange lights approaching((City name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m an airline pilot and have been flying a total of 26 years. On a flight from ((city name deleted)) on the evening of 12-07-04 ; 21:45 local time, we were approximately 150nm to the northeast of cvg at flight level 310. Just prior to begining our descent, I noticed 3 lights at our 11 to 12 o&#39;clock postion. There was an overcast layer of clouds way down below topping at 8000 feet and crisp clear moonless sky above. The lights caught my attention because they were moving unlike those of commercial aircraft. I immediately assumed they were military and thought they might be flying in the area of Buckeye MOA. I was on with Indy center and asked them if Buckeye was hot and they said that no aircraft were in there tonight. I continued to watch the lights and their movements as we descended. I checked on with the next Indy &#34;low&#34; sector and asked this new controller if Buckeye was hot and &#34;No&#34; was again the answer. I then began to describe to the controller the lights that we were seeing and their movements and direction from our postion. Another airline pilot on the frequency backed up my description. The lights would periodically move vertically very rapidly down then back up to a hover. The lights would line up at an equal distance apart in this hover parallel to the horizon. The strangest thing that I saw was that all three lights then moved horizontally a small distance in unison. I thought that maybe I was staring too long and it was my eyes causing the movement that most people will experience when they stare at a star for instance. The star might appear to move or drift if stared at too long. So, I looked away at the fixed cloud deck below but kept the lights in my poriferal vision. They still moved. I tested my vision again looking repeatedly away in different directions and confirmed that they were all moving together in unison. Then occasionally one light would be brighter than the others and then fade. At one point they all disappeared for a couple of minutes and then all reappeared together. There were also times when only one or two lights were visible at one time as well. They were not commercial aircraft and not military aircraft in formation as I know what they look like. Also, at 150nm from cvg, it looked as though the lights were in the vicintiy of cvg but as we got closer to our destination, we could see that they were much further away in the distance and so I could not even guess on their range. Again, the most striking characteristics were the movements in unison and the high velocity they appeared to have whether it was vertical or horizontal. I&#39;ve never seen any aircraft do that, military or otherwise in all my years of flying.<n>

12/7/04 21:00|Kingsport|TN|Diamond|15-25 minutes|A large amount of UFO's in the sky, including a low flying one that was nearly silent and a sort of diamond shape with 5 lights.|12/14/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41023.html|230|ndxe200412| A large amount of UFO&#39;s in the sky, including a low flying one that was nearly silent and a sort of diamond shape with 5 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next door neighbor came over to use the phone and mentioned that while we had been to the store, she was knocking on our door to show us a UFO that she had spotted in the sky. That&#39;s not the sort of thing that I usually accept as a possibility, but about a month before this, I spotted something odd in the sky as well and so did a few others, but it was too high up to be sure exactly what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife went outside to smoke a cigarette and the neighbor was heading back over to her apartment when I heard them both call for me to come see something. They sounded like it was urgent, so I grabbed up my son out of his playpen and headed outside to see what was up. They pointed up to the sky and there were bluish, rather dim lights that almost looked like stars, but they were moving in a mostly straight pattern across the sky. They were going reasonably fast, but not any faster than an airplane might fly. But then, we looked around longer and realized that there were more of them, and not all of them were flying the same direction. Some where going straight and some were curving around. Others flew by that had reddish or amber lights instead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I&#39;ve seen lots of planes, but these did not fly like planes or helicopters, or any type of aircraft that I&#39;ve ever laid eyes on. Not to mention, some of the lower flying ones appeared to have more than one light, and they tended to be in a diamond/triangular type shape. My neighbor, wife and I all stood there awestruck for minutes pointing out to each other when another one would fly into view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was all truely amazing, but there was more to come. All of the sudden, we saw one  fly across MUCH lower than all of the others and it flew quite slowly (slow enough that an airplane would have stalled out), where we had a plain view of the shape and lighting of it. It&#39;s very hard to explain and I wish I had remembered to grab my camera, but I was in shock and could not think straight until it had already passed out of sight. The lights were mostly blue and in a diamond shape with 5 lights, although some of the lights alternated between red, blue and green. The rear of the object was a little longer than the rest of it. There were no corners or points anywhere on the object...it was completely smooth and rounded, yet it still had a diamond type shape. It was no more than 500 ft in the air above us, and when it went right over, I could vaguely see a disc type shape on the bottom, and some sort of strange markings that were illuminated slightly by the lights, but it was hard to make out and really unlike anything I&#39;ve seen. It was also nearly completely silent. I couldn&#39;t really hear it at all, but my wife said she heard a slight humming noise. It was obvious that it was not a helicopted or plane, because I&#39;ve heard them both fly over at that altitude, and they made LOTS of noise. This made almost none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to take the baby in, since it was getting really windy not long after this, but apparently my wife spotted two more diamond shaped UFO&#39;s a few minutes later. I had my wife come in a watch the baby so I could look at the sky some more and I noticed several other lights...flashing this time in the sky. Those were obviously airplanes (about 5 of them). They were flying around the area, sort of making passes, like they were searching for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was probably 5 minutes before 8 when it happened. As i was turning in to the parking lot I saw a group of what looked light glowing balls of light come out of knowhere, they didn&#39;t seem to be in any formation at the time and I was like stuart Do You See That and he was like yeah and then these &#34;glowing balls&#34; formed into a  line that  sort of looked like the were turning either towards us or away and as they turned we could see that the turned into like a streamline of light and then they just Dissappeared just like that.  So it was like, no formation of glowing balls, formation and moving in the same direction and then to a perfect line then dissapeared.  We were shocked!  It was amazing! And later we both discussed the fact that the lights looked sort of like the yellow caution lights you see on roads, but from a distance. Also if that was some sort of military aircraft turning in flight then it was a HUGE one maybe the size of a b-52.  But, the fact that it went from no frormation to formation boggled our minds.  I&#39;m happy that there was a sight to post this on, it makes me feel a little better about the whole&#34;situation&#34;. Thanks!!  Robert Randow<n>

The storm was tracking nearly straight west to east and I was looking south down the line of the approaching storm. I only took one picture at that time and didn&#39;t see anything unusual flying in the sky. It took me a few days to even review the pic on my camera before I noticed something odd. It took me a couple of more days to get my camera&#39;s photo software installed on my computer, download the picture, and import it into Paint Shop Pro. The orginal picture shows two unusual lights in the sky, one dim one in the upper left and the obvious one in the upper right. All I&#39;ve done in Paint Shop Pro is to brighten the image, do a couple of zooms on the lights, and create a negative image of the light on the right side. The zoomed light on the right appears to me to have a energetic field around it, and the negative of it makes this look even more apparent. If these are actual objects, they would have to have been shooting upward into the dark storm clouds so fast that I never saw them. I&#39;ve seen my share of air traffic in the area, but with that storm rolling in, there wasn&#39;t a plane in the sky. Other than fighter jets, I&#39;ve never seen any aircraft flying upward at such steep angles, and never into a storm! I&#39;m also certain there were no sounds of any jets in the area at that time either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we came near a town called oakwood,ga a light about 3 to 5 miles away shot down at around 35 degrees, from left to right. The highway only has to the sides just trees. But the weird part was that it never hit the ground. the light apeared like a firefly does and it shot a clean even light at an estemated 35 degrees and again disapeared like i said a firefly does with its light. not a flame or any smoke was seen. it was not a plane the plane would of crashed. not a meteor or shooting star becase it was a even light so clead and shooting so cleanly. It was the clearest night sky.  It did not look like it was out of control but at a high speed very high. The light was i say the size of a van and even from front to back. the light shot the length of one side of the highway to the other side. It was a four lane highway. I saw it my brother in passenger seat saw it my girlfriend had a scare she was all nervouse all night long. None of us believed i still dont know what it was. Do u? please to calm me a bit give me an explanation. please. there was no trail or smoke. other cars saw it because when it happened other cars put the brakes on!<n>

They were using bright search lights, sweeping the ocean looking for it. This search went on for several hours during the night.

I looked into the sky, and at first I thought it was a very bright star above one of the trees, not too far away. I was surprised by its changing colors - pink, yellow, green. I thought: &#34;Wow, what a beautiful star, and it&#39;s sparkling! When I looked at other stars, they all were dim, and so far away, and motioneless. And this one was alive. As I kept watching, I realized that it was moving slowly and rays of light of different size came out of it. It looked like a miniature lightning, only it was not dissappearing. I couldn&#39;t see the shape of it or details of the craft, I could only see the rays of light, stretching far out of it. It was there for a couple of hours and during that time,  it has moved a considerable distance. From my place I had to walk two meters from my original position to be able to keep watching it. Its path wasn&#39;t straight, as it was making small moves and circles around. I didn&#39;t wait until the end, and went to sleep. It was in the sky for about two hours. Most of other people were sleeping at the time, so, I don&#39;t know anyone else who&#39;d seen it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was my first encounter with UFO. I have a Master&#39;s degree in humanities, have never hallucinated or been on drugs or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From a distance the light seemed very bright and white.  As we drove closer, the craft remained on a steady path, and began to look not like any normal aircraft.  Once we were close enough to see that it had outer bright white lights on the tips of what seemed to be a triangle or diamond shape; it was difficult to determine as it was dark.  In addition to the white lights, there where blue and red sort of scrolling lights in between the white light tipped outer corners of the craft.  We stopped the car and got out and listened and watched.  It was very quite this night, the craft flew almost directly over top of where we had stopped and emitted no sound whatsoever.  We watched at this time the craft just drift over and then away from us in virtually the same direction the entire time.  I would like to point out that the craft was drifting at a speed that was too slow for any airplane, but at a constant rate.  I would guess 50-70 km/hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was silver/gray with blinking orange/yellow lights evenly spaced all the way around it. It was about 8 stories above the ground. There were no houses/buildings anywhere in the immediate area. It did not appear to move at all, just hover. The vehicle immediately behind me turned his lights off, back on, then turned his high beams on several times, flashing me to get my attention I assume. I slowed down to get a good look at the object but did not stop, as I was alone with my 3yr old son. I arrived home about 10 minutes later &amp; told my boyfriend what I had seen, and we got back in the car with our DVcamcorder and went looking for it. I backtracked and was able to locate the field where I saw it, but it was not present. We drove a way in both directions to see if it had moved, but did not see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We saw the green light too !!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I were leaving a relatives house that night, headed in a northern direction, I Just happened to look up When I was putting My vehicle in gear, and noticed the green light pretty much on top of us. The object was very Large, was comparable to a full moon or larger, in fact,I cannot compare the size to anything..it was very large.It was a floresent or Irridecent green in color and it had an Orb or a Sphere shape, and there was, what i can only describe as a static completely around the object ,that seemed to light up the area around us ( This was not a beam of light but just the light from around the object). The object was moving just above the tree line to cross over us, and made no sound at all. It was moving in a N-NW direction ( Crossing Hwy 19 / 98, Toward the Gulf Of Mexico )  at a fast rate of speed, the object appeard to be decending, ( In fact, I was expecting to hear an impact, once it had passed us) But then, It just disappeared behind the tree line. I remember thinking... no way, no how, someone else saw that... I searched the internet, looked at NASA an NOAA pages, checked the news for weeks and no reports.Just happy to know someone else saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> **.... and for the skeptics, I was raised in boats growing up and thru adult hood as our livelyhood, I can identify stars ( as taught as a child how to find my way home if anything ever happened) and I have seen many things in the sky, and this was no star,comet,meteor,plane,blimp,weather baloon or otherwise....<n>

A flying object traveled northbound next to the turnpike above the treeline in a straight line, dipped and turned up and to the northeast at an incredibly high rate of speed before it completely disappeared. I could not make out the shape of the object - it was a bright, flourescent green light that left a trail as it moved. I have never seen anything move that quickly in the sky (or on land or sea for that matter). I&#39;m 40 years old and have never seen anything like this in my life, nor have I ever looked for it. I cannot explain it and feel strange even having seen it. It was too big to be a model plane or a firefly or some logical explanation. It was too fast to be a small plane or helicopter. The light was not a projected beam because it was self-propelled and moved with precision and purpose. And it disappeared after it changed direction upward and to the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had no vapor trail as did the air plane, and it changed direction once or twice and then disappeared. There were no clouds for it to fly behind, just clear sky. the event lasted about 5 - 10 seconds. 30 seconds later it reappeared in a slightly different location behind its initial direction of movement, stayed stationary and vanished yet again. Object appeared for a third time and made several directional changes, no vapor trail again and vanished once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A few seconds after the two lights disappeared in the north horizon, identical lights appeared again behind the south side of the stadium and follow the exact same trajectory.  A few seconds after these two lights dissappeared, a third set of lights crossed the sky, following the same trajectory as the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first glance I thought it was an airplane on approach to O&#39;Hare as the light was flickering between blue &amp; white with a very random red flash mixed in.  After a few minutes I asked my parents to verify that it was flashing and they both confirmed.  We all agreed that it must have been a planet and went inside.  After a lot of boring researche online, I could not find a reasonable planetary explanation.  A couple of hours later it wass gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

12/4/04 20:30|Burlington (south of)|IN|Triangle|20 minutes|Orange flashes followed by appearance of objects|12/14/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41036.html|264|ndxe200412| Orange flashes followed by appearance of objects<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last Friday, Decemeber 3rd, 2004, I was driving to Kokomo, Indiana from Lafayette, Indiana. While heading eastbound on State Road 26 at around 8:30 pm, give or take about 15 minutes, an orange burst of light caught my attention in my peripheral vision. The night was clear, there were no clouds. I saw an orange light, at first like a dim star, which grew in size or intensity to about four times the size and brightness of Venus. Then another light seemed to grow near this one in the same manner, at about 10 o&#39;clock the original objects position. Then the first object faded out followed by the second. This took place over a 10-20 second period. After this happened, I noticed two objects remaining equidistant circle the area. From my position facing east, they started at the eleven o&#39;clock position and moved to the two o&#39;clock position, and then back again, from left to right. Vertically, if the ground is at  90 degrees and straight up is zero degrees, they were at about 50 degrees up. I have no experience judging distance so this is the only way I can relate it, I hop it helps! Once these two objects returned to the position I originally noticed them, I noticed several other objects, three, I believe. They converged in one central area of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I pulled off the road to watch them more closely at the state road 26 and state road 29 intersection. I observed the same appearance of the orange lights that I described earlier. Each time I witnessed that, I observed another object. They totalled seven at this point. They were flying in all directions in the sky, but circling to the north of 26. They were about one half the brightness of venus. At some times they were flying quickly while others seemed to maintain position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects themselves flashed white, but intermittently. This is why I was so interested in them, never seeing an airplane like that. The two objects that were keeping the same distance between them as I described earlier seemed to be flashing at eachother. One would flash several times, for different durations, a quick flash followed by a long, at a seemingly random interval. Then the other would start flashing just as the original ended. It reminded me of the lights on a broadband modem, when the computer is connecting to the internet. Once there were seven objects all flying in random directions one flew directly over my position. I can&#39;t judge the altitude of it, but it wasn&#39;t as high as those jet liners that are seen at night... probably not helping. it was about the size of venus in the sky, but not as bright. The object that flew over me appeared to by triangular, although that was hard to judge. It had three red areas, that looked like the tips of a triangle. the outer points were the brightest, fading into black at the center. It resembled a peice of metal when a torch is held on one side until it gets red hot, fading into the opposite, cooler edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects maintained their seemingly random flight paths and then fell in line heading southwest at an incredible rate of speed from my position at the intersection . They would have bursts of light that became more uniform in interval instead of the random flashes from earlier, and then accelerated across the sky. I phoned my brother to look outside at home (romney, indiana) to look outside to see if he could see them. He looked east from our house half a mile from US 231 and he saw them. He reported that they were moving at an unbelievable speed and reported that he saw one start flashing really quick and take off. They headed south out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects slowly drifted to the northwest, maintaining the same angle to eachother, disappeared and reappeared and then continued in the same direction until gone for good.  I&#39;ve seen these objects many times in the past: on clear days, if you look deeply into the blue sky, you can see them, sometimes more than one, sometimes in a formation, always at the same altitude and slowly drifting around.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light on the object was circular, I could tell it was attached to a a craft but couldn&#39;t see a craft because it was dark outside. The object was roughly 50 feet to 100 feet above my car, and as it passed over and I went to slow my car down to catch a glance, the object vanished before my eyes. The car behind me slowed down, I&#39;m guesing he saw it too, however I didn&#39;t not turn around to ask him what he witnessed. The object made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I seen a bright white saucer or disk shape craft orbiting the moon at its terminus.

It appears in the clouds as a horizontal oval formation of many circular lights that rotate around in the shape of this oval in a direction opposite the motion of the entire formation.  For example, when the formation moves from left to right, the circular white lights rotate in a counterclockwise direction.  This repeats from left to right... dissapears....right to left....dissapears...left to right and so on for the duration of around 1hour.  It was first seen by a coworker who pointed it out and showed it to others.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I leaned back to look at the stars as it was a very clear night and the stars very bright. I viewed a very large V moving overhead from NE toward SW. I said &#34;what the heck is that&#34; everyone looked up and briefly saw what I was looking at. At first I thought it was a large flock of Geese, but the formation was too purfect and much straighter that a V of geese. It appeared to be a formation of smaller odjects because it was not a solid V I could see the stars behind the center of the V. Each individual object was a small square and appeared to be lit up. The color was soft orange like a harvest moon color. The squares on one side of the V looked a little more ragged than the other side. The whole grouping moved steady but quickly across the sky. We may have had a view for 6-8 seconds and it was gone out of sight behind trees in our neighbors yard. There was no sound at all. All of us saw the object(s) the same as we discussed it after it was gone, and all had a very strange feeling that it was like nothing any of us had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought I was seeing a Plane, but Planes don&#39;t spin.  This group of lights spun in a counter clock wise motion and took about  10 seconds to make a revalution.  It also drifted to the west in a hover from about mile post 165 to the east end of town.  Then the rotation stopped and the craft moved straight North.  At this point I had pulled off to the side of the road and got out of my truck.  the light were shaped in a Trapezoid formation with a spot light in the center that would come on  intermitantly.  What ever this craft was it did not make the sounds that a helocopter makes.  The only thing I heard was a low  continues whooshing sound heavy on the osh part.  I stood there for about four minutes watching this object light up the country side with a bright white circle  until it was about a mile or so North then the craft shot straight up and out of site.  The whole time I watched this craft it was about 700 feet above the ground and I also saw the normal passenger jet aircraft in the sky but they were traveling at their normal altitudes 20k  feet or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No lights were displayed anywhere on the crafts hence drawing my attention. They  made an unusual maneuver which no aircraft usually makes. They appeared to turn end over end then straighten out and instead of traveling together as Military aircraft do, these were sandwiched together and moved indistinguishable of one another. Because it was night it was difficult to tell if it was a single ship or two traveling together. They were enormous and moved without making a sound. An approximate distance from where I stood was about 1500&#39; and their size although hard to gage, was about 50 to 75 in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved out of view without any further incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/3/04 19:45|Los Angeles|CA|Triangle|60 seconds|Huge triangle with red lights|12/14/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40931.html|275|ndxe200412| Huge triangle with red lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking North in my neighborhood of West Hollywood, I noticed a red light in the sky, then a moment later, I saw a second red light moving in tandem with the first light (from my perspective about an arm&#39;s length away from each other).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was maybe military (being in tandem and all). I then noticed a third light up ahead of the other two, forming a perfect triangle.  All moving in unison, heading North.  The three lights would pulse at the same moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, I realized there was the vague outline of a mass connecting these three red lights.  Then I watched as four or five other lights pulsed along the outer edge of the triangle, with more lights being on the western edge of the object. I could not detect any pattern to the flashing of these other lights.  A couple of times all seven or eight were on at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t gage its altitude, but whether it was low or high, this thing was huge.  If it was just up a few thousand feet, you could fit dozens of commercial jets within its base outline.  If it was really high up -- well, it would be beyond massive.  One of those sweeping, movie premiere-style spotlights swept under the object and didn&#39;t touch it, so it was at least higher than those things can project light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could detect no sound, the street I was on was quiet and I can normally hear aircraft (but I am still in a city).  The sky was clear (recent rain has made it noticibly so).  It seemed to glide across the sky and was just to my West, putting the object near the 405 highway.  Was anyone else looking up then?  Someone had to see this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The moon looked normal, however; light as bright as the moon was shooting out making the moon twice the size.  It looked like it had possibly an large asteroid impact and debris was moving away from the lunar surface.  I really think it was a powerful light source.  It was about 85 degrees from the ESE.  I began taking shots, then called my friends and asked them to look.  Carry and Amy.  They were awe struck.  This is what happened.  We had some very thin Cumulus Stratus clouds.  When the clouds passed, it was even brighter and alien to me.  I focused my camera and saw to orbs moving  toward the moon from WSW.  Then they disappeared, then reappeared .  They were moving in harmony, then quickly separated as on craft moved faster than the other.  The other caught up and they joined as one.  I will forward your picks as soon as I can.  Sorry for upsetting you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards  ((name and telephone number deleted))<n>

My buddy was driving on our way home from work and I, as I do every time on the road at night, was looking for strange craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Typically I see these triangles over my home in Tracy Ca as they are the ones flying the lowest, quietest, and slowest over the town, usually in groups of two to three, one after another, in the same path.  Friday nights view was the best I&#39;ve ever had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I see up above, a standard plane, similar to a U2, with no lights on.  It had a red and green light, and no others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two minutes later, as I scan ahead of us, all of a sudden there it was.  It appeared out of no where. Nowhere was it in front of us until, I must have blinked, and there were two lights ahead and sllight right of us, about 1-2 miles from us.  Freeway is packed and as we pass to the left of the craft, it was no more than 500 yards to my right and 250 yards up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a perfect triangle with three big lights in each corner.  Center was a tiny light and between each big light and the center light was a medium light.  This was by far the best vision of this triangle I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled down my window pointing and my buddy didnt get to see it all lit up, sort of hovering to the right like I did.  Traffic was heavy.  Often these planes come in and appear to land or hover about the Sunol grade area, just before the 84 exit.  This one either was invisible and came out at that moment, or perhaps he was moving at such a quick speed that when he stopped, I was able to view him.  Amazing!<n>

I live in apartments where you can see just over the tree line. I was putting up Christmas lights, on my porch when I saw a very strange light. Extreemly bright blue, almost like a pulsating blue. I know that it wasn&#39;t an airplane because it was admitting one bright blue light. Also, most of the planes must have seen something because it was bright enough that from there view it must have been a sight to see. As I watched it, it shot stright up in the sky and left a &#34;light trail&#34; behind it. I lost it because of the cloud cover that evening but I know that it couldn&#39;t have been a commercial plane because of the speed. When I told my friends about it they just laughed and said I was seeing things. This was my first &#34;sighting&#34; of what I couldn&#39;t explain. Its my first UFO sighting, in my words.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This object that i saw looked to be cigar to cylinder shaped and was going towards the northwest and is looked to be faily high in the sky.  that fact that it was that high in the sky was what led me to belive it was a ufo because if it had been a plane there would have surely been contrails coming from behind it.  Also of note their were many military jets flying around the area shortly after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also an hour before the sighting i was listening to wtam 1100 am to the mike trivisanno show and he said along with another caller that he seen a ufo about the same shape earlier that day.

We were going camping for the last time this year, before it gets real cold. We had a camp fire going and we had been getting ready to put it out when we decided to just let it burn itself out instead. One of the three of us commented on how clear it was for once, since it had been overcast for the last few days. We then started picking out the names of constalations that we were able to point out. Thats when we saw what we think was a UFO. There was a slight haze or light glow around the object. At first it seemed more like a distand planet but after a while we noticed it was more than that. It was actually moving, slowly moving but moving. The first thing that came to mind was that it was a plane, except planes dont just stay around one spot. Then we thought about a helicopter or something of that sort, but there is no reason a chopper should be floating arount there, nor did it really look like one. It was hard to tell the shape of the object be cause the glow caused the object to look blurred. We discussed our new topic of intrest for a while, wondering what it could be. We had gotten away from gazing dumbfoundedly at it for a while only to look back and notice a second glow. At first it seemed unreal, but after the two moved in diffrent patterns and stayed relatively close, we knew it wasnt anything normal. We decided that we would go on with our night as we planned but the happening stayed in the back of our minds all night. We didnt watch them until they went away but the time that we did spend watching them lasted about 10 to fifteen minutes, not including the time spent discussing the objects between the time the first one and second one appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, I thought it was one of the many airplanes they have here at the airforce base but this particular flashing light was unusual, because it appeared to be flashing up and down. I lost sight of the flashing light so i decided to go and get my siter, on our way back we were passing right by the Sheriff&#39;office, when we noticed a flashing light that was not very high, we thought it was a helicoper but there was no sound, then suddenly the whole light changed to red and it was flashing quite fast, it moved towards the city and we lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The stars began to move, take shape and formed a triangle with three lights, the craft then began a series of maneuvers without making a sound. The craft stood on end but floated slowly down, it momentarily was surrounded by a slight puff of white haze, the rear of the craft was slightly rounded, recessed from the end of the wing tips of the triangle. The craft 1/2 rolled and banked showing it&#39;s top, which was the blackest, black I have ever seen. If it had a windshield it did not show, it&#39;s lines were very low and defined. It came around me, climbing slowly, then went up, made a maneuver I can&#39;t understand except, it made a loop without changing direction of the front point of the craft and it went straight up out of sight. Every animal was making noise, dog barking, racoon screaming, birds night flying and my heart pounding. My hearing is outstanding and no noise, no exhaust trail, nothing!! If this is a secret project, I can&#39;t believe the spaceshuttle is patches, it wasn&#39;t a B-117A, B2, F/A-22 Raptor or anything I&#39;ve read about, this thing was pure machine.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was on my way to an evening class.  I exited Cumberland Parkway onto I-64 ((CORRECTION BELOW:  I-65)), about 15 miles north of Bowling Green (or 75 miles north of Nashville).  I was travelling westbound on this 6 lane stretch of highway;it is  generally a N/S highway but this stretch from the Mammoth Cave Area to BG is east/west; traffic was moderate.  I saw in the sky in front of me what looked like three military jets.  There is often air traffic from Fort Campbell to the west.  The three &#34;planes&#34; were close together, but all three seemed to be going in different directions.  They were about 1/4 to 1/3 up from the horizon. Because they were low in the late afternoon sky it looked like they were illuminated by the sun.  It was a mostly sunny day.  Two of the objects looked like planes moving directly away from me, i.e. also travelling westbound, because they looked like little reflective, vaguely diamond shaped points of light.  As represented by the scale of my hand at arm&#39;s length from my face, the appeared to be about the size of wooden matchheads, about 10 inches apart, and both at the same height;  the third object just looked like a short contrail line (maybe 1 inch long on that same scale, in a horizontal plane, and appearing to be moving to the north, VERY SLOWLY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were quite distinct and quite bright.  I thought little of it, but the odd thing was that they seemed to be together, yet going in three directions.  Actually, the two  diamond objects, I observed, did not seem to be moving at all, but the line object was moving to the right, ever so slowly.  They were directly in front of me and quite bright, thus easy to watch continuously.  After about 10 minutes the diamonds still had not moved, but now the line, which didn&#39;t change shape, started moving back towards the diamonds.  After 10 minutes I knew that this was something that I could not explain.  I did notice that the objects were beginning to set like planets or stars.  Perhaps they were satellites, but were very fixed, except for the line one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 minutes, I stopped at a rest area right before my exit, to see if I could talk to someone else about this phenomenon, or corroborate what I saw.  I asked one man, and he noticed it and saw it for a long time as well.  I also asked a trucker and he hadn&#39;t noticed it.  By this time it was getting close to sunset, and the objects were too low in the sky to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to class, the professor was tardy and I took the opportunity to ask my fellow students if any of them had seen it.  Only one man, who came along the same route, saw exactly the same thing that I described, although he though that the thin &#34;line&#34; object was spinning.  He also agreed that the two diamond objects were in a fixed relationship, the one to the other, while the other object moved back and forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Does anybody have any explanation for this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((CORRECTION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Correction to my entry - I-65 and not I-64<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was listening to your show tonight and checked an old entry I made.

At this pointI began to move in order to better view the object. The light then grew dim and I realized that it posessed the shape of a pyramid. It slowed down and began to move up and down very slowly. I noticed a reddish flare shoot out of the top at which time the craft jetted down even lower. The light at this point had become nearly undetectable, however I could still view the shape and relative size of said object. It eventually left our field of vision and I rejoined the rest of the witnesses. I asked what one of them who had seen it and his description matched mine perfectly.

I could not have missed it, as it was an extremely bright (almost white) blue light, that I took to be flames similar to something entering the atmosphere.  However, this was many times larger than any comet, meteors, or such than I had seen before, and the object appeared very close.  It lit up at a low altitude, from what I could see, and went out just one or two seconds later.  The sight sent a chill down my spine.  I was surprised there was nothing on the news and thought nothing of it, but last night and tonight I have seen planes flying in formation, low to the ground, in that vicinity.  I have never seen them around before, so I figured that maybe there was something to it.

Cal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Riverside/Norco California.  I have been closely observing the skies over these two cities since Nov 2003.  At that time i observed (on 11/16/03)a very large and bright and beautiful &#34;star&#34; in the eastern sky.  It was a sight to behold! It didn&#39;t just twinkle, it was a light show all by its self!!  Red, green. blue,gold and purple beams of light shooting out from it!! and as I cont. to watch it, I realized that this &#34;star&#34; was actually moving horizontally back and fourth as if it was flying! Well needless to say, the night skies captivated my full attention from that day on and I was hooked on astronomy and the possibility of UFO&#39;s in the skies over Norco California!!  Well, I did some investigating and the awesome star I saw I believe is Serius. The brightest star above earth.  It becomes visible to So. Cal in November through around March or so.  And although I know Serius IS a star...I have to say that I have never seen a star with the likes of this star in my 48 years on earth.  I know Serius has been around for probally millions of years, but I never noticed it before that Nov 2003 night.  How i missed it, I don&#39;t know.  And what makes it appear to be flying in the sky,I don&#39;t know either. Well anyways, I have had my eye on the sky ever since, and let me tell you, that I have seen many unexplainable as well as unbelieveable &#34;strange&#34; flying &#34;stars&#34; in our skies over So. Cal. First of all, when you look up in the sky just after dark, there are 3 bright lights in the sky that always stay in a triangle formation.  They look just like bright stars,but if you&#39;ve got a bit of patience, just sit down in a chair in a dark area,free from city lights, and watch those &#34;stars&#34;  Before long you&#39;re gunna notice that they are actually flying around in the sky.  They almost always stay within a certain radius from their original resting place, I&#39;ve never seen them just take off and jam across the sky.  It&#39;s as if they have a certain area to guard and they stay within that area.  I&#39;ve seen beams of light shoot out from these &#34;stars&#34; across the night sky for miles. Lately they have taken on a strange flouresent green hue, and when they &#34;fly&#34; they will luminize the whole sky around them which also turns flouresent green. Actually they are surrounded by vapor clouds and that&#39;s what lights up in the sky.  These clouds materalize and evaporate with the movement of these objects. The flying stars were observed all throughout this year. The color change took place in the middle of Nov. Will some of you see if you can see the same such mysterous objects in the sky over your own cities?? If you do, write a short discription of what YOU see here at this web site.  It&#39;ll be very interesting to hear other peoples stories about the &#34;flying stars&#34; and what YOU think they really are.  Thank You!!<n>
