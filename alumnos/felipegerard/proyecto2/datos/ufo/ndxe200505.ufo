5/31/05 20:00|Greene/Lewiston|ME|Other|30-45 seconds|A large UFO passes slowly a few hundred feet above us, then goes to warp speed.|3/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108046.html|3|ndxe200505| A large UFO passes slowly a few hundred feet above us, then goes to warp speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening in the spring or summer of 2005 my wife and I were in our family room, with the doors to our deck open (screens were closed), watching a TV show about NASA and deep space exploration.  I would guess it was on the discovery channel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the show got to the part about the kind of special engine it would take to travel millions of miles, they showed an animation of a satellite and played the sound of the engine…  which sounded like a hot-air balloon, when it’s burning gas to heat the air inside it (a constant Cauuuuu sound).<n> <n><n> <n><n> But what caught our attention, was when the show went to commercial, the sound continued???  So I went out onto our deck, we lived on the edge of a forest at the time, and looked up expecting to see a hot air balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But what I saw, was a spaceship, a big spaceship that seemed to be defying gravity.  It was a hundred or two feet in front of me, and few hundred feet above the ground, not going very fast.  Going left to right, perpendicular to our house and deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FYI – In the direction I was looking there are no roads, no houses, or lights, just forest and marsh, for about a mile and a half, and no airports nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called my wife out to the deck, and we both watched it… up close and with clear view of it.  It was big enough to pretty much black out the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dimension are a complete guess, but something like 100’ across, 200’ long and 40’ tall, with a glowing engine covering the entire backside of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as the shape goes, and I hate to say this, it looked a lot like something out of a Star Wars or Star Trek movie, only a little more rugged.   It was close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, we stood there watching it move slowly with that constant Cauuuu sound… then when it got about a mile off to our right (our house was on a hill), the thing went into some kind of near instant warp speed, and arced away and up, and was gone in two or three seconds. The glow from its’ engine allowed us to track its’ amazing rapid accent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it had gone, we didn’t report the incident to the police, as we’re both professionals, and didn’t want any bad PR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the next morning, when we told the story to our employees and made light of it, we got the expected ribbing…  but one of them told us they’d been a story that morning in the Lewiston Sun Journal, about a woman in Auburn (our sister city, on the other side of the river) who had called the police to report a UFO or strange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never bothered to look for the story, as we were very busy, and didn’t subscribe to the paper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone wants to pin-point the date, and time, they can look for the woman’s story in the Lewiston Sun Journal, and then check Time Warner’s TV show listings on that date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a little background, neither my wife nor I do drugs, or alcohol.  Nor have seen a UFO before, or since. And have gone years without telling other people about this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My guess is the spaceship had possible landed on a wide, isolated part of the Androscoggin River for water, and was in the process of taking off when it passed over us.  The river is about 3,500 feet to the west of us, with only a hand full of houses in between.<n>

Usually when I spot these I like to follow them across the sky, so as I was doing so I noticed it&#39;s trajectory wasn&#39;t straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I was questioning this I raised my arm up to form a straight line of what should have been the trajectory if it were a sattelite.  When I did this I watched it turn about 45 degrees from what should have been it&#39;s straight line orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I took note of this I lowered my arm, and when I was done lowering my arm the object was then gone.  I checked the sky for a few more seconds for cloud cover, but there was none it was perfectly clear.<n>

An error message was displayed saying my smart card was not allowed to access the channel. This was true for all channels. I am a service tech by trade and did my best to correct the problem with no results. Fustrated, I walked out on the patio to smoke a cigarette. As I sat there, cows began mooing and whaling. I passed this off as a nuisance as well. As I pet the dogs, the female dog stuck her ear up as if to hear something. Using the local colloquialism I said, &#34;Geeet-em!&#34; Both dogs ran out in the yard after a grey figure that I saw moving very swiftly, standing upright. As they barked, coyotes began to howl; They were all over the place! There were three different packs from the North, South, and West Directions. The pack from the north was extremely close, and it sounded as if they were in the front yard. I was surprised that I could not see the coyotes but had seen the other figure. The coyotes returned howls back and forth along with all of the sparsely placed neighbors&#39; dogs. The cows began to moo again accompaning all the other sounds of animals. As this was going on I heard a humming sound in the sky start to get louder and louder. This is when I became really nervous, because too many strange things were happening for me to write them off as coincidence. I looked and looked at the sky but could not see a plane or helicopter that was making this noise. The more I looked for something in the sky, the louder the noise became. Finally the noise was so loud that it somehow was making me lethargic and had a sort of hypnotic effect. I almost lost conscienceness, but began to fight the effect it was having on me. Please keep in mind that the coyotes were still yipping and yelping while all this was going on, but the the dogs had retreated to the patio and were just as frightened as I was. Everytime I would glance at the female dog, she would growl under her breath as if she knew that the occurence was threatening in some way. As the noise prolonged, I then noticed what I would describe as a &#34;light shadow&#34;. It was a oval shape of light in the front yard that appeared on the lawn, but yet there was no ray or beam projecting that light onto the ground. It was light without a source, and it moved in a quirky manner in a circular pattern. I felt an energy trying to communicate with me, but I kept thinking: &#34;No, No, No, I don&#39;t belive it!&#34; It was almost as if I was trying to deny its existence in order for it to go away. And quicker than a flash everything was gone, the world was still and peaceful, and I was left doubting everything I had seen. Doubting what I saw did not help, however, because nothing could be justified in my mind as to explain, logicallly, what had happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that every sighting must first be considered as a hoax, however I must iterate that this was the first time I have ever experienced anything so unexplainable. Until now, I did not belive in such things. What I saw, heard, and felt has changed my mind forever on the subject.

The light was so bright that is cast a shadow of me and my friend on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object quickly grew out of sight in about another 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no noise which is strange because it looked very close to the ground.<n>

Another thing, while it was turning it seemed to flash an orangy colour for a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time it was hovering i ran upstairs to wake everyone up and come have a look. My mother finally got out of bed and came to have a look too, by the time she got there it was taking off over in the far distance but she did see the &#39;craft&#39; moving and agreed it was too fast for a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i am writing this right now i have goosebumps on my arms as you just never believe you would ever see anything like that being as i am in the UK and most of these reports seem to come from America.<n>

We brought out our binoculars to get a better view. While I was looking through the binculars, my son (12)saw a red streak go down to the right of the object and screamed &#34;Did you see that?&#34;. I didn&#39;t, but when we searched for the first light that was chaning colors it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to look up at the sky. We saw two star-like objects move together from left to right in the north western sky and then they disappeared. Then there were two star-like objects in the northeastern sky that would appear and disappear in slightly different areas than they were before, but their distance from each other remained the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we saw a star like object move over head from north to south. It passed another starlike object and made an immediate turn back and joined with the object it had just passed. It appeared to form a tiangle with two other star-like items.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, we saw three red flashing lights go across the sky from the south east part of town over to the northwest part of town. Using binoculars we tracked it as it went across the sky. The three red lights flashed randomly in a triangle formation. There was absolutely no sound coming from the object. Shortly after it had passed an airplace passed in the distance and it could clearly be heard!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an exciting two hours we spent looking up at the sky!

The object was travelling at some speed and was not omitting any jet stream or noise. It was difficult in seeing the exact shape of this craft because of it&#39;s distance, however, it was not the shape of a conventinal jet aircraft that would be flying at that height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never logged or seen such a sight before and prior to this event I would have described myself a &#39;non beliver&#39;and of sound mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was with my class in the hall and my teacher stopped for a few minutes to talk with another teacher real quick.  For whatever reason I was turned around, I’m guessing to get my teacher’s attention, and everyone else was facing the other way.  We had a large wall on that side of the building that was just glass, and through I saw what looked like a small saucer type shape with an odd metallic orange color scoot across the sky.  It was a clear cloudless day, it had a single, central disc with a smaller ring on top and a small ring on the bottom, and both were spinning and had white lights on them.	 	 Above the top ring was a small half sphere that was a slightly lighter tint of the off metallic orange but I still couldn’t see inside well enough.  I tried for the whole amount of time to get my classmates to turn and see it but they seemed to just stare at me blankly.  By the time they all turned and my teacher noticed me it had just hid behind the wall of the school, I seemed to be the only one to see it.  I just couldn’t explain it, when I saw it time seemed to just fail to acknowledge me, and it just flew across the sky.  The geological environment around the school was these sort of small hills and it was flying just above them on the left side of the school, maybe not even ¼ of a mile away.<n>

The lights were out and I was using 2 candles to light the pages:  It’s a long story.  My window is on the 9th floor facing East ward, overlooking downtown Toronto from the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a cigarette out of the package beside me on the window sill, pickup up the lighter and looked up and directly out of the window.  At that moment I was struck with the fact that there were 2 objects in the sky which I had never seen before (and trust me, I look out this window several times per day and night).  The only words I could use to describe the situation at the time were of a questionable nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 objects were holding position in formation.  One was slightly higher than the other and only a nudge off to the left.  They were bright amber in color and luminescent.  At first they looked like gigantic stars.  It soon became clear when, after sitting still for approximately 4 seconds, both of them darted off to the right with incredible speed and acceleration.  Without slowing down or accelerating, they immediately stopped and went in the opposite direction as they were joined by a 3rd from across the lake.  All 3 objects maintained a delta formation that was rotating slightly as they flew at the speed of mach 30 off to the North and out of sight.  The entire sighting lasted approximately 12-15 seconds, in which time they covered a distance of no less than 85km.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were luminescent spheres, travelling at mach 30 or beyond, in perfect delta and parallel formations.  They were within the atmosphere, not higher than 1km above ground level.  They switched directions and appeared to have the ability to accelerate and decelerate almost instantaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve run through the list of all possible explanations and this incident seems to defy every explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I sat in front of my apartment like i have done every night around the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking straight ahead in a space between some trees and i saw a bright light that looked like aircraft lights approaching at maybe around 3 or 4 thousand feet. im an air traffic controller so i know very well what aircraft lights look like at night and how far they can travel at relative speeds and everything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i figured these lights were an aircraft at first but these lights were moving way too slow for any conventional aircraft.  i then thought maybe they could be from a blimp but i dont know of too many blimps that fly at 230 in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> so i watched these lights for 27 minutes and they barely moved a mile and they moved in a half arc type of flight path. the lights looked like a star almost, no particular shape just shining lights from a distance.  so i went inside to get my camera too record it and look on the internet if anyone was reporting the same sighting. when i went back outside the lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i walked all around the parking lot away from all trees so where all i could see was sky and the lights had completely disappeared. like i said, i have seen just about every type of aircrafts lights at night on final approach or flying overhead and i have never witnessed anything like i just did. there is not one single aircraft that i know of, capable of emitting the amount of light that i saw and moving/hovering as slow as i saw and then just disappear. and i am positive they were not helicopter lights. it just is not possible.<n>

I asked my brother to bring the tourch, to put a light on it, may be they get a signal, but my father was scared and he doesn&#39;t allow me to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15 min my father took us back to rooms, these UFOs were still there.<n>

I never put in the report what happened just before I saw the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking my dogs around midnight &amp; was almost back home.  I had just passed my neighbor&#39;s house who had the United States flag placed on the house.  I recall seeing the flag moving in the breeze &amp; then everything began to quiver around me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I remember was looking up at the UFO.  I believe I was taken right when the quivering took place &amp; returned when I looked up &amp; saw the UFO.  I think they wanted me to see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s been 8 years since this happening.  Some time after this event I also had a different experience, which involved a close encounter with a being.  I had lost track of time &amp; the dogs wanted out.  I got as far as the end of my driveway &amp; saw a small being in a white space suite &amp; helmet across the street.  It was on the side of my neighbor&#39;s house.  I froze, dogs didn&#39;t bark.  I immediately turned around! &amp; went back to my house &amp; got a flashlight.  I looked at the time &amp; it was about 1:40 am.  When I returned to the end of the driveway the being was gone.  The being was about the size of a 8-10 year old child.  The white suite had bulbous arms an also bulbous legs on the upper part.  I saw no face,  I guess it had it&#39;s back toward me.  I no longer walk my dogs after dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These happenings have haunted me ever since.  There are times I wish there was a support group for people like me who have had UFO related experiences.  I was so scared I never reported the last incident until now.  I was afraid the military was going to come &amp; take me away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

The craft was observed over Lake Wylie|6/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44293.html|28|ndxe200505| PERFECT Triangle shaped craft. 3 lights on bottom (round) with dull glow on entire underside. The craft was observed over Lake Wylie<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and wife were driving home from an evening out with our 3 kids. We were driving down Southpoint Rd (parallel to Lake Wylie). Around 2315hrs, my wife observed an object flying in a strange manner and in a flight path that is not ever used. Southpoint Road leads to the Duke Power Allen steam plant and the main portion(s) of Lake Wylie. CLT International Airport is very close by but we were nowhere close to the flight path or paths that the airplanes ascend and descend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my wife observed this, she literally  snatched my arm and pointed the object to me (she was driving). When I viewed the object, I was in total awe. The object was a half mile from us and was flying over the lake. I figure that the object was 1000 feet (probably less) from the ground. The object from flying west as we were heading east. We slowed down and were moving at a snails pace on the road to observe this phenomena. The object stopped, appeared to hover and then performed a swift 90 degree turn and was heading in our direction (towards the steam plant). We kept driving (slowly) and then noticed the object had changed course (back to the west). We then turned our vehicle around and went back to the original spot of where we viewed the object. When we arrived, the object was back in it&#39;s original position. We pulled into the high school parking lot and sat there viewing the object. Then the craft took a southerly course and flew over Gaither Road (towards the other side of Lake Wylie). The craft had NO SOUND and a dull yellow glow on the bottom. The three lights were dull also but a tad brighter. When the craft pulled away, it kept at a very slow pace and was very close to us. Unfortunately, there were a lot of trees/angle to where we could not track it after that. I am a 4 year veteran honorably discharged from the U.S. Navy. I was an Operations Specialist (Radar operations). I am now a Project Manager with a Mechanical Engineering firm. I have been employed with this firm for 8 years. My wife is a homemaker (stay at home mom). We are both active in our community. The other witnesses were our kids (seven, five and two). The two older children observed this craft and were visibly/emotionally disturbed by it (probably from me and my wife&#39;s excitement). I will gladly submit to a polygraph test. This was truly amazing!!<n>

We were on glass mountain between Bishop and Mammoth Lakes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before going to sleep, we watch the sky for a few hours looking for satellites and ufo&#39;s.  On Saturday night, my cousin spotted a pinpoint of light traveling from west to east.  We assumed it was a satellite at first (object too high to be conventional aircraft).  After a few seconds of watching, it seemed to grow in size about like a dime held out at arms length and it lit up bright blue/white (like when someone is arc welding) and it&#39;s course became staggered for a few seconds untill it returned to a pinpoint of light.  After that it just continued on it&#39;s way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our elevation on the mountain was approx 8000ft. the sky was crystal clear, the temperature was around 51deg with a very light wind.  There were no other aircraft in the vicinity at that exact time.  We did see several satellites the entire week we were there.  I&#39;ve been a sky watcher since my first ufo sighting at age 7.  After seeing 12 now, I strongly believe we are not alone, never have been and never will be.<n>

I looked at it and thought it was only a star, because it wasn&#39;t moving so I didn&#39;t feel it was an airplane or other aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continue to hover for about another 20 minutes and by now more people were looking at it so I decided to get a pair of binoculars to take a closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My heart drop when I focused in and discovered that it was some sort of aircraft, but none like I had ever seen before.  It was a triangle shape with a series of bright blue and red lights (really bright lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object hover a few moments more before it started moving in a side to side motion while dropping lower in the sky at the same time. It finally flew out of view after we watched it for about 15 minutes. It was too far away to photograph.<n>

I could see it was chrome and very shiny.  It was just hovering in the cloud and slowly dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it wasn&#39;t a plane because one was in a landing pattern heading to Newark Airport.<n>

(Sometimes, the Polaris sweeper gets stuck or tangled, which requires regular babysitting when it is in operation.)  While doing so, I heard a plane flying nearby.  I like airplanes so I try to catch a glimpse of them when I hear them. I could tell it was close by the sound but couldn&#39;t see it anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds later, I saw it pop up from behind some trees that were blocking my view to the northwest. It was a small single-propeller airplane, probably a Cessna. As I watched it for a second or so, I noticed a dark object roughly in the same line of sight as the plane but approximately twice as far and about twice the altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, the object seemed to be changing shapes and I thought it was a bird or perhaps a garbage bag that the wind had gotten hold of. As I kept watching, I noticed that the object was stationary. By then I was fixated and I realized that the object was not changing shapes but rather was changing its orientation, which made it appear to change shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way the object&#39;s profile was changing was consistent with a disk shape that seemed to be wobbling, much like the way a spinning coin wobbles just before it rests on the table... only much slower. While I watched, I saw it start to move slowly and steadily towards the east. When I first saw it, it was directly north of me in my backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a layer of scattered clouds at the time and they made for a good background to provide contrast for the object. Once, the sun peaked out for a few seconds and I caught a glimpse of a shine that made the object appear metallic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object moved away, I mustered up the will to peel my eyes from it and ran into the house to get the new camcorder I bought a little over a month ago. My wife was napping at the time so I didn&#39;t have to explain my odd behavior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I returned to the backyard, the object had gotten very far. To further exacerbate the situation, I&#39;m not very proficient with the video camera and had to use &#34;Easycam&#34; mode and hope for the best while I tried to control my excitement. I captured approximately two minutes of footage showing the object moving away from me in an eastward direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I zoomed in on the object a couple of times to highlight it but most of the footage is unzoomed to keep surrounding trees and structures within the frame for reference. The camera that was used is a Sony DCR-DVD403. I have sent a copy of the DVD that it produced to your address in Seattle. The third clip on the disk has the most useful footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for me, I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering (B.A.Sc.) from the University of Ottawa. For the past twelve years, I have been cultivating a successful career in the field of IT. I am currently employed by a major IT outsourcing company as an Infrastructure Specialist. Due to the attention that this may draw, I would prefer to remain anonymous, or at least have my personal information withheld.<n>

It did not twinkle like a star or planet, just stayed in the same spot.  My husband was sick, and I came out to the living room to see how he was feeling at 3:00-3:05AM .  He was asleep.  I sat down to have a cigarette.  I looked out the window and saw two small lights (white), with a flashing white light behind them.  At first I thought it was a plane.  It came up to the light (spot) in the N.E. sky and stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside at that time.  I could hear a slow and distant whump....whump....whump.  What amazed me was, it took the light that had been in the sky for as long as I could remember away.  I came back in and woke my husband, he came outside with me but could not see enough ot it to discount it as anything but a plane or helicopter.  It had come in from the West and continued in the same straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, May 29th 2005, I stayed up until 3:00am.  There is no longer any light in the North East sky.  For me it was a UFO.  I like to believe that there is life on other planets but this was a little much for me to wrap my brain around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object formed an irregular triangle, a total of three lights.  I could not see any solid substance within those lights, it was too far away.  Until I hear from someone else, I am telling myself that NASA sent something up to retrieve a dead satellite.  I hope that the NASA idea is correct because if it&#39;s not my other guess is a little to creepy for me to entertain.  Were we being observed?  I hope someone can help me to understand what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were pretty close to the lights and they began to look like a circular object and the red lights appeared to have little bars across them.  When it was close to us at this point and you could see it was very big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, for about ten seconds I looked down inside the pickup and looked back up and it wasn&#39;t there anymore, so I asked my friend where it went and he pointed to the other side of the rode, so I looked over and it was way on the other side of the rode towards the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, we turned on the next gravel road going east towards the object, but we decided we would stop it see if it was moving.  We watched it go right over my friends farm and it was hovering over it for at least a minute and then there appeared a smaller saucer right below the big one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched them hovering over his farm it began moving very fast at an angle into the sky and it just disapeared into a little ball of light and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We followed it for at least 5 minutes before it disappeared, the whole time it seemed like it was running away from us when we would move towards it and when we would stop, it would stop with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never been a believer in these sorts of things, but what I saw last night made me question myself.<n>

5/27/05 23:59|Tacoma|WA|Triangle|1 min|Saw triangle close up through 12 inch Dobsonian telescope. Duration of observation approximately 1 min.|6/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44189.html|39|ndxe200505| Saw triangle close up through 12 inch Dobsonian telescope. Duration of observation approximately 1 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out Friday evening May 27, 2005 looking at the night sky here in Tacoma, Washington with my 12 inch Dobsonian telescope. It was a beautiful evening, full of stars, with no clouds or haze at all. I am situated here in a great location because even though I live in the city Tacoma, it is approximately 8 miles west of downtown and located at Point Defiance which is surrounded on three sides by Puget Sound. The sky is pretty dark here except for looking eastward towards downtown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at Jupiter and notice to pairs of moons grouped tightly together on the left side of the planet. It was very interesting. CAVEAT: Because this is a Dobsonian telescope, everything is upside down and backwards, so the moons were really to the right of Jupiter if you could see them with your naked eyes. I went inside to look at my planetarium program to see which moons these were. I stepped back outside and walked up to my telescope to start viewing these moons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up at Jupiter at 23:59 when I noticed a very bright deep red light ramping up and down in luminosity at a rate of approximately 1 cycle/second 5 degrees higher in elevation than Jupiter heading S-SW toward the horizon. My mind instantly searched for familiar clues to this object. It does not appear “right”. I then quickly looked for the familiar green FAA markings. None exhibited. OK, what? All this transpired in less than 5 seconds. I immediately grabbed my telescope and was determined to not this possible once-in-a-lifetime event get away from me. I spotted it with my finder scope and somehow kept it in the main field of view of the 2 inch wide angle 32mm eyepiece that I had in the telescope at the time. It was the show of a lifetime for me!  Now for my observation; First of all, what I want to state here is that it was “tough enough” to keep this object centered to the best of my ability by hand in the center of my field of view during the 30-45 second period of observation, especially in the beginning, because at the closest point to me it was at a minimum of 10 diameters of Jupiter. Because of this, I concentrated only on what “I” thought was extremely unique to this craft. These were in two areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)  The main deep red overpowering light in the center of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)  The apparent surprising (to me), non-flat bottom to this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me now expound on the &#34;light&#34;; Size and Intensity; This light was extremely wide. It appeared to me to be approximately 1/20th to as much as 1/10th the diameter of the bottom of the triangle. It was extremely bright when it would ramp up in 1second duration cycles. The intensity was extremely bright but soft, (diffuse). The intensity at maximum was as bright as on-coming passenger jet headlights when they are heading directly towards you, (but this light WAS NOT pointed in my direction, but was straight down 29 degrees in elevation S-SW of me). Also, there was one other small red light at the right triangle tip blinking in unison with the main one. I did not notice one on the left side, but this may be due to the angle of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now for the Hue; Almost, but not quite, as deep red as a street blinking stop light with a “true” glass lens and “filament” type bulb. The reason I stress here a “Filament” type bulb is because it is the closest analogy that I can come up with that describes the ramping up and down of the main light at 1 cycle intervals. If you can picture one of these lights as described above blinking on and off at a 1cycle/second intervals, but never going completely out before it starts increasing in intensity again. This most accurately explains what I saw. All this is happening on a non-wavering linear repetitious cadence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now for the “bottom shape” of the craft; 	If you notice on any kind of modern jet aircraft, the main wing has a dihedral, (note; Dihedral is an angle raising the centerline of the wing tip above the centerline of the wing root).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This angle appeared to me about a similar 3 degree angle starting at it lowest point from the front tip of the craft, running straight to the rear, dissecting the rear flat edge of the triangle in half. This angle then moved upwards both to the left and right tips of the triangle. Hypothetically; I would suspect if you saw this thing on the ground in the daytime from the rear the bottom would have a chevron shape to it, (if this helps).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now for the bottom’s “reflective property”; One thing that was quite evident in the telescope was how reflective it was. I could plainly see that the glow from ground illumination was casting a whitish soft glow to the bottom. Now for the “interesting” part of this observation that may make this light different from any normal light that “we” may know about. As bright as this center light did ramp up to, it never cast ANY portion of this to the bottom whatsoever. The light would be intensely bright but you could see right adjacent to it the glow effect from ground lighting without ANY hue change. It was quite amazing to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other Observations;  Apparent observed height; From the elevation above horizon (29 degrees), and it’s width of 10 Jupiters minimum, the best guess I can come up with is 1-3K feet. Very close to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An explanation of this is warranted here; I am an amateur astronomer and avid aircraft enthusiast. I know a lot of different aircraft from the WWII era to modern day. I have been a multi-year Boeing Museum of Flight member, gone to air shows for years, etc. This craft appeared to be in altitude of about in between the height of C-17’s landing a few miles south of here at McChord Air Force Base &amp; passenger jet aircraft heading north to Sea-Tac.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Speed; I would estimate that it must have been slower than passenger jet. The reason I say this is because I have tried following passenger jets at this angle of elevation above the horizon in the past and they are too fast to track. Even with this 2 inch wide angle 32mm eyepiece that I have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sound; None apparent. Could be that it was too far away to hear though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flying Characteristics; Smooth, gliding, graceful, effortless. No yawing, pitching, front point always staying straight ahead in the line of travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personal Observations; 		I spend every moment that I can outside for quite a few years now and never have seen anything “out of the ordinary”. Nothing, since I had when I was a child, very many years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been listening to Jeff Rense now for quite a few years and have been hearing the “I went out for a cigarette” routine. Well isn’t it ironic that I have been patiently waiting for years for this chance and just the night before this sighting, I then finally said to myself; “Gee, for heavens sake, am I ever going to see anything myself? Then 24hours later, Wham! 		It almost makes you think; “Is someone reading my thoughts?”. What a coincidence, that’s all I can say. What are the odds on that? 		One other small thing, If only I had come out 10 seconds earlier it would have been right over my head. I kick myself over that one. The only good part of this is that I would have never been able to track the craft with my telescope. At this angle it would be too fast to track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Ours” vs. “Theirs”  		In some respects, I would think “Ours”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Examples; 		Speed. Non-wavering flying. Dihedral “type” angle making you think, lift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In other respect “Theirs” 		Examples; 		The intensity of the light. None of this light reflects on the bottom, but the glow of the street lights below, do. No FAA markings. The sheer beauty of this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Ours”? Doesn’t make sense to me; 		If it IS a Black Project, why fly it low over Tacoma? Ok, so you aren’t worried about someone taking a “pot shot” at the thing. Then why put the biggest, brightest, red-light in the world and stick it on the bottom, adverstising; “Look at me!” “Look at me!”<n>

I have never reported anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 23:30 on 5/27/05 while taking my nightly walk, I observed a triangular craft (craft) traversing the sky from north to south at about 20K feet.  The sky is very clear this night with several miles of clear visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft&#39;s speed was about 500 knots.  The craft was perfectly silent and moving rapidly.  Several miles behind the craft was what appeared to be a fighter jet moving very rapidly, 600 to 700 knots.   As the jet was chasing the craft they both where flying toward my position.   I could begin to hear the engines of the jet at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared as thought the triangular craft was toying with the jet in that as the jet got closer to the craft, the craft would speed up somewhat and leave the jet behind.   As the craft and jet got nearly directly over my location, the triangular craft made a sharp right hand turn the the west.  The jet was unable to make the turn at the same angle as the craft.  The jet&#39;s turn was much more pronounced and made a much wider loop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to that, the jet lost quite a bit of ground on the craft during the turn, yet again as both craft began traverseing in a straight line toward the west-nortwest the craft again appeared to toy with the pursuing jet in the same manner aforementioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds it appeared that the craft accelerated dramaticaly and left the jet behind.  I observed the jet make one tight loop several miles from my position and then turn off to the north-northeast and flew out of my line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing that was odd about the triangular craft was the three lights making up the trianglar pattern were not equal in distance.  Referencing the wingspan of the jet, two of the lights on the craft were about 50 to 75 feet apart and the third light was approximately 100 to 150 feet from the other two lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally, the two lights closer together were at the front and the other further away light was at the rear facing the pursuing jet.  This made the craft to appear to be moving in reverse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted, that the color of the triangular craft lights were an unusual milky white color, nothing like that of the very bright red, green and white lights obsereved on the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tinker Air Force Base, which does have fighters, is located about 25 miles east of my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assure you that this is a true account of what I observed on the stated date and time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone on two occasions, and we found him to be quite objective in his description of the alleged sighting, and very well organized in his description of what it was he apparently witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have invited him to contact media and law enforcement offices, to inquire whether anyone else might have been witness to the event.  Also, he will contact the FAA ARTCC in Oklahoma City, to inquire whether the controllers on duty Friday night, May 27, might know what the cause of the incident was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have to allow for the possibility that the object apparently being pursued by what may have been a military fighter jet may have been an F-22 &#34;Raptor&#34; fighter on a test flight, but even that aircraft would have to have displayed conventional red and green marker lights on its wing tips.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness will submit an illustration of what the lights on the object looked like to him, as he viewed it from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If any visitors to the NUFORC site were witness to this event over Oklahoma, we would request that they submit a short report of what they saw, using the Online Report Form on our website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We invite visitors to our site to compare this report with the report submitted from Kirkland, Washington, (located just east of Seattle) regarding an alleged sighting of a bizarre-looking, triangular craft at 00:18 hrs. (Pacific) on Friday, May 13, 2005.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PD))<n>

It was the size of a pencil&#39;s eraser.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, it was gliding across the sky in a perfect straight line, no wiggling at all, very steady, and at a constant speed.  I would also say that it was stayed at a continuous height because it didn&#39;t get smaller or larger while it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also no sound at all. It was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I tried to show it to my grandfather but his eyesight isn&#39;t that great.  Then I banged on my brother&#39;s window to get him to come outside and bring me my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He came out but he was impatient and didn&#39;t see anything.  By this time it was going behind my roof so I decided to move in between my house and my next door neighbor&#39;s house to continue to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I lost it. I knew that it was NOT a bird because I&#39;ve seen birds at night before. And it was definitely NOT a plane because there were no lights whatsoever. I really wish I had had my binoculars!<n>

It was large and out of place, not significantly higher than the treeline. 2 smaller lights were then emitted in order from smallest first to largest last, which formed an angled formation, the original light being the largest and highest. I would approximate the formation to be a 30 degree line. The lights formed this line from west to east.  Then, the lights melded back into the larger, original light in reverse order and it disappeared. Altitude and size is difficult to estimate. The initial sighting to its disappearance was around 15 seconds. I can draw no conclusions as to the nature of this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I recognized red, blue, and green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to grab my friend, when we returned there was a bright firey light adjacent to the object. The light was shaped like a torn seem, the light was seemingly almost as bright as the sun. The light was a mix of white and orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A jet from the local airforce bace approached from the west traveling east directly for the triangular object and adjacent light.  We knew it was a jet because of airfoce experience, it was unmistakeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the jet approached the source the seem of light moved inward and closed as if it pixilated from mass to miniscule. The Triangular shape turned in a direction that faced upward and north by northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we no longer saw three colors of light.  We saw three red circles instead and they grew rapidly smaller with the Triangles departure.  As it moved north by northwest it broke due east and appeared to be a weather helicopter or civilian chopper of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another event in seemingly the same location happened tonight, coincidentally while I was on the phone outside.  This time the triangular shape was difficult to see.  The adjacent light was much brighter and appeared to move south towards my self.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this happened the Triangular shape became more and more difficult to see.  Then impossible to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light moved inward and closed what seemed to be a tear or gap or seem.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no triangular object after the light closed. Airforce jets responded this time as well from the same direction. They didnt get nearly as close before the firey light as ceased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone knows anything about these events please share them on this site, I will check back periodically.<n>

They were made up of multiple lights of red, orange, and yellow.  A few minutes after the second object appeared a third one appeared, again out of nowhere, but looked larger or maybe closer than the other two.  The third object was higher above the horizon and maybe 30 degrees to the left of the other two.  The objects went away in the order they appeared.  After the second object disappeared the third seemed to be gone but came back(no movement, as if the lights were simply turned off).

5/24/05 20:00|Sullivans Island|SC|Light|15-20 minutes|Two separate light events at same time off of Sullivan's Island, SC|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65156.html|70|ndxe200505| Two separate light events at same time off of Sullivan&#39;s Island, SC<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two friends and myself witnessed an amazing sequence of mysterious lights in the Charleston harbor in South Carolina.  We were at the beach on Sullivan&#39;s Island on the evening of May 24th, 2005, to watch the sunset.  It was the day after a full moon, and we sat up in the dunes because the tide was coming in.  After the sun set, and it finally became dark, the tide was so high that we were forced to stay in our position on the dunes.  It was while sitting, waiting for the tide to go out just enough for us to be able to walk back to the beach access, that we began to see lights in the outer harbor, between Sullivan&#39;s Island and James Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we saw only one orange light. It was located at the inside end of the jetties of the Charleston Harbor. From where we were sitting, we were pretty much staring out towards James Island. My first assumption was that the light was a flare, that maybe a boat was having problems in the harbor. Then a second light appeared to the left, seemingly the exact same light just in another place. I thought that perhaps the would-be boat launched another flare. While staring out at the lights, we slowly began to realize that if it were a flare, it would have at least moved in the wind or began to fall out of the sky. These lights remained at a constant position. Then it seemed that on of the lights -- the one on the right -- began to split, first in to another orange light.. then, each orange light split off to include a red light connected with a beam. Two immensely bright orange and red lights connected by a beam. They continued to dazzle us with a series of brightening and dimming, growing and shrinking, disappearing and reappearing, but never in a different spot. The one on the right seemed to be more active than the one on the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were frightened, but after coming to terms with what I was looking at, I thought enough of the event to try to capture a photo. I actually captured 4, but with a Nokia cell phone camera which probably would have been only 1 mega pixel at that time. I still have the phone somewhere in a drawer, with a picture I took of the sunset that same day, but its retired and no longer has service hooked up. I transferred the four pictures of the lights a few days later, but I think you would have to have been there to recognize what they represent. I tried to capture a video, but it refused to show up the same as it would for a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the meantime, we had been drawn to another series of lights in a slightly different area of the sky. After the experience I mentioned above began, at least a few minutes passed before a bright white light began to appear in the sky out towards the open ocean.  Since we were staring out towards James Island, we had to look to our left and up in the sky to see this one.  A white light would appear and disappear.  We were never sure if it was going to come back, but each time it did. At first I thought this was lightning, but there was no flash of light associated with it.  It was a steady light that was there and then it wasn&#39;t.  We were so amazed and occupied by the orange/red lights that were giving us a show in the harbor, that I don&#39;t recall exactly how many times it happened.  But, after several times of appearing and disappearing, as kind of a grand finale the light appeared as five or six separate lights that all streaked across a small section of sky together at the same speed, then disappeared for good. In the end, five or six bright rectangular-ish objects that are equally sized and evenly spaced between each other, moving the same speed and same trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both instances of lights occurred simultaneously, however seemingly independent of each other. The styling of the two sets of lights were completely different.  The harbor lights were bright orange/red, fairly constant acting, and the ocean light(s) were white and more seldom.  None of the lights made sounds.  There didn&#39;t seem to be any aircraft or cargo ship activity in the area at the time.<n>

I see what I think is the B1 Stealth Bomber heading south at 11pm as I stand in my driveway.  I feel pumped up and want to see it.  I&#39;ve only seen the B1 a few times and never at night. It approaches close and low to the ground.  I see a white light glare coming over the trees.  I estimate the craft at 1000 feet above as I stand in a fairly small, hilltop clearing of an oak forrest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it gets closer, I notice a pointed front end.   White lights point directly down, like spot lights.  I now know it cannot be the Stealth Bomber.  Wow, I&#39;ve never seen a Stealth Fighter.  As it reaches almost overhead, Im struck by the shape of the craft.  I see a perfect isosceles triangle.  The bottom of the craft shows shiney metalic.  I see 3 bright white lights running down each side of the triangle.  I try to see a cockpit that I can recognize.  I can&#39;t see it.  I see no cockpit.  Im stunned again by the perfection of the triange, the bright lights and now by the fact the craft moves surprising slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passes overhead.  I see two oval exhast-like ports on the rear of the craft.  I see two fins sticking up from behind.  Those two fins resemble the stealth fighters two rear fins.  I cannot hear a sound coming from those exhast-like ports.   The back of the craft is straight, not jagged like the rear part of the wing profile of the Stealth Fighter or the Bomber.  It passes over the tree tops line out of sight.   I go to bed thinking I just saw the next new military plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, I notice that the electronic fish finder on my boat parked in the drive is strangely powered &#39;on&#39; and running.  It dawns on me then that what I saw the previous night may not be military.  I later tried to identify what I saw through web research.  I found nothing military and could not identify what I saw.  Through the web reseach, I find Im not the only one that has seen a &#39;flying triangle.&#39;<n>

The chopper was doing just that. Except it was going much faster than normal. Not to far behind it was a plane. I couldn&#39;t tell what kind as it was dark outside. The plane was obviously going to pass the helicopter eventually but it was to far behind it for me to see it when it would pass it becoase it would already be out of sight by then. What was behind it was what is strange. A triangle shaped craft. It was perfectly silent and was speeding toward the plane. But it was still to far behind the plane for me to still hear the plane&#39;s engine(s). The craft had three sides all the same length. It had white strobe lights on each of the corners and one red strobe light in the center on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

Our location when we saw the light in the sky was at Orange Beach, Alabama on a condominium midway through construction.  The condominium is located nearly directly in front of the Alabama Point bridge which I estimated the distance between the bridge and the condo to be approximately a mile in distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole observation began when three people and I took our lunch break at exactly 12:00 PM on the condominium&#39;s balcony that was facing southeast on the first floor.  I tended to my lunch,  devouring the tuna-fish sandwich that I had made in the early morning, while the other three people began consuming their meal just a few yards away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While attending to my lunch, I was wearing my polarize sunglasses and glancing towards the Gulf admiring the scenery of the barrier island&#39;s surroundings.  It was extremely hot and humid that day which also set a new temperature record for that day.  I believe the actual temperature was 98 degree F, and with the humidity factored in, the temperature actually felt like 115 degree F.  Because it was so hot and humid that day, the surrounding area had a slight haze in the air which is typical for hot, humid climate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sunlight seem to be especially intense that day for it was extremely bright and challenging when seeing without the aid of sunglasses.  Thankfully, there was a slight and gentle breeze from the Gulf  to briefly cool us off just a tad now and then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While glancing around at the surrounding area, a brilliant light in the sky captivated my attention.  I said nothing to the others just yet, but I just dwelled there in awe scrutinizing the light to see if it would change direction if it was traversing the sky.   I didn&#39;t want the other people to think I was seeing a UFO until I rule out all possibilities of what the light may be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was some clouds in the sky, and few times, the clouds would pass in front of the light in the sky, yet the light still shined through the clouds seemly almost unhindered.  The light was just barely off the left side of one of the three, huge condo that was on the barrier island.  In the line of sight of the light is a small island that has some pine trees on it.  That was one of the reasons why I didn&#39;t spot the light in the sky at my first glance of the surroundings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light seem to just suspend over the Gulf just between East and South East direction near the area where the torturous sun rise slowly each morning.  If you were to draw a line between the light and the condo, it did not cross the Alabama-Florida boundary line, but it was just between the two, tall pine trees on the island.  Between the two pine tree was a stubby tree possibly an oak tree.  I used those trees as a guide for any lateral movement in the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light elevation may had been between 30 to 45 degrees off the horizon, but almost level with the condo&#39;s roof on the barrier island which was also leveled with the pine trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking it may be a jet heading directly towards my direction with its lights on, I waited five minutes for any changes in direction, elevation, or intensity of the light, and I also listen for any sounds of a jet flying.  Since none of those factors changed and no jet sound could be heard, I disclosed to the other people of what I saw.  I guided them in direction using the pine trees as landmarks for the viewing of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, both witness had some trouble spotting the light until their eyes adjusted and was able to see clearly the light.  I let one of the witness use my sunglasses, and he was able to see the light with no problems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked the two witness, &#34;What is it?&#34;  Neither of them had any clear answers, but only possibilities of what the light may be.  There was another person on the balcony, but that person refused to glance in the direction that the light was being observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both witness and I watched for another 10 minutes when three more people showed up on the balcony.  They were able to view the light and again I asked, &#34;What is it?&#34;  No one had any definite answers.  One person said, &#34;It could be a balloon.&#34;  Another person said, &#34;It could be a parachute ride.&#34;  Another person said, &#34;It could be a plane.&#34;  Another person said, &#34;It could be a planet or star.&#34;  Another person said, &#34;It could be kite.&#34;  &#34;It could be an UFO!&#34; I said because nobody could identify it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the witness watch the light and discussing what it could be until our lunch break was over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occasionally, I would glance towards the light while we were working until around 1:00 PM, I could no longer see the light where it once was positioned exactly each time in the same area in the sky motionlessly shining like a bright, huge star.  My final thoughts, &#34;What was it I saw that day?&#34;<n>

It slowly traveled to the North for about 1 minute or so, then made a  wide, circular curve - clockwise until it headed ESE.  My view was obstructed for about 15 seconds by trees.  Once I was able to view it again, it was heading ESE towards my area.  As it approached, I began to see color and shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed directly overhead in a more Easterly direction and continued until it could no longer be seen.  The object appeared to be traveling slowly, but if it was farther off than I percieved it may have been moving much faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was glowing an Orange-Yellow color, and the lights on the bottom of it appeared to be segmented into three rectangular shapes, nearly the same in shape and size.  There was a halo of light surrounding it that was more yellow in color and appeared misty.  That is how the teardrop type shape was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was rotating counter-clockwise on what appeared to be an asymmetrical axis at about 1 revolution every 3 or 4 seconds.  The revolutions and latteral speed were constant.  Though the defining lines of the object could not be seen clearly, I got a distinct view of the underside as I described it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my step-daughter out to see it but the only view of it that she briefly saw was a rotation seen in the distance as it left our field of vision.

I had never been on a plane before. What I seen shocked me. There was a sphere looking light that looked like it was bouncing really fast along the skyline. We were not up to hight cause I could still see the ground pretty good. The light was so bright surprisingly because it was still daylight out. But I was sorta stuck in shock I couldnt take my eyes off the thing, I was infatuated with it. I wanted to tell my husband to look but I couldnt. When it was finally out of sight I turned away and looked down at my self and was thinking did I really just see that. And would my husband believe me, then I started thinking that maybe I was seeing things but the image is burnt in my head and I can still see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 8:00 p.m., and as we made a turn around a corner I saw an object in the sky.  I looked at the object a few seconds expecting it to turn out to be a helicopter but it looked like it was tumbling and spinning at the same time as this motion was going on it seemed like it was changing shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m guessing the shape shifting effect was due to the tumbling motion or maybe the shape shifting was causing it to look like it was tumbling.  I looked at my friend and asked her if she saw what I saw and she told me she did then asked me what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was close enough that I could make out some detail as it turned, but none of the shapes made sense.  Sometimes I could make out what looked like an aircraft rudder then a second later it looked like it had an oval like sphere on the one end there were not lights on the object that I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overall the object had an elongated shape that as I said seemed to be out of control and tumbling and flipping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an ex Air Force aircraft mechanic and the person I was with is a paralegal.  I have seen many planes and helicopters and I have never seen anything that moved like this object.  It was black and did not reflect light, despite the fact that the sun was shining directly on it.  I could also see a perfect translucent circle around the object as it tumbled in the sky.  I could see the circle because the part of the sky that was visible inside the circle was a different shade.  Also, the object never made a sound that we could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to be stationary at first then seemed to move away from us and up.  Shortly after it moved a passenger jet flew over the apartment complex and as the jet liner passed over I could still see the object above and further away than the jet and I would say the object was a third to half the size of the jet from my perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for about thirty to forty-five minutes and the longer I watched it the further up it went.  Fortunately there was not a cloud in the sky and I saw the object climb until it was only a black speck and then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite objective in his description of the event.

It almost look like staror planet but this seemed strange, a star or planet doesn&#39;t shine that bright after 6PM with a sunny sky. The object moved from west to east (and from east to west) slowly and sometimes I could not tell if it was moving because it moved so slowly.When it moved back and forth the object faintedto the point it was hard to relocate it.  Usually it fainted when it got closer to the sun but when it got further from the sun it begun to shine more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing it for more than ten minutes this thing got my real attention and my jaw dropped. It emitted an object smaller than itself. The smaller object traveled northeast slowly but faster than the bigger object.  After that I did not know what happened to the two objects because I got distracted by a soccer game that my father was in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I look up again to the sky I could not relocate them. However after ten minutes I saw another object that looked the same at the same location of the sky. It&#39;s behavior moved the same (west to east and east to west slowly). A few minutes later it traveled only west not going back to east.(note:as it traveled west to the sun it kept its white color it didn&#39;t look like it reflected any orange,yellow colors caused by the sun)<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it traveled west it fainted and then another object heading toward it appeared about the same size but brighter coming from the northwest and traveling southeast. As I focus my eyes on this brighter object I could describe it had a faint red color, I could bearly tell it had a red color,if I didn&#39;t focus on it the color would be a bright white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects looked like they were at the same altitude and almost made contact to each other as they got closer to each other . The object going west fainted and I observed it until my eyes couldn&#39;t see it.  The other object fainted as it traveled slowly southeast and kept my eyes on it until I couldn&#39;t see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About twenty minutes later the sky was a little dark but still bright, it was between 7:30 PM and 8:00 PM, I looked up to see any more sightings of more objects and just as I looked up a saw one. This object was bigger and I could distinguish another shape. At first it looked between a bent cigar and a small moon crescent then looked like a straight small cigar. It&#39;s color was a bright white,it&#39;s altitude looked the same as the other objects that I saw before and moved west slowly, its location was further northwest from the other objects that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father saw it as I told him about it and the other objects. There was another person that I told them about the first object that I saw and they also saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects could not be ballons because at the altitude to which they looked they were at had to burst by the sun rays. A<n> <n><n> <n><n> high-altitude airliner, those planes that are way up high in the sky and leave a smog white trail, was able to travel under one of the objects and I was able to campare that the unknown object was about twice as high in the sky than the airliner&#39;s altitude.(The aircraft passed under the third object that I saw).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope that this sighting  is somehow useful and I give many thanks for the people for putting an easy  source to reach for the public to report ufos.<n>

That&#39;s when I noticed an unusual light above the treetops from a forest area that borders my property (approx. 50 ft above ground and approx 100 yards away).  I pointed it out to her, and she did not realize that a light coming from that area was strange, she thought it was like a reflection of our lanai (porch) lights reflection off something up there. I said, no...not possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got out and walked closer, and proceeded to see this light change colors, from red to blue, to bright white.  We were blown away by what we saw, and watched it for about 3-5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we went away from it for a little while, when we did, she saw it move back into her sight at an alarming speed (she freeked out), and she hollered at me to come see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see it where she said it took off to, but she said it didn&#39;t move that far, and only moved to continue to check us out.  So we went back to the side of the house that allowed the best view, and I watched for about 30 seconds the area behind the trees that she said it moved to, and sure enough, it re-appeared as a dim light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, in the original spot that we first saw it, two other lights appeared.  It was very hard to judge shape or size, however it did appear that they were changing shape, and they definately were changing color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the other two appeared, ALL 3 got really bright simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were dumbfounded, as neither or us has encountered anything strange before and frankly were skeptical of this type of stuff.  The main light, the one that had moved, also appeared to have &#34;dancing&#34; white smaller lights around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All in all, they were &#34;around&#34; for about a half hour to 45 minutes.  I did not even think to grab my camera, as I was so overwhelmed by what I was witnessing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It truly seemed to both of us that they were watching us, and somewhat using the treetops as cover, however when we went to the side of the house that they were near, the would like re-appear and even get brighter, changing from red to blue to white to bright white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have heard aircraft, as it is really quiet where I live, and the fact that she saw it move super fast and then we saw three proves to me we saw something &#34;out of this world&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects appeared to change shapes, and one of them even kinda burned like a flair for a short time (a minute or so), but would then change to blue and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They or it did seem to be checking us out, and maybe it could sense our body heat and/or the heat from the hot-tub.  ???<n>

Myself and two of my friends were at a campsite deep in the mountains in Suches Georgia. The campsite is located along an old dirt road called Old 41 that wonders through the southern appalachians. We were literally miles away from any other people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a quiet, clear night.  We first noticed something strange when we saw a brief flash of light that lit up the canopy of trees around us.  It almost seemed like lightning.  There was no following thunder.  All three of us noticed right away that the skies were completely clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About twenty seconds later as my companions and I pondered and verbally discussed the source of the mysterious flash of light.  A triangular shaped craft flew directly over head at an amazing speed. The craft must have only been about fifty to one hundred feet over the tops of the trees.  At that speed and altitude, a pilot in a coventional plane would of had to be insane.  The object hissed as it passed by.  There was no other sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object projected a sharp bright light (similar in brightness and color to a halogen spotlight) towards the ground and lit up every thing within my sight as it passed over.  The light was being emmitted from an area about 10 of 15 feet in diameter from the bottem center of the craft.  I think there might have been smaller more faint lights around the edges of the craft.  The &#34;fly-by&#34; only lasted a split second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the craft passed the wind picked up and lasted a minute or two. I can&#39;t remember how long exactly because I was franticly throwing my camping gear into the back of the truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we left at about 1:20am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Case has been forwarded to Tom Sheets<n>

(She lived a few blocks east of the capital building, a huge art deco skyscraper.)  Come midnight, the lights went down on the Capital and we sat out on her porch gazing up at the sky. I noticed a couple of points of light moving slowly across the sky towards each other (as airplanes would if they aimed for each other) except that the lights approached each other and danced around each other and sped away, like a satellite using gravity as a slingshot. They did this dance for a while, this happened for about ten or fifteen mintues, the lights would fade in intensity and suddenly brighten (although this change in luminosity seemed to be a separate phenomenon from the speed of the &#34;craft.&#34;) For about 15 minutes we observed 2, sometimes three lights (although one light would always be fainter in this case) doing an impossible tango in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My buddy thought it was fighter jets, and my former girl mentioned that the lights were well above the feathery cirrus clouds, and I&#39;m pretty sure commercial aircraft don&#39;t fly that high. One guess of mine is that the lights were caused by craft skimming on the edge of the atmosphere (hte bright bursts of light caused much in the same way as the splashes caused by a water skier bouncing on the surface of the ocean.) Also the lights would travel below the skyline of Lincoln to almost directly overhead within seconds. We could not hear any engines of jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We debated this for probably 15 minutes before the lights faded off. As we were about to go inside I spotted a light again. (It was moving parallel to the power lines above where we sat.)  Suddenly the light brightened, and forked apart into seven or eight lights which for about two seconds moved in tandem with each other (horizontally?) before they began to swarm around and forward (like the flying machines moving en masse in the Matrix 3 or the meteors at the end of Contact moving in one direction) and shot up into the sky. (I called Lincoln 911 afterwards, feeling rather foolish when the woman who answered laughed at me.)  Even now I can believe what I saw; yet I can&#39;t. I am a skeptic through and through (I do not believe in the spiritual, I trust in science) and for me to see something with my own two eyes that not only defies the current laws of physics (or maybe it doesn&#39;t, not my field of expertise); for me to actually get a fundamental answer to the question of are we alone was something I never expected. I figured I&#39;d die without answers to anything (or at least the big questions.)  Earlier today, a few of my friends and I got to talking UFOs and someone said I should document what I saw so . . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, not much of a story, but when I looked on here to see if anyone reported anything about it and I saw nothing from 2005, I decided better late than never.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was waiting for it to explode...it didn&#39;t! I thought it to be a dud but it was dead silent and it would have made a fairly loud &#34;boom&#34; if it were a firework, but it had no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were about 10 small, bright balls of lights lined straight up. Right after we seen them they sinchronizingly (sp?) disapeared altogether. As they disapeared  i seen one of the middle balls curve out of formation with the other and there were airplanes or jets flying behind it. Then we seen this bright yellow light swerving all over the place but it slowly got dimmer and dimmer until it was gone.<n>

I looked up to the night sky towards the moon, (as I do every night) and I noticed what appeared to be a star except it didn’t seem to fit with the constellations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not saying I know all my constellations, I’m just saying it didn’t fit. Now this star was directly Underneath the moon and I thought to myself is it moving or doe’s it just appear as so because I was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I stopped, and low and behold the &#34;star&#34; was still descending very rapidly. I called over a few co-workers, and the security guard on duty to take a look. Just for self-satisfaction that I wasn’t crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all continued to watch it descend, now when I say descend I don’t mean on an angle, it was dropping straight down. Not at a speed you would contribute to something falling from the sky, and then at a certain point it looked as though it stopped, and wavered a little then it continued its journey down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before it got below my line of sight from the roof of my job, it just vanished. For as many years as I have been looking up (I’m 25 now) I have never seen anything so peculiar in my life.  It was probably nothing, I just figured I’d share what I saw in case you receive similar reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing S-SE.

I did think it was strange that jets were out flying at that time of night. Then I saw further in the sky, towards the west something floating down like the way a feather would float down and it was in the shape of an oval or a pringles potato chip ( i know that sounds strange, but thats what it looked like to me) and it was coming down really slowly, going back and forth as it came down and as I tried to study it more closely and focus on it, it appeared to have some kind of a pattern on it, to me it looked like some kind of flower and it was white background and the flower looking thing was either lights  or some other kind of shiny material, I couldn&#39;t tell.  Then it went too low and I lost sight of it because it went below the trees.  It must have came down somewhere out over the ocean is all I could of where it went.  When I got past the trees finally and could see the ocean I didnt see anything out there, besides it was dark outside, too, and I didnt see any kind of lights out on the ocean in the direction I thought the object must have gone down.  Then as I was standing there at the end of the park looking out at the ocean a object about the size of a helicopter, maybe bigger I couldnt tell cause the object was so well blended into the night sky, this object flew right over the tree tops in the park, and I mean right above them, it made no sound at all, the only reason why I noticed it was the fact that I had been looking up at the sky to see if there was anything else.   This object had a couple of little red lights on the bottom of it which also caught my eye.  It was flying over the park heading out over the ocean in the direction that I thought the other object must have gone down.  No one else, as far as I could tell had seen anything that I had just seen.  I couldn&#39;t believe other people could be so blind and just so oblivious as to all the stuff I had just seen.  I hope someone else saw the same stuff.  Then I went to my car and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

When I was 7 in my flat at maybe midnight throw my window I sow I very very bright light which was coming closer and closer.  When I fell asleep I had a strange nightmare that I was kidnaped by aliens.  I couldn&#39;t move or do anything I was just looking and I was very scared.

No one sow that except me it was really strange.  2 years later I was on a trip to Hungary with my family.On our way back we went to some restaurant and I finished eating first.  I came out and started to look at the stars.2 minutes after a 3 lights came from nowhere and they were very very bright and after 7-10 sec they were gone.  Sometimes in my dreams I can&#39;t move or talk I am just looking around and those dreams finish very strange:  I am on floor or my light is turned on or I am on other side of bed....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They weren’t blinking or anything they were just steady white lights. I stopped the car to look at the lights and my wife started to freak out because she thought that they were going to take us.

I did indeed send a response on the 20th!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is a copy of my original response... in case the original was lost.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting outdoors, at a small hamburger restaurant, with a friend. I initially saw what I thought was a small mylar ballon descending behind the sign at the mall we were at. A few moments later I saw the object rising again. At this point I still believed it to be a balloon and watched it as it rose somewhat rapidly to a few hundered feet. At this time I pointed it out to my friend who also saw it. It suddenly stopped very abruptly and just hovered for a few seconds. At this point I realized that it probably<n> <n><n> wasn&#39;t a ballon and was also much farther away then I had originally assumed. The objected seemed to be flickering or reflecting light in a manner that I realized, after a while, was in a regular cyclic<n> <n><n> pattern. It seemed to then slowly drift upward and to the West. It then shifted direction and started moving a little more rapidly towards the East until it went from our site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a (light colored) helicopter in the area a few minutes prior to the event. Having seen the<n> <n><n> helicopter a few minutes earlier made it quite clear, by comparison , that whatever we saw was not a<n> <n><n> conventional craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event seemed to last about 10-15 minutes in total. I&#39;m very surprised that there aren&#39;t more<n> <n><n> reports about this as it is a very heavily populated area. On top of it all, I&#39;m pretty much a sceptic<n> <n><n> about these sorts of things so I&#39;m very baffled by the whole experience. I&#39;m an artist by profession and feel that I&#39;ve got a pretty good eye for discerning the qualities of different objects and can say with a fair<n> <n><n> amount of certainty that it was not like any conventional aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

However I looked again because the shape was strange and the object was very shiny, chrome like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was high in the air, hard to judge the distance. Not 30,000 ft, more like 5 to 10,000ft up. The shape was more egg-like than anything else but the image I was looking at seemed blury.  It seemed to be flatter on the bottom and curved on the top. The middle was unclear as if there were something around it or vapor maybe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No I do not need glasses to see clearly. It&#39;s just that It looked like something with heat coming off of it, you know what I mean.The sun actually reflected off one part of it. It was seen while I was looking up high in the sky facing east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear and sunny day with some scattered higher clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving to the south, but did not move very fast. It was a steady movement though. There were four tall trees that were about to block my view after watching for around 6 or 7 seconds. I waited for the object to come from behind the trees. While I waited a jet came over the building behind me. Slightly lower than what I had seen, and headed east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew for sure that I had not been watching a plane or jet. I continued to wait to see it come from behind the trees. It never did. I walked quickly to the south to look further but it was gone. Just not there. It could not have traveled to low for me to see and should have come out from the trees in about another 10 seconds from when it went in. It didn&#39;t! I looked around alittle longer and kept searching around when I drove to the east but never saw another sign of it. I am a Truck Driver for CCX co. and am 51 Years old. I have never seen anything like this and I consider myself to be level headed and with a good reputation. I am only reporting this hoping that maybe someone else saw it better than me and saw where it went or how it vanished. We are not very far from Picatinny Armory, around 6 miles away.<n>

It was very low in the sky, just above the hills.  It must have been over 10 miles away because it&#39;s position never seemed to vary with respect to my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was watching it, another object appeared to rise out of the top of the first one.  Both were very large,about the size of a thumbnail on an outstretched arm.  After a few minutes, a third object appeared, blinked-out, and then re-appeared.  All three objects then hovered for about 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking for a road that might head out to them so I could get a closer look and a picture.  I finally pulled off on Hofsetter Rd. and stopped about 100 yards away from the freeway.  I opened my trunk to get my digital camera and when I got ready to take a video- they were gone. Very frustrating.<n>

It at first appeared to be a helicopter because it hovered and moved very slowy in a south western direction.  When I looked at it with my eyes alone, I could not decipher exactly what the image was. I thought it was a plane but the lights seemed too bright.  I also thought that it might be a star or the moon as you might view them as the sun is rising in the morning, however, the object appeared to be moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to my home from my morning walk,.  I retrieved my binoculars from my car and then viewed the object.  I thought I would see something normal that would explain what seemed abnormal.  What I saw was a somewhat round object silver in color outlined with what looked like a flourescent light tube that rapped arround the entire object.  At the base of the object there were three beams of the same flourescent light that encircled the object.  The shape of the beams were similar to the fire seen when a rocket is taking off or boosting power.  They were located at the base of the object.  One on both ends and one in the middle that appeared to be shorter that the other two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did awaken my roommate and asked him to come outside and view what I had seen.  He asked me what he was suppose to see.  I told him to just look and tell me what he thought it was.  He said that it must be a UFO and just went back to bed.  He did see the same image that I viewed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the morning paper to see if I could find an explanation for what I saw.  This evening I telephoned three local TV news stations and asked if anyone had reported seeing any strange obects that morning on the the west side of El Paso.  They all answered no.  The object that I saw was not a balloon, a plane, a helicopter nor was it like anything I have ever seen in my lifetime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not one to make up stories.  I saw what I saw and so did my roommate.  I am sure there is a logical explanation for what I saw and that is why I must know what it was that I did see.  Any help that you can offer would be greatly appreciated.  I just need to know what it was?  Thanks.<n>

I looked up to check the stars, which were brighter at that particular time and location (3 a.m., small subdivision basically in open treeless grassland/scrub brush terrain approx 1/2 mi E of I-25 at Johnstown exit).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the sky and talked for a few moments when I noticed 2 faint starlike objects traveling from N to S/SE.  They were roughly an inch apart if a ruler was held at arms length.  One was not in front of the other, rather offset and slightly to the left(NE).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked my watch which said 3:00 a.m. exactly as they were directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Speed was close to that of a jetliner although the impression was much faster since the faintness made them appear to be well up near the edge of the atmosphere.  No noise was noted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they travelled to the south the first one became dim and the second became much brighter, approximately half as bright as Venus.  They then both faded slowly from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We scanned the sky for any other movement but after a few minutes saw none, so my son went inside and after another sky check I re-entered my vehicle and drove home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The manner in which the two objects faded from view is characteristic of how satellites fade from view during the evening hours, as they move away from the setting sun, and into the Earth&#39;s shadow.  However, we do not know if satellites would be directly illuminated by the Sun at the hour indicated.  Moreover, as they orbit to the southeast, they would be approaching the rising sun in the east, so they should not fade from sight of a witness on the ground.  We do not know what the witness observed.  PD))<n>

The sky had a few clouds and we debated a few seconds whether the light we were seeing to the north east was a star or a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes we concluded it was a star and had taken seats on the balcony furniture. From the corner of my eye I saw a small light shoot across the sky but lost sight of it as it was above the balcony top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife stood to see what it was and she immediately said &#34;stand up, you have got to see this; Hurry , Hurry!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I caught sight of the light (which had a red tint to it) racing across the sky. I immdediately thought that it was a shooting star, because that was exactly the speed that it was going (but it was clearly below cloud level, which is what alarmed my wife in the first place.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light stopped dead still in the sky, within the same visual space as the star we had observed earlier. The object sat motionless for about 1 to 2 seconds, then moved left at about half the original speed for about 2 seconds. It appeared to make a quick circular motion then shot across the sky in front of the ship again at the speed of a shooting star.  We lost sight of it when it crossed the front of the ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all took place in a matter of about 5 to 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a sceptic of all things mysterious by nature and prefer to believe that there is most likely a sound scientific explanation for what we saw. I just don&#39;t know what it is at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be interested to know if any one else has seen a similar phenomenon and what some likley explanations might be.<n>
5/18/05 22:00|Phoenix|AZ|Light|30 min.|Phoenix Lights again over North Phoenix both yellowish orange and red near Deer Valley Airport.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44035.html|133|ndxe200505| Phoenix Lights again over North Phoenix both yellowish orange and red near Deer Valley Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work as a night security guard just north of Deer Valley Airport in North Phoenix. I have seen the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; many times from this location and a few others, perhaps altogether 12 times total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw them again last night (5-18-05) around 10:00pm just southwest of Deer Valley Airport over the city. It was hard to get an exact count of the number of lights involved, but I counted at least 5 which hovered stationary for about 10-15 minutes in exactly the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, a small plane which had come in for a landing at the airport swooped back up and headed in the direction of the lights; the lights faded out one by one as the small plane approached them. One of the lights seemed to pulsate red in light color while the others were yellowish orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In past sightings I had seen these lights in more of an amber color. Based on the color of the amber street lights both near and far (because there is a light refraction effect due to the atmosphere causing slight change in color over distance) and the observable size comparison between the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; and the street lights, I estimate that the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; would have to have been at least three feet in diameter and at least three miles from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As student with a physics major at ASU, after my last sighting I had devised this basic concept in order to guage the size of what I was seeing. I know that this is not a concrete method and is only a somewhat successful estimate. I will be conducting some experiments along this line which may give me a more solid premise. The real key here is exactly what color light was actually being emitted and consequently refracted, so I have used past experiences as a model for the test method.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over a year ago I had witnessed the lights in front of South Mountain which I later measured with my tripometer in my car to have been no more than ten miles away. Based on my recollection of the color and size from that experience and this new experience, I have come to the conclusion that the light source must be somewhere between 5 to 15 feet in diameter most likely. Hopefully, I will have devised a more precise guaging method by the next time I see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this siting the lights did appear once more about 15 minutes later much farther away and appearing more orange in color; the duration of this second instance was approximately two minutes. If my estimates are correct, these are not common flares as so many debunkers (I believe someone from NUFORC even attested to these lights having been flares on Coast to Coast AM if I am not mistaken because of a statement from what was referred to as a credible source&#39;s observation) have testified in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen these lights do some amazing things in the past with formations and maneuvers. According to my estimates of size, these light sources would have to be remotely flown or possibly manned flights. My curiosity is piqued.<n>

Initially, my friend insisted that it must be Venus, but upon further observation we determined that it was too large, too bright, and not where Venus should have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked much like an extremely large, bright star.

5/18/05 13:20|Edwardsville|IL|Sphere|8-10 seconds|ILLINOIS/MUFON REPORT:  Black sphere seen flying rapidly in a straight-line course under clouds.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44014.html|141|ndxe200505| black sphere seen flying rapidly in a straight-line course under clouds<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1:20pm I was lying in a lounge chair on my patio looking up at the sky when I observed what appeared to be a black sphere fly into my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came out of the southwest and moved in a northeast direction. It appeared to maintain level flight and constant speed throughout the sighting which lasted approximately 8-10 seconds. It appeared to be the size of a BB at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was first viewed at 90 degrees elevation (overhead) then moved across the sky to the northeast to approximately 15-20 degrees elevation before disappearing behind a treeline. As I observed this sphere, I noticed it was below the clouds which were at 25,000 feet altitude (checked with The Weather Channel immediately after sighting).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate it was not far below the clouds, but can&#39;t be certain. There was no noise and no vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was comparable in apparent speed and flight as that of a satellite when seen at night. The speed seemed very fast, though.  At first, I thought it might be a bird or aircraft.  However, the unwavering direction of flight and rate of speed ruled out these possibilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition, after the sighting, I was able to observe birds at high elevation and planes below and above the clouds.  All of these were clearly distinguishable for what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also suspected a balloon, since I determined the wind was SSW at 12 mph (also from the Weather Channel).  However, the speed was simply too fast for a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I wasn&#39;t looking at that specific portion of the sky at that exact time, I wouldn&#39;t have even noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Dave Marler, State Director of Illinois/MUFON, for sharing his sighting report with NUFORC.

The other was an extremely bright white light that was about five or six times larger than the orange light and it was very slowly pulsing on and off, but, not in the manner that a strobe light does and it was much more brilliant than any aircraft strobe I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The white light object was not directly behind the orange light, but, was off to the side and rear and obviously on track and/or seeming to be in pursuit of it. They were not close enough together to be mistaken as being a single object (unless it was an immense thing, thousands of feet long) and neither had conventional aircraft style multi- colored lights as are typically seen. They were both only single points of light as described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, I got my senses and ran to the bedroom window and yelled for my wife to hurry and come see this and I continued to watch and did not lose sight of them. When she made it outside and I showed her, she said, &#34;What is that?&#34; and I told her that I didn&#39;t know, but, they were definitely not any kind of airplanes or jets. By that time the objects were in the west/southwest sky at about 40 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, just as quickly as it appeared, the white light completely vanished and the orange light continued trekking west until it went out of our sight. Neither seemed to make any manuevers to turn or change altitude. There were no audible sounds and I did not notice any other aircraft in the sky during that time, at least, not in the same viewing area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total time I would estimate at 18- 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A side note: About eight or ten minutes later, two large planes at moderate altitude, one in front of the other and with identical lighting flew directly overhead from the east on a due west heading. The lighting on them was not like commercial aircraft, but, they were assuredly conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought the event was definitely spectacular and out of the ordinary. Would like to know if someone else witnessed and reported it.<n>

We were looking at the half moon in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Directly overhead in the upper stratosphere we observed a satellite moving from west to east.  As the satellite disappeared from sight in the east, another brighter light (to the south of where the light had originated) was moving at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the satellite disappeared from the east, an object from the southwest running parallel with the flat path of the satellite came across the sky at a high rate of speed.  Directly overhead the object made a right angle turn north for a few sconds, then another right angle turn to the east, then yet another right angle turn to the north, and yet finally  another right angle turn to the east on approximately the same flight plan as the satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then appeared to shoot straight up in the sky and disappeared from sight, slightly moving towards the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded and credible.

It was approximately 4 or 5 in afternoon and partly cloudy.  A friend and I were on the balcony when we noticed a weird shaped object that was dark, flying at a steady pace from north to south.  I got a picture on my digital camera and a few minutes later, I took a picture of a plane flying in the opposite direction.  You can clearly see the difference.  The ufo was steady and rather far away, yet clearly was not a normal looking object. It was an irregular shape and almost seemed impossible to be flying.  Even on the camera, you can see either air displacement or heat disbursement around the object.  I have only told close friends and family about this and they have all agreed that it is a rare occasion.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking at the sky, it was a clear day and we had just picked up a bunch of kids.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a reflection from an object in the sky. The object at first looked perfectly round and metallic but the more I stared it seemed to become transparent. I thought it was a weather balloon but I could not see any devices hanging from the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object and soon there were trees that slightly blocked my view of the object but I kept my eyes fixed on it until the trees passed. The trees were only there for 10 seconds tops and I could still see the reflection through the trees. But by the time the trees passed, the object was gone completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Planes were visible at the same time and traveled slowly in comparison to the dissappearence of the object. I was facing southeast at the time and if I am standing on the ground it would have been above me at an approximate 70-75 degree angle. A bit before this happened the train I was traveling on lost power for five minutes.<n>

It looked similar in brightness to Regulus in the Constellation Leo if it were in the night sky with the exception this was daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing it for several minutes trying to determine whether it was perhaps a mylar balloon we noticed that it remained stationary and appeared to be getting larger (as if it were descending). We took turns viewing it so we would not succumb to an optical illusion.  We pulled over on Main towards the turnoff into the Forks at Earl&#39;s on Main just past the CN Station. Using the moon as a reference point, it was about  6 inches off the 8 o&#39;clock position and now moving towards the SW. It had become larger in appearance and looked almost like 2 balls turning clockwise slowly around each other and was now emanating a  bright reddish light. The reddish light went from a single distinct light to 3 lights then back to a single light then into 2 lights and back into 3 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to observe it as it once again seemed to stop moving and hovered in a stationary position emanating these same lights. I also notice that it seemed to now be rising in height becoming once again smaller. It had changed to a darker colouration with a silver edge and now looked like an oval solid object with some sort of &#34;field&#34; surrounding it making it appear very dark as if it had a shadow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started moving towards the east for a few moments and then stopped and began to rise further into the sky. We watched it for a few more minutes as it continually became smaller yet remained as a brilliant star looking object, then began moving off towards the North where it disappeared from sight.<n>

It was a large silver ball shaped object about 20 feet in diameter. As we saw it, it gathered speed and flew through a small cloud appearing to suck most of the vapour from it. as it did so it changed shape and shot off at ridiculously high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the time there was total silence in the air, even the noise from other planes became inaudible. My uncle now believes in UFO&#39;s but only because he has seen one with his own eyes and there is no way it could have been anything else, not from this planet anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife tells me that she read a paper monday morning after I had already told her and that a man had seen and photographed a similar UFO on the same day.<n>

I looked in the phone book to fine the postal code(or zip code for americans) so that i could easily link to it to show my friends.  so you can check it out on google maps until they update the satelite image. just search using the postal code s7m1a8 and zoom in all the way. its right next to google&#39;s green pointer arrow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It looked like the main object was a sphere with other undefined things connected to it.  Also there was a dark blackness within the outer edge of the main object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking at it I could see the jet behind it and the jet was about twice the distance as the object from me.  I could see the wings of the jet as well as the tail (it was well defined).  The object was much clearer as it was a lot closer and was a little larger than the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was going from the east to the west about at the same pace as the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the house to get my camera but when I returned all I saw was a somewhat of a blur that streaked across the sky from about the last place I saw the object traveling to the north west.  The object was gone but the jet was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I new I should have just stayed watching it and forgot my camera.<n>

I looked over the Lake and I observed a bright gleaming silver disc across the lake and over a place called havasu landing.  It was probably about 25 miles away from me and probably mile up in the sky.  The craft moved at right angles at lightening fast speeds, it would also sit still then instantly appear at least 10 miles across on the other side of the sky as fast as I could bling. I would estimate the craft to be 30 feet in disc shape length and probably 10 feet tall. I went inside to get my roomates and they observed the object with me and it was nothing we have ever seen before.  This area we saw the craft was either over california or nevada near the borders, we are 2 hours from las Vegas.  I observed the craft for easily 30 straight minutes.  I know what I saw is extra or intra dimension technology whether it was ours or not.  It was a classic silver disc.<n>

I opened my eyes but could not move. The paralysis has happened before and so I fought it with extreme anger. After a moment I gained control of my limbs and I managed to sit up. I looked out the window onto the porch and saw a typical grey alien crouched down staring at me. To the thing&#39;s left I could see another one through the door&#39;s window trying to get in by jigling the handle. They were wearing tight black jumpsuits of some sort. I also noticed an orange glow from above and behind them but not the source of it. I was scared to the extreme.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped up and ran out the front door into the hallway. I ran right into the chest of a white man wearing dark clothes of some kind. The man was like a rock and I bounced backward in horror, falling. I  lost consciousness before I hit the ground. The next thing I knew I was back on the couch. The sky was starting to get light and it was early morning. I noticed that the door to my porch was ajar. I got up, still scared, and left my apt. I drove to a nearby QFC parking lot and sat in my car until it was time for work. After that I was afraid to be alone in my apt. at night. I moved out shortly after in with my girlfriend for that reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is just one of several events like this since I was about 9 years old.

We thought we saw a Stealth bomber and began trying to see where it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw another, and after a while we saw several.  I went inside so my son could wake up and see them.  The three of us layed outside watching for over 4 hours.  During this time other types of aircraft appeared, several larger triangular looking aircraft were seen, as well as massive crafts consisting of several smaller crafts joined together.  We watched as they seemed to be moving from one large craft to another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed as though the smaller ones were launching from the larger ones.  Straight lines of what looked like stars (but were&#39;nt) were appearing, at one point there were at least five consisting of 8 or more moving lights.  During most of the activity in the sky we heard our dogs barking at nothing, cat (not ours) howling, and wild burros schreeching nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly before daylight it appeared as though they began to prepare to depart.  At times it seemed as though they were engaged in combat with each other.  Many falling star type beams observed, they were red and gold in color.  Larger crafts appeared to break down into several smaller ones and depart.  Some of the larger crafts had a blue craft that seemed to be guiding them away.  One large craft in particular split into two separate pieces one of which departed upward and the other downward in the distance.  The one that appeared to land here looked as though it turned over, changing its position as it was descending, towards 29 Palms.  During the entire event, they made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After most of the crafts had departed 4 gold colored, square objects began to ascend after them, they seemed to have been some kind of guide.  It was at this point that my husband called the 29 Palms Marine Corps base.  He was transferred to the correct person who basically told him &#34;he hadn&#39;t seen anything.&#34;  This statement was made after he was asked who he was, where he was, what was seen and how many others had seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, my husband placed another call to the local Sheriff&#39;s Department and was told an Officer would be sent down.  As he walked outside after this call, he proceeded to call his father and noticed that the 4 gold square objects were landing in a square formation around our house.  At this point we ran into our home and locked the doors and turned off the lights.  It appeared that some sort of door or hatch opened and a male human figure get out and began walking toward our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called the Sheriff&#39;s department back to see what was taking so long and were told the deputy would not be responding.  Husband went back outside and noticed one of the four objects was rising up from the ground again, it hovered at approximately 40-50 feet.  He quickly came back inside.  This was approximately 20 minutes before daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At daylight he went outside and observed them all departing, he called us out so we could see it too.  They were already several hundred feet off the ground.  A little later  we drove down to where they had landed and saw circular imprints in the soil as well as laid over weeds.  Only found two of these.<n>

I am going to remain anonymous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently a U.S. civilian mechanic hired to do work on military craft in Texas. I will not go into any other details right now, but I have very interesting news for all of you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sightings of triangular vehicles flying silently and slowly are real. They are not of alien origin, but rather U.S.A. made craft that must have some form of alien technology. These &#34;planes&#34; are truely remarkable, and they will be known publicly very soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to sign a document (non-disclosure agreement) and can be terminated (and in the words of the agreement, &#34;removed&#34;)  I was shown 7 of the 16 currently in Texas, and was told there were MANY more, some in Northern California, Nevada and some in New Mexico. I witnessed them in flight, and was taught how to remove and replace a part that I had never seen before. I have been working on aircraft since I was 16, (roughly 30 years ago) and know many of the components used in most modern aircraft. This was NOT normal. It contained a blue fluid and must have weighed 600 lbs, yet was only 3 feet X 4 feet and about 16 to 18&#34; deep. It had a clear window about an inch sqare that you could see blue fluid inside of it, and the part had three progs on both ends. This part went into what was described as the Stellar Ignition Feed, and they called the part a Fuel Rod.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crafts themselves are BLACK. Not just black, but blacker than black. It&#39;s wierd I know, but you have never seen any black like this. Not only were there visible tiling around the craft, much like the space shuttle, but these were not tiles. It appeared to have a SKIN. A lifelike skin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this all sounds crazy, trust me I thought I was going crazy when I witnessed what these aircraft can do, but I will provide more detailed information later. I am currently off dute for three days, and need to contact some friends about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll be back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS: I am so glad I found your site. I searched all over the internet today for a place to report this, and was relieved to find your site. Thank you! More to come.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; he provides no contact information.

My mom was driving and she looked off the road.  When she looked back we saw a flash of something moving in front of our car.  Then it flew off with blinking lights and flew out into the sky and disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The lake is off the paved roads, rather rural, no electricity or water or sanitary facilities. It sets in a depression surrounded by low rolling hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all fishing, facing three different directions. Suddenly we heard a sound of something traveling at a high rate of speed from the (approximate)ESE. We all looked up when it was at its loudest, apparently directly overhead, and tried to follow the sound as it disappeared in the (approximate) WNW. The entire incident was only about 30-40 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound got louder and higher in pitch as it approached us, being loudest and the highest pitch when seemingly overhead, and then got softer and lower in pitch as it disappeared. There was NO odor, color, turbulance (that we could tell), exhaust trail, engine flame, lights, reflection of sunlight... absolutely NOTHING except the sound... a &#34;whooshing&#34; sound of something apparently not extremely large, but moving very rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The few birds there were did not exhibit any unusual behavior, and as nearly as we could tell we were &#34;alone&#34; at the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us had any idea as to what caused the sound, or the significance of it, or anything about it, except for agreeing to what is reported above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired school teacher/librarian, age 64, my oldest brother is 69 and a semi-retired printer, my younger brother works for a petroleum company and is 59. We come from different locations... two from seperate locations in the Texas panhandle, one from a small town in the Oklahoma panhandle (different county, however).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was fairly calm, sunny to partly cloudy, and warm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The nearest air bases, to my knowledge, are at Clovis, NM, OKC, Altus, OK -- all at some distance from the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Educationally, I have two batchelor degrees and a masters; my older brother has a bachelors degree; my younger brother a GED and all of us considerable education from &#34;hard knocks!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would agree to follow-up contact via e-mail or otherwise (but at no additional expense to us, please).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have located the town of Clear Lake, OK, but the only nearby bodies of water we can locate through www.mapquest.com are Lake Evan Chambers, to the northeast of that town, and<n>

It was yellow. It was like half ball and halk triangle.  I saw it and at first I thought, &#34;must be my imagination&#34;.  but i even rubbed my eyes,shook my head and I even pulled up my glasses all the way up to my nose to see better. But no. It was never my imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my mom while she was driving, &#34;What is that ugly,scary thing up in the sky?&#34;  But when she looked up, there was nothing.  I looked all over for it.  I&#39;m in practicly in trauma right now.  I don&#39;t want to stay by myself at all. I am &#34;special&#34; and I have a &#34;gut feeling&#34; that something bad will happen if I am alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened today and I&#39;m in shock.  I&#39;m so scared. I mean why did it dissapear?  How do I know if maybe at night the creatures in that thing come after me and try to do something to me?  i&#39;m scared. HELP.<n>

We kept witnessing bright circular bursts of white light that reminded me of a flash and I kept question it b/c it was like no lightening I had ever witnessed in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 2 am we began to see a orange shape circle off in the distance and I was drawn to it b/c it looked like a setting sun though small in comparison and it began to dim then went away and within a minute or so it was back as bright as could be in the same location it appeared to stay in the same position the entire time before once again dimming and disappering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in the flight path of the Airport so I&#39;ve grown accustome to the sounds and shapes of planes. The object had no sound like the planes that pass over our house with running lights on and landing gear down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 45 minutes to an hour after the event a plane did fly over our house and I remarked how we heard it and could distinctly see the red and white blinking plane lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During our encounter of this odd orange blob, I sent my husband running for our camera. I got one capture that when blown up looked like two curved smiles. The whole event lasted about 10 minutes and then within 1/2 hour we heard this odd tone that neither of us could place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband, is usualy the logical skeptic, said there is no way it was a flare nor weather balloon because it remained in the same position and the way it dimmed and came back so bright was not typical of either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides a photo of two objects against a night sky.

They were not bright, but dim lights, a soft blue/white color (naturally Im color blind so its hard to say) sort of reminded me of the color from a LCD flashlight, but dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew from the east overhead and disapeared to the west. And they were traveling faster than anything I have ever seen. I thought at first it was a series of shooting stars, but there wasnt any trail, or space junk, but no trail. That fast though, get my idea of speed. AND TOTALLY SILENT.............and Im far enough out in the country where therte is not much noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOT a sound, nada zip. about 10 seconds after it was gone, I realized just what it was, because I had a similar experience when I was about 11 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I realized what Id seen, I got that same feeling again that I did back in &#34;64&#34;, Im still like a little stunned right now, but had to log this down in here, as a safe spot with proof.<n>

I went outside and heard the sound coming from above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up towards the east and saw three lights flying towards my direction. I went indside my house and got my camera. When I came outside I could see three different sets of lights. The lights seemed very low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in an area that is lower than the surrounding land, so they must have been very low. I took several pictures but ran out of memory. One of the sets of lights seemed to move more in my direction then they slowly flew away.<n>
5/13/05 21:15|Emory|TX|Rectangle|about 1 minute|Man and wife experience a dramatic sighting of a UFO hovering nearby:  A "disappearing cell phone radio tower"|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43991.html|192|ndxe200505| Man and wife experience a dramatic sighting of a UFO hovering nearby:  A &#34;disappearing cell phone radio tower&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were returning home from a Gospel meeting.  As we drove south on FM779 about half a mile north of our turn off on Rains County Road 2230, we looked off to our left (toward the east) and saw what looked like a cellphone radio tower.  It was lite up on top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remarked to my wife that I wasn&#39;t aware they were building another tower so close to the one near our home.  She said that it looked like it was lighted different for the one near us.  It looked like the top of the tower had three horizontal rows of white lights on it.  There were two red, flasing lights just below the white lights and a white strobe light above the horizontal rows of white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be taller than the tower near us so I remarked that possibly there were different lighting requirements for taller towers.  I again said to her that I wondered why they would build another tower so close to the one near us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were looking across an open pasture of a dairy farm.  The lights looked to be, maybe, a quarter mile away. It was hard to judge distance because it was very near dark. My estimate of the distance between us and it is based on how large I would expect the platform on a radio tower to appear.  We were not alarmed and thought no more about it until the next day when we drove down the same road and there was no tower there or anything of any height anywhere near that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drive down that road sometimes five times a day.  If there was a tower being erected anywhere around there we would have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t understand why we weren&#39;t alarmed, more observant and at least more curious when we saw the lights.  We don&#39;t know what we saw, but whatever it was, was certainly there on Friday night, May 13, 2005.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the witness, who is well known by NUFORC, and others in the UFO community, for submitting this report.

Given your experience in the field of ufology, I suspect that you are not predisposed to flights of fancy, when it comes to reporting a sighting, the likes of which you describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am processing newly received reports now, and we will have your report posted to our site very soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, again, for sharing the information with NUFORC!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards,  Peter<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.  Really, I&#39;m rather puzzeled.  It was all so matter-of-fact on the part of me and my wife.  We were not thinking about anything like a UFO and it did not even occur to us to stop or to question what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m working on a map of the location where we saw whatever it was.  I also have a picture or two of the open area where we saw it and I&#39;ll try to come up with some kind of drawing of what we saw.  I&#39;m not much of a computer artist but I think I can come up with something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END CORRESPONDENCE #2))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Attached are some maps of where the sighting took place, a very rought sketch of what the object looked like to us, and a photo made the following day of the area where the sighting took place.  As you can see, there ain&#39;t no tower there!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter, please feel free to use the attachments as you see fit.  I apologize for the poor quality of the drawing of the object.  I don&#39;t have even a little bit of drawing talent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you would like, you are free to use our names associated with this sighting.  My wife of 43+ years is named ((name deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suspect that you are correct in your suspicion show below.  When I began telling my friends of my interest in UFOs, friends that I had had for years and years suddenly began telling me about sightings that they had had.  Some of their stories were VERY interesting and unusual.  They had never said anything to anyone before about their sightings.  Certainly does make you wonder how many strange things are actually going on out there and are never reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have questions about what the wife and I saw, please ask.  I don&#39;t feel like I covered it very well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END CORRESPONDENCE))<n>

I of course thought that it was a jet coming in to land at the airport but as I got closer to my house this craft was still pretty much in the same spot. I thought that this waz very weird because it was going so slow I thought that it was going to fall out of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached my street I could see that the railroad crossing gates were all down and flashing. These are a triple set of tracks and I thought that was odd because usually not all of them go down at the same time. And the gates go down just a few minutes before the actual train goes by and no train came through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I pulled into my driveway and this object was directly behind my house but out over the lake. And for about a minute it stood still and then it started moving again. Still at the speed of a snail. I stood on my back deck watching it creep along ever so slowly.......it was actually painful to stand and watch it it was slow.....like watching paint dry.......anyway, I watched it for 20 minutes before it was out of view and then I went in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft/object was sort of helicopter shaped. It was fairly low in the sky and it made a sound like a jet only softer more masssive. I appeared to have three very large, (two story size), windows on the front and the light that came from those windows was the brightest I have ever seen in my life. Also it flew with the front down slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I definatly know it was not a jet and it was not a helicopter. I was close enough to see the windows and the shape of this thing. Also there were no other lights lit up on it. No flashing lights and no tail section like a jet or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So that is my sighting as I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has not been the first encounter I have had with &#34;others&#34;. I do have other stories that started when I was a child. I believe that soon we will have actual evidence to take care of the naysayers. But until then it will remain a small group of us that know what is out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((initials deleted))   :)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are not certain whether the sighting occurred on the morning of May 13, or May 14.  We will contact the witness to obtain clarification.

(Shadowridge)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My roommate and I left our apartment and went out to our car when I noticed movement in the sky almost directly above and in front of us as we walked East through the parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up, I expected to see the lights of a plane coming in to land at Palomar airport, turning on it&#39;s landing lights and making it&#39;s banked turn West.  Instead, I spotted a very bright red/gold light with a long streaking tail. The second I saw that, I reacted by jabbing my friend&#39;s shoulder to get his attention. I pointed up to it. It reached directly overhead when he spotted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued streaking across the sky, running North to South, and the tail even started to spark. Then it faded and went out of sight to the South. We both believe that this was a meteorite or a piece of space debris falling back to Earth. It appeared very low, lasted much longer than I&#39;ve ever seen, and was really bright. If it was just a meteorite, it was a fairly bright one and still a spectacular sight for anyone who may have caught this one. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if one or two more local reports come in on this tonight.<n>

I had a clear view of the bottom of craft as it was banking but when it levelled out it was GONE/perfectly stealthy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personal notation: I was going out to drop some recycling material and heard or sensed something very subtle.  I looked up towards the east and saw clearly a perfect black triangle which was travelling 45 degrees up from my view facing due east.  I was dumbstruck as the craft made barely any noise, and seemed to be defying the laws of gravity and aviation as it was banking North east from my with no audible noise. I strained to hear anything and could not, but sensed great power or energy.  I was amazed at the razor sharp edges of the triangle and was struck by the clarity of the salmon colored lights that ran up one side of the triangle leading edge and up the other side but not on the part of the triangle which was on the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw that the craft was leveling off and as soon as it did it completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My feeling was one of amazement, also a very ominous feeling which turned into excitement and fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with, and spoken with via telephone, the witness, and he appears to us to be quite serious-minded and credible.

The object was about 1/2 mile away from me at near treetop level. The area in question is mostly residential with schools in the area. I watched this object for about 2 minutes. It was not any kind of aircraft I am familiar with. It moved little but eventially disappeared. The other cashier was busy with customers and was not able to view it. It would have been dangerously low if it were and aircraft. I estimate it was substantially larger than a small plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried later to interview residents of the area and none saw anything. I also reconnoitered the area to look for anything unusual that might explain the sighting. Nothing was found. No other people said they saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stood in her driveway only 20 feet from the house and began pointing out the common constalations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a faint light darting across the sky, it may have moved a half inch or so from our location at a time. We first thought it was a plane. We dismissed this after watching it for one or two minutes. The movements were too irregular to be an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made quick, movements moving only a half inch or so at a time. It moved left, right, up, down, and every way inbetween.

We assembled the teloscope, at this point it was 22:30 roughly, and the object were stationary for longer periods of time. The teloscope and binoqulars didn&#39;t help very much. They were old and too dirty. The objects were clearly round in shape. We continued to observes them until 24:10 roughly, and as time passed the objects were stationary for longer and longer periods of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ploted out the points, marking a place of referrence and used a one peak of my girlfriends roof to mark the object to the left and a large pine tree to mark the object to the right.

I clearly saw the outline of the Mtn. Range.  The road continues up to the top of that Mtn. (Overlooking an olive orchard)  I pulled over and waited outside my car with the flashers on so I wouldn&#39;t get hit.  A car that was a few miles behind me, (or at least 5 minutes) pulled up and asked if I had seen the flash.  I told them I had.  After a short while I got back in my car to continue my drive.  (It was really cold out)  After no more than 30 seconds in the car, I saw the next Mtn. range in front of me light up as I had the last.  It was a strange experiance to say the least.  I can&#39;t think of any light I have seen so bright.  We are talking 10 miles of Mtn. profile that lit up.  I don&#39;t think a transformer blowing up could do that.  However, I&#39;m not sure I rule out the possibility of a metiorite quite yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something to note:  I did see more animals on this road than I typically do.  There were aircraft in the area, however, I am unsure as to weather they were civilian or military.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 25 miles South of South Mountain in Phoenix I had the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on I-10, which goes North from Tucson to Phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a very bright white light on an aircraft to the east of I-10. The craft has a flashing blue light like in a tail area so I assumed a light plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no noise though. Then the tail light started to whip around in a fashion suggesting it was not attached to the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was also moving erractically and very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I though wow, I´m really tired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then on the west side of I-10, I saw 4 very bright white lights that lit up very quickly and flew at I-10 at a very high speed and zoomed up in a parabolic way and disappeared. This was very odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally I saw a very bright light in front of me in the sky. The light got very bright and then dimmed revealing the bottom of a craft shaped like an old fashioned keyhole. The base of the craft had blue and pinkish red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this sounds weird, but I did see it, as described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don´t know what this was, but it is the strangest thing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do not have aircraft that can move like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting period lasted 5 minutes.<n>

I noticed that there was something above the horizon. It was like an orb, with about 4 red lights. I thought at first that this was a helicopter or an aircraft. However, after I realised this would be impossible, as it was too low, made no noise, and didnt move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to take a closer look. So i went outside, closer to the field. I saw this object a little closer. It was a round object, mid air, with about 4 red lights. These lights were flickering. I watched it for about half an hour. Then it disapeared, it moved upwards slowly, then vanished, with each light disappearing as it moved upwards.<n>

5/10/05 15:00|McLean|VA|Other|One Minute|Three balls of light (BOLs), bobbing in circular formation, seen in midafternoon low over homes .|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48921.html|219|ndxe200505| Three balls of light (BOLs), bobbing in circular formation, seen in midafternoon low over homes .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m belatedly reporting, only having recently found out about this website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On May 10, 2005, approximately 3:00pm, in the courtyard behind my townhouse in McLean, VA, I witnessed three balls of &#34;white,&#34; hovering over my home.  It was the day before fighter jets were dispatched in DC to intercept a civilian aircraft--very much in that days news at the time, which had intruded into restricted Washingtion air space.  One of these jets also flew low over my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since learned the objects I saw are referred to as balls of light or BOLs. I was gardening and happened to look up at the very blue sky to the right of my chimney...south. I saw three small balls, more like three round white puffs, not illuminated from within...that I could tell...but just reflecting sun light.  At the time my estimate of their altitude was approximately 100 feet. They were bobbing around one another in a circular pattern; the formation was staying stationary.  Quickly after spotting them, and as if they realized I had noticed them, one shot off to the northeast, going behind my chimney and again becoming visible on the other side.  If the object was at 100 feet, I estimate the speed at 50-60 mph...the day was sunny and rather calm. This object, slightly bobbing, but moving in a straight line, quickly moved out of sight behind trees and other townhouses. When I turned my eyes back to the other two, they were also gone, obviously in different directions from the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects I saw were much the same as the BOLs I&#39;ve seen on television of lights taped over crop circles.  Their bobbing movements were also similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Driving from Beth-shemesh toward Kiryat-Gat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I saw 3 lights over the hills a head. At the first couple of minutes  I Thought it was sort of military aircraft activity. Then the 3 distance lights splitted while two of them maintained about 500m ahead about 500m- 1000m high above the road, and the 3rd went down. I would guess to about 100m or less above my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No extra-ordinary lights were seen beside the exact triangular shape of the object. No effect was seen on the car, everything kept working as it was prior to the encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also it is the first time I&#39;m reporting here, I wish to say that it wasn&#39;t the first time me or members of my family have encountered such objects. more then that, some members of my family (my brother and I) have some strange marks, mostly on our hands and legs. Short streight elevated lines under our skin (about 1cm long each).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also I have a Ph.D. in physics, I can not explain the sights. But still, we know so little about our universe.

I went outside to invistigate.  No one was to be seen.  At which point, I asked my wife if she would go to the corner store for a beer. Too cool my nerves, and to serve as a nightcap.  Five minutes later I decided to go outside again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw a Mesa police cruiser parked in front of my apartment.  I went around a neighboring apartment as I heard a small crowd.  There I saw a police officer and about seven other people who heard or felt the same &#34;boom&#34;.  We live underneath a known flight path but nothing like this!  As my wife returns, a second &#34;boom&#34; was heard to the north-west.  The officer heard this as well and immediately radio&#39;d it in.  As we live next to a police and fire station, a fire-truck was scrambled to see if there was an explosion of some sort in our area.  A police helicopter orbited our complex then searched to the west to see if there was any trouble-there was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, more people came out claiming they too heard the loud explosion and about 12 mins., later a smaller one as well.  I didn&#39;t hear it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of pure curiosity I called a local TV station FOX 10 and they said they only knew of a apartment fire 10 miles to the north-east.  I then as a lark, called Luke&#39;s AFB and asked if they knew of any supersonic overflights over Mesa.  Maybe a hot-dogger or two.  They said not that they know of, but suggested I call in the morning and file a report with the&#39;re OSI division.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only file this report because maybe this might corroborate a possible ufo sighting as I have seen this activity before-less the &#34;fast mover&#34;.<n>

My backyard faces a street with a large empty lot across that street; I live on the outskirts of Austin out in the southwestern hills area where there is a lot of vacant land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I sat watching my dog, I heard a small chirping sound and looked up.  Just across the street was a long line of green rectangular lights hovering about 60-100 feet over the vacant lot.  The object was close enough to me where, if it had been a blimp, I think I could have heard the engine which is quite noisy on a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the initial small chirping sound, I didn&#39;t hear anything else coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly grabbed my dog, ran inside, locked the door, turned off all the lights, and sat down on my couch shaking and praying that whatever it was was not interested in me or my dog.   After about five minutes, I sneaked over to my window and slowly raised one slat on the blind to peek out and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I peeked out several times that night and the following nights and never saw it again (to my relief, I might add!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wrote down the date and time this happened to eventually report it to someone.<n>

5/9/05 13:00|Cumberland|ME|Cigar|15 minutes|((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous source.  Hoax??  PD))  I was at a party late on Tuesday night with about 4 of my friends from college.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43897.html|228|ndxe200505| I was at a party late on Tuesday night with about 4 of my friends from college. Everything was going great and there were tons of stars in the sky that were all visible because there were no clouds out at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were having a barbecue and while everyone was talking and relaxing I kept noticing and my eyes kept wondering off towards this particular star that seemed to stand out from the rest and it looked like it was moving. I ignored it at first thinking that it was just an illusion but as I looked closer it really was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned around to tell my friends that there was something moving towards us way off in the sky amongst the stars and when I turned around to point it out to them it had moved much further to us. This thing must have been as far as hell away from us as possible since it looked as if it were sitting up in space with the stars and to move that much of a distance in about 5 seconds is incredible.  I don&#39;t even think any planes, fighter jets, or anyhting that has been made on this planet can travel that fast from that far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone was excited at this point and we just watched as it got closer and closer to where we were. Now that I recall the whole time that this was happening there was no noise or anything and after it got to where we were at such mind blowing speeds it slowed to about a 10 mile an hour hover right above the trees that were about 20 feet away from us. These trees down at my house are all about 50 feet tall so we had an amazing view of this cigar shaped ship. It did have these 5 intensly bright lights on the bottom of it that were all white except the one in the middle was a less bright yellow color. At one point the craft just completely stopped while above the trees and the middle light yellow light became more intense than the white ones and flickered on and off twice<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do know for a fact though that it was a solid object because the lights on the bottom of it reflected the silver metallic surface that it was made out of. Also when it flew over us it covered up most of the stars in the sky so we knew that it was solid. it was atleast 65 feet long and from the bottom you could easily tell it was about 25 feet wide. We observed it hovering above the trees that were now lit up becuase of the intense lights on the bottom of the craft until the light in the center turned from yellow to light blue and it sped off at amazing speeds over the trees in my back yard to about 1,000 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this whole time there was no noise whatsoever and we were actually kind of spooked. Then off in the distance not to far away two other ships on the left and right sides of the cigar shaped craft rose up from the thick woods and then at that point all five of them sped away in formation within about 2 seconds.I know I will never see anything like this again in my life and it will stay with me forever. I know for a fact it wasn&#39;t a blimp, plane, jet, helicopter or anything and so do my friends. I am studying to be a doctor at Bowden college and I am not crazy. I know what I saw and I&#39;m not lying. THIS IS NOT A JOKE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I read the report I mentioned above just moments ago and I have to say that I saw nothing of the sort.  I get on my roof to watch the Stealth do its fly by (as most of us locals don&#39;t care to go to the races all that much) and normally take photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This year I didn&#39;t have batteries for my digital camera however I had my camera phone. I witnessed the stealth through binoculars from a distance and directly as it flew over me twice. I never saw any other object in its path, and I surely did not see any smoke coming from its wing.  I have to assume that the individual who made the report was either in another existance, or was like most race goers and heavily intoxicated and possibly hung over from the night before (the weekend of the 500 all of the fans consume mind-blowing amounts of alcohol and god knows what else).<n>

My dog was with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly my dog became very agitated and seemed to want back in the house. At the same time my head and hair began to tingle.

He said to me, &#34;Do you think that is a star or a plane?&#34;  I immediately saw what he was looking at because it was so visibly bright. It was not moving so I said it must be a star but it is too bright and to low in the sky compared to the other stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking at it and as we got closer to it I could see it was flashing lights so I figured it was a plane. Then I thought it couldn’t be a plane either because it was moving to slow. I rolled the window down and looked up at it as it was flying over us. I saw 3 distinct lights in a row that were brighter than any other flashing lights I’ve seen. They were flashing from the right to the left one at a time but very fast. It reminded me of a police car lights on the top of the car. I couldn’t see what the lights were attached to because they were so bright. As we drove past it I looked back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness on two occasions, and she seemed quite credible to us.

I was at 3500 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something approached the plane -- I got a sense of speed before a sense of it&#39;s shape -- from the right front quarter.  It darted right under the plane, I would say at about 15 to twenty feet below me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it might be a bird, and was alarmed.  A bird strike, even in a small plane, could do some serious damage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly looked to my left and saw the object.  It was a sphere, about the size of a large softball, or maybe a bit smaller than a basketball.  It was pale yellow in color, and it was moving very fast, in a horizontal path, not diving, or climbing.  It disappeared to the west very quickly.  I lost it on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told myself it had to have been a bird, but no bird moves that fast.  Even with combined closing speed (I was only doing 90 knots indicated -- about 103mph) a bird would not have looked like it was going that fast.  I had to collect myself and fly the plane, I was about to enter busy airspace, so I had to think about other things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange.<n>

The light zig-zagged from left to right-more so up and down and then disappeared behind the ridge only to keep reappearing about 5 times fading out (the light) then disappear for good behind the mountain ridge. We saw this through the night vision scope and the light was much more intense than any other star or planet in the sky.  Its movement, as seen through the scope, was clearly moving erratically compared to any other night objects such as stars,airplanes passing by,satellites etc. The same description would be given as we saw also saw this with our naked eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I only had a short view as I saw it through a break in the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was moving fast and it appeared to be too close to the ground not to hit the ground at the speed it was traveling. I saw nor heard any indication of this light hitting the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light appeared to be a round bright green dot with a brighter whitish center. The track it was taking was straight, no arc; however my opportunity of viewing was short.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was partly cloudy, temperature about 55F. No other apparent reason for light falling from the sky, no fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color is was what caught my eye as I was looking directly southeast at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did contact a Philadelphia news channel to find out if this light was seen by anyone else. No reply from the e-mail as of 11:03pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no way of telling the distance this light was away from me so I can&#39;t even guess at the size.

The way it turned and the way it was coming down, there is no way a plane can move like that. It was very strange and very surreal feeling to have witnessed something like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thinking maybe some government had something entering the earths atmosphere.

5/6/05 23:19|Blue Springs|MO|Unknown|Just over 7 minutes|Amber-ish burning light shapeshifting into an array of lights moving very in slow motion but fast at the same time.....can't explain it|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43823.html|247|ndxe200505| Amber-ish burning light shapeshifting into an array of lights moving very in slow motion but fast at the same time.....can&#39;t explain it<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 11:19 PM, my girlfriend and I were heading back from dinner at a friend&#39;s house moving South on Highway 7.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a 1/4 mile North of Argo road, I stopped in the middle of a conversation because something amberish color caught my eye about right at my 10&#39;o clock or Southeast from us.  We started to really observe what the hell it was because we thought at first that maybe it was just a tower.  The light seemed to be about the same size one of those tower lights look like....height and everything, but it was flickering like it was burning.  It wasn&#39;t a red light like the towers have.  I mean it was orange like fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we realized that it wasn&#39;t a tower when we got passed the hills and trees and seen that it was clearly up in the sky a cosiderable height.  It wasn&#39;t a huge thing in the sky at all.  We keep heading South coming up to Pink Hill Road, then all of a sudden it got smaller and smaller.  This was very strange because it got so small it just looked like one of those tiny, tiny white-ish, blue-ish stars in the sky...just a speck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it started to move West accross Blue Springs very slowly and as we got closer to I-70 we could see flashing red and white lights, just like our airplanes and helIcoptors have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we were really confused because we thought we just saw a plane catch on fire or something, then it goes out and it&#39;s flying like normal.  As we stop at the stop light at I-70.  The flashing lights were flashing one at a time next to each other in a linear motion but around the object.  And it had a larger light underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed like the lights were moving in an oval shape, but as we tried to follow it, it completely did things we have never seen before.  It looked like it completely shifted shape because of the way the lights were positioned before it started moving slowly away from us, but really far at the same time.  It&#39;s kind of hard to explain without speaking with someone directly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we were following it West it turned North, but in a matter of about 15 seconds it kept getting smaller and smaller, then it disappeared over the horizen.  The whole weird thing about is that it looked like it wasn&#39;t hardly moving and yet it was coasting along silently and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seriously felt like when we started talking about what we were seeing and following it, it was like it knew and changed from a fireball and shapeshifted to a somewhat shoddy airplane look a like and then slowly drifted away into the horizen, but like I said over a 15 second period.  It had to been moving really fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also thought that maybe it was something that came back into the atmosphere at a great rate of speed and then proceeded to fly over our airspace, hence the fire at first cutting throught the atmosphere.  I don&#39;t know, it is really strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before and my girlfriend and I hope that we can talk to someone who may have watched the whole thing like we did.  I even called my buddy who was at dinner with me to check the sky and see if he could see what I was seeing, but he was already heading South on Lee&#39;s Summit Rd and it was too far North by then.  I checked my cell phone to see what time I called him and it was at 11:26PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the most part we spent about 5 and half minutes driving from Argo Road to Winsteads parking lot trying to figure out what the hell it was, then spending another minute and half or so trying to follow it.  It was moving so strangly like it was on one constant linear path of energy or something and it was moving so freely, I really can&#39;t explain it.  It looked like slow motion, but it moved away from us fairly quickly obviously because it was gone within about 15 seconds after we tried to follow it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got to Woods Chapel Rd heading West on South Outer Rd so we could head North to follow it but it was out of sight after we passed the Saturn dealership and that&#39;s when I called my buddy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else see this??????????  Has anyone seen anything similiar before in another experience?   I know for a fact I&#39;m not crazy and neither is my girlfriend and we are simply dumbfounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My whole perception just completely changed.  Either our government has some really cool things we don&#39;t know about or we have something going on up there that we either know about and don&#39;t want to tell the public or they simply don&#39;t know about it at all....and that bugs the hell out of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDA FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for responding to my report and please, call me ((name deleted) .   I will do what you say and call my local authorities and media agencies to see if I can locate some more witnesses.  We couldn&#39;t have been the only ones.  I can see where if someone glanced at it, they probably just thought it was an airplane after it shape-shifted and thought nothing of it, but someone else just had to see the start of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been a believer, but have never experienced anything like this and it has truly left me annoyed by not knowing what it was.  I am a very sincere and credible person with people who know me and this is one of those things that we haven&#39;t told no one else yet because they will probably think we are joking around with them.  They would think it&#39;s one of those &#34;true lies&#34;, where a story is so unbelievably true that it has to be a lie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We want to try and contact other people in Blue Springs first who saw it before we really go in depth talking about it.  I felt comfortable explaining everything to you of course since your website seems to be the prominent site that appears in search engines for reporting this kind of thing.  If you or anybody that contacts you about it want to call me, that&#39;s absolutely fine with me.  I will definitely keep you informed of my progress.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wanted to know when my post will be available for others to see or if I could get a copy of it so if I do find other people who saw something, I can use it as a point of reference.  I&#39;ll just send them to the link or give them a copy and I&#39;ll tell them it came directly from you and I&#39;ll have them contact you too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END #2))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks Peter.

In total there were 7 of us all standing outside yet only 6 could see the object as it blended in almost perfectly with the night sky.  This large group of people included my own brother and another man who would later join the Air Force of which he is currently enlisted.  We were in the back yard of the home smoking cigarettes when an individual frantically pointed to the sky asking something like, &#34;What is that?!&#34;  I remember the date because it was not only Cinco De Mayo but also 5/5/05.  Had there not been others to witness the event I likely would have never told anyone about it.  The object was flying extremely low.  It was traveling so slowly that If one of us had chased after it we would have been able to keep up.  It was around 10 feet long and maybe around 10-12 feet at its wing span.  It was a triangular object that gave off absolut! ly no sound or reflection of the lights below.  It almost completely blended into the night sky in a way that seemed like it was mimicking it.  It gave off no lights and had no lights on it that I remember seeing.  However this event did occur nearly 5 years ago.  The object travelled across the entire length of my yard and crossed over South Boulevard/ 20 mile Rd into Rochester Hills.  Because it was so difficult to see against the night sky everyone lost sight of it after it had only traveled a short distance.  Less than 100 yards.  The object flew directly above us and never changed speed.  When the object crossed South Boulevard I could see that it was flying only slightly higher than the telephone poles it was passing over.  It also released no vapors or any kind of trail that I could see behind the object.  Even though one of the people in the group was unable to see the object it is likely due to his poor vision or unwillingness to accept what was occurring around hi! m.  Other than shock there were no feelings I experienced duri! ng this incident.  I know what I saw and so do the others who witnessed this event.  There is no way this aircraft was earth technology.  It made no noise and seemed to cloak itself against the sky.  If the object was under intelligent control it would have easily been able to see us gawking at it.  It was literally flying so low as it was passing over us that I could have thrown a baseball at it and hit it.  This event deeply disturbed me for some time after.  It is only until recently that I discovered this website and thought it was necessary that I share my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At about 20:24 she said in an excited voice that &#39;she saw it and oh my God it is so big,&#39; etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told her it was too early for the ISS, but she insisted and said it was no satellite or meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said the oject was rectangular and had some appearance of depth leading her to believe it had the shape of a rectangular box.  It was bright yellow with no other lights.  She said it appeared to be on a course from N to S as if some intelligence were guiding it. It was not drifting aimlessly or shooting like a meteor. She said she did not notice any physical effects in her body, but I heard an uncharacteristic agitation in her voice.  The object came from the N at about 30 degrees when she first noticed it.  Mom held a 3&#34; by 5&#34; box in her hand and said that is how large it appeared in the sky with the luminescence as bright as the moon.  The highest elevation observed was approximately 75 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She noted that there was a small plane in the sky and also a jet that seemed to be going in the same direction as the rectangular craft.  She kept saying &#34;that jet must see it.&#39; When the craft disappeared from sight in the N facing window,she went to the southerly kitchen window to see it again and it vanished. She is sure it did not go behind a cloud.  She checked other directions, but it was gone.  Had the object retained the same speed, she should have picked in up again at another window. It was a clear night, so it either sped up or just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By then, I was out on my deck in Gloucester and could not see it.  If it had been there, I should have seen it.  Rockport is the next town over from Gloucester. (The Heavens- Above! website usually gives observation times either exact or within 1 second for the 2 places)  I am submitting this report for my mother who is 76 years young in possession of all of her faculties.  (Probably in possession of more faculties than someone half her age)  She is a retired clerk/secretary with an eye for details.  My mother is the daughter of a fishing captain, and has been looking up into the heavens and toward the sea all of her life.  She knows a meteor from a satellite from a star.

White and Red Pulsing.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96582.html|261|ndxe200505| Dozens of free Flying Stars over Spokane on sunny afternoon, taking triangular formations.  White and Red Pulsing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was waiting outside my girlfriends house off of sprague when I looked in the sky and saw dozens of flying objects that looked like stars in the blue clear skys around the afternoon sun.   After ten minutes or so they began to move around slowly at first, and I noticed that some of them were red and blinking while the others looked white and sparkly.   They would take triangular formations and the red stars would take a position in the middle of the triangles.   They would move back and forth, and fly toward the horizon, and accelerate at extremely high speed until disappearing.  Then they would be replaced by others that would return, while often the red pulsing ones would stay still or move slowly.  My girlfriend came outside and I pointed out the stars asking &amp;quot;why are there stars over spokane in the middle of the day?&amp;quot;  She got binoculars, and when we observed them the white sparkly stars were only what looked three red, blue, and green lights, ! together looking white with the naked eye.  They almost looked like the pixel of an old T.V. closeup.  The red ones were just red, and clear blue sky in between pulses as if nothing was there.  Eventually, they all either shot over the horizon with seemingly parabolic acceleration, or strangly flew into the sun until unobservable.  It almost seemed like it new I saw them, since they were not hardly visible or moving at all at first, and as soon as I had binoculars they all slowly dispersed.  Whatever they were, they were definitely coordinating they&#39;re movements and seemed to like the triangle formation, although it was not a constant theme as they silently moved where ever they liked.  Also, the red blinking ones seemed to be more stationary as the white ones formed triangles around them.  I reported to the police and the airport, both said call the airforce or one of the others.<n>

We could see the people as they were hiking up that trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A light orb hovered up the mountain in a fashion unlike the people.  It went to a ledge and hovered for around 10-15 seconds.

This ball was weaving in and out of one of the &#34;contrals&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this for about 30 minutes, it then flashed brightly once and in the blink of an eye, it zipped away towards the south at a great rate of speed.<n>

I was parked in a shopping center waiting for my girlfriend to finish cashing her paycheck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s when I saw a woman standing on the sidewalk in front of the store pointing up. I jumped out of my truck to see what she was pointing at. I saw an object that was rectangle in shape and was only around 50 feet above the light polls in the parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was around 2 feet wide 4 feet long and razor thin. It had a transparent texture with holes. In other words it looked like a rectangle frame covered in wax paper and the wax paper had all holes evenly spaced in it and only the outer rim of the hole would stand out. The centers of the holes were also transparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object stayed in one spot rotating very slowly. As it rotated the sun would shine off its edges. This is what would keep you from loosing sight of it. The center did not reflect sunlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wondering why it wasn’t blowing around in the wind. The wind was around 10 miles and hour and gusty at times yet this object wasn’t affected by it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides myself looking at this object, there was the lady who got my attention to look at it along with other people around her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly after 5 minutes of watching this, it suddenly went straight up quite fast. If it wasn’t for the sun reflecting off its edges I would have lost it sooner.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Early morning I was working out. Laying on the deck doing situps...skys were clear, sunny. FedEx planes and other aircraft were out. Very busty morning. However, out of the blue...an object that looked like a cylinder or a tube...very metallic flew by...no sound. It was low...maybe 1000ft? First thing I thought was...wow where is the wings? I dismissed it until another tube went by....exact flight path as the other. Same description. It didn&#39;t hit me until after I seen them that I started wondering. Where were the wings? Where was the sound? Was it a missile? Seemed odd it was flying in such busy skys...but then again...it made perfect sense because the skys were so busy anyway with planes and such. Besides that who would report it? Its taken me 3 months just to report it because I had to come to termsn with what I seen. A metallic tube or cylinder object flying about 1000 ft maybe a bit more up in the air. How long or big? Dont know...didn&#39;t see it long enough. Very strange.

Occasionally, we would see small towns set off fireworks, along the way. I saw a flash of light, assumed it was a firework, and waited for the noise. There wasn&#39;t a noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I had realized that it wasn&#39;t a firework I saw whatever it was, flash again. This time it was much closer(Yes we were moving in a car but it moved too much of a distance in that time to be stationary). The next flash was directly beside our car. The flash occured about the same heighth as the top of a telephone pole(except the telephone poles were on the other side of the road). There still wasn&#39;t any sound. I looked behind the car antcipating the next flash which occured quite a distance from our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

About 5 times bigger and brighter than a star.  It was moving straight and it was not blinking.  You could see airplanes off in different directions.  It looked nothing like them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it seemed like it was straight in front of us it looked like it got brighter.  That might have just been an optical illusion though.  I live far out in the country away from city lights.

5/3/05 22:00|Japan||Triangle|2-3 seconds|Multiple sightings in very narrow, low-altitude air corridor|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44507.html|273|ndxe200505| MULTIPLE SIGHTINGS in VERY NARROW, LOW-ALTITUDE AIR CORRIDOR  This sighting is the most recent of several objects observed in the same, highly-confined area above a densely populated suburb of Tokyo from a period beginning in 1993 and currently on-going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a U.S. citizen living adjacent to the northern-most shore of Tokyo Bay.  The condominium where my family and I live has a spacious outdoor terrace providing a 180 degree view facing due west.  The object I saw would be best described as triangular, although slightly irregular in shape.  My first impression was it looked like a &#34;stubby boomerang.&#34;  The object was directly overhead at roughly 90 degrees from the observation surface.  It either emitted a dull white light, or was composed of a dull white material.  At arm&#39;s length the object would have measured 2 inches in width at its base, and about an inch and a half in length (thus the &#34;stubby&#34; description).  It moved from due south to due north and was visible for only 2 or 3 seconds.  There was absolutely no sound emitted from the object, and visual contact was lost after the object underwent a process that can be described as similar to television or video image dissolve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the same area, there have been numerous sightings of objects of varying descriptions.  I have seen several myself, my son reported seeing one and other individuals have either directly observed objects, or have recounted second-hand sightings.  Two years ago, a Japanese Air Self Defence Force helicopter was dispatched to the area described above and spent 30 minutes hovering at 60 to 80 feet.  I have no information about what a military helicopter would be doing making such a horribly loud racket and hovering so low over a residential area, but it seemed to be looking for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OTHER SIGHTINGS:  March 1993.  I was taking out the trash at approximately 21:30 and noticed in the corner of my eye something moving to my left at an altitude of 80 or 90 feet.  The object was almost completely transparent.  Heading due north, the object moved slowly and in complete silence.  From the angle I first saw the object, there were two hemispheres side by side facing downward (the rounded edges pointed downwards).  Above the hemispheres was a platform, like a table top viewed from the side.  There was a small building right next to me, and the view of the object was blocked as it continued moving in a direction directly behind the building.  I dropped the bags of trash and ran to the other side of the building and saw the same object again.  This time, the angle had changed.  The flying object was V-shaped with three hemispheres on each wing.  Again, it was almost transparent.  There were some people walking on the street who hadn&#39;t noticed the object.  The object was so silent and so nearly invisible, no one would have seen it unless they had happened to have directly spotted it.  Observation time: approximately 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> July 1997.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the same corridor, I saw an amoeba-like blob flying due south.  From our terrace, I had a front-and-center view of the setting sun (about 18:40).  The nearly transparent blob was heading in a direction that would take it directly in front of the sun.  I recalled my 1993 sighting and wondered what would happen when the object flew between my line of sight and the sun.  As the blob passed in front of the sun, I could see that the object looked about four times larger than the sun at the distance it was from me (300 feet or so).  Although the object did not block out the sunlight, the shape of the sun was slightly distored and slightly less light was emitted.  The object passed across the sun and continued in the same direction until it was out of sight.  Total viewing time: 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two nights later, July 1997.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to sit out on the terrace every night.  At sometime around 20:45, a gray-colored boomeranng-shaped object suddenly appeared from a due west direction and began flying directly towards me at an altitude of about 100 feet.  It was moving in a zig-zag configuration.  Although moving rapidly, it was clear that the object was changing shape with each curving maneuver it made.  Instead of having straight edges, the boomerang had wavy lines.  On both wings or blades of the boomerang shape there were darker gray-colored wavy lines extending from the front of the object to the tips of the wings.  Observation time 4-5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next night. July 1997, approximately 0:30.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out on the terrace hoping to see another object.  By this time, I had begun to theorize that the area of the sightings was a type of corridor for the objects.  I was outside patiently waiting and had been sitting for 5 or 6 hours and was about ready to go inside and go to bed.  Suddenly due west, a huge V-shaped object appeared at about 100 feet in altitude and at about 300 feet from my position.  It was very similar to the object I had witnessed in 1993; V-shape with hemispheres on the bottom surface of the wings.  There were some notable differences from the 1993 sighting.  First, instead of being almost completely transparent, it was dark gray in color.  It looked as though it was made of smoke or cloud, yet the giant V maintained a coherent shape as it glidely slowly due south.  Second, although the wings were parallel to the ground, the wing tips curved upwards and emitted either some type of particles or energy.  The edges of the wing-tips wavered in a manner resembling heat radiating off a hot paved road.  As I watched the object move slowly and silently in a steady due south direction, I couldn&#39;t help but wonder why the object had swept V-shaped wings.  At the speed it was traveling, they would have served no aerodynamic function.  Then a fortuitous event happened.  As the object progressed on its unchanging trajectory, it approached a 12-story condo building, and from my viewing angle, flew above the building which is about 350 feet away. At the mid-way point on the roof of the building, there is a rectangular structure that houses a water tank and air-conditioning equipment.  The V-shape object passed directly behind the utility structure and the left wing just barely cleared the structure.  Using these coordinates as a reference, I would estimate that the V-shaped object was 150 to 160 feet lengthwise, and about 80 feet wide from wing-tip to wing-tip.  At this point, I had been observing the object for at least 30 seconds.  I continued to watch it for another minute as it continued on its trajectory. Although the object had not yet disappeared from view completely, it had traveled far enough away that it appeared much smaller and far less visible.  It was still vaguely visible but I decided there was nothing more to observe, so I turned away and went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above sighting was the most spectacular of any of my observations, including those leading up to the time of this writing (June 2005).  These experiences have led me to search the Internet to research what other observations have been made in other locations.  There is one important distinction that can be made about my observations and those made by other people.  The Internet has numerous postings of triangular-, boomerang-, and V-shaped objects.  But in every instance, there have been discriptions of lights on the objects.  In every case I have personally witnessed, the objects did not have what might be interpreted as mounted lights.  The objects have consistently been monochromatic or transparent, and when illuminated types were observed, the entire object was bright, not with light sources on isolated surfaces such a wing-tips, nose or center.  Again, I emphasize that each sighting I have made has been while I was alone.  However, individuals, including my son claim to have witnessed objects in the same corridor.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I drew back the curtains to see what it was ,and saw a strange shape in the sky it looked like a misshaped peanut. I stared at it for about five minutes and it started getting closer then suddenly it seemed to stop and hover and then it just streched and dissapered. I saw the same one, or what looked like the same one around 3:00 A.M. This time it stayed for about fifteen minutes then once more it streched and dissapered. I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/2/05 21:45|Big Lake|TX|Light|1-1/2 hours|Bright white light in NW sky moved rapidly and erratically up, down, left, right and changed colors to blue ands blue green.|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48076.html|278|ndxe200505| Bright white light in NW sky moved rapidly and erratically up, down, left, right and changed colors to blue ands blue green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at what I thought might be a very bright planet in the northwest sky, located at approximately 45 deg. above the horizon. The light then began moving further northwest slowly at first and then very quickly left to right and then up and down very rapidly but in a very erratic fashion. It moved left to right in a wide 180 deg. movement across the horizon and then up and down in about a 45 degree movement above where it had been originally positioned and then back down again. The erratic fashion in which it moved can only be described as if a leaf were falling to the earth moving quickly back and forth as it falls. Another interesting thing is that it changed colors when it moved. While stationary it was a very bright white light, but when it moved it turned blue and then blue green in color. As soon as it stopped and became stationary, it turned white. I had never seen anything quite like this before and watched it for about an hour and a half before it slowly moved to the Northwest and disappeared over the horizon. I had hoped it would come closer to my position so that I might get a better look at what it was. I told my family about it and am still being teased about what I saw, but I know what I saw, I just don&#39;t know what it was. I had no camera to offer proof. I was in a very remote high plains desert location, with the nearest town(Spring Lake) being about 22 miles further north of my position. this occured at 9:45 p.m. and I observed it until about 11:20 p.m. Spring Lake, Texas is about 40 miles North of Ozona, Texas. It is a very remote and sparsely populated area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had set up camp out on an open field atop of a ridge where cows were grazing, a place which someone had named &#39;the boomer trail&#39; (the words were carved on a wooden fence post at the end of the field). The view from ridge - essentially you could see for miles down into the valley in front of you, and miles in the opposite direction, down into the valleys behind (probably north and south views). A small part of our side to side (east and west) views were obstructed by hilltops along the ridgeline we were on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not too long after sunset when all of us were sitting in a circle chatting and drinking tea. I was looking up at the stars. It was an amazingly clear night. Not one cloud in the sky. And since we were kind of isolated from any civilization, the stars were extremely prevalent. I believe there was also a full moon that night which was rising behind me, towards the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up and towards the northwest when, in almost the exact spot I was checking out, an amazingly bright light caught my attention. It was a white light and atleast as bright as moon, if not brighter. when I finally focused on the light, I saw that it was aimed somewhere behind me. A couple seconds went by when the light panned over top of us and down through the valley directly in front of me. It was then that I realized the light was in the shape of a perfect cone. It&#39;s hard to say how far across the light at the bottom of the cone was, but i would guess no more than 1/4 of a mile (pretty narrow).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the spotlight had shut off it had already moved maybe two miles away from us. This whole process had lasted about 5 seconds. Although it appeared that the light had been shut off, there was still 2-3 seconds where you could see light coming from the source, kind of like the was fading out. However, I dont think the light was dimming. Rather I believe the beam had come from so far away that it just took a while for the light to finally dissipitate. When the white light had finally burnt completely out, it became obvious that the source was in outer space. What this light finally amounted too after this event was a near miniscule, dim, red dot that was slowly tracking across the sky. One probably would not have noticed it if the had not seen the powerful white beam that shot from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would appear that it was a type of satellite, but I have never heard of any satellites that shoot perfect cones of light that touch the ground... About 5 minutes had past before the tiny red dot had tracked to the east and was no longer in our view....We all saw the red dot tracking, but only one other witness had seen nearly the entire length of the white-light incident. And, atleast one other person in the group, besides he, caught the tail end of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All in all it was an amazing site to see and I have yet to tell the story to anyone that has any idea of what could have created such a powerful light. We were near a military base, so it may not be so suprising that something weird like that took place... The following day we were hiking across an open ridge and saw two planes doing manuevers coming toward us down in the valley below. One of the planes flew right over my head and it was so low I swear I could just about see the features of pilots face in the cockpit....Anyway, I would much like to learn what that light was and what purpose it has.......<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He had been sitting out in his yard and saw a very fast white light move from East to South.  By the time we got outside, we only saw 2 flashing red ligths.  They were moving back and forth, up and down, (really all over the sky).  We watch the red lights for about one minute until they were out of sight.  We saw a plane fly toward them, but I don&#39;t know if the plane was chasing the red lights.  There is a Air National Guard in the city so it could have been a miltary plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work with computers and my husband and friend are both college professors.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was bright sunny, and cloudy. We stopped to turn into the gas station and while we were stopped we both witnessed what we believe to be a UFO. It floated and moved back and forth in an upward movement. By the time we had pulled in it had dissapered and we lost track of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom is one of the biggest sceptics out there, so this was really an interesting ordeal for the both of us. There is no way it was a plane, or an animal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was on the smaller size, but very shiney, and obviously made out of metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I did not turn on the light in the room I was in, so I could see out quite clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first when I saw a red flash I thought it was an intruder throwing away a ligthed cigarette butt. But then I was amazed to see the &#39;cigarette light&#39; and 2 other bright red lights moving between my neighbours side of the garden fence and mine. The movement was similar to that of a butterfly - a fluttery dance movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the lights then moved off at a very rapid speed to the end of my garden passing up over bushes and trees and up over the roof top of the house opposite (approx 120 yards in distance). The other two lights then followed after a few seconds.  The lights were a very deep red colour and approx. 2 - 3 inches in circumference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have eliminated the possibility of it being someone using laser lights because of the angle of the movements. I have tried to find out if perhaps they were luminous insects - the firefly was one possibility but we don&#39;t, as far as I know, get them in this part of the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So who knows what they were?<n>

It pops up every now and then on certain nights. I would gladly like to dismiss this as a radar helicopter, but it is just too bright and the rapid movements it makes just does not add up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We haven&#39;t video taped this object yet, but we are counting on it.

We made camp at Camp Crooked Creek, located near Ft. Knox. When the rest of the troop went to bed, I stayed up and made a fire, along with a fellow Scout. At around midnight when the fire had died down to embers is when we saw the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember everything around me flashed in a blue light, exactly the same flash a camera would make (the same amount of time too). Both of us exclaimed &#34;whoa,&#34; because it was not only shocking but appeared to come from above us. We both instinctively looked up. About 250-300 yards above me, I made out three dim lights ( in a triangular position). I could barely make out the dark outline of an aircraft, it appeared to be in the shape of a triangle as well. If it didn&#39;t have lights on the bottom, i don&#39;t think I would have been able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not moving, it just hovered above us. About 5 seconds went by, and then it shot across the sky towards the horizon. It looked just like a shooting star, with the trailing light following behind it. I remember expecting to hear a huge roar of an engine, but it made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My immediate reaction was that it had to have been a fighter jet, because we were so close to Ft. Knox. But, I quickly ruled that out, because, what explains the flash?  The flash was targeted right at us. The whole place didn&#39;t flash, just the small area around myself and my friend. Also, what plane can hover like that? A Harrier Jet can hover, but this object was only 250-300 yards directly above us and made no noise. Also, there is no plane that can move that fast. It had gone past the horizon in a fraction of a second without making any noise. That&#39;s what convinced me that this was no plane, missile, or anything man made. We woke a few of the older Scouts and told them what happened, but no one took us seriously, as has been the case whenever I bring up the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw, and the fact that someone else was with me, and was able to recount exactly the same thing I saw, makes me truly believe that we encountered a UFO. Why didn&#39;t I go to the media if I was so sure? Because I knew there was no way of proving it, and this culture seems to dismiss anyone who believes in UFO&#39;s. But, I needed to get this off my chest. If you need any more details or have questions please fill free to contact me. Thank you.<n>

We drove to north of the airport in my city, where there is a Polish Hall. We parked in the parking lot, put some music on, nothing out of the ordinary was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The parking lot is to the east of the building, and it stretches about 4 or 5 rows north with more spaces. North of that is a soccer field, than a small field, just less than the size of the soccer field, and groups of trees where the forest begins to start, I would say two soccer field lengths away from where we were parked. It was around 10:40, or 10:45 PM when I glanced up into the sky above the trees in the distance, to the north east and I saw this glowing small orange light. I though it was a plane at first but it struck me as odd, because it was moving very very slowly. The object appeared to be moving southwest towards the town of Whitby, or Brooklin, which is the north part of the city, but remained at a very low height. As it came more towards the west and directly in front of our view, the shape began to change but because it was closer, not because it was morphing or anything. It became an oval or disc shaped glowing orange. It looked like it was a giant glowing neon orange object at this point. Definetly was not a plane as I have been living beside this airport for a few decades, and all that usually flies out of there are the small DC planes. We have a police copter, but it already flew by about 30 minutes before this happened, and I can tell you this thing didn&#39;t make a sound in the sky at all. It was a clear night, no sound. As it came closer towards whitby, more southwest, the orange seemed like it was the back of the object, as if it was some sort of afterburner like on a jet, but extremely large. You could somewhat see a shadow of the body, in the sky, but again it was nighttime, and very dark so it wa hard to make out the shape. It seemed like a giant egg or oval. Right before it left our viewpoint, at the closest point to us, clearly the orange was the back of the craft. It seemed that it had two giant afterburners of some sort on the back, you could see the outline of the body in the dark and these small flashing lights began to appear, on the top, bottom, the middle around the sides, and at the front. I distinctly remember them being a blue, orange, off white, red, and green. Then it was gone without a sound. The next day at my old job, I overheard a woman i worked with talking about the same thing. I knew what I saw really was an event that cannot be explained. I even called the airport about planes in the area and they are supposed to have a curfew for planes flying at 11PM so there should not have been anything in the sky. I drew a picture in the paint program I will email to you. I have seen strange orange lights over lake ontario in whitby before, but this was much closer and it was a longer duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

While I lied there, just clearing my mind, and looking at the stars and planes in the night sky, I noticed  light /sphere  approx. 30-60 miles away in the dist, high in the north sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It danced, almost doing loop d’ loops up and down in an erratic pattern. It seemed that it was above Lancaster , but cant say for sure.  Not beleving what I was seeing, I put my right thumb up next to it and a star  nearby and held it still to see if possibly my eyes or head were moving , but sure enough, I was able to assure myself I was not hallucinating. After a couple of minutes of watching this thing, and assuming it was some experimental craft or missile from Skunkworks, I lost interest for a few moments. When looking back to see study the object more I noticed it bob and weave, then rapidly move out of sight in a north bound direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the longest time I thought it was some experimental guided missile. But why  would the Gov. test the object near a populated area. I&#39;ve seen the YF22’s hovering about the palmdale airport area before and the donut shaped contrails in the nineties, but only seem something similar on future weapons.  This thing was to crazy to test around here. that’s all my gut feeling tells me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It seemed like it didn&#39;t disturb the air around it no sound  at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First thing I thought thatit was a refection off the craft from the sun, but it had the sun behind it with no ability to reflect my direction.

I asked ((name deleted)) if he could see the plane as I did not readily observe it, as there were scatterd clouds in the sky. These clouds were not rain clouds as they were cirrus clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then suddenly appeared out from behind the high cloud cover and I realized that there was absolutley no contrail being emitted from the craft.  The sound immediately indicated to me that the craft was extremely solid and well built as I looked and realized that this craft had to be in excess of well over 1500 or 2000 feet in length.  It was well above the cirrus clouds which I estimate to have been at 40 to 50 thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This had a very long needle like appearance and was at about what I estimate to be 60 or 70 thousand feet.  It was very light bright white in color, no lights, and no apparent wings or tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In refernce to the direction of Route 340 which generally travels North to South, the craft was traveling due East.  My estimation of the speed at which the craft was traveling, can be arrived at by how long the time transpired from when I first heard the craft to the time when I located it and then perceiving its rate of speed as it traveled East towards Washington, D.C.  I can faithfully say that the craft was traveling in excess of 1500 miles per hour.<n>

Again, maybe the military has such a tiny jet, dunno.  found it odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she sounded sincere and credible.

It was totally silent, no lights of any kind and I was close enough to confirm that it was nothing familiar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew so smooth, like glass. I watched it from a parking lot and attempted to get pictures on my cell phone, but the resolution was too poor. It started to get smaller (moving away) so I drove after it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled into another parking lot about 1/4 mile away and  watched it until it got real small (and I was going to be late to work). It was heading to the Southeast I belive and must have been going pretty fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weirdest thing is that the object had at least two bent poles or &#34;arms&#34; coming off the sides like the probes on a space shuttle. As the object got farther away it appeared more round like a dark ball. I am positive of what I saw.<n>

HUGE!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hey PETER,  I saw my first TRIANGULAR UFO last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was delivering newspapers, and at 3:38 am, nature called...... so i looked up at the sky while on &#34;break&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the night was vey cloudy in patches over rochester MICH. In a clear section of the sky aprx 60-75 degrees i spotted some stars. I didnt know what constellation i was looking at, but after 10 seconds 1 of the stars started moving.  I thought wow that PLANE is waaaay up there.  but then another star followed the first. then i said what in the heck is that?  Then a third &#34;Star&#34; followed the second star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter, I realized I was staring at a triangular craft, at first on its side, then it slowly turned, and i saw the &#34;triangular&#34; formation.  Now i am pretty sure it was one craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights on the craft was as bright as a small star, You had to STARE at it to even see it. there were 3 lights, one on each angle of the craft.  there was no middle light that i could see.  The craft had no color.  It look like it was tranparent, or the color of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it wasn&#39;t one craft then it was 3 lights in a Triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it slowly glide for about 20 seconds before i lost it in the heavy cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The LIGHTs NEVER BLINKed, NOR FLASHED.  like i said THEY looked like 3 stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was it sure used the night sky as CAMOFLOGUE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope you can use this.  I am i huge Art bell fan and a big fan of yours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw a huge orange pulsating orb, back in 96 or 97 in oxford michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> thanks a lot, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed a &#34;triplet&#34; of U.

5/1/05 03:00|Wayland|MA|Light|1 or 2 minutes|Light or energy flying object no lareger than 10-12 inches entered bedroom on more than one occassion|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72055.html|297|ndxe200505| Light or energy flying object no lareger than 10-12 inches entered bedroom on more than one occassion<n> <n><n> <n><n> This actually occured on more than one occassion: I was sleeping and a flickering light form entered my room consisting of flickering lights in yellow red and green but all one color at one time( all green or all yellow or all red) . It was sort of rectangular craft shaped but not a disc. It was only 10 inches or so across. I was not afraid and simply watched it in a strange state of numbness. It moved from the window swinging around the end of the bed and then settling into position slightly above me on my right. I was completely aware of being remotely &#34;observed&#34; but did not feel afraid....it was like a floationg camera without supstance that I could see..just light/energy After it flew out again I simply lay down and went back to sleep. When it happened again a few days later I did not even really sit up...I saw it enter and just lay still... I was being observed..but I felt that perhaps it could read more information about me than just visual but that is only my impression or feeling at the time. I had no sence of impending danger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to know if such things have ever been reported before.  I have since moved away from that house and have had other unusual experiences but not the same and I have not &#34;met&#34; anyone who is other worldly that I can recall. I hope it stays that way.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/1/05 01:00|Portland|OR|Oval|3-7 minutes|Three amber/orange objects patrol Portland skyline|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43983.html|298|ndxe200505| Three amber/orange objects patrol Portland skyline<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends and I were on our balcony overlooking downtown portland when one of our friends noticed three bright orange lights flying over the skyline. It was a very clear night and we could clearly see that the objects were flying in a line formation, flying South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was an airplane flying in this area at this time as well, and we could see using this as a reference point that the other three objects were much larger than the airplane. They were flying at a patrol-like speed and relatively low. Our balcony faces north with the skyline to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the objects flew behind our building where we couldn&#39;t see them anymore, we ran downstairs to see them. I got there in time to them disappear as they flew farther and farther out into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends who had gotten downstairs first, said that the three objects formed a triangle before flying farther out until they disappeared. I noticed as they were disappearing that one of the objects was larger than the other two. The objects appeared to be oval shaped, but because the lights were so bright it is hard to be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever they were, they were in clear sight and flying low, they didn&#39;t seem to mind if they were seen.<n>
5/1/05 01:00|Portland|OR|Disk|5 minutes|Orange disk-like orbs over Downtown Portland.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD))|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43776.html|299|ndxe200505| Orange disk-like orbs over Downtown Portland<n> <n><n> <n><n> approx 1:00 AM Relaxing on balcony (approx 60 feet up) with 4 friends; first &#34;vessel&#34; seen moving South parallel to the river over downtown Portland. From our vantage point seemed to be moving over the Wells Fargo tower, altitude unknown, but relatively low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was very bright and there was a visible halo. The &#34;vessel&#34; appeared to be orb-like due to the extremely bright orange fire-colored halo, but on further observation with my trusty discovery channel telescope, there was a definite disk-like shape. The lights seemed to be at the bottom of the ship, the top of the ship was very hard to make out but was definatley a very large metal structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A second ship of same description came into view moving at the same slow, lurking speed, almost as if they were patrolling or searching for something, a third ship comes into view a few moments later.  All three ships pass the northeast corner of the building and are no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We run down the stairs to watch them move across the rest of the sky. They have stopped moving across the city. They are in a clear triangular formation like a 90 degree triangle and are moving vertically up and out of the atmosphere until they can no longer be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very Strange and awesome but spine tingling and scary as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  We are uncertain whether the report is meant to be a serious report.  We received no other reports of this incident, which seems strange to us, although there were reports submitted from other locations on the west coast for the same time period, about which the witness was not aware, since they were not posted at the time we received this report.

5/1/05 00:45|Portland|OR|Light|5+ minutes|Three reddish lights seen over Pearl District of Portland, OR|6/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44363.html|301|ndxe200505| Three reddish lights seen over Pearl District of Portland, OR<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness reported sighting to MUFON (per Oregon State Director for MUFON).  Witness states he was in the Pearl District of Portland and on his way home from work, when he saw a well-dressed man walking his dog in a park. The man was looking up at the sky with an &#34;expression of wonder and concern&#34;, and he turned to the reporting witness and said, &#34;There&#39;s three strange lights up in the sky&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reporting witness continues: &#34;. . . and when I stopped and looked sure enough right where he pointed there they were. Three dim but definite reddish lights, two were right above each other, the third above the two and off to the upper right.  They resembled stars in their size and over the course of several minutes the upper two would fade and dim out, then reappear at intervals, independent of each other.  Finally they faded for good with the upper right one moving off to the west in the process, the other one just did a stationary fade leaving the bottom light which then faded in and out as well then vanished. They seemed to be a high altitude but as I had no way of establishing scale it&#39;s impossible to tell. The gentleman expresses his gratitude at my stopping and telling him what I was seeing as it mirrored his own perceptions and relieved him as he was concerned that he was &#39;seeing things&#39;. He also told me that he had been watching them for about 5 minutes before I appeared and they had seemed both lower and brighter.&#34;<n>
5/1/05 00:30|Downey|CA|Formation|10-15 min|4 orange-reddish objects lights in the sky traveling in non-static formation @ equal speeds and change in appearance|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43743.html|302|ndxe200505| 4 orange-reddish objects lights in the sky traveling in non-static formation @ equal speeds and change in appearance<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first observed 2 objects that I assumed to be 2 aircraft flying in close proximity (there are always aircraft nearby at all times due to LAX flight paths being nearby) but then I immediately realized that the light&#39;s color was wrong since it was an orange/orange-red color (not white, red or green as aircraft use) and they were traveling at what I observed to be exact courses and speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realized that it was not just 2 but four objects traveling in a formation with one in front , the 2 in the middle (still traveling together in parallel and the last object about the same distance from the middle two as the first was and all four traveling at an apparently equal speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four objects were of the same color light as the first 2 I had noticed and I also realized that the seemed to flicker a little, almost as ember that will sometimes escape from a wood fire will tend to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized that this was something very unusual so I went inside my home to get my brother and let him see these same objects to see if maybe I was jumping to conclusions to quickly.  He also couldn&#39;t figure out what these objects were but we were quite sure it was not a normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total amount of time from when I first noticed these objects to when I told my brother and he stepped outside was no more than 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About half-way through the total course of what I could observe of these 4 objects, the 2 middle objects started altering their formation from parallel travel to an in-line formation, which put all 4 objects into one single line but all four still traveling at the same speed.  As soon as the 2 middle objects finished getting in the same line the first object in the front of the formation started to drop or lose something that to me appeared almost like little embers from the bottom of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about the same time the objects light intensity started diminishing rapidly and also the object started to increase its observed speed.  At about the same point at which the first object started to change it&#39;s appearance, the 2nd one started to alter in the same manner and as the 3rd and 4th objects reached the same point the same exact changes occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When these objects would reach their dimmest but still visible appearance is when objects appeared to reach the highest observable speed before dissapearing completely from my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four objects went through the same process in the same manner from the same points in the sky but only as they reached what was the initial point of the first object in the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather coditions were almost clear skys with only some small amounts of hazy patches of clouds at different points of the sky around my area.  There was no visible moon nearby that I could observe.<n>
