I looked out my window and saw an orange fireball gliding over the house.  I went into the kitchen and told my sister to come to the window and watch what I thought was a meteor falling into the back yard.  I pulled open the kitchen curtains and saw a black diamond with green lights on the points settle onto the back porch roof-- but the green lights didn&#39;t light up any of the diamond. (It was small, only about ten feet across and about eight feet high.)  A low hum was shaking the house and rattling the back window.  The thing sat on the roof for a few minutes,and I wanted to go outside but I heard someone in my head saying, &#34;Don&#39;t go outside, you&#39;ll get hurt.&#34;  Finally the thing slid horizontally off the porch and hovered in the back yard.  The green lights went off and it was just a black diamond, but it was blacker than the sky. It took off and seemed to be flying fast and slow at the same time.  After it had gone over the hill, four jets from the military base chased it, but couldn&#39;t catch it.  I don&#39;t remember going back to bed, but a few hours later I woke up, tucked into bed, wearing slippers that I hadn&#39;t been wearing earlier, and my hands were crossed over my chest.  It took 5 years for me to remember this event, but I had false memories of having told people about it.  When my parents came home that night, they found my sister in front of the TV, shaking.  They thought she&#39;d just seen a scary movie.  She doesn&#39;t remember seeing anything that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The objects were amber to orange glowing spheres. We had seen several (2) earlier the same evening on the way out to the island on US 80, that were positioned over an area proximate to the Savannah River somewhere near Ft. Pulaski National Monument. These moved slowly east to west at slightly different altitudes and then descended below tree level. Their desent was very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We eventually ended up at old Fort Screven on Tybee, on the wall facing the Atlantic. Out over the water was another one of these glowing objects that just seemed to hang in the air. From out vantage point, we double checked our bearings by identifying various landmarks both north and south of us along the shore. The glowing object seemed to wobble once or twice and may have made some slight movement but we couldn&#39;t be sure. After about 30 minutes or so, the object, right before our eyes, just winked out. It was gone, poof. None of the objects emitted any noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were familiar with the appearances and characteristics of helicopters coming and going from the Coast Guard station on the island and the objects we witnessed could in no way be mistaken for helicopters or planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in &#34;late December 1980&#34; is approximate.  Please note that this is about the same time that the celebrated &#34;Cash-Landrum&#34; Incident occurred near Dayton, TX, a case in which three people were seriously burned by an unidentified object that may have been a UFO.

This plane/ufo never made a sound. it was flying north to south.while we were frozen it was like, the aircraft reliazed we were watching it. it stopped in mid-flight ,paused,&amp; then shot strait up, then strait down,then went left,then right. the aircraft did this four times in about 2 or 3 seconds. the distances it covered during the up down side to side would have to be around a half mile in all 4 directions.Then the air craft shot across the night sky. the aircraft went from right in fron of us,to  out of sight into the stars in about a half second.we ran back to our house,told our parents.Who did not believe us... odd thing after that night my brother &amp; i never talked about what happened that night.As for how long we were frozen in place ? I DO NOT KNOW we did not move or talk until it was gone.  Some poeple say i was obducted.IS THIS POSSIBLE ? I do not have a clue,I was frozen &amp; could not move. Since then my brother has passed on,ca not talk to him about it.One thing is sure ,our military has no air craft that can fly the way this aircraft did,or shoot off into space as fast as this thing did!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

12/27/80 01:00|RAF Bentwaters (UK/England)||Rectangle|2 hours|Additional information (eyewitness account) of the Bentwaters Incident|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32312.html|5|ndxe198012| Additional information (eyewitness account) of the Bentwaters Incident<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the on-site ((deleted--senior technical position)) in RAF Woodbridge, UK, for a ((deleted)) year period from June 19XX to October 19XX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This reports relates to the &#34;Bentwaters Incident.&#34; I need to provide some background for you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 years ago, I was watching the History channel, and I saw a man being interviewed....and I recognized him as an Airman I knew back in the late &#39;70&#39;s. He was (is) ((name deleted)). This was the first I had heard of the UFO sighting just east of the base, in the late fall of 1980.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never told anyone of this story before, and I believe that I can shed some additional light on the situation....from the perspective of a weatherman, and one who has certain knowledge and experience in observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To start. I do not know how familiar you are with this Bentwater Incident. Kind of pisses me off, it should be called the Woodbridge incident, as it occurred just east of RAF Woodbridge, not Bentwaters. Bear with me here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The base is oriented generally east to west...in fact, the runway orientation is exactly 09-27. This makes it very easy to observe the weather, and the direction from the center of the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a several month period, all during the summer and fall of 1980, I and the ((deleted--technical personnel)) under my command observed lights to the east of the base, in Her Majesties Rendlesham forest. This is a rather large stand of trees BETWEEN RAF Woodbridge and Bentwaters, indeed, the east gate led to a small road which was a quick way to get to and from the base, from one base to the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My ((deleted--family member)) was also in the ((deleted--military)) at the time, and she was assigned to the Bentwaters base weather station. Normally, we worked the same shift, and I would drop ((deleted--family member)) off at work, go on to my work, and reverse the process and the end of my shift. Woodbridge was south of Bentwaters, we lived north of Bentwaters, in a little town of Leiston...along the north sea. I digress.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I am about to write is something that I have been thinking a lot about. I am not about publicity, and will not leave my name. I will leave an e-mail address that you can contact me with, if you want.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the way from my work, to pick up my ((family member)), I went out the east gate, turned left, and headed on up to Bentwaters. I had gone about 200 yards, and was pretty deep in the woods. It was foggy, the visibility was less than a mile. This was pretty common in fall, there is a climatological maxima for fog along the north sea that time of year. I was driving my little ((deleted--foreign car)), doing about 40. There was no radio in the car, just tooling along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Up and off to my right, in the woods, about 50 feet into the woods I saw a bright, pulsating light. The frequency of pulsing was quick, and was an orangish-reddish color. This freaked me out pretty good, I didn&#39;t know what it was. The hair on the back of my neck went straight out, unexpectedly so...I became VERY frightened, and gunned the car, and left. Thinking back, I did not see a craft...but I remain convinced, to this day, that this was (is) something I can&#39;t explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked to my wife about this, and gradually forgot about it...until this entire incident came back into my attention several years ago. About a year ago, the Halt tapes became more public, and this kinda freaked me out, too! I KNEW Lt. Col. Halt, and spoke with him many, many times in my capacity of providing ((deleted--information)), and the various on-base agencies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have read several reports of this Incident, many contain innaccuracies, misjudgements, and many are just plain wrong. The people I worked with and I speculated for months as to the source of the lights to the east of the airfield. We considered, and rejected, the idea that it was the lights from the Orfordness lighthouse. We KNEW that one, bearing 140 degrees, at 7 miles. Little light, pause, big light, pause, little light, pause, rinse repeat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light we saw was IMMEDIATELY off the base proper, within a half mile of where my unit was assigned. As is the practice of many ((deleted--units)), we were assigned on the ((deleted))  floor of the ((deleted--on the base)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our job was to maintain a continuous ((deleted)) watch...we had no other duties other than to monitor the ((deleted)), and as such, we were outside a LOT...hours per day (and night) just looking around, and monitoring our ((deleted))  instruments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something that isn&#39;t talked about much....when the Colonel and his staff measured radiation, they knew what they were doing. The base still had an active WSA (weapon storage area) for nuclear weapons on the base. We even had an armored personnel carrier, painted Air Force blue on the base....pretty cool, actually. This is why a Lieutenant Colonel and other security forces were in the woods outside a small tactical fighter base after midnight in December....the Air Force doesn&#39;t fool around with their nukes. Ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listened to George Khoury (sp?)  (sic--Noory) tonight, and heard this website, and thought....why not?  If anything, I have understated what I saw, but at this point, I am not prepared to say much more....I have a good job, I am now retired from the Air Force, and I think it is pretty safe here to put down a little of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for taking the time to read this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will list a little used email address, if you have any questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The dates of the incident, a suspected landing of a triangular-shaped UFO in Rendlesham Forest, are December 26 and 27.

12/23/80 00:00|Cairns (QLD, Australia)||Disk|10mins|I remember it was close to Christmas and I had preyed to God for months and months every night to please do something about my abusive|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14638.html|7|ndxe198012| I remember it was close to Christmas and I had preyed to God for months and months every night to please do something about my abusive father as he had threatened to kill my mother and if it wasn&#39;t for my quick thinking she would be dead. Anyway, I was 8 years old and angry at God for giving me such a father. I went to bed praying and wishing for a better father and a barbie bus and barbies for Christmas. I was awoken by a very dull humming noise, although when I awoke I could not hear it at all. I sat bolt upright and there right outside my window was a huge disc shaped object hovering very low. The middle bit where all the windows were seemed to revolve around and I could see people walking around inside. My first reaction was one of immediate fear and then an overwhelming sense of love and security surrounded me and moments later I found myself at the back door trying to find the key to get out and into the backyard to go with them. I actually had the key in the door and the door open when a voice inside my head told me to stop for the sake of my mother. You see she slept in my room as my father used to rape her if she slept in the same bed and I was worried if I was gone in the morning she would get the blame and the beating for it. I closed the door and locked it and raced back to my room to find the craft still in the same position and when I looked out the window at it I could hear them communicating with me in their mind saying don&#39;t be frightened we won&#39;t hurt you. Come with us. To this I told them that I was afraid for my mother and I said I wanted to get married and have children first and they said that they would come back for me one day. The disc shaped object lifted slightly and noislessly before moving towards the mountains where it seemed to move rapidly and dart sideways. I tried to wake mum to tell her but I couldn&#39;t wake her,which is unusual as she is a super light sleeper. I told my sister 15 years later and a few people but no-one really believed me except my sister, and my husband. There were red lights on the underside of the craft and the craft itself was a metallic white in colour.<n>

We were heading home to our hotel while on a Christmas vacation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was well ahead of us and although we screamed to the top of our lungs and jumped up and down to get his attention, did not believe us and never turned around to see it.  The “saucer” was very bright white, had many windows all the way around it, was very silent and  came from behind the building, hovered over us and the building and then proceeded to go very quickly back up and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were more excited than frightened, but it was also rather alarming because we had never seen a flying object move like that in terms of silence and speed.  It was very bright and made of a solid material.   The windows did have light in them, but we did not see any objects or living creatures inside the windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

There was no noise. It was heading north &amp; was probably heading towards the Clinton Nuclear Power Station, that had just been built. It was flying very low, just over the cars (which were many). It could NOT have been a helicopter or other conventional aircraft for several reasons. ONe fact was that the snowstorm was raging. The wind was blowing very, very hard, &amp; each flake of snow would hit out windshield about the size of a 1/2 a dollar. No conventional aircraft could have been flying in that weather. Two, it had no wings or helecopter blades because they would have hit the trees that overhung the 4 lane street. It was using a very large, very bright searchlight. It had to be some kind of Carbon-arc light because of the brightness of the spot it prodiced on the pavement. It seemed to be using the light to nevigate. It was moving about 5 MPH at an altitude of approximately 15 feet above the pavement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting at a red light. When the light changed to green, I continued driving (south) again &amp; it flew right over out heads.  &amp; because I was in the center lane, I was unable to turn around right away to follow it. I finally was able to maneuver to the left lane &amp; turn around 2 blocks later. By then it was gone. Illinois Power had just finished building a Nuclear Power station in Clinton. I figured that was where it was going, but there was no evidence to substantiate that. Because of the raging snowstorm, I gave up the chase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dates are approximate. I was working at ((deleted)) TV as a ((employee)) at the time. For fear of retaliation, I was reluctant to come forward openly, but I did share this with many of out friends. My wife (fience at the time) was with me at the time &amp; was as suprised as I was at this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, but could be corroborated from weather reports at that time.

After a mile or so I came to the top of a hill and stop and got out of my car.  The object just hung in the sky.  It made a sound which I could not I.D.  It was not a helicopter or plane.  I watched it for a few minutes with nothing happening.  I than began to drive a few minutes late the object flew to the south of my position and met up with 2 other objects in the sky.  The other 2 objects came from southeast and southwest  They hung in the sky for just a few seconds, then they flew straight up and away.  A few day after my sighting a large Army plane was flying over the area pulling a drone shaped from it&#39;s bottom.  It made several passes over the entire area of the Blue Hills.  We were told it was looking for minerals in the soil.  During the early 80&#39;s and late 70&#39;s the military install an ELF (Extermily Low Freq) site in north eastern Wisconsin.

We turned west onto the small street on the south side of the McDonald’s. I recall, very vividly, the object was  a matte black disc with small orange ‘flames’ around its edge, coming from the west, from say Lakewood or Long Beach (one would expect to see the Lakewood Sheriff station’s helicopter on a similar path) with silence. It was around late dusk and I recall remembering the event later and the fact that we seemed to have returned to my friend’s home minus any McDonald&#39;s food, no need to discuss the object, and hearing about John Lennon’s murder that evening , which helped me date the event. I make no abduction claims at all, just the sighting, but feel a distinct loss of time from the moment the object was passing over and being back in the TV den at my friend’s house. The street and parking lot, hence the restaurant, was busy when the sighting occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Saw this thing back around 1980 and thought I was crazy.Lived halfway between Arkansas City and Winfield Kansas.Was driving to town, and just a mile east of the house saw a light behind the hedge row. Looked like a plane coming this way from the airport, but the limbs of the trees were dimly lit around the light. The light was amoungnst the limbs, and small dim &#34;sparks&#34; were radiating from the light. I stopped and watched, but left as soon as the light quit.

But what unnerved me the MOST was it &#34;seemed&#34; to be aware of my presense.My curiosity quickly turned to fear and disbelief.I ran as fast as I could to get a neighbor/witness ,but my friend got mad &amp; thought I was joking.We returned 10min. later and it was gone...27yrs. later, and this incident still unnerves me..I dont think or talk about it.. because people just laughed at me then.But its one minute of terror I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It was low to the ground, sort of shadowing the top of the trees. In other words the craft was following the contour of the landscape. As it got closer the light divided into two lights of which they appeared to be some type of flood light. It also looked like shafts of light the farther away it got. It proceeded to come in and the closer it came to the road the lower it got. I was so amazed with the sight that I stopped the car and got out, my wife was in the car with me. I had completely cut the motor of the vehicle off. This craft was flying soundlessly over the road and us.  It was shaped like a rectangular box, with a slanted plexiglass looking windshield. It was moving very slowly, and my wife was telling me to get into the car and lets go. It was a full moon night and we both saw the ufo very plainly. Not like some kind of light in the sky, we saw the entire vehicle. And I have not been the same until this very day. My wife and I are not mental patients and have never been. We don&#39;t drink or do any type of drugs. We attend church regularly and are the parents of four children.<n>

It was a big flash, and even though we were a bit drunk, we were scared. After a few seconds, the light dissapeared, and we drove back to Roswell, where we all came from. This is the first time, we have ever told any one this. We have often thought about it, but we have kept it a secret. Other wise people might think, we were out of our minds.
