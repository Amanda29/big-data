HER OLDER DAUGHTER WAS AWAY. THERE WAS NOBODY TO WALK ME HOME.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I BRAVELY SAID I WOULD BE OK, I WALKED BACK AND FORTH TO SCHOOL ALONE.  BUT NOT AT DUSK, SHE SAID WORRIEDLY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ABOUT HALFWAY HOME SOMETHING I SAW ACROSS THE FIELDS OF MY FATHER&#39;S FARM ALERTED ME...BALLS OF LIGHT LIKE BALOONS IN THE SKY, FLOATING ABOUT...NO,PLAYING TAG, PERHAPS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SUDDENLY, ONE CAME SPEEDING IN A STRAIGHT LINE TOWARDS ME AND I FRANTICALLY LOOKED FOR A PLACE TO HIDE, FEELING IT HAD SPOTTED ME AND I WAS IN SOME KIND OF MORTAL DANGER.
