I do not have video of it coming over me but would have been a show stopper. I feel strongly the thing in this video is what went over my house. I just posted the video on youtube<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqTWDx8nNlU YouTube - Portal Georgia UFO<n>
9/30/07 22:00|Portal|GA|Triangle|30sec-1min|Really big triangle with 3 large lights following behind a dark delta wing craft with red lights across rear|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61336.html|2|ndxe200709| Really big triangle with 3 large lights following behind a dark delta wing craft with red lights across rear<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been observing this thing since August, recorded a video in early September but have waited to see it closer and or get a better picture. I have not made a digital copy I can upload of the object with the low southern star as a reference, hope to get a better shot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday September 30 2008 I was watching TV when a loud rumble like a jet at full throttle came over my house. I ran out to the field before looking back and up. I could not believe it it was a giant triangular craft with large globes of amber on the points, ahead of it appeared to be a giant stealth delta wing craft and across the rear was 4 sets of red lights like an old Thunderbird. The triangle with the lights was following so close it was as if it were towing the triangle which was very close. They flew over and I could see them shrink before disappearing over the horizon, leading me to believe it was actually much larger and flying much higher than they looked as it flew over. I figured it was bigger than a football field if that was 500 feet. After seeing it so long makes me think it was much higher which means it was really big! Although I am 50 mi. east of  Dublin the flight path I have been observing heads straight to Dublin. They seem to like swamps. As many times I have a camera with me that night I did not and that picture would have been great and barely fit the screen. It was not until the Dublin incident that I felt like coming forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were either a tight formation or a single object with 3 lights.  There was no noise. They may have been illuminated from city glow as they looked a faded brownish color. Each object or light had a hazy glow around the edge.  With my stuck out thumb as a guide the object(s) together were about as big as a quarter at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had both a camera and camcorder 2 feet away from me in my car but the whole sighting lasted less than 10 seconds and by the time I could have gotten them out and turned on the objects would have been gone. I opted to watch.  After watching them cross the sky and disappear past the roof of my house I watched a few more minutes to see if anything else would show up, then I went inside and started typing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was a witness to the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; on 3/13/97 and for the last 10 years since then, I have been scanning the sky nightly without with camera close by, but have not seen anything since then... until this night.  What I saw is unlike anything I&#39;d seen or heard of before.  It was certainly unexplainable.  It was way about 5 to 8 thousand feet and moving about as fast as a fixed wing aircraft would be flying.  The difference that set it apart from any aircraft is that it looked like a small cloud that was lit up from behind by a white  light.  As I watched it travel high in the center of the sky, it faded to black and then lit back up again. As it flew over it faded out and again and lit up again in perfect rythem as it headed straight southwards.  I ran inside to get my camera but by the time I got back (about 30 seconds) it was too far away to get a shot off.  There was no other light other than the one that blinked on and off from behind this cloudlike object.  As I watched it fly awy from me, it made a manuver unlike anything I&#34;ve ev.er witnesse then went out of sight as it was heading into the southward sky.<n>

The night was incredibly clear, and the sun had just finished setting; the moon had not yet began to rise. I was traveling in my vehicle at about 55 mph (speed limit) when I looked ahead to the top of Wye Mtn. I saw two rather large lights within close proximity to each other (seemingly part of the same craft), emitting a low burning orange color. The craft was extremely close to the ground and actually appeared to be sitting atop a tree or home on top of the mountain. I sat and stared while slowly pressing on my brakes to prolong the experience and verify what I was seeing. I continued foreword at this point at around 35-38 mph, looking closely to the top of the mountain. After a tree had passed in front of my view and I tried to re-focus on the craft, it wasn’t there! I sat back in my seat and kept driving as if nothing had occurred, when my friend looked over at me and asked if I had seen it too. I was beside myself. I kept looking and looking to no avail. We traveled up Highway  113 and saw no more indicators of any craft in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

9/30/07 19:30|Gurnee|IL|Sphere|5 minutes|Large orange orb moving south to north across the eastern sky just prior to sunset.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59041.html|8|ndxe200709| Large orange orb moving south to north across the eastern sky just prior to sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was relaxing on my patio enjoying a clear perfect evening when I spotted an orange orb travelling acroos the eastern sky. It was traveling from south to north at elevation and speed which seemed to be about the same as commercial aircraft that I often observe. It was silent. Being just prior to sunset the sun was low in the sky and was reflecting brightlt off this object, indicating that was bright orange in color and appeared to be perfectly round in shape, like a &#34;ball&#34;. Judging by the size of commercial aircraft at that same apparent distance and/or altitude it must have been quite large in size. There was no vapor trail. The time was approximately 7:20 CDT. By the time I thought to go grab my digital camera it had moved out of my sight. It&#39;s path was straight, and as if in orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving and listening to the radio. It was a cloudless sky, so the white streak stood out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching about five minutes she alerted me that it was a craft.  She saw revolving lights under the object.  The lights also changed color to blue and then red, then back to white. I looked and saw it  and pulled off the road to get a good look.  The object was not moving.  We had the mountain range to use as a marker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to drive toward Laramie we could see the object did not move.  It was about two inches wide at arms length and we estimate it to be 30-40 miles west of us. It was about a fist above the mountains.  We continued to watch until we reached Laramie about twenty to twenty-five minutes after we first spotted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no mistaking it with anything we know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both experienced sky-watchers and this was the real deal.<n>
9/30/07 18:30|Clarkton|NC|Other|5 Minutes|This was a reddish vertical streamer that drifted to the south and was in the western sky.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59024.html|10|ndxe200709| This was a reddish vertical streamer that drifted to the south and was in the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and child noticed a reddish streamer type of object in the western sky that was drifting toward the south.  The object appeared to have something hanging form it but we were not able to make out the hanging object.  It was not a parachute, as I am a former jumper and it was not a streaming parachute.  It was in a slow decent and appeared to be a very large object resembling a wind drift indicator used by sky divers, although it was large and descernible to the naked eye as it appeared to be about 1/2 mile from our location.  We watched this vertical streamer descend for about 5 minutes.  We got into our car and drove toward the sighting and were not able to see the object again.  I surmise that it went down in a wooded area close to our home which is not accessible to us.  There were no aircraft in the area and no sound.  There were no jumpers in our area.  Our home is located in an aerial training area for Pope AFB and Ft. Bragg, which are located approximately 60 miles to the NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was waiting for my brother in his car outside his house, when I looked up to the east and saw a Cigar Shaped, Silver object fly into the leading edge of a storm cloud. There may have been more already in the cloud but I didn&#39;t see them. It was close enough that if it were an Airplane I would have heard it and there was no contrail. I don’t drink and I don’t do drugs and I wasn’t tired.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One sphere was ahead of the group and to the right. Four spheres were at and near the red object and one sphere followed a larger distance behind. they were traveling in a northern direction. I suspected this to be a VIP traveling and escorted by military aircraft, but my internet searches only produces other UFO sightings. They were very high and moved at a rate of speed similar to satellites I&#39;ve seen in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything like this and pointed it out to my father-in-law who observed same.<n>

Planes birds etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ~ 14:25 Whitish / Bluish object seen with binoculars for about 30 seconds viewed toward the West  at ~ 75º elevation, lost view when I moved my position slightly. Traveled about 1-2 inches (arms length) toward the SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was ‘self illuminating’ and not reflective. The object was spherical and illuminated ‘white’ from the center outward. The color changed gradually to a bright blue at the well defined circumference. This blue color must have been quite intense due to the fact that the normal blue of the cloudless sky appears quite dull/dark in my binoculars. This object was most likely not visible to the unaided eye. This was the most interesting of objects seen thus far during my daytime viewing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ~ 14:27 Attempting to relocate the object above, I saw a ‘whitish’ object in the same general area. The object was not highly reflective. The exact form is uncertain. It was not well defined; however it had the shape of a rectangle if I were to guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the object in a somewhat southerly direction. The previous blue object appeared within the ‘field of view’ (fov) for a few seconds.  I continued to follow the 2nd object for 2-3 min. It traveled ~ 5-6 inches (arms length). Due to the apparent altitude of this object and the one below, the exact form and shape are uncertain. I’m not certain why I did not return to viewing the ‘bluish’ object rather than the ‘white’ object ?  Again, this object and the one below were most likely not visible to the unaided eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ~ 14:35 3rd object. Identical to the 2nd object. I viewed it for 6-7 min. traveling at a relatively slow pace as above. It suddenly began to pick up speed and began to travel in a SW direction.  I maintained sighting of the object as I backed 15 feet toward the NE in order to maintain view. This movement was required due to tree obstruction.  The objects acceleration increased to the point that I was required to run beyond the tree obstruction. When attempting to relocate after moving to a new viewing location about 30 feet to the SW, I think I found the object,  however it appeared to be accelerating at a rapid rate and appeared to be droping in altitude to point of losing sight. This last view is uncertain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 15:00 as perspective: Four (2 blue / 2 white) balloons, visible w/o binoculars as a single object toward the North at about 75 º.  Balloons traveled ~ 12-14 inches (arms length) over a period of 25 min. As they traveled toward the West, they ascended to an altitude during this period where they were not visible w/o binoculars.  (later ID&#39;d as typical &#34;Caldwell Banker&#39; grouping of &#39;open-house&#39; balloons)<n>

It is very prominent, currently, at this time of morning.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were driving home from Wal-Mart at 4:04 in the morning. While on the off-ramp leading to the road back to our house, we looked up at the sky and noticed a very large yellowish-white object in the sky, too big and bright to be a star. While we were stopped at the red light at the end of the off-ramp, we also noticed it was moving slowly to the left. Since planets do not move that quickly from a point of view on Earth, we also knew it wasn&#39;t a planet. When viewed with the naked eye, we even noticed wing-shaped protrusions. I though it looked like a phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we finally arrived home, we could no longer see the object through the tall trees, so we had to walk down the road to view the craft with a pair of binoculars. We stood there for 20-30 minutes watching the craft. We noticed that it had a flashing red light on its underside, and had a faintly visible flashing red dot moving around it. We are not sure whether or not this was another craft, but if it is, we believe the larger craft is a mother ship. The large craft also had a starburst light pattern around it, which did not twinkle, indicating that this was definitely not a star. While we watched it, it stayed still for the majority of the time, but every now and then, it would noticeably move to the left, to the right, up a little, and further away...and at one point, closer to us. It also occasionally changed shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked back to the house at about 4:30, and noted that it was much higher up in the sky now; we could see it over the treetops while standing next to the house. It was also moving much more frequently, and slightly more quickly. At approximately 4:56, I ran into the house to wake my mother up to show her the craft. At approximately 5:20, after my mother and brother had gone back into the house, I noticed that the red dot that was flying around the object had flown into the object, and a dim blue light flew out in its place. The craft is still out there right now.<n>

As i got closer i could see a green light on the left and a red light on the right. The object was triangular shaped with one bright light in front. I turned down the radio, rolled down my windows and stuck my head out just to see if i could hear a plane engine. There was no noise. It just hovered there in one spot.

It was visible only because of the fireball/plasma that fully engulfed it, and it&#39;s lines were not vague, but distinct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the front (foward section based on direction of travel), the plasma was sparse, heavier on the sides, and formed a tail in the rear that was approx. 50% of the size of the object itself. The object was travelling south to north (approx.). As the object entered our field of vision, it disappeared completely without changing any direction or speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was not clear, but contained light, sparse cloud cover that I believe helped us to see it better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Altitude is unknown, but it was either under/in the clouds, or very bright/ burning through from above the clouds.<n>

This light moved in a straight coarse for about 1 min then just dissapeared. I honestly don&#39;t think it was a jet or satalite, because I see many jets being that I live close to BWI airport and I would know the difference. This appeared  way out in outer space where jets don&#39;t fly and a satalite wouldn&#39;t suddenly just dissapear.Im convinced this was something other than a conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They are becoming more frequent in Chicago but only justified by the Olympic bid.  Crime is low and the culture is very civilized.  So why the multiple copters and the amount of time they are flying ?  Upon noticing the over abundance of helicopter activity I begin to look out the window of my 6th floor apartment facing west.  As I observe the &#34;ghetto birds&#34; in action I notice what I&#39;ve never noticed before; a dimond shaped light in coming due west.  This light resembled the light a star emits.  The only distinguishable difference between this light and a star was it&#39;s sheer size and lack of accute stationary form.  It hovered left to right and was much larger than a star (or moon) and was most certainly more illuminated than a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was it ?  And why have I personally witnessed objects in the sky that I&#39;ve never seen before at some a frequent pace (the 3rd time in 4 months I&#39;ve witnessed a UFO or ARV), why were the helicopters flying for so long and in such numbers, and why was this in the vacinity of O&#39;Hare again ?  Was I the only one to see this ?<n>

The Sun was bright when I looked into the sky and saw about 5 Jet Planes. I stopped looking. I started to explain to my Wife how Jet Planes operate. My Wife started looking into the sky, and that&#39;s when she spotted what appeared to like a huge, chrome, bowl shaped object almost in the middle of the Jet Planes. My wife told Me to look at it, and she asked me if I knew what it was. I could not explain what it was, but it was something that we had never seen before. It stayed in the same spot for about 10 seconds. It got smaller as it went up into the atmosphere, which took about 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was the brightest object in the sky except for the moon. I watched this star as I walked along the road and noticed it blinked off. I decided that was definately not right. As I stopped and gazed more intently it came back on after about 30 seconds, then off after about a minute. It did this a few times before beginning to move! It&#39;s now moving toward the South-SouthWest. Without warning it shoots off to the SSW at incredible speed in an arc-like manner (in other words not in a straight line) I waited for it to return and it did not.

We were traveling north on U.S. 59, and at approximately 11:00 - 11:15 p.m. as we neared Humble, both of us observed a flying object that surprised us regarding how the object looked and the apparent speed of travel.  We observed it somewhere between Jetero Blvd. And FM 1960.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling on a heading of about 45 degrees, and appeared to be at a fairly low altitude, and also appeared to be losing altitude.  The object was bright and appeared to be streaming material behind (my son thought it might have been on fire).  We drive this freeway often and see planes crossing overhead the freeway (east-west) all the time on final approach to Bush Intl airport.  What primarily caught our attention was the speed, direction and altitude of the object.  We watched it continue in a northeast direction, until it either got too low to see or disappeared over the horizon.  Afterward, we were very confused about where the object went and thought perhaps it just appeared close but was actually a meteorite burning up in the atmosphere much further away.  Since this occurred so close to the airport, there may be many explanations but it sure looked remarkable.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As dusk started to settle in, I noticed a polar-orbit satellite going over and pointed it out to my son. We chatted for a while after that, then started scanning for more sats as the evening got a little darker (I had just mentioned the Sputnik anniversary, so we were inspired).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before long, we saw another sat... I think that it was about this time (maybe 8pm) that we came in and looked up visible sat passes tonight on heavens-above.com.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Went back outside, both looking up - and we both notice, at the same time, a fairly tight group of objects nearly straight above us, somewhat to the north. There are five small lighted &#34;somethings&#34; moving quickly across the sky toward the south...<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were in a line, not perfectly straight across, but close... Moving much faster than a sat, not pinpoints like stars but *very* small, distinct circles. Not very bright - from comparing to the sats that we saw tonight (mostly Cosmos rocket bodies), I would say magnitude 3 or so each. The whole group was maybe 2-3 moon widths across. My first thought was a large meteor breaking up, but it was too slow for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If the speed wasn&#39;t enough to dismiss the meteor theory, the behaviour of the objects was - they changed their orientation, one to another, almost as if jockeying for position as they crossed the sky, eventually forming a shallow arc! I started saying &#34;holy $#&amp;^!&#34; out loud by this time, and my son and I had time to look at each other and look back up and watch these things fly off to the south, probably 15-20 seconds after we spotted them.  They disappeared into the light pollution on the horizon at maybe 20-30 degrees up and off to the SSE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must have looked totally freaked out, because my son said to me several times, &#34;I saw them, too, Dad, I saw them too!&#34;. I flipped open my cell phone for the time - 8:23pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound, absolutely nothing. Too fast for high altitude aircraft. No lights like aircraft. No way they were sats or breaking up debris - they swapped position with each other, very quickly, and flew in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I even checked the upper air data when it came in later this evening to see if maybe, just maybe, we were looking at balloons (I know my high altitude balloons are sometimes reported as UFOs - things can look strange way up in the sky). Upper air sounding from 0z tonight showed winds in the right direction at around 9k-12k feet (I think - not near the ground, anyway, so they weren&#39;t party balloons and we mistook the apparent altitude) but only at 20 knots or so (which looks really darn slow from 10k feet away). And there&#39;s no way that I could make balloons - even purposely-designed as a hoax - do what these things did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the third time in 20 years that I&#39;ve seen something downright unexplainable in the sky. First time was 20 years or so ago - six or so lights in a &#34;T&#34; arrangement, apparent triangular outline, moving silently across the night sky (dimmer yet than these tonight). Second, about seven years ago, *exactly* the same as the first time, but moving in the opposite direction (first time the &#34;T&#34; arrangement went base-first, second time went top-first). Silent both times, hard to even see. Now this…  Honestly, I wish I hadn&#39;t seen this. I&#39;m still rather freaked - and I&#39;m rational, teach computers and science, design and fly high-altitude scientific balloons, do a reasonable amount of sky-watching, take no medications, rarely drink... I *wasn&#39;t* seeing things and I can find NOTHING that matches what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two triangle things in the past I have written off to the much-rumoured secret mil airship - fits the descriptions in Aviation Week from a long time ago). But this?? My son was thrilled, wanted to see it again, seemed to be totally in awe. I can&#39;t sleep right now but wish I could….<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My first thought was the light was the sunlight reflecting off a high flying jet as the sunrise had not yet occured.  However, it soon became apparent the light was not moving.  I then pulled off the road and noted two other cars parked with the occupants of these cars looking toward the light.  The light appeared bright and had the shape of a chevron or &#34;V&#34; shape.  Directly below and to the left of the light(southeast of my position)  were two small orange orbs.  The height of the light and the orbs could not be determined but it was above the broken cloud cover.  I observe the light to remain motionless for approximaely 5 minutes.  It then rotated slighly and exposed a diffused red light on what appeared to be the rear area of the craft.  I continued to observe the light for an additional 5 minutes before leaving.  The two other cars and their occupants had left prior to my departure. I continued to observe the light as I drove towards my job site only loosing site of it when I arrived at the job site.

It was the brightness of Sirius or maybe brighter, and the size of half of an eraser head at arm&#39;s length - close to the size of Venus.  I could not tell what the distance from earth was, but it was high up at the altitude I would expect to see a satellite at. The object changed trajectory at 80 degrees to a more NE direction.  It was at that point that I said maybe it was not a satellite - it then faded slowly and moved UP and it was gone at about 110 degrees or so.  The entire sighting lasted maybe 20 seconds. We both came away with the idea that it did not look like a satellite or a plane, and by going up and away, this would indicate something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 50 feet to my right, two Las Vegas police officers had someone in custody, possibly for illegal drugs.  My eyes were directed upwards and I observed an aircraft streaking overhead.  The flight pattern resembled a conventional aircraft, but this aircraft was a perfect triangle in shape. I have never seen a triangular shaped aircraft.  The next day, my friends told me that it was probably the latest in Stealth technology.  This craft had three lights, one at each end of the triangle and one light in its mid-center.  I glanced toward the police officers, and their attention was also directed towards the object.  One of them said, &#34;Wow, look at that&#34;.  They then turned back to the subject they had in custody.  As the object passed, two very bright white lights were flickering at the rear of the craft.  I don&#39;t believe I heard any noise emitting from the aircraft.  I am not able to accurately describe the size of it or how high it was in the sky.  I was not able to confer with the two police officers about further descriptions because they were busy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The color coming from the exhausts was red and blue|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59060.html|47|ndxe200709| Two of my friends and I were sitting on the beach in a semi-circle. My friend directly across from me said “what is that coming down the beach”. I turned around and from the Southwest coming directly down the shoreline was a bright white light. At first we thought it was a helicopter but then we noticed how slow it was moving and at times it appeared to hover. The object then cut left over the dunes and at that point we thought it was a Cessna plane or something like that. We went about our business then about five minutes later we saw the object shoot up almost like a rocket from behind the houses. It had two very large circular exhausts (not sure exactly what the correct term is for this). It looked like the Space Shuttle Main Engines but instead of three there were two. The color coming from the exhausts was red and blue. What was strange about all of this is that the object made absolutely no noise at all. I know there is a Marine Corps base close to the area which made me think it could have possibly been a CV-22 Harrier Jet. If I’m right, the Harrier Jet makes noise. Whatever this was, I have never seen anything like it before. The other very, very strange thing is that my friend was wearing a digital watch and it started to consistently blink on and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I wasn&#39;t wearing my glasses, so I couldn&#39;t make it out for sure. I went into the grocery store, and asked the people that were working to tell me if there was something there, or if I was just crazy. They confirmed that they too were seeing the object the same as I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a dark, and diamond shaped. It was taller than it was wide, like two 45 degree triangles. There were red glowing marks down the sides, and they would pulsate about every other second. On either side, was a small white light that would blink in between every other red pulse. When the red light&#39;s pulsed, I could sort of hear it, and feel it, like I was somehow connected too it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been looking up into the night skies for as long as I can remember. Hoping to catch a glimpse of the supernatural. I swear to god that this &#34;thing&#34; was hovering directly over me as it passed by, maybe 200-500 feet up, like the height of a low low-flying airplane, and NO it was NOT an airplane, or anything that I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw it, it was moving out of the west, and going east-south-east. This was the most amazing thing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

North (NYC north, not stratosphere north) of the 4 spheres were three of the exact same objects also in a perfectly straight line, so that all 7 objects were in a straight line moving at the same speed. The objects appeared for about 15 seconds in the sky, moving towards the shore, then they all disappeared at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than a minute later we saw the same objects appear over the ocean again. These lights were in the sky, not in the ocean (i.e., not a ship).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared about 5 minutes after my daughter saw a &#34;meteor&#34; over the ocean. I saw the same &#34;meteor&#34; enter the atmosphere. It was not a meteor. It was unlike anything I have ever seen... shooting stars, planes, military or otherwise.  It was too big and too close. It was something that swooped down into our atmosphere. I didn’t think much about it until I saw the perfectly round orange bright lights a couple of minutes later. These were not airplane lights...they didn’t twinkle. They were simply bright orange illuminated orbs that moved toward the shore in a supersonic glide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fishermen and beachcombers along the shore also saw the same incident. We asked them, because my husband and I were so incredulous about what we had seen. Everyone we talked to about the incident reported the same sighting...bright orange lights in a straight line, 4 and 3 in two groups.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky visibility was excellent...full moon and clear skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our background: My husband has five degrees: MBA, masters, PhD, and others. He is from Minnesota. I am a writer with a B.A. in English from Virginia. We have been married for 10 years and have one six-year-old daughter (who witnessed this with us). We have never experienced something like this...and are somewhat embarrassed to be reporting it now!  But we cannot deny what we and so many others witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first we thought they were helicopters search lights. They then turned towards us and arched around to about the 1:00 position. At this time they appeared to be the lights on the wings of a plane. I remember thinking the plane was going to land on the road. At about this same time a third white light appeared. I though it was the tail of the plane but was surprised not to see the flashing red lights of a plane. The lights then turned back towards the10:00 position and the 3 lights became 1. It disappeared off in the distance very quickly. The total time from sighting to it disappearing was 20 – 30 seconds.  The lights were bright and did not blink, they were all white. The weather was clear with a few clouds and a full moon. The lights were not near the moon and we could not make out any object in the sky other than the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

THEN IT WAS GONE. ABOUT 15 MINUTES LATER IT APPEARED AGAIN ABOUT 500 YARDS TO THE RIGHT AND A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN THE FIRST SIGHTING,IT STAYED THERE FOR ABOUT 30 TO 40 SECONDS AND THEN JUST DISAPPEARED.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was traveling north on I-75 in Charlotte County, Florida.  I saw the object cross the highway about ½ mile ahead.  At first I thought it was an Air Force fighter jet because of the speed. It had a whit light in the front and a green light in the back. If it was any kind of airplane then I should have seen a red navigational light since I was on its port side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object raced across the sky then I lost sight. Twenty seconds later I was driving on an overpass and I saw the object make a sharp left turn and loop north.  As it made this maneuver it became 2 objects with bright white lights.  As I descended the overpass I lost sight again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location was highway marker 175 on Interstate 75.  The time was 8 PM.<n>

I thought it was a sattelite . then it changed direction. then it went in circles. then i saw another...and another and another. they were doing like figure 8&#39;s and flying around and seemed to be barely missing hitting eachother. then suddenly they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> every night at that time and place i strained to find then again but didn&#39;t and gave up. But on my lunch hour i got something to eat and parked in random apt. complex to eat. i heard a kid singing opera going haywire on the 4th floor balcony and looked and laughed. Then what i thought was a hawk caught my eye. but it seemed way too high to be any hawk...it was in the clouds. it was making rapid back &amp; forth movements and right angles very quickly and looked black-not bird like. then i saw another and another till there was a whole swarm! and this was in broad daylight this time!! they put on the same &#39;airshow&#34; and swarmed around fast barely missing eachother. conveniently my cell phone phone would not work...and i swear a bird came along REAL close trying to distract me...cuz i looked really really fast at it and looked back and the all vanished!<n>

I was just pulling up into my driveway and got out of my car. I have a habit of looking  up at the sky all the time and did so as I was walking toward my front door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near an airport so Im used to seeing planes coming in for a landing and also going by after a takeoff. I was looking east and was watching a passenger jet going by and above to the right of the plane was a bright light. The plane was at about 11:oclock and the bright light at about 1:oclock but higher than the plane. I thought at first that the light was a star until it started to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it moved slowly at a downward angle like a swooping arc. It came from above and not the horizon which freaked me out. No blinking lights, no noise, no humming, no indication of anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came from the east and was heading west at the same time the plane was coming from the west heading east. There was a moment when I saw both plane and object at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light was getting closer it started to level out and when it passed over me I could see 3 dimly lit lights on what I think was the belly of the object. I couldnt tell how big the lights were or how fast it was moving but it was moving fast as if like gliding or like slipping on ice and just moving without moving parts. Thats not all. From the same direction that I first saw the light another light appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light was it seems smaller and was a metallic shiny red light that did not emit light but glowed. The red light moved at a very rapid pace and caught up to the white light in just what seemed a few seconds.It looked liked the red light either was swallowed up by the white light or they were very close together. I cant stop thinking about it. It wasnt natural and was quite alien to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reminded me a little of  the movie close encounters when the peeps were on the highyway and saw the crafts fly by. I really cant stop thinking of this and am wondering if anyone else out there has seen this. It was a clear night with the harvest moon out and for some reason I keep thinking the moon has a part in this. Dont know why but thats what I feel. I lost the view of the objects due to the trees in my backyard but did I get an eyeful.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The moon was very bright and beautiful and so I could see no stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One bright orange light appeared miles out over the water and at about 30 degrees from my vantage point.

Then they both disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, I saw one reappear where the original had been, followed by another and another all the way up to seven or eight of them side by side in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they all disappeared together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little to the right of this event, the same thing happened again this time from left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These certainly were not stars; way too high and not consistent with any type of firework; motion was not consistent with a comet or any other type of heavenly body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to look for another 20 or 30 minutes and saw nothing else.<n>

The sun was setting so it was not completely light out at the time. Two people, whom I didn&#39;t see, were walking out had stopped and pointed towards the sky looking at something and then left ( as I was later told). As I was almost in the door i heard  another person say something like &#34; look at that glider up there.&#34; So I walked back out in front of the store and tried to see the glider. Two other people now were looking at the &#34;glider.&#34; The object was located east of where I was standing and was high enough to be visible from the light of the setting sun. At first it was hard to find but when I did I immediately didn&#39;t think that it was a glider, and by glider i mean hang glider. A glider would probably not be flying that high near a major city (Nashville air traffic flies right over the area) or when it was getting dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was high up in the air, somewhere between 7,000 and 10,000 feet possibly, and was very dark colored, most likely black. It was triangular in shape. There were no lights on it to indicate it was an airplane or otherwise. It appeared to be moving very slowly north, northeast as best as I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the witnesses towards the end said &#34;look theres two.&#34; The object or possibly objects either moved away or it was just too dark to see them after a couple of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personally I am aware of Black Triangles and their observances near cities and interstates. I have never observed a &#34;ufo&#34; before, although I am interested in the subject. I wish i had a camera with zoom to take a picture at the time. I&#39;ll have to keep one with zoom on hand now just in case.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Both witnesses ran outside and saw an object that looked something like a mobile with loosly attached parts, perhaps four or five black rectangles and several shiny objects held together by a fragile frame. The object proceeded Northerly at a relatively constant speed of perhaps 40 miles per hour. We were able to watch it until it became too far to see.All the time It was below white clouds. We suspected a lightweight aircraft but there did not appear to be any human shape or cockpit.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Surrounded by very small lights scattered like glitter all around the outer perimeter of object.  It was still dark outside and viewed through  a spotting scope all I could see were the lights.  I lined it up with some trees to see if it was moving across the sky and the object seemed to remain stationery for a long period of time.  When daylight started it got smaller and smaller  and finally faided out of sight.  I will check again at 6am in the morning to see if it may have been a satellite,  but it just seemed way too big and close for that.  A satellite travels and this was stationery.  It was east of Gresham/Damascus looking toward Mt Hood at 6am.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first was at 4:45am with my fiancée and this was at 5:38 am. Alone.  I was walking my dogs and looked up into the sky because a bright orb caught my eye.  As I looked at it, it seemed to be about ¾ of a mile to a mile away. It moved up and then down and then back and diagonally very quickly and then stopped abruptly to hover.  As it hovered it was swinging slightly from right to left, then it crossed the sky towards the east very slowly emitting a white light.  No plane or helicopter I know of moves that way. The bright white light was moving slower than the first one I encountered in February that moved very very quickly across the sky in al directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However, I have a strong feeling that what I witnessed needs to be reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of a work-related assignment, I have rented a 1,500 sq. ft. condo in an area of Punta Gorda, Florida, called Punta Gorda Isles, since May of 2007, and will be here until mid-December of 2007.  My condo is on the fourth floor of a building in a complex called Fountain Court.  The condo faces the north, and it has a screened in balcony that faces north as well.  The balcony looks out over a beautifully landscaped circular drive area, and beyond that is a street, then a complex of two story apartment buildings, then another building.  For about a mile-and-a-half beyond that are tree tops and, low on the horizon, a couple of buildings, a few broadcasting towers and a high-rise construction crane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The face of the balcony is approximately nine feet across.  I work at home and, (though I wouldn’t want this known because I’m in the health field) I smoke.  Therefore, several times during every day and night, I walk out onto the balcony, sit down, smoke a cigarette and think.  I also make many business calls out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of Monday, September 24th, I was sitting on the balcony smoking a cigarette.  The sky at the time was a grayish color, and it was a patchwork of clouds (in different shades of gray) at different altitudes.  I was just staring forward as I always do, because there is nothing else to do.  Anyway, while I was sitting there I noticed what appeared to be a dull silver-colored parachute floating downward out of the clouds at an angle headed directly towards me.  However, there weren’t any lines/cords hanging from the parachute, nor was there anything or anyone suspended from what appeared to be the parachute.  I remember wondering why there wasn’t anything suspended from the parachute, and I can remember thinking that maybe the parachute cables were clear plastic and just couldn’t be seen – but that didn’t make sense.  I can also remember wondering how the parachute could be pulled towards the ground by gravity if there were no weight beneath the parachute to draw the parachute towards the ground.  Nonetheless, I wondered why someone would be parachuting at night, and I wondered where they could land at night with all the trees and buildings in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Punta Gorda and where I live here are the most boring places on earth and, therefore, what I was witnessing should have riveted my attention – but it didn’t probably because of the following reasons:  1. I am in the middle of some very stressful situations at work, with which my mind was preoccupied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. I was taking a smoke break while working on another book, and I was thinking about what I had been writing and what I would continue writing when I walked back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. There are so many technologically-advanced things that are happening these days that almost nothing surprises us anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. And, this may seem strange, but it seems like I wasn’t supposed to see it.  No matter what else was on my mind, I can’t now understand why I wasn’t riveted to what was occurring in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object came closer I realized that the top of the object was flat, its sides were curved like a parachute, and its bottom was flat.  For an instant I thought it may have been an odd-shaped advertising blimp that had broken free.  However, there were no illustrations or writing on the object, and the object wasn&#39;t shaped like any blimp I&#39;d ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the middle of this, I stood up and walked about two feet indoors to get another cigarette off the table that is right next to the door.  Then I turned back outside and stood there on the balcony watching the object come closer.  I noticed that the wind was gently blowing to the west, however, the object was coming in towards me at a direct and seemingly determined angle – almost as if it were guided by a rail (which it wasn’t) – and it was totally unaffected by the wind.  Therefore, I began to assume that it was somehow propelled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then turned inside again (this time to get a lighter – which took about four  seconds) and, when I turned back out onto the patio, the object was traveling east at about thirty-five miles per hour.  I didn’t see the object make the turn, but from its before and after locations and motions, it seemed that it would have had to have made a sudden left turn.  Although the object was obviously propelled by something, there were no sounds whatsoever, nor were there any jets, propellers or other visible or audible indications of propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object made its left turn, it was traveling, as stated, at about thirty-five miles per hour.  It was traveling about twenty feet above the tree tops, and I realized from my vantage point that the object was about the size of a compact to mid-sized car.  I moved to the westernmost corner of my balcony and watched the object maintain a constant altitude and speed as it traveled east.  I watched the object travel east for about fifteen to thirty seconds until it disappeared into the haze of the eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now realize how these types of things can happen and no one reports them.  It was all quite inconspicuous, quiet, and it was over with so quickly that it wasn’t until it was over that I had time to really think about what just occurred.   And, after it was over, I realized all the things the object wasn’t:  1. It wasn’t a parachute  2. It wasn’t an advertising blimp, and there was no advertising on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. It wasn’t like any kind of craft that I’ve ever seen or heard about before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. The object had no windows, no antenna(s), no wheels or pods, no propellers, jets or other visible means of propulsion and it was absolutely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To me it strongly seemed that the object had a mission.  It came down at an exact angle from the sky.  It turned and went in an exact direction to the east.  After it turned to the east, it maintained a constant altitude just above the trees and buildings.  If it had been a government craft, it would have most obviously been a surveillance craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object disappeared, I became a bit upset with myself for not being totally focused on what had occurred from beginning to end.  I wished, for example, that I would have witnessed the object stop its descent and make its turn to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next evening, Tuesday evening, September 25th, I was at a small meeting where I had to give a talk.  A very level-headed woman, with whom I work, was there.  I told her about what I’d witnessed the night before.  She responded by saying: “That’s strange.  My mother told me that she saw something unusual in the sky by Punta Gorda Isles last night at about 8:30 p.m.”  I said, “That’s where I live, in Punta Gorda Isles, but I thought it was about 11:30 or midnight when I saw what I saw.”  She said, “No, my mother said it was at about 8:30 last night.  However, you know my mother is very intelligent but she is eighty-seven years old.”  We all chuckled and that was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I definitely saw what I saw and it was real and not imagined.  It may have been a new type of government craft but, if so, it was unlike anything I’d ever heard or read about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never before seen anything like this, nor have I ever seen or reported any kind of U.F.O. event.  This all was totally unexpected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a very bright star, high in the Southwest.  Then, I realized that it was moving.  I see many airplanes in the night sky, but this had no running lights.  It was just pure white light.  Suddenly, it just stopped in place and quit moving.  Then, it got dimmer and dimmer while continuing to remain stationary.  It seemed to be ascending at a very rapid rate up into the stratosphere.  This whole incident occurred in about fifteen seconds.  I doubt that any conventional aircraft could have hovered so high in the atmosphere, nor ascended vertically so quickly out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And there is no doubt it was a flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in taxi bout 10:00 PM when X said, &#34;Hey, Look at that!&#34;  I looked out the window and saw flying through the air at cloud level -- I am no expert, but I would say 4000 to perhaps at about 5000 feet -- a triangular-shaped craft with bright blue, red and yellow lights on each side (pretty sure on this, but there could have been other colors too), four to five from point to point, including the lights on the ends.  The body of the craft was dark – or indistinct.  It was about the size of a small to medium-sized airplane, moving steadily (similar to the speed of a plane) but not fast.  About 5 to 10 seconds later, the taxi turned and our view was obstructed.  My heart!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were spaced something like this:    * *   * *  *  * *<n>

At 8:12pm, I saw what appeared, to me, to be something akin to an irridium flare or bright plane landing light dim and go out about 12 o&#39;clock high.  One minute later at 8:13pm, to the west, I picked up an orange light approaching at 2-3x the speed of the incoming airliners (on flight path to PHL from West to East).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially just orange, the light pattern of the object became a clockwise rotating orange beam, similar to a &#34;bow tie&#34; rotating clockwise.  I payed close attention - no blinking lights and it roated about 40-50 RPM (one clockwise rotation per second or so).  Initial thought was it looked like a recent viewing of a flyover of the ISS.  However, it got interesting at this point.  After viewing the craft for 5 seconds, it stopped.  Stopped! This is where my heart started to beat quickly.  I did not take my eyes off of it and in a very short time, it reversed direction from due-east to what appeared to be almost a 180* direction change and it appeared to start heading up.  It changed direction again 2-3 more times, going east again, then another zig back to north west where it dimmed and disappeared.  The point it disappeared was not too far from the point in the sky I had seen the flare-type effect at 8:12pm.  It had done this activity at about the same time I caught, out of the corner of my right eye, the bright headlight of a commercial airliner traveling from East to West on an opposite path toward the object (a normal flight path from PHL outbound to the West).  The object appeared to have &#34;sensed&#34; the airliner heading its way and it made a choice to zig zag away and then out of sight &#34;upward&#34; in a course correction effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object didn&#39;t seem too out of the ordinary as a rotating orange bar of light.  What was astounding was that it stopped and changed course a number of times in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of bar of orange light would have been 2-3 times the width of a commercial airliner at 25K feet.  Possibly just under the width of my pinky fingernail held at arm&#39;s length.  I do not know if I can judge the height of the object but would approximate 15-20K feet.  The color of the object was orange at all times - changing from bar to point of light to small point of light to nothing during its flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Normally when I watch, I take a folding wooden chair out to sit in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My observation is limited somewhat due to trees, however the nearest provides a nice shade from the sun to my South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition to aircraft, there are many birds-of-prey which are fascinating to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, after a summer of daytime sky watching, the discovery of planets viewable and nothing else much interesting, this is what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 24 September 2007  Nikon 10x25, 5º binoculars  No clouds were observed in the sky during the five hour period of observation. There was a light haze in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observation #1 12:30 While viewing what appeared to be a pair of dragon flies with my binoculars, I noticed an object in the background that was somewhat reflective although out of focus. I was looking directly overhead and without lowering the binoculars I immediately refocused onto the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared spherical, although due to the altitude, this is uncertain. The reflection on the object from the sun was not intense or bright. The reflection was more &#39;dull&#39;, almost a non-reflection. Color was grayish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, I thought that the object was stationary, however I realized that I was craning my neck further back to keep the object within view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object initially traveled in an East to West direction. It traveled about four inches (arms length) toward the west.  The object then made a 90º turn toward the North and I viewed it for an additional 1.5&#34; of travel. I moved slightly, less than one second, as the object passed behind the AC power service lines into my home. I was unable to locate the object after this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total viewing time was six-eight seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am quite certain that I would not have been able to see this object without the use of my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what this could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observation #2 12:40 Having seen the previous object 10 minutes earlier, I was focusing my attention in the same general area of the sky. That being directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Without the use of binoculars, I noticed a brief flash or reflection of light. Once again, directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately brought my binoculars up and into focus and was able to follow the object as it traveled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s path was in a North direction. It traveled about 20&#34; (arms length). The object was a definite cylindrical, rectangular or oblong shape. It was light in color and after the initial bright reflection overhead, it did not appear to be highly reflective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object traveled, it appeared to be tumbling and or rotating, not quite end-over-end. I was able to see dark areas on the rather light colored object as it &#39;tumbled&#39; indicating to me that these were shadows produced by the movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to view the object&#39;s entire path which lasted six-eight seconds at which point it simply faded from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The diameter or width of the object appeared to be about 1/7th it&#39;s length. The length was approximately 1/3 the size of a full sized aircraft flying at a 35,000 - 38,000 foot flight level at a 45º elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These estimates are highly questionable due to the altitude and short duration of observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best guess as to what the object could have been, is that it could be one of many rockets or boosters that are in a decaying orbit overhead. I am not certain if it is possible to actually see shape in these objects as they travel through the daytime sky ?  An online attempt was made to determine if there were any of these rockets / boosters in orbit at the time in question, however there are so many objects that it appeared to be a futile attempt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observation #3 13:35 Again, directly overhead, an unaided observation of a flash or reflection was seen.  I immediately, brought my binoculars up and into focus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling in a South - North direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to have form of a typical plane or a &#39;plus&#39;(+)shape. It seemed to have form on the ends of the + shape. It was far too high to be able to maintain a steady view through the binoculars. The object was not highly-reflective as it traveled. It did not spin or rotate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to watch the object from it&#39;s position overhead for approximately 10 seconds. During this period, the object traveled about 30 inches (arms length) until it traveled behind a tree about 200 feet from my position. I lost sight at an elevation of about 35-45ºs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In comparison, a high flight-level plane at an elevation of about 60 degrees to my North, travels about eight inches (arms length) in a period of 35 - 40 seconds. At this distance and altitude, the shape of the plane is quite discernible and not in question!  This object was high and traveling VERY fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After contemplating this object for some time, it suddenly occurred to me that it was probably the ISS. A quick check determined that the ISS was traveling at this time over Southern South America.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no solid idea what this object was. Again, I&#39;m not certain of the ability to see form in objects that are in low earth orbit during the daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observation #4 16:00 I noticed a bright point of light in the South Eastern sky at about a 45 degree elevation. Raising my binoculars, the object appeared to resemble a planet as viewed during the daytime with binoculars. There was some form to the object and it resembled a large balloon. It appeared that there was some sort of appendage on the lower side / bottom of the object. Due to my movement however, this is uncertain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a gradual movement that seemed to be toward the NNE.  Travel was about three inches (at arms length) in a period of about four-six minutes. After this movement, the object began a gradual movement in a ESE direction. Object was in view for approximately an additional 15-20 minutes until it reduced to a very fine point of light and I was unable to relocate the object after taking a &#39;movement break&#39; for a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, depending upon actual altitude,the object would most likely have been over Western Central NJ.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although interesting, I assumed that due to the duration, altitude and travel of the object, that it was most likely a weather balloon. I had never seen one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> National Weather Service(NWS)indicates that weather balloon flights are able to last in excess of two hours and travel about 125 miles. Altitudes attained can reach 115,000 feet. Balloon releases are normally scheduled at 00:00 and 12:00 UTC with exceptions for additional releases for specific storm concerns. The diameter of the balloon at it&#39;s bursting point can be as wide as 20 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a footnote to these events, at 17:15, I saw a bright lime-green balloon with a curly tail rise above the treetop about 200 feet from my location. It began it&#39;s northward travel and I watched with and without binoculars for about 12 minutes until it became non-viewable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This added some perspective to the preceding events of the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, after spending the amount of time I have this past summer watching planes, I find it improbable to have witnessed these four objects in a single day. It did none the less, happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was flickering red and green lights and was unlike any other stars in the sky. I called for my husband to come and see and he was just as perplexed as I. We watched it for 30 to 45 minutes and it did not move. I used a pair of binoculars and got a good view of the lights but couldn’t make out a shape. I will be purchasing a telescope or stronger binoculars very soon. The next night I looked to see if it could’ve been some type of tower or something that I had never noticed before. There was nothing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years ago I posted a sighting that happened many years ago in 1975 in another state. Because of that sighting I became very watchful of the night sky. My husband on the other hand has always been a skeptic but even he said the lights in the sky couldn’t have been a plane because they were in one spot for so long.

I was outside around a fire with my Niece and Nephew. The sky was clear, weather nice. I looked to the sky and seen a triangular shaped UFO/Aircraft at about 2500-3000 feet up flying low speed. It&#39;s belly was lit up with approx 7 white lights (in a V shape) and it was virtually silent (it was very silent). It&#39;s direction was north I believe, following the Niagara River towards Niagara Falls (30 Km away). Our sighting was with 3 people and I would say it was 2-3 minutes duration as it disappeared into the night and tree line. This is the 3rd time in 1 month I have seen it. I visit my friend regularily who lives in Ft Erie, he has seen it with me a few weeks back. It was an awsome sight to see and next time I WILL have my camera on hand to video it. It is as if I can set my watch to this &#39;thing&#39;. I also know it can be seen from Buffalo, but do believe it was in Canadian airspace the three times I seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My take on this mystery Aircraft/UFO is this. I believe it to be a B2 Spirit Bomber patroling the border, I may be wrong though. I am a true believer in UFO&#39;s and an Aircraft buff, but to the untrained eye... this is one very freaky sight and confuse/scare someone by it&#39;s appearance. It is ghostly in nature and it blends into the night sky perfectly. Added all that with it&#39;s silence and I am sure it is a B2 Stealth. Anyone reading this who is in either Buffalo NY or Fort Erie Ontario areas, I urge to set out with your video camera at about 10 at night to be sure you catch it. Keep a watch west into Lake Erie. The wait is worth your time. I only assume this Aircraft is flying easterly over Lake Erie then onto Lake Ontario. Our area here is big time internation border with numerous bridges crossing into the USA and I am certain it is a secret border patrol tool. Very intimidating!  Comments and questions can be directed through this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks! ((name deleted))  PS: Please contact me with other area sightings. BTW I have not seen it from Niagara Falls. I would like to speak to Mr.Davenport if possible, email is fine too.<n>

It also appeared to &#34;wobble&#34; from time to time. While this area of sky typically is in general area of approach to Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta, the light and its extremely slow rise from the horizon prompted this report.

I noticed a round bright white light coming across from the left side, and it was moving very slow. I thought to my self that plane is too low. But that is when the round light stopped moving and that is when I figured that the object was flying straight in my direction, at this time the light was right over the house across the street. This is when I noticed the object was not making a sound, and it started to move side ways again. It was about ten to fifteen feet above the house, and the house  was about forty-five feet across the street. As I started to point in the direction, the thing stopped agin, at this time it started to go up and out away from us. At the time of my hand being in the up Poisson, I could not cover the light with my hand, so I guess the circle was about eight to ten feet in diameter I don`t know. But with out a sound the circle started to move outward at fast pace it only took about three or four seconds for it to be the size of a pinhead and then gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can not tell you for sure that it was a UFO, but I do know this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1-   the round bright light moved from one side of the sky to the other with out making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2-   it stopped in mid flight, and not once did the brightness ever change to dull or brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3-   it was just above the telephone wires across the street and I could not see any sign of windows and the light did not hurt my eyes, not like a light bulb from a lamp, I could have looked at it all night with having to blink, like I said, I can`t tell you it was a UFO, but as far as what I think it was, yes I am a be leaver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We live in a rural area of town outside of Lebanon Oregon called Lacomb. Above us in the sky appeared a very large glowing red &amp; orange appearing round shape that hovered low, just above the treetops and stayed above us, then gently glided toward the north without veering off the course slowly . We watched it till it was out of sight. Really most beautiful and made no sound.We have been pretty mesmerized by the whole thing, called the police ( the next day) to see if anyone had reported seeing this- because we want to know what it is- alas nobody called it it. Did not see what direction it came from- just sorta was there &amp; cant really say what exact shape but it appeared round- maybe not perfectly tho- it was on fire- no sparks, noise. Can you help us?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END FIRST MESSAGE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((SECOND MESSAGE FROM WITNESS))<n>

We saw it from the East side in Garfield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Om September 22nd, 2007, at approximately 9:30 pm we spotted what first looked like an airplane in the northwestern sky over Cleveland, Ohio.  We were in Garfield Hts., Ohio at the time sitting on the back porch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got a pair of binoculars to take a closer look.  It was not an airplane.  It was an unidentifiable object, actually hovering very slowly moving from the western sky towards the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It first seemed to hover for at least an hour and finally started moving.  Through the binoculars, it first looked to me like an arrow or V shape with red, blue and white lights.  Then it changed to a circular shape with red lights on the left and blue lights on the right and white lights in the middle.  It was constantly blinking and twinkling.  My friend saw pretty much the same thing, but what she called concentrated energy force streaming from the blue and red lights.  She said it looked like a see-through bubble with white veins going around it.  She had contacts in, and I didn’t.   After watching it for an hour and a half, it went further off into the horizon behind a tree.  It did not disappear suddenly, it just hovered away into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD))<n>

It looked like a small ball of fire - much like the fire of a hot air balloon, but was moving too fast to be that, nor did we hear the &#34;phoom&#34; sound you hear from a hot air balloon when they are firing it.  The elevation was that of a lower flying airplane, much lower than the stars.  Another one was following directly in it&#39;s path at the very same height and speed (not super fast, but swift like an airplane).  It seemed much lower than a jet and did not make any noise at all.  One of the people in my group thought it might be helicopters as there is an army base nearby, but no helicopter sounds could be heard.  It seemed the first one &#39;fizzled&#39; out - like it went behind a cloud, but there was no cloud.  Then the 2nd one got brighter, and seemed to &#39;fizzle&#39; out as well not long after.  We were all astonished!<n>

I witnessed it between 9:15 PM CST and 10:05 PM CST. As I looked up I saw an object fly into my line of sight at about the level I&#39;ve seen satellites. As I watched it, it moved erratically in short bursts until it semi settled into a particular part of the sky. Not being an astronomer, I can&#39;t tell you which part nor the longitude and latitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it, I noticed that there were very large spokes of light emanating from it in all directions. Sometimes there would be flashes. There were also smaller lights flying into and out of the larger light. It stayed in position for quite a while moving erratically at times and only for short distances. It was amazing, I didn’t want to take my eyes off of it, but I wanted my binoculars. I went in to get them and when I came back out it was gone, of course.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Light appeared to have extremely rapid up-down movements which would have been very dramatic altitude changes.  The light also appeared and disappeared several times over at least an hour&#39;s time.  There were thunderstorms FAR in that direction that made it unlikely to be a star and the light&#39;s being low on the horizon made it clear that it was moving as I could see stationary lights on channel markers nearby.  The light was at least as far away as Cedar key. NO known aircraft could change altitude like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 1hr ago i got dropped off near my house by a friend, it was quite dark and so it was quite easy to notice this red flickering ball in the sky. I wondered if it might be a UFO but kinda just kept walking to my house. Then about 30 seconds into my walk i saw several people stood out in their garden and heard them say &#34;here comes some more, they are quite evenly spaced out&#34; or something like that. I looked over my shoulder and sure enough there was a pair of them coming over into sight. Same characteristics as the first, totally silent and flickering red/orange. I called my friend up who had just dropped me off and told him to look into the sky, he too saw them! a couple of mins later, after the pair of UFO&#39;s had gone from my sight, 2 more came strolling over the horizon exactly the same, just ambling along in no particular rush. They kept coming mins apart, then finally one on its own. I wasn&#39;t counting but i must have seen about 10 in total, and judging by the crowd of people in the garden there was more before that!  I still can&#39;t believe what i just saw and am looking out of the window every 2 mins to look for more but i think they have gone to expose themselves to other people now<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The light at arms length was the size of a pin head. It was brighter then Venus and you could see two lights together with the naked eye. The light was stationary and did not move for twenty minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I observed the lights with my 10-50 binoculars it was reflecting light form the sun and was a golden diamond shape translucent with three lights internally you could see structure three parts the right and left were beveled outwards into the middle and the bottom was beveled to the middle making a straight line below the other two compartments. As the sun set the object glowed white with three separately lit compartments it would glow brighter and then weaken several times. The Diamond shape was more defined as it grew darker. The object disappeared around 7:43PM and the clouds moved in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnesses #2 Costilla NM   On Saturday evening 9/22/07 at 7pm. My girlfriend and I were on our way to her moms B-day party and she noticed a bright light in the southern sky, just south of the rising moon to the east. I told her to pull over cause it just wasn&#39;t moving at all or blinking, and it was too bright and large to be a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Specially do to the fact that it was still day light out, and she preceded to take three pictures of it. It was an easy shot for the camera do to the exposure light available.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went on to the party and once we arrived we just kept watching this still light, but this time with her mom and her step dad, brother, brother girl friend, and last to arrive was my friend and his two boys from San Diego CA. He the fire chief there for 12 fire districts in the down town area of the city. He&#39;s about as creditable as most, and by time time he arrived we had found the binoculars and now were looking at the details of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My self a professional artist, got a sketch pad and started drawing the shape of this thing, kind of smooched diamond -top to bottom, the bottom half being more of a warmer golden light, shimmering sparkles at those bottom edges(see illustration)The top half was clearly two large bright white lights side by side like eyes, almond shape to be exact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 40 mins. of watching it clearly, some clouds moved in and the object slowly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also it was my opinion that the object become Even more transparent as before the later it got, as though the sun had some effect with it. I could increasingly see more sky through it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/22/07 19:15|San Pablo|CO|Diamond|30 min|Incredibly pure white, bright light, hanging motionless, low in s sky just after sunset Sept. 22. ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter?

This bright object appeared to be due south at about 12-15 degrees above the horizon.  The bright object was bigger and brighter than any planet I’ve ever scene.  It was 3 to 4 times bigger than Venus and incredibly bright.  I convinced myself it was a plane coming directly toward us, just high enough to be reflecting the bright light of sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this pure white, bright circle of light grew slightly in circumference and brightness, I thought this must be one huge plane and it’s getting really close, I almost wanted to duck down but there never were any plane sounds.  Without binoculars, all I had to help aid in viewing was prescription sunglasses.  I got in the car to get my glasses and when I stood up again the bright object seemed to be back where I first saw it.  I’m guessing that would have been south of Taos, NM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> O.K. that was odd, but the real shocker came when I put on my prescription sunglasses – the brightness was dimmed and I could see 3 distinct yellowish/gold lights - the one middle front light being slightly bigger than the 2 side lights.  There seemed to be some energy or filament connecting or flowing between the center light and the side lights.  I thought, “That ain’t right,” and pulled the sunglasses off my face and there I saw the pure white, bright light again.  What?  How can this be?  I kept taking my sunglasses off and putting them back on again trying to reconcile the two different things I was seeing - a round pure white and very bright light without my sunglasses and with them on seeing 3 separate yellow/gold lights with something blurry between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the moment, I convinced myself this was Jupiter and a couple of moons and accounted for the blurriness by remembering I was looking through sunglasses not binoculars, and of course the reflecting light of sunset must be causing the brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood in amazement and watched the big waxing gibbous moon move along the path of the ecliptic in the southeast while our bright object appeared motionless in the south until our view was obstructed by clouds at approx. 7:45pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since Sat. Sept. 22nd I’ve researched star charts and found that this bright light could not possibly have been Jupiter, as that planet was in the SSW, on the ecliptic at 26 degrees during the time our object was sighted due south at approx. 12 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter?

It was early enough in the day, somewhere between 1700 and 1800 hours that I didn’t think it was a star.  There were no other stars visible at the time.  I thought at first that it might be a planet, aircraft, or a weather balloon.  The wind was blowing on the ground, perhaps at 10 to 20 miles per hour but I did not see the object moving in the direction of the wind. At first glance it appeared to be stationary with the moon as the reference point.  Over the course of 20 to 30 minutes (estimate) the object appeared to move from above and to the right of the moon to above and to the left of the moon.  The moon and object were in the southwest sky over La Mesilla NM 87532.  In the pictures and video I took, the branch that sticks out furthest from the cottonwood tree in the right of the picture is approx 6.5 meters from the ground. The picture was taken from approx 19.1 meters NE of the spot directly under that branch.  In other words, the camera was pointed slightly up and to the SW.  The pictures were taken with a hand-held Kodak EasyShare 433c digital camera.  The object never made any sound, and never changed color, shape, or brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter?  PD))<n>

It was between 3 and 4 in the afternoon. I was looking up at the eastern side of the notch at the mountain peaks when I noticed a craft flying horizontally just above the peaks. It seemed to me to be a cylindrical flat craft. Cigar shaped may best describe its appearance. it was slightly smaller than a passenger plane, it was white in color but did not gleam or shine in the bright sunlight. At first it looked like a plane but I noticed that it was flying very slow. It was very far away and very high above the mountains, I could not make a guess at the exact distances. when I realized its peculiar slow movement I pointed it out to my boyfriend. He acknowledged it and assured me it was just a plane. It did not however visibly have wings or a tail and did not make any sound.  just as it was about to &#34;fly&#34; behind a right mountain peak it abruptly made a 180 degree turn into the opposite direction and it seemed to speed up and abruptly turned in the opposite direction again heading in the original direction and &#34;flew&#34; behind the mountain peaks out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 21 year old University student residing in Northern Central New Hampshire. I have an associates degree in Early Childhood and I am persuing my bachelors in Early childhood with a minor in sociology. I am a full time student with a part time job. I do not do drugs and I was not drinking or effected by alcohol at the time of the sighting. I have never before witnessed an Unidentified Flying Object but I thought that this was a peculiar movement of a typical aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was a plane or helicopter hovering very low but then I realized it was definitely something else.  The skies were clear except for a few clouds passing by and there was relatively no wind. The object was extremely bright, brighter than the North Star and its size didn’t compare to a star. It was like 20 stars put together or more. It hovered very low below the clouds and moved left to right very slowly. Even when the clouds passed by, you could still see it shining through. The light would constantly turn off and on and at times it wasn’t visible for about 30 seconds. The shape of the object was like a star that is flattened out and its color was a bright yellow/orange. There are not any military bases near by or radio towers of such, just mountains and open fields.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/22/07 04:00|Martin|GA|Other|2-2 1/2 hours|UFO sighting in Georgia, at a lake, 3 of us saw it, early in the morning, 1 big object and other star like objects moving in the sky|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60705.html|118|ndxe200709| UFO sighting in Georgia, at a lake, 3 of us saw it, early in the morning, 1 big object and other star like objects moving in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday morning September, 22 I think. I looked at my cell phone and I think that was the date I saw. There was a main, large UFO that was  just above the tree line across the lake we were on. Three of us were on the dock of my friend&#39;s parents lake house. We were drinking alchohol but we were winding down and quietly chattering under the cover of my friend&#39;s dock. I noticed an object out of the corner of my eye reflecting across the lake almost like how the moon does. This was not the moon. It was seemingly hovering, almost bouncing very quickly, so quickly it was kind of blurry. But while it was bouncing the object was moving from left to right and up and down but staying around the same spot. It was a round bright blue ball of light. It did not make a sound. Later on it changed colors,we all agreed on that. It turned a lighter bright and not so blueish but more white, but at the top it looked kind of green.I could see the stars in the background and that was how we determined it was moving. There was no air traffic that we could see. No airplanes. The whole lake, as far as we could tell, was out. It was dark everywhere and there was not a light on anywhere. It was cold. We sat and watched it for a long time. After a while we began to see other objects in the sky moving around and then stopping. They looked like stars. As the main object started to slowly shift little by little higher up in the sky these small star looking things moved with it. It would move then stop then on of them would move then stop then the one below it would move then stop. We also saw these object moving sideways across the sky it got brighter to bright then it dimmed to out of sight completely. My friend says he saw something I must of missed. He says he saw something that looked like a star, I think, drop out of the ball of light and move across the sky. The other person who was with us was a friend of my friend and she saw everything we did. She pointed out the smaller objects mov! ing in p attern ever so slightly with the big ball of light. The UFO moved around but stayed above the treeline until after about an hour then started to shift upward with the smaller objects. It seemed like what ever this was, was trying to make anyone who might be watching them think they were stars, I guess, moving with the rotation of the earth. But I saw the stars in the background while this thing moved around side to side, up and down, and bouncing so fast it was blurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are only so many things you typically see in the sky at night which is the moon, the stars, shooting stars, which we saw earlier, airplanes(military or not), and helicopters. This didn&#39;t make a sound, but it was clearly moving as far as we could tell. One of my friends are licensed to work on planes and they viamently agree with me about what we saw. Even more so. It was absolutely unidentifiable and in the sky. We watched it along with the 2 smaller star like objects go up into the sky slowly and then slow down to a stop. Completely still. We also started seeing airplanes blinking red and white in the sky. We started seeing the planes between 5 and 5:30 a.m. We went inside the house to sleep around 6:15. By this time we very cold,tired,hungry and got sick of watching it. In retrospect I guess we should of tried to keep watching but we were bored with it. All the factors I mentioned attributed to us going in. In all this time we didn&#39;t leave the dock to go wake anybody in the house up until we went in to sleep and we didn&#39;t attempt to photograph at all. We just watched. I stopped drinking when I first saw it, I can&#39;t remember if they did or not. I haven&#39;t seen a point in reporting until now. I feel kind of obligated to report it. My sighting has made me a believer. I didn&#39;t and don&#39;t think anyone would believe us because we were drinking. But it was a sobering sight. I can&#39;t speak for my friends. But we all do agree that we saw something very unusual and it wasn&#39;t an airplane or a helicopter or like anything any of us has ever seen.I have not told them I&#39;ve made this report but I&#39;m going to tell my friend next time I talk to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After watching the light for a few min (2-3 min) it began to move abnormaly up, down side to side forward and back very fast! Then it headed off into the distance faster than i have ever seen anything move and lit up the clouds in front of it. About 30 sec later it came back from the same place it went to.  It repeated the same thing for about an hour before disapearing for about 15 min. So i looked around in other places in the sky for the object and saw 3 more lights, not as close as the other one moving irraticly as well. After watching the other one for a while the big one that was really close came back and that&#39;s when i went to get my parents as they had just woken up and they saw it as well. I don&#39;t know what to think but they weren&#39;t back the next night so i&#39;am glad some one else saw them too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/22/07 03:15|Lawton|MI|Changing|2.5 Hours|This is not the first sighting over Bankson Lake Lawton Michigan.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59023.html|120|ndxe200709| This is not the first sighting over Bankson Lake Lawton Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday morning 22nd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m getting ready to go in for the night and I notice my shadow and I turn my head to see where the lights coming from.. Thought to myself, &#34;That&#39;s an awfully bright star I don&#39;t remember seeing one that bright before.&#34; So I watch it a little bit and then it begins to move south away from the lake.. By that time I knew it wasn&#39;t a star obviously so I flash my light at it. As soon as I did that it did a complete 180 and was coming my way, I said, &#34;Oh Sh*t&#34; what have I just done! It&#39;s approach was rather rapid and as it got close to me and I knew it wasn&#39;t going to stop  until it reached me I got spooked and took six steps back. By the six step the object stopped..  It stooped as if it knew I didn&#39;t want it any closer.  It was directly in front of me. During this time I noted two airlines flying way above  the object and to me that confirmed this was something rather unique.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft had no sound to it the only things heard were the sounds of crickets and me saying, &#34;what in the F is this thing!&#34;  The object was a greenish yellow color like I have never seen before. coming form the bottom were at times two to four beams of light that only went to a certain distance and stopped.  At times these beams would rotate. One time they connected and the craft looked like a diamond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved out to the end of the dock to get a better look and as I did that the craft moved back keeping the same distance it had when I saw it from the beach area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I like that, a UFO that knows it&#39;s boundaries. Kind of cool huh? :)  After I got tired of looking at this from the dock. I moved to an area next door to me..  As I did that, with in  10 to 15 seconds the craft moved with me and was once again directly in front of me keeping that same distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I thought I&#39;d try something. When a cloud went under it I would move again..  After the cloud past over the UFO came over to me again. Keeping that same distance.   The distance was just over cloud level.  One time a cloud went under it and I moved and it shout out from the cloud. This thing was just wild.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point the craft shot out this green beam of light that came down. half way between it self and the water. I took note that the beam of light did not reflect off the water. The light stayed for five seconds and then traveled back up to the craft. Interestingly enough after the beam travel back up to the craft it left a kind of  mist or residue I don&#39;t know what you would call it but it disappeared within seconds. This residue I speak of I just remebered it..  Also I will admit I did feel slightly sick to my stomach that day.  That&#39;s just something I took note of.. Could be nothing but maybe something.. Sick to my stomach as if I had a mild flue or you could I felt woozy or something..<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event lasted between 2.5 hours. It was daylight before it actually left.. It left after I had, had enough I guess.. I went and hid behind my neighbors house for a minute or two and when I came back it was gone.. It was like the craft was watching me as I was watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have video and pictures of the craft. I&#39;m sending you three of the pictures.. I&#39;d like to know you think of the pictures. I want to try and enhance the others before I send anymore.. I also took video. This video seems like classic UFO footage..What I mean by that is while recording, the image in the LCD screen looks different then what I was actually seeing.. It&#39;s fuzzy or blurry I guess and it does have like a kind of black outlineing around the object.. These green beams I speak of aren&#39;t vissible in the video but they are in the pictures at times that I am glad for. I&#39;m glad those beams are vissible in the pictures..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have NEVER seen anything like this and it went for 2.5 hours. It was simply amaing.  The lights it gave off I have never seen colors like that.. It was just incredible.. The video&#39;s the pictures, they don&#39;t give credit to what was seen.. But it does give a pretty good idea of it.. As they say seeing is believing...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upon noticing the object facing north moved at first very slowly, and then with a almost radiant burst, the green tint faded into an almost brilliant orange. Upon this the object moved at an astounding speed and a small faint noise was heard. The object then proceeded to head South-east and then vanished from line a sight due to the speed and velocity in which it traveled.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live in Santa Ana, California, but the object was southwest from my position, into the Costa Mesa area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only visible part of the object was a solid bright bluish ring. A storm was approaching in the distance and it was slightly windy, so at first I thought it might be something floating in the wind. It&#39;s movement was very fluid, but still fairly erratic. The movement pattern almost looked like a plastic bag caught in an updraft of air. But, it wasn&#39;t very long before I realized that it was way too big to be something floating in the wind. It looked to be flying at a fairly low altitude, around the height that a helicopter might fly, but it&#39;s maneuverability was beyond anything I&#39;ve ever seen a helicopter do. It slowed to a hover, then dove in an arc and came back up a few times, both horizontally and vertically. The speed at which it could turn made me think it might be a radio controlled airplane, but I&#39;ve never seen one a big as this. It had no lights on it other than a blue/white ring on the bottom. When it tilted away from my perspective, the ring was not visible. Conversely, when it tilted towards my direction, the ring shined brightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to move around the area for a few minutes, and then dropped it&#39;s altitude to a point where I could no longer see it, and I lost sight of it after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother was also outside at the time, and also witnessed the object. But unfortunately, I was unable to get a picture or video of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The speed in which it left the area was far beyond anything my friend and I have ever experienced . I have never witnessed anything like this in my life.

9/21/07 20:25|Deer Park|OH|Triangle|about 10 minutes|Witnessed an object with hundreds of yellow bright lights that formed a triangle shape in Cincinnati.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58861.html|129|ndxe200709| Witnessed an object with hundreds of yellow bright lights that formed a triangle shape in Cincinnati.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving to a Convalescent home to visit my father and was accompanied in the car by my mother.  It was about 8:20 p.m. when I first saw an object lit with bright lights.  They were the kind of lights you would see on a Christmas tree but only one color which was a standard yellow.  I was traveling down Ridge Rd.  when I first saw this object in the form of a cross.  It looked to be hovering about 200 feet in the air and was quite visible.  At first I thought it was just a plane, but it did not move like one.  Then it started heading away from us toward Cross County highway.  It sped off somewhat rapidly but not very fast like in a supersonic mode.  I started to turn right onto Galbraith road to make it to my destination but was still trying to keep it in sight.  It looked very far away maybe 1000 yards and then I caught sight of it again to my left.  It must have been hovering in that area of neighborhood but then it reappeared about 300 yards away behind the Dillonvale shopping center.  It looked like it was hovering at the same height, about 150 to 200 feet or maybe higher.  Then something really strange happened.  It started coming towards us at the intersection of Galbraith and Plainfield roads right above Deer Park High School.  But this time it appeared in the form of a triangle.  It seemed like it changed its lighting pattern.  It kind of looked like a stealth fighter this time; the lights were the same but in the form of a triangle.  In back there seemed to be three propulsion type engines.  They emitted a flame but the object didn&#39;t make any noise I could hear.  I did have the windows rolled up though.  There was a policeman stopped with his lights flashing close to the area of Deer Park High School.  He was talking to a male who looked to be about the age of 15 or 16. I&#39;m pretty sure this police officer must have witnessed the object and so did some other people.  The back of the object seemed to be about 100 feet across.  I turned left onto Plainfield Rd.  to follow it a! nd get a better look.  That&#39;s when I saw the kid and the policeman.  The object then started to head away from us again and did a very sharp turn and that&#39;s when the three engines lit up.  That&#39;s when I lost sight of it.  It kind of reminded of the way a Stealth Fighter or bomber would appear but that kind of  jet would not be lit up in this fashion.  The whole experience was very strange.  It ended approximately 10 minutes after I first witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I heard screams &amp; looked outside my window to find out what the comotion was about. I saw no one. Seconds later my kids ran into my apartment screaming, &#34; Daddy, it&#39;s a UFO in the sky!&#34;. Being that I live near Wright Patterson Air Force base, I figured it must be some kind of military plane. I rushed to the porch balcony followed by my childeren. What I saw next, I could not believe. I live right along 75 south in between Dayton &amp; Cincinnati so I know for a fact I was looking Southeast. In the distant sky, among small engine aircrafts that normally fly in this area, I noticed what seemed to be 3 white dots followed by a red dot in a train type fashion moving through the night sky towards the South east. I would estimate the altitude as being than that of a low flying commercial plane. I tried to get a picture w/my cell phone but the lighting was terrible. Seconds later, the dots seemed as if they completely changed directions. Instead of moving away from me they were now moving towards my apartment balcony. After changing directions, whatever it was stopped &amp; hovered left to right. It was the weirdest movement I have ever seen any craft make. After hovering for a few seconds the dots turned into about 9 bright lights that together formed a triangle. Surrounding each individual bright light was a bright white outline of a triangle. The complete triangle turned at an angle then, like a firecraker exploded &amp; the bright dots inside the triangle burst into clusters &amp; then turned red! The red remnats then formed a huge semicircle in the sky.The aircraft towers in the area all turned red. Two airplanes that looked &amp; sounded like the military vehicles that usually frequent the area were observed passing shortly therafter. The night sky, which had been pretty active up until I saw the last of what I thought to be military vehicles, was now silent!  If this was some kind of prank, I wish someone would tell me!

It caught my eye because the lights were getting brighter, but as we stopped to look at a triangular object flying silently and low in the sky at dusk, we realized we were seeing the lights brighten as it showed it belly. It turned and the lights dimmed and at one point seemed like a horizontal line of lights. We were seeing it from the side or horizontal plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cluster of lights were very bright, about 6 sets of lights that looked like an array to me, but my husband’s better vision detected an outline and many lights that formed the array. It wasn’t in any hurry and seemed to glide above the clouds and took it’s time making its way south along the tree line. We lost sight of it so we jumped in our car trying to anticipate where it had gone.  Unfortunately, we were unable to locate it again and since then we’ve been scouring the internet trying to find others in our area of West Chester, Ohio who may have also seen it. I’m an office manager of 3.5 years for the Cincinnati Branch of an international company and my husband is a crew member of a predominant builder her in Cincinnati.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We knew we wouldn’t hear about it on the news as in such a free country as ours, we’re not allowed to be made aware of things like this en masse. But we know what we saw and we’ll continue evaluating the skies at night hoping to see the craft again.  Funny, that we stepped into a store today that was showing video footage and telling a news story that a similar craft was sighted recently in Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe next time I’ll have my video cam / digital camera with me to capture the proof.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear day with vary few mist of clouds . I was watching airplanes flying over  with vary high altitude where the plane makes a straight trace of clouds. There was lots of planes going passed , which is normal in this area because the airport is about 40miles away. One of the air planes happened to go through a mist of cloud ,[very light cloud].suddenly  a black circle object appeared above the  airplane and moved forward in my direction . Ware the airplane was moving from east to west . I was facing  south .  When the object  appeared  over the plane , moved forward about 3inches  and stopped  a second or two not moving  then  moved back south again slightly to west  and disappeared .  This happened while I was watching the kids playing outside and my 11 year old daughter sitting to my left and watching same plane at the same time. I asked my daughter “what is that” I did not tell her what I saw because I want to see if she saw the same thing and she answered “ yes what is that” ,she described it as the same thing I saw .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Very shocking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just after lunch, and my friend and I were were running late to class. We were the only ones in the courtyard. Just as we were walking, I looked up in the sky. The sky was fifty percent cloudy, but in a clear blue spot, I noticed a defined white saucer or cigar shaped object moving at a slow pace, almost as if it wasn’t moving at all. We knew immediately that it wasn’t a plane because it left no trail and it was moving much to slowly. Then, it started moving downwards diagonally very slowly. Then, it seemed to come to a stop and hovered for about ten seconds. It made an abrupt turn and started moving very quickly southbound, and within seconds it disappeared from our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We slowed down and the craft took off very quickly. It shot up very quickly upward and left no trace. It was like it disappeared and left no trace in the sky. There were no traffic and we parked on the side of the road for about 15 mins. A car stopped and we talked to them about what we seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While nothing has been reported here,  I&#39;m still not convinced that what I&#39;ve seen is of reason,  so I decided to post my sightings.  I am giving a summary of what has occured on 3 different occasions over the past 3 weeks,  with the latest incident being tonight.  Looking to the north (as the bird flies,  towards Allentown),  a light begins to rise above the tree line.  As the light rises, ever so slowly, it&#39;s brightness grows in intensity.  The light will begin to travel east, then, without reason, shift west at an exceptional rate of speed.  At this point the object will hover for about 1-2 minutes with a varied, pulsating level of brightness;  then without warning the object grows real bright and simply disappears.  For minutes I will stand searching the sky with no trace of there ever being anything there to begin with.  What makes these occurences more unusual is that after each sighting,  it has been accompanied with a &#34;shooting star&#34;.  As rare as it is for one to see a shooting star,  I find it odd that after each of the 3 sightings there was the presence of a steaking light across the sky in the direction of the sighting that one one would normally dismiss as a shooting star.  If anyone has seen anything of this nature in the area, please make a post.  It would be nice to know that my fiance and I aren&#39;t the only ones seeing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched it for a few seconds and grabbed my binoculars from inside the house and it was still there, moving horizontally but slowly for a few minutes, (approximately 3) it was about three inches long and about 1 inch thick viewing through my 7x35 glasses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had no sound, but seemed like it was a mile 1/2 or so away and may be 1000 ft higher than myself.  We are 5000 ft at our place. Then it just disappeared without moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a clear view of it, just a silver bar shape with no wings, rotors or tail., or any other markings.  It just instantly vanished in a clear blue sky.   Never saw anything like it, I called the local sheriff department they gave me phone numbers to report it to, they did the same thing, then they gave me a FAA number they did not know where I could call but suggested you on the internet.  So here it is? The sighting was at 9:30 AM on 9/21/07<n>

At first, I thought it was probably an airplane, but it did not appear to be moving. The object appeared MUCH bigger (at least 5 times) than any of the stars in the sky and VERY bright. I thought I could see a 2 blinking red lights on the bottom, but not sure.  I went back inside to get my binoculars but was unable to get better resolution through them.  I walked downstairs to the back yard and watched the object for another couple minutes.  The light seemed to fade slightly, as if a haze passed over and brightened again.  In about 30 seconds it was completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It&#39;s the only one I know of that keeps the outdoor pool open after Labor Day. Anyway, Tuesday morning (9/18/07) I first noticed what I thought was probably a red-eye flight coming in for a landing at O&#39;Hare. The thing is that it never banked and never circled. It was a very bright light -- too high to be a helicopter and too low to be a star -- that would go higher into the sky (I was facing East), straight up, or back a little lower. By 5:50 it started going higher and possibly a little to the South. I leave the pool at 6:20, and the sun hasn&#39;t fully risen. It did the same thing on Wednesday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t swim yesterday, but I did this morning (9/21) and decided that I should wear my contacts to try to get a better look at it. From what I could tell, I saw a faint outline, a chevron shape that resembled a turkey wishbone (but with a bigger center at the point) or even the Nike symbol if both points were the same length. I occasionally saw what seemed to be a &#34;jet stream,&#34; but it was broad and short. When the object was a little lower (between 5:30-5:45) it looked as if there was a bit of orange or red at the end, and the stream seemed to retract and then come out. When the object was higher I didn&#39;t notice the red and could only see a slight stream. There was no noise that I could tell, and I know it wasn&#39;t a plane because one of those did pass overhead, continuing forward with a rhythmic flashing light underneath. This was completely different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More than anything I&#39;d like to put my mind at rest. I&#39;d like to think that there&#39;s a logical explanation that O&#39;Hare Air Traffic Control would certainly be aware of. However, I know that it could be something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then a white light and a warm feeling came over me, and I was knocked to the ground and when I woke up I had several sore spots on my body and my anus hurt. The most puzzling thing would be that it was no longer early morning hours but more early afternoon. My location had changed and my clothes where tattered. I at first figured this could of been an accident by a veichle or possible mugging but much to my dismay my arms and legs had several various unrecogonizable burnt marks. This is very difficult for me to discuss.<n>

Suddenly out of nowhere we saw an object that was all silver and it had two wings in the front and two wings in the back. I would say that it was 1000 feet in the air. It hovered and then backed up went up and down with a very controlled pattern. Then my dad told me to get my mom to show her and right when we got outside it disappeared out of thin air.   We saw I about 4:13 p.m.  I’ve waited so long to file this report in hope what I saw will make since. This object was not far enough away for there to be any confusion about what I saw. To this day my father and I think about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After a minute I noticed a pair of lights appearing in the horizon just to my right above my detached garage on the east side of my house. It looked like a low flying plane with its landing lights on at first. I was expecting to hear the sound of a jet or prop engine of some sort but it never made a bit of noise. I was facing due east and it was moving west to slightly northwest overhead. A few seconds later I could tell the two lights were actually much further apart than an airplane and they were positioned at the front and back of whatever it was coming toward me. As it passed closer overhead I could faintly make out a dark shadow of a cigar shape behind the lights. The object then went out of view behind a large maple tree on the northeast corner of the house. I jumped down off the porch and ran to the north side of the house to try and catch sight of it again but it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood outside for several more minutes hoping to see it again before going inside and looking at the clock. It was 2:10 am so I must have seen it somewhere around 1:50 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were in 2 rows at first, then as they got above us, they slowed and separated into a &#34;V&#34; shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my Sister to run in the house after it started to make this low Humming noise, (Kind of like, a Choir) I didn&#39;t know what to do, so I ran back inside after I watched it continue to fly South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do believe it was some sort of UFO, because it was definitely not a Group of Airplanes.

The Object appeared to be circular with white lights in a circular pattern on the under side of the object. The white lights were not Continuous, but individual white lights. As the object flew from side to side I could see the bottom and top. The top had a red glow and appeared to blink. The object continued to fly at about 2,000ft altitude in this &#34;falling leaf&#34; motion. This flying pattern lasted about three to five minutes. The object then shot into the air to an altitude that I would estimate to be 4k - 6k ft in the air and shot (what I mean by shot is within a few seconds) across the sky over saddleback mountain and into riverside county, CA. We could see the object for another few minutes over the corona, ca area. We lost sight of the object at approximately 23:50 on 09/20/07.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We, at first, thought it was a small aircraft, but it was very close to the ground. The light showed that it was very maneuverable in its sporadic, three-dimensional movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unique to this light, however, was a beam of a lighter white going from the main light (let’s say craft) to the ground. The light could move independently from the movement of the craft itself, and it searched from the trees surrounding the field to about the middle of the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft continued these actions for about 15 minutes until it traveled to the tree line. The movements then switched to only a line parallel to our side of the field on the opposite side above the trees. The light remained on the ground for 1 more minute until the craft got brighter (as if its beam were shining at us). I and my friends got the distinct feeling that it has seen us seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, in the blink of an eye, it was gone. It did not go below the trees. It did not fly up to the sky.

9/20/07 20:00|Coos Bay|OR|Cigar|10 -13 minutes|The cigar shaped object, possibly hundreds of feet long, flew slowly along the Pacific coastline.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59230.html|152|ndxe200709| The cigar shaped object, possibly hundreds of feet long, flew slowly along the Pacific coastline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> October 12, 2007 Around the middle of September I sighted an unusual object in the western sky.  The reason for the untimely reporting is simply because I had no idea that there was even a place to report these things to.  It wasn’t until I encountered a second sighting of a completely different object (which I will put in a separate report) sometime during the first week of October that I started researching for a place to report.  Our local airport manager gave me phone number and web site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live about 700 or 800 yards from the Oregon coastline and the western sky is over the coastline and the Pacific Ocean in general.  Approximately 8 PM, I was standing on my front porch looking at the recently darkened sky when I noticed movement to the northwest which appeared, initially, aircraft like.  A white and a red light in the sky, moving, at first glance, typical aircraft.  As I looked closer I thought to myself, &#34;That’s sort of odd.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw didn’t really look like an airplane.  I thought possibly a blimp but I could hear none of the familiar noise that travels with the average blimp.  As the object moved slowly toward a more westerly position from my porch, my view became clearer and the object started looking nothing like an airplane or a blimp.  Looking due west from my front porch, I first sighted the object at approximately a 45 degree angle to my right in the northwest sky and seemed to be running parallel to the coastline.  Our local airport would be at approximately 35 degrees assuming due west was 90 degrees and zero was to the right.  Often time, jets leaving the airport take a similar flight path.  As the object reached its due west position, I could tell it was many times larger than any of the largest jets I’ve seen here or even the blimps that fly over the area fairly often.  It also now appeared to be further out than I originally thought.  The object continued in a southerly direction until it reached approximately 120 degrees (my left) where it started to angle slightly more eastward and also began to angle more upward into the sky.  Until this point, it had been traveling more or less horizontally along the coast.  It continued this upward path until it flew out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first sighted the object, all I could see was 2 lights, a very bright white light at the leading end and a less bright red light at the trailing end.  The white light did not appear to be particularly directional and seemed to create a soft glow or haze near the leading edge.  The red light was probably 30-40% dimmer but crisper with less haze factor.  As the object got to a more westerly position its shape became more apparent.  It looked to be tube like with the white light fairly centered on the leading end and the red light seeming to sit on the upper side of the trailing end.  Although we do get some thin to thick fog along the coastline, this night was clear and so fog was not the simple answer for why the upper and lower edges of the tube did not appear particularly crisp.  The crispness of the tube edges seemed to fade in and out slightly and if, indeed it was further out than it appeared, then thin, not quite visible fog could have been the reason for this.  The size of the object was kind of hard for me to tell but was quite large, maybe hundreds of feet long.  I would say that it was probably 8 to 12 times as long as it was thick.  The side clearly appeared to have the roundedness of a tube with the light that seemed to glow very dimly along the side from the leading end, almost highlighted like.  I thought possibly (?) reflected light from the town.  At no time did I ever hear any noise or sound come from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object reached its roughly due west position is when I called my wife out to see it.  She came out and caught the last 3 or 4 minutes as the object angled up and away from the coastline into the upper part of its path where it flew out of sight toward high, thin clouds.  It did not appear to reach the high clouds and seemed to just disappear 20 or 30 miles out to the south and east.  The entire time of my sighting was probably 10 to 13 minutes.  It flew quite slowly for the first 7 or 8 minutes and seemed to speed up some (to not quite as slow but not fast by any means) after its flight path changed upward and inland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

She was on the phone sitting in a recliner and glanced out our bedroom window and noticed an object hovering over the next door neighbors house.  She said it was shaped like a triangle.  It had 3 lights on the bottom, 1 red light in the middle and 2 white lights, 1 on each end.  There were 2 more white lights located half way up, 1 on each side of the triangle.  She did not see the top of the craft because the top of our bedroom window blocked the rest of the craft, so there could have been a light at the top. The craft was fairly stationary over the roof.  It did move in an up and down pattern and did this for 3 to 4 minutes.  It slowing started moving east and went behind some trees and disappeared.  She said it could have been as big as a car or bigger.  She could not tell what the color was but seemed to have a reflective finish.  Sunset was around 6:52 pm and she guesses this was around 7:15 pm so it was already est. 70% dark.  It wasn’t too dark as she could see the sky behind the craft.  The window was wide open and she did not hear any sound. At this time we do not know if any other neighbors observed this.  I will talk to the neighbors and see if anybody saw anything.  I will report if anyone else saw anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw two large aircraft in the air, one traveling northeast, and the other traveling southwest.  They were in my estimation at about 35,000 to 40,000 feet in altitude.  Both were leaving heavy con trails, illuminated by the setting sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a luminous dot at what I would estimate to be at least 1,000 feet in front of the aircraft which was traveling southwest.  At first I thought this was a star, but as I watched, I noticed that it maintained a fixed distance from the large aircraft, and tracked its position very accurately until both disappeared behind the tree line.  The luminous dot was slightly to the starboard side and in front of the large aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The early evening sky was an intense clear blue.  When I looked up, at first I thought I was observing Venus, as a steady bright looking planet appeared out of nowhere.  Soon there were several large bright looking &#34;stars&#34; slowly moving about in formation.  The first formation looked like a horoscope constellation and then they formed a square with three dots below.  I counted what appeared to be a total of eleven metallic gray crafts biding time playfully in the sky.  The bright light look just sort of changed to actual craft-disc appearance.  Two of the discs were actually doing flips like pancakes. One zipped toward the first main lighted disc(this disc never moved, the rest formed around it)  as though it were going to hit it, but quickly darted up at the last moment.  They appeared to be putting on a show for us.  We had the feeling they knew we were watching them.  We were frigtened and looked down to take the strain off our necks, when we looked up, they were all suddenly gathered right above our heads, all of them, way up and not moving.  We scattered to our cars and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They proclaimed the most astonishing thing was the silence and stillness of this object. They did not describe any particular lights, only that the whole object was illuminated, glowing a kind of orange. As the object moved from above the tower it traveled northeast and left what they described as a “jet stream”. They did not hear any engine sounds. After it left their sight my son said our cattle started “going wild” and as the object moved toward the northeast coyotes began shrieking. My son immediately called his sister who has always believed in extraterre..strial life. My son and his friends are not imaginative or overly dramatic. They wanted to report this sighting immediately but did not know to whom. They were most amazed by the silence and the stillness of the large object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

At about 1:30 AM we observed what at first we thought to be a commercial airliner passing over in the sky when all of a sudden it seemed to slow down and then just shot off at lightspeed. I personally didn&#39;t get the greatest look because I was viewing out of the windshield of my friends van which has a significant amout of tinting on it. Also, there was a street light in the path of my view. despite all this, I had a clear enough view to know what I saw, there is nothing of this earth that I know of can fly at that rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Each time the lites had gone off. Then the craft had moved rapidly to the north west before the lites would appear again. This happened at approx. 9:40pm it was dark and the lites though very far away to me, seemed incredably large like the size of dinner plates. I called my boyfriend out to see this and we watched the sky for about 10 min. It finally appeared one more time, farther away and higher it seems and the lites did the same sequence of events. Only this time it was moving south east in the sky when it disapeared for good. We both noticed two jets heading directly into the space where we had seen the craft last the one jet flew through the space and the other just seemed to vanish. Last year at about this same time and date my sister and I witnessed this exact same thing right here by our farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Around 8:30pm we had our dinner and then layed back in our folding chairs and just admired the scenery(it was a clear night and the sky was full of stars).It was about this time while we were talking that my friend almost jumped out of his chair and said&#34; what the heck was that?&#34; I turned around and did&#39;nt see anything.I asked him what it was he saw and he told me that he saw a pulsating light beyond the trees. I knew he saw something because he&#39;s never reacted that way before. About a minute or two later, for no reason at all i turned around and looked at a clearing through the pine trees and looked up. There was a bright light up in the sky and a dimmer light underneath it. It was over tree top level. Maybe 100ft to 175ft high. Just as i saw the lights they both started to go dim until they just went out completely. I could see a black form moving very slow above trees but couldn&#39;t make it out due to so many trees in the way. It made absolutely no noise what so ever. About a minute later we heard what at first was the sound of a plane, but as the sound came closer it was definately a helecopter. I told my friend that i&#39;ll bet him the helecopter was following that object in the sky. Sure enough it flew right above us and towards the same direction as the flying object went. We both just stared as each other and i said to him if this really happen? Nevertheless after this experience, we went to sleep for the night. I hate to admit it, but i was a little nervous that night because i figured that the flying object would come back later that night.....to my knowldge it didn&#39;t....P.S.The day before this happened we were invited to a camp fire get together and i over heard the camp host that he had seen a ufo all lite up the night before......posssibly what we saw......can you keep me posted if anyone else has seen anything peculiar at hawley lake? thanks..! ........<n> <n><n> <n><n> .<n>

I then looked up at the sky, I was facing east. I saw traveling from North to South what seemed to be 2 pretty big pinkish red round &#34; lights&#34;  traveling. One was in front and the second one seemed to be following the first one. The second object was behind and to the right of the lead object. The were too low to be airplanes and made no sound at all. I clearly saw the two objects long enough to see that they were not everyday craft. They seemed to be exactly the same size and seemed to travel at the exact same speed. They flew into or behind a cloud and I lost sight of them. I continued to look to see if I could find where they went but to no avail. About 2 minutes after I saw these pinkish red &#34;lights&#34; that seemed to come from the north, I heard and saw an airplane fly in the same direction but the airplane turned to the east too soon to follow the path that these objects had taken. The objects were flying down here in our atmosphere, I mean to say, that they were not high in the sky. They were lower than a small airplane would fly...........<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(She had previously told me of a story her and her sister had of some strange lights in the sky about a year prior).  She yelled downstair&#39;s to me to come and see what she had described to me as to what her and her sister had seen.  I ran outside with her only to see nothing.  She said it was right over our barn.  I was not skeptical of her because i do believe there is life out there, i just wished i could see for myself  a U.F.O.  So I stared at the sky for about 10 minutes, then all of a sudden a huge orange light followed by four more consecutive lights appeared due West of our farm.  When the fifth one came on they all shut off and as soon as they all shut off they started again only maybe two ship lengths ahead. (I am calculating ship length by the length of the five lights together).  At the end of the second array of lights I observed two individual lights (at what i will call the front and back of the craft).  I observed these lights for about half an hour.  In that time they turned color,(from red and back to a dull white to disappearing altogether. At one point it appeared to shoot out a wide angle light on it&#39;s southern pointed light).  At this point now i had started to notice several airplanes.  It is uncommon for me to see this kind of commercial traffic.  Two in particular were a pair of blinking lights coming out of the south.  One was following the other in a very close proximity.  There were no green or red lights, only a single blinking white light on what i think were two fighter planes flying in formation.  They were flying in a north westernly direction and soon turned due west.  I don&#39;t know if one turned his lights off but the one in the rear over took the one in front and it became only one light.  I watched that light fly right under the &#34;two lights&#34; that i thought were a craft and kept on going till it was out of sight.  I also observed several satellites which is also uncommon.  I am an intelligent person and am aware of! all mil itary and commercial aircraft.  I do not make rash decisions and I think before I speak.  I am not saying that this craft was from outerspace,  what i am saying is that if this craft was human made it would be as long as roughly 15 747&#39;s and equally as wide. This was unlike anything i have ever seen.  It was not a commercial airline or strange gasses in the sky,  these were five lights that came on and then went off and moved without sound.  The airplanes observed made sound, this did not.  I know what I saw and i would laugh at the governmen if they said it was a weather balloon!!!!<n>

Flew straight course but made partial spines on its axis left and right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our Power was out do to late payment that night ( 9-18-07, 11:25 PST ). I was alone in the back patio, reclining in a chair listening to my headphones and enjoying the cool night air, there was not much else to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I will tell you that I am very familiar with the night sky and can tell the difference between planets, stars satellites and different aircraft. I have been through Private pilot and Civil Air Patrol ground schools and have had over 60 or so flight hours in private pilot training, and familiar with what lights aircraft should and are required to be equipped with and what each lights function and meaning are etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of my sighting the sky was clear and I was sitting back looking up at the stars while enjoying my radio station. I was facing up and out to the east.  I noticed some movement in the corner of my left eye, I faced that way and saw what looked like and moved like 4 bright white satellites moving in perfect formation across the sky at a speed a little faster than satellites move across the sky. The formation was that of a perfect triangle with the fourth light dead center. All the lights (3 points and 1 center) were identical in size, color ( white with slightest hint of blue) and brightness. And all about 50% brighter than the brightest stars out that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I have no way of knowing the actual size of the craft as there was nothing to reference it off of, I cant make an estimate on the altitude or speed. But I got the since it was pretty high and cruzing at a good speed, If I put my hand up to the sky the object would be equivalent in length as the width of 1 1/2 fingers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had only these lights and they stayed solid. No red/green wing tip position lights, anti collision or any other for that matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved in a straight line to the south east crossing my view of the sky at an angle. I was very confused as to what it could be, I took out my headphones ( volume was not high so I had no ringing in ears from radio station) and listened for sounds of engines which I should have been able to hear if it was a passenger jet, Prop plane or rotocraft at their perspective heights based on the size of the object as it appeared, but heard nothing, this is also a very quiet neighborhood especially at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still figured for a moment that just maybe, it could be a newly deployed satellite. I have seen on the NASA channel where a satellite would be deployed by being released in a case where the case comes apart and the parts drift apart leaving the satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I was convinced it was not some kind of conventional aircraft or space junk moving in formation when after about 15 to 20 seconds the craft rotated approximate 90 degrees to the right on its axis ( the center light ) it took about 3-4 seconds to make this smooth rotation. At that point it stopped rotating and was still flying in the exact same line of travel and speed but now sideways. (it was pointy side forward to begin with) Facing almost south west but traveling on to the south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued on for about 10 seconds in this configuration then just like it did before it now rotated on its axis left back to its original configuration now facing its line of travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was really excited to see this because I knew for sure it was not any satellite(S) or aircraft I have ever seen. I was thinking this is either some out of this world craft (cool) or something brand new that we had (also cool), and if it is something we have It has to be using some new kind of propulsion to be able to rotate and fly sideways so smoothly like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued on to the south east until it was out of site. Both of the crafts rotations were the same speed (about 3-4 seconds) and smooth, never seeming to have an effect on its straight line of travel or speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best I can compare it to would be a tank moving down the highway and the turret being able to swivel left and right without effecting the speed or course of the vehicle. Only what I saw was what appeared to be an entire aircraft do the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my aircraft (flight schools aircraft I use for training) I can do what is called a crab which is where you give full left or right rudder and opposite aileron to put the aircraft in a slightly sideways configuration, but only about 10-20 degrees or so and at the expense of speed, it creates major drag and is used sometimes to drastically slow the aircraft, usually for a landing where you may be coming in a little high and or fast, it allows you to loose some altitude and speed quickly by using the body of the aircraft it self to create a lot of drag.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know of no aircraft that can put itself in a sideways configuration from forward movement at high speed without breaking apart, moving off course, loosing speed etc. Some aircraft can hover and fly sideways at very slow speeds and some rotocraft but not at high speeds in the hundreds of miles per hour or faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the amount of space the craft took up which was not a lot, like I said about 1 and a half finger width  and limited number of stars out at night in our sky around here (near by city lights drown out all but the brighter stars) I did not get a chance to see it cross over a stationary star to see if it would block it out, I did watch for that but it did not cross any stars in its line of flight from my point of view. This may have helped rule out separate objects doing formation ( very impressive Formation ) flying but I really got the since it was a single solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the lights on the craft all maintained their brightness during the entire sighting across the sky. Satellites I see will usually blink or fade, these lights did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know for sure what I saw that night but It was diffidently making deliberate movements making me believe it was controlled by something or someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also for reference the crafts line of travel was south east with the line taking it over or just slightly north of BFL Meadows Field, rather than right over the city of Bakersfield. If anything it would have skirted the area of Bakersfield on its northern edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have included a picture I made on a paint program showing the crafts appearance, line of travel and movements. What I actually seen looked a bit more distant than it appears in the picture. Consider it a somewhat zoomed in look at exactly what I had seen. Also the positions in the sky where the craft changed its configuration was much more distant from each other than what you see in the picture, it was about 10 seconds between the left and right rotations and the craft was seen for a total of about 50 seconds to 1 minute which covered the entire line of sight of sky I could see which was quite a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 20/16 vision, seen object on clear cool night with eyes outside, not through any mediums like screen, window, glasses etc.<n>

They appeared larger than a star or satellite, but (reflective ?)brightness of about half of the surrounding average stars. They appeared to be very high elevation, and faster than any  manned aircraft I have ever observed. Speed estimate would be slower than a meteor, and much faster than a satellite when viewed from Earth and moving about 5 degrees apart at exact speed and direction, one following the other. They crossed the sky  about 25 degrees above the North horizon to about 25-30 degrees from reaching the Southern Horizon and duration of abount 15-20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curiously enough, I was again outside at  aproximately 8:40 pm on Monday 9/17. I did not see the same objects, instead only a single. Appearing larger, (about 3/4 thumbnail at arm length) and a triangular in exact symmetry. Coloration was dim, but reddish hue possibly from reflection ,against the early twilight blue. This object appeared to follow the exact previous North to South path , but may have been considerably larger or lower in Altitude. The triangular object speed was nearly 2-3 times faster than the previous, with the duration of about 7-10 seconds to cross the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither obsevations included atmoshereic disturbances, contrails, or sound activity. Elevation, I believe was low orbit, maybe several miles above commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried but did not observe anything other than normal aircraft/satellite activity on 9/18 from 8:35 pm until 9:00 pm. Probably the object you saw was a few minutes earlier than what I was prepared for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would really be interested in seeing an image on the website, or maybe a link to it if possible. Tonight will be cloudy, so observing will be limited for this area.... Just wanted ask, if you know, since this is a repeating occurance, can it be referenced with airport radar?   ** amateur astonomer- cleaning telescope this is e-mail copy i sent to local weather correspondent, after hearing that he broadcast a photo on Monday&#39;s daytime weather report.

The explosion was at least 5 to 10 seconds in durration and I thought a jet aircraft had crashed on the hill above my home. When I ran out the front door and looked towards the source of the sound, there was an erie bluish green glow that I could see towards the top of the hill through the old growth doug firs.  It was rather like a neon sign at first and quicly dissapated to nothing in a matter of seconds. No one on my street came out of thier homes and I did not hear any emergency vehicles afterwards.

I thought to myself, cool a shooting star, except when it came into view in front of my windshield, it had no tail. Just a glowing sphere like object with no sound. I thought for something to be moving that fast it would have a loud sonic boom. It was traveling north at an extreme rate of speed. Probably well over 1000 mph, and then it went over the horizon. This lasted no more than one second. I thought to myself there is no way I just saw what I think I saw, maybe it was an just an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was within a half of a mile of the airport, so I drove by it to see if there was a plane on the runway. When I got there, I remembered that McCollum Field or Cobb County Airport only has one runway running East and West, no North and South runway. I pulled up the airports’ website and they are not even opened from midnight though six in the morning. I have seen hundreds of shooting stars before and I know what they look like. My house is across the street from the airport, so I have a good idea of what comes in and out of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never believed in UFO’s or sophisticated intelligent life outside of Earth, but whatever I saw tonight was definitely not from around here. I have no idea what I saw but at age 20, I probably will not be going outside at night by myself for a long time and I will never sleep with my window open ever again. My description is that I am 20 years old, male, a junior at Kennesaw State University with a 3.4 GPA and currently a finance major. I enjoy hunting, fishing, trapshooting, and I spend the majority of my summers on the lake, I am a very outdoors person.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This time i watched ca. 6 UFO&#39;s zooming around in the clear night sky. I don&#39;t think they were any kind of human transportation, as they were zooming around the sky at extreme speed, probably 10 times as fast as any human transportation. i stood by the window and watched them for, ca. 20 minutes. in the last 2 minutes, the UFO&#39;s started disappearing in front my eyes, until they were all gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason i think they were UFO&#39;s, is because of the way they moved, going up, stopping in a fraction of a second, then going straight down. They were making all kinds of strange movements, always at extremely high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could only see them as small lights in the sky. they not were blinking steadily like a commercial air plane, it was solid light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Sighting approx. 3 minutes; return path 1 1/2 hr. later<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Monday, 17 Sept, 2007, myself, my husband, and two of our out of state {W. VA} friends were at our pond on our property in Southwest Virginia, bordering Hawkins County, TN. We had fished for a couple of hours, then built a fire, had some supper, and eventually gathered the lawn chairs around the fire and played music. The other three were all picking various acoustic instruments, while I sat back listening, watching the sky occasionally, and enjoying the music for an hour or so. I stretched out, and just looked over my left shoulder while flexing my neck muscles. A bright yellow orange light caught my eye, coming from the north over Clinch Mt., and moving in an easterly direction. I immediately sat up, turning toward it. It was stationary at first, then moved forward slowly, hovered, and then moved back again to its original position. I knew then it was not a plane. I grabbed my husbands knee, as he was picking a banjo, and pointed to the object. He looked and stopped playing immediately after watching for just a couple of seconds. He then told our friends, who were sitting with their backs to the object, to &#34;stop now, and get a look at this&#34;. It was that quickly apparent that this was out of the ordinary. The time was approximately 23:15, on a clear night, no clouds, and no background lights, as we live in the country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this light go in a controlled yet occasionally erratic pattern for about three minutes. At one point, it went from a 1 or 2 o&#39;clock position, to a 7 o&#39;clock position, then back. It would hover, then go forward slowly, deliberately, and had occasional almost jerking movements back to its previous hovering point, then jumping ahead slightly, and then moving smoothly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a Nikon D50 with me, and a Hitachi digital dvd camera. Neither of them would work. They both had fully charged Li ion batteries. [I had both of these present, and fully charged, to record some of our annual get-together music]. I was very surprised about my digital SLR, as I quickly changed settings, wondering why it would not work, as I had taken several shots previous to this sighting. I tried to just fire the flash of the camera, to see if there would be a reaction of some sort from the object. The flash would not fire. I was torn between trying to figure this out, knowing I&#39;d be missing part of what this object was doing. I tried the the video cam...nothing. It would not record. I put them both down, deciding to just watch, while mentally cursing the manufacturers of what I thought was fairly good digital equipment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time, the object was halfway between Clinch Mt. and Pine Ridge. We continued watching its movement, fairly slow, deliberate, with occasional moments of hovering, until it could no longer be seen over Pine Ridge. No blinking lights were seen by three witnesses. The fourth thought he might have seen a blinking red light, but not at all times. There was absolutely no sound. The estimated time of sighting is three minutes. I knew something extraordinary had been seen, and we were all fascinated, not really knowing what to think, except that it was definitely not a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1 1/2 hours later, we were still around the campfire, still playing music. I was listenening, still watching the sky occasionally. The approximate time was 00:45. What I believe to be the same object came around again, this time from the south, traveling north. Easy to see, and still absolutely no sound, and definitely no blinking lights. Same bright yellow orange color. The movement this time was just as slow, though not as erratic. Short periods of hovering were observed intermittently, then a continuation of a fairly straight path. This second pass took about two to two and one half minutes to cover the area, where it disappeared over Clinch Mountain. We all agreed that this was the same object seen earlier. After this, we called it a night and came home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the event occurred, it seemed to me personally that I was seeing it, yet at the same time not really believing that this was something I could not explain. Just remarkable; I really can not find the perfect word. Totally amazing falls a bit short.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For informational purposes, about 5 minutes later, I picked up the Nikon to see if I could take a shot; it worked perfectly, still showing a full battery charge.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One night i went out for a walk and as i was walking i noticed that  a street light which was usually the only light to be found for a ways, had a second light floating above it, a single sort of vertical oval shaped light, maybe 5-6 feet above it, unmoving, a bright but hazy white/orange light, after watching it for about a minute i continued with my walk and shortly turned around and walked home and took notice that the light was still there.  The next day in bright sunshine i walked down to the streetlight to check it out and there was nothing above the streetlight or in the vicinity that would create any kind of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few weeks later i went out for another late night walk ( as was my fashion)  as upon returning my eye was drawn to the open access point of the lake my house was on, i had barely  stepped near it when i saw very clearly 3 fairly large horizontal oval lights, 2 white, one orangish/red, spaced about 3 feet away from each other hovering above my lake just above the tree line, i stopped out of curiosity trying to listen for the sound of a plane  but heard only a very soft, very low whooshing-like pulsing, i tried to think of any and all possible explanations besides the one i am reporting now, but i didn&#39;t live near any towers, tall buildings, power stations or water towers, i heard no sound of planes or helicopters and the lights weren&#39;t moving, and they were very clearly just above my lake which has no means of supporting any kind of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My immediate thought was &#34; go inside and get the camera&#34; but I was mesmerized by its strangeness and also a little afraid, and I worried that the lights might disappear by the time I came back to the spot. I watched the lights for about 5 minutes, and they never seemed to move, and as I watched the light farthest on the right which was white and the middle light which was orange/red changed, and now the far right was orange/red and the middle was white. I dont know why but i was suddenly frightened, thinking of all the silly movies id seen, and i felt like the lights were watching me as well, i grew rather anxious and decided to quickly walk home, as i was doing so i kept looking behind me back at the lights, at which point i realized they HAD been moving because they were now higher above the treetops then they had been before, they had just been moving too slowly for me to notice.  I reached home and firmly locked the door behind me and drew all the curtains to appease my own uneasiness. The next day I returned to the spot and saw no sign of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Then c slowly dimmed out then followed by, b and then a. Each dimming was about 5 seconds apart from each other. I and some other people have seen these lights during this year.

I was trying to look at it and pay attention to the road, but my mother said one of the lights was red as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It just hovered there with no sound. I wasn’t going to stop and look, so I kept driving and it stayed there while we were on the hill and going around the bend.  After that we couldn’t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked for it on the way home a few hours later, but there was nothing at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/17/07 19:17|Bodega Bay|CA|Cigar|15 minutes|Streaking object appears to stop and hover for several minutes|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58953.html|189|ndxe200709| Streaking object appears to stop and hover for several minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband, my brother, my sister-in-law and I were vacationing at a coastal house in Bodega Bay, CA (about two hours north of San Francisco).  We were watching the sun set over the ocean and preparing to watch the clear night sky, so we had big binoculars (16X70) set up on a tripod on the west-facing patio.  Moments after sunset (which occurred at 7:15 p.m., [see photo]), while the sky at the horizon was still orangey, we noticed a very bright orange/gold streak moving at a slightly upward angle in a north-to-south direction [see photos].  At arm’s length and measuring between thumb and forefinger, the streak early on was about an inch above the horizon.  We then looked at it through the binoculars and we saw not only the streak, but a dark, somewhat elongated object that was rounded at the leading edge of what we then called a “trail”. The object took up about 1/4 inch of the streak.  Over the next minute or so, the trail got to be about four inches long (as measured above).<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute or two after we first saw the trail, the object/trail appeared to stop and hover in place for another 10 minutes or so, but the trail did not dissipate at all like a vapor trail would.  (Since we were facing west, it&#39;s also possible the object was not hovering but rather moving west to east or east to west after it appeared to stop.) We could see the trail and the &#34;unmoving&#34; object for a total of 10 minutes or so until it got too dark to see through the binoculars.  The pictures we took do not even begin to show the brightness of the trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on the &#34;distance to horizon&#34; calculator on the Internet, we estimated the distance to the object was about 15.5 nautical or 17.9 statute miles.  (We did a Google Earth calculation that showed our rental house was 172 feet above sea level and, adding the five-foot height of the tripod, resulted in a &#34;height of eye&#34; of 177 feet.)  If the object was almost 18 miles away, the object would have to be quite large to appear as big as it did, even though it required binoculars to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our collective conclusion was that the object was too big to be any kind of airplane and that the trail was not a vapor trail.  The way the object appeared to stop and hover, and the fact that the trail did not dissipate, were also very strange.  Maybe it was some kind of missile, but we sure can’t figure it out.  None of us had ever seen such a thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We did not check our watch, but Venus was very visible and few other stars were showing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was about equal in brightness to Venus and did not appear to be moving. There was no visible trail, and we thought it was another bright planet.  It was approximately 45 degrees off of the horizon.  After observing the light for approximately 15 seconds, the light vanished and a white haze lingered in its location for less than a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location of the light was almost due north, as I noted the direction and compared it to the presence of the North Star and big dipper once they appeared.  We were located on a boat at the Channel Islands in Southern California.  Specifically, we were anchored at smugglers cove on the east end of Santa Cruz Island, and the light appeared above Santa Barbara.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thoughts were that it may be a satellite, but I have never seen a satellite that was that bright.  The white haze had me thinking that it was a missile or rocket launch from Vandenberg AFB, but my research so far shows no launches that evening.  I have seen missile launches before and have seen a haze after the rocket left the atmosphere, but this did not appear to be moving and there was no contrail.<n>

I walked into our family room while my wife was still in the kitchen.  A light flash brighter than anything I had ever seen and some sort of weird, different type of energy filled our home.  The origin seemed to be the south facing window.  Our baby, upstairs, was sleeping and immediately began to scream.  The left side of my face became mildly tingley and I was seeing spots.   My wife, who didn&#39;t have visible access to any south facing windonws, asked if I took a picture with a flash or something, and I informed her that I didn&#39;t.  We walked outside and nothing looked biazarre.  But, I still have a slight headache over 15 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searched the Internet and news stations for other witnesses but have yet to find any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

As I was leaving to town of Camino I saw a flashing light in the sky. At first I thought it was a plane because there is an airport close by. As I got closer I could see it was triangle shape with flashing white and red lights that would turn green. As I drove into Placerville it went behind a hill.  Then I saw it on the south side of the Hwy. while I was in the middle of Placerville. Both times I saw it, it did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 51 years old and retired.

At about 5:45am edt I was walking my dog.  It was a starry night, pitch black, except for street lights.  As I was approaching my house, about 200 feet away, I saw this &#34;whitest&#34; saucer-shaped &#34;thing&#34; silently glide VERY LOW over the roof of my house.  I have a pine tree in the back yard &amp; it looked like it was just above the top of the tree. NO SOUND, NO LIGHTS on it of any kind. &#34;Gliding&#34; much faster than a plane it was gone in a couple of seconds behind trees on my neighbor&#39;s property.  I am used to seeing planes over my property since I live near our local airport.  I always walk early in the mornings &amp; see many planes with their red, green &amp; white lights.  This was NOT a plane.  It was moving from the west to the east in a straight line and left no trail behind it.  The width of it seemed to be about the width of my roof but it probably was further south than it looked so it could have been larger.  Very little height - like I was seeing only the edge of a &#34;saucer&#34;. I could see it because it was a light color against the black sky.  I wanted to call the police &amp; ask it anyone else had reported it but was afarid they would laugh at me.  That is why I am contacting you to see if others have reported this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They stayed in one general area and I watched for a few minutes before going inside and locking the door!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second event, last night (September 17th) at approximately 12am, I witnessed three red blinking lights flying very quickly across the sky.  They were separated several miles apart from one another and all three had very rapid red blinking lights.  It appeared that they would shoot to the East, hover for a moment, drop and move in another direction.  I called my boyfriend outside and to witness this sighting and he laughed at me for being concerned!   Apparently, he has witnessed several sightings while camping with his family and is comfortable with the fact that &#34;there&#39;s always things flying around out there&#34;.   If they are curious and kind I see no reason to be afraid, but I have seen too many movies to not be fear the worst first!<n>

It started at about 30 degrees above the southern horizon and fell to about 5 degrees above the horizon where I lost view of it. I cried out,&#34;Oh!&#34; when I saw it and Yael got a glimpse of it as well. No sound was associated with the object. It did not appear to be a shooting star because it was moving too slowly so close to the horizon  It took place about 150 miles North of Los Angeles in the same general vicinity of where I saw a brilliant blue orb fall from the sky on July 28th. This event occured after I gave a talk to 70 people at Bay Area Mufon where I emphasized the what I believe is a consciousness link between UFO experiencers and the intelligence behing the phenomenon, presumably ET in nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On the way home, I looked up into the sky and say a strange formation of lights, or, perhaps it was one single object. I pulled over to the side of the road and got out. I observed the object for about four minuets. The object, or objects made no noise and were in the formation of a &#34;V&#34;. It had 7 orange/redish lights that formed the &#34;V&#34;. From what I could see, there was no electrical interference because my Blackberry still worked. The object moved slowly in a SSE direction. I did not watch it until it was out of sight, I was much too frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

But something else caught my eye. Naturaly, I couldn&#39;t see it because it was dark, but I saw 3 white lights in a line with a red light. the order was white, white, red, white, all in a line. The lights were glowing, unlike the triangular flashing lights of a plane. It either was staying still or moving very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom did notice it and asked if it was a plane. I knew it couldn&#39;t be a plane because everyone knows a plane has flashing lights, not glowing lights. Its also was not a communications tower like you would find in the mountains near Tracy. I dont have a photo or a video, all I know is, it was a UFO. If it wasn&#39;t, then what was it?<n>

A work associate and I were standing outside on the 3rd and top level of the Glendale Galleria North west parking structure talking. It was around dusk and I happen to be facing South-west when something in the distance caught my attention. I asked my friend to look at what seem to be 3 white circular objects in a triangular formation hovering above the hills/mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was it was a UFO, but for fear of being thought crazy, I asked him what he thought the 3 objects were. We continued to watch them hover when he said he thought they were some type of birds, but then all 3 started to move at the same time and speed upwards.  I remember telling him, those were not birds. That, birds did not fly that fast nor that high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch as these three white (not sure what to call these objects) UFO&#39;s as it flew further toward us yet higher. I remembered my camera in my purse and told my friend not to take his eyes off the UFO&#39;s so I would know where they were as it had grown dark. Yet, you could still see the white circle&#39;s that formed a triangle. I was able to take 2 pictures each time my friend having to point them out, so I would know where I had to aim my camera. When I tried to take a third, my camera wouldn&#39;t work. I was and am still excited that I have 2 photos.   The photo&#39;s clearly show the stars in the sky as well as a bright red circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for a few more seconds and then all of a sudden they were gone!<n>

As I was walking almost straight up I recounted objects but now tere were five--for sure there were six before--they were in a loose formation ---not very close to each other.

I was at my girlfriends house and I went outside on the balcony which is located to the west side of the house. My girlfriend is living on the 10th floor, so I have a fantastic view over the city. We had clear weather, no clouds, no fog or anything else. Visibility was around like 30 kilometers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching the sky into the west direction as I suddenly noticed one bright light in the sky, moving from west to east. The light had like an aura around. I was unable to determine how high this object was in the sky. Suddenly another light appeared to the left side of the first object and started getting brighter and brighter and it adjusted its speed by the first one. I noticed a pedestrian down on the street and I was yelling from the balcony at the person: Look at that ! Look at that up there in the sky! He looked up and saw the same as I saw. The objects now were moving together for approxematly 4 seconds as the second light suddenly made a sharp 90 degree left turn, speeded up and dimmed out. The first one was now nearly direct straight in the sky over me as it rapidly dimmed out and disappeared. At that moment I noticed that the signal from the radiostation I was listening to, interfered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also an aircraft (could be a 747, &#39;cause of the 4 streams ) in the sky during that sight high above around 36000 ft. moving south-west.

After about five seconds it started to move across the sky in an erratic zig zag motion. After viewing this for about two seconds I told the other person camping with me to come look at the light. He walked over with the flashlight  hanging off the zipper of his shirt still on illuminating his front as well as the ground in front of him. This flashlight is made by mountain equipment co-op and is intended for use on pedal bikes. Note: it is a very small light powered by two watch batteries, yet a very small amount of light coming directly from the bulb would have been visible from the UFO’s position at that time.  We saw the UFO’s light move up and down and diagonally up and across as well as down and across, sometimes pausing briefly before moving again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching this for about one minute I shined a rather small flashlight directly at the UFO. The flashlight has the name Reactor on it, one L.E.D. Bulb, is powered by four double&#34; A&#34; batteries and a reflective surface measuring one and three quarter inches across. As soon as I shone the light at the UFO it continued zig zaging to the edge of the forest across the bay approximately one hundred fifty feet away from us. At this point it paused and it appeared to me that the UFO’s light became brighter and somewhat larger.The UFO light was about 1&#39; across. It then started to descend at a forty five degree angle across to the edge of the bay about forty feet in front of our campsite.As This descent took about ten seconds.At a distance of about one hundred feet I could distinguish what appeared to be an aura around two objects at the top of the UFO light. The bottom of the light was round and solid light.The UFO had a slightly oval shape. When the UFO was about fifty feet from us I said “I think we better turn the lights off. I turned my light off at this point and my friend turned the light in his hand off a second later. I started to turn my attention back toward the UFO again but decided to double check that all the lights were off. At this point the UFO was aware of the light near my friend’s neck. He was not very familiar with the on/off switch and it was a tense moment.  But one of us finally turned it off. My friend saw UFO come to the same altitude as us and proceeded to move directly toward us. As soon as the last light was turned off it went back to its previous agenda of flying erratically above the forest. It reached a distance of about five to seven kilometres away and after about one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not wanting to lose sight of it I picked up a large “million candle watt” flashlight and shone it at the UFO.  Not the smartest move, but I felt relatively safe since it had approached so slowly the first time. This time it made about three zig zags to the same spot at the far edge of the bay in approximately two seconds.  At this point it slowed briefly. I turned the light off, and turned to run as soon as I saw the UFO go in front of the tree line. However my friend grabbed me as he didn’t want me to be injured running through the woods. I soon turned around and never saw the UFO again. Although I did try to get it to come back after a couple minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We arrived at Borrego around 5 pm, and decided to backpack at Culp Valley Campground.  Culp Valley is approximately 3500 feet in elevation overlooking the Borrego Desert.  We backpacked about 1/2 mile from the trailhead and set up our tent about 20 feet north of the trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nightfall began and I couldn&#39;t sleep.  At around 3 am I heard a male voice conversing with someone or something.  I was startled by this realization and sitting in the tent I looked into the direction (about 50 yards from my tent) of the chatter and witnessed a green light moving back and forth.  I noticed the green light was coming closer and closer to the trail near where my tent was located.  I immediately ducked down in my tent and peered out in the front portion of my tent.  I noticed a mass gathering of people (12-15) or beings following the leader holding the green light.  I was terrified asking myself why people were hiking the trail at 3am in the desert.  I quickly took a glance of the party of beings walking past my tent.  I witnessed really tall beings and really short beings wearing white robes holding metal rods with light emitting from the rods.  These beings had bald heads wearing white robes walking very very quietly and slow....with their heads looking left to right with each footstep.  The little beings had robes on and I noticed their long arms swaying back and forth in unison with their feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that surprised me was the minimal noise I heard during their walk past my tent.  I&#39;ve backpacked far too often to hear footsteps of people walking near or around my tent.  It didn&#39;t happen in this instance.  The beings reluctantly continued on the trail and the bright lights slowly faded away.  I was panicking during the whole episode and waited 10 minutes to wake my girlfriend up to inform her of my observations.  The next morning I ran down to the trail to gather any form of evidence.  Unfortunately I didn&#39;t find anything that was peculiar.  The next day I made a call to the park ranger giving him my account of what happened.  He came up with two theories.  Night scientists or a religious cult.  I personally think it was a ranger guiding extraterrestrials into our natural habitat.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking at the stars from my back garden when I noticed an object moving. It was a large black, solid triange - there seemed to be a light at each of the three corners - they looked like stars - however the black triangular objcet was opaque and moving steadily across the sky. I called to my partner - but he could not see it.  I could also hear a helicopter from behind me, but could not see it, I assumed it was watching it too. I watched it travel across the sky, for about three minutes, it was completely silent. Eventually it went below the sightline of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It darted and danced about the sky and was heading from East to West direction. At times it looked like there were darker red lights around the outer perimeter. I kept thinking get your camera, get your binoculars but I knew it would be gone before I even got back with them. I am a sky watcher and have seen some strange things, but nothing ever like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/15/07 23:00|Clearwater Beach|FL|Unknown|30 minutes|Extremely stealthy aircrafts, like helicopters, fly over Gulf of Mexico and Clearwater Beach, Florida|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92342.html|215|ndxe200709| Extremely stealthy aircrafts, like helicopters, fly over Gulf of Mexico and Clearwater Beach, Florida<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report is being filed almost five years after the fact. Better late than never.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In September, 2007 (I am not sure of the exact date, but it was in the middle of the month), my wife and I saw unusual activity in the sky above Clearwater Beach, Florida, and the Gulf of Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although we now live in Clearwater, Florida, at the time we were vacationers to Clearwater Beach, annually. We were staying at our usual accommodations, a hotel located on the street that is directly across from the beach. As was our custom, we were booked into a room on the fourth floor, which is the top floor of the hotel. The room has a balcony which overlooks the hotel pool and gives us a scenic view of the beach and the Gulf of Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened to be the last night of a week-long vacation. We sat on the balcony to watch the sunset and remained there for several hours afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2300 hours (11 p.m), I happened to notice a bright light on the horizon. Seldom have I ever seen boats out on the Gulf late at night, but I had no reason to believe it was anything other than a watercraft. At first, I thought the light was moving north to south, parallel to the horizon, but soon I realized it was traveling east-west, heading in our general direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recall that the sky was clear and there was a half moon that evening. Given that it was the month of September, it was off-season. Very few people were out and about that night and there was very little in the way of automobile traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light got closer, the first thing I concluded that if it didn’t turn, the craft would be heading directly for the beach, not the harbor. As the light got even closer, I knew it was not a watercraft. It was an aircraft, flying at low altitude, but well above the water. It continued flying at the same altitude, but at what I would consider much too slow for an airplane or jet. My guess was that it was a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing I could see were lights at the front of the craft, seemingly encased in an elongated oval cover. I could not see how many lights were within this elongated cover, but I am sure there were at least three, maybe as many as five. These lights were white, not unlike headlights on an automobile. Since they were not pointed at me, it’s not possible to say how bright the lights were. But from my view on the fourth floor of the hotel, I would conclude that they were much brighter than halogen bulbs on standard cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not fly directly overhead, but about 3 to 4 blocks north of our location, above Pier 60, which is a local tourist attraction. It was soon out of our sightline. If this was all that happened, I probably would not have remembered it.  But over the next 30-40 minutes, this event occurred three more times, at least 5 -10 minutes apart.  Same thing each time: light on the horizon, approaching the beach, and finally out of sight.  There was one major difference. Each time it passed, it was at a slightly different line of latitude.  The second time, it was a mere block away from our location, the third time, it was directly overhead, and the final time, it was closer to the location of its first pass, near the pier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot say whether it was one craft that had turned about and made four passes or four separate crafts. But on its third pass, directly overhead, I was able to make the following observations:  1.	The front of the craft where the lights were, seemed to be rounded, much like the edge of a Frisbee. The only other part of the craft that was clearly observable was the area immediately around the elongated light cover. The lights reflected off this part of the craft as though the body of the craft was made of black chrome, but somewhat duller, like black patent leather shoes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.	What I am less sure of is the shape of the craft. Based on the front of the craft, I would say that it was saucer shaped. But as it passed overhead, there was something shadowy about the rest of the craft. It was as though the craft temporarily blocked out the starlight above. I had the sense that it was more like a boomerang.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.	I’m not good at measuring things in terms of inches, feet and yards. But if I had to guess the altitude of the craft, I would say that it was flying at a level that was five to six times the height of our hotel, a four story building. My wife and I disagree on this; she believes it flew at a higher altitude. Either way, it was closer to the ground than any other craft in flight that I’ve ever seen, other than watching a helicopter take off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.	While it did not hover at any point, it moved much like a helicopter, and certainly moved at a speed I associate with helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.	This craft was absolutely noiseless. No sound of an engine nor a rotary blade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the craft made its last pass (or after the fourth craft passed), the show was over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sadly, since it was the last night of our stay, I didn’t bother to recharge the battery for my camera, otherwise I would have recorded the last two passes for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About my wife and I: we had not consumed any intoxicants that evening; we are both college graduates; and, we were both professionals. My wife was a nurse at a convalescent home and I was about to retire after 30 years as a public school teacher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for why it has taken me 5 years to report this:  1.	It was late at night and this craft(s) did not seem to pose a threat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.	I had no idea who to report it to, inasmuch as the U.S. Air Force has washed its hands of UFO investigations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.	We checked the local news on television the following morning and there was no indication that anyone else had reported it, or at least the local stations were not covering such an event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.	With Clearwater Beach being so close to MacDill AFB, the possibility occurred to me that I may have seen military aircraft, secret or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally decided to report this “sighting” based on what I’ve read about the raid to capture/kill Osama Bin Laden. In published reports, it has been stated that one of the concerns about the mission was that the helicopters that transported the Navy SEALS into Pakistan, while visually stealthy, were not as audibly stealthy as they would have preferred. The mission into Pakistan took place almost 4 years after my “sighting”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can tell you that if it had not been for the lights, I probably would never have noticed my craft(s). The craft(s) was/were virtually stealthy; almost invisible and certainly without noise. If the U.S. military developed such capabilities, I wondered why they had not already been applied to currently used aircraft, including those helicopters used on the SEALS’ mission.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for my own reaction to the events of that night, the only word I can use is “fascination”. I was not frightened not was I excited about the possibility I was seeing UFO’s. It was what it was. But after considering the technology this craft or crafts had, I can’t rule out the possibility of extraterrestrial activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very aware that more recently, hoaxes in this location happen often, with Chinese lanterns being used frequently. But these hoaxes tend to happen at the height of tourist season, not long after sunset, when there is a greater chance of witnesses. In our case, it was later in the evening and, other than my wife and I, no witnesses to speak of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If any of the information I have supplied ties in with other sightings in Clearwater or elsewhere, I hope it is helpful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

A friend and I were stargazing, looking for satellites and meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Appeared as a ball of light that shifted between white, blue, red, yellow and green colours.  There was in no regular pattern between the colour changes; both in time between changes and the actual colour changed to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object appeared close to the horizon but distance was impossible to tell – aside from it being very distant (5km or more).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball of light was about the size / brightness of 4-5 of the brightest stars in the sky.  When viewed through binoculars the ball of light was 4 distinct spheres of light.  It was very hard to distinguish as it seemed to move in and out of binocular focus.  The surrounding stars did remain in binocular focus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saw airplanes traveling at some distance behind the object.  There was no interaction with the object.  Also saw satellites in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object moved side to side, up and down, and in J shape patterns in a small portion of the sky.  Movment not like traditional aircraft movement in any way.  No noise was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conservation Officer stopped to inquire what we were watching in the sky.  Pointed out the object and he viewed it for a minute or two in binoculars before stating – “there are sure some strange things in the sky” and then drove off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watched object for 20 minutes before another one appeared in another part of the sky (also near the horizon) approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise from the first.  This object was identical to the first but seemed more active.  Similar motion but also saw it do a slow figure-8 pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watched both objects for about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Tried to take photos/video with digital camera but nothing appeared due to the quality of the photo sensor.  Went out the next evening to look for the objects but none appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My daughter and I saw a large orange fireball low in the western sky. Seemed to be near a cell tower, and the ball was so bright that you could not see the tower light until the ball was gone. Stayed in one spot for several seconds then slowly faded until gone. A few minutes later it reappeared, much lower and to the east. Looked almost like it had changed shape. Again, the ball faded until gone. But, before it disappeared, there was a bright flash of light over the cornfield, much like someone had taken a flash photo. We have a video, but of course, it’s not very good.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was, at first I thought it was a helicopter or something and went back to watching some tv. What caught my attention again was the bright light was still there, this time it was a little closer and it seemed to &#39;hover&#39; in place. I then got up, my curiousity grown, to inspect it. When I went upon our back porch. It was in the Northwest of the sky of our backyard. It wasnt cloudy, stars and the moon was out. You could see it through our full grown green ash tree. I also noticed that some of the lights from the other 5 houses were out, when usually you can see then on. Come to think about it, there was no stars, moon or any other light showing but just that one. Also this &#39;light&#39; or UFO made no noise at all. I saw the light move really slow to the right bout a quarter of a inch.  Then it stopped and hovered. I stayed staring at it, thinking what in the heck is it? I called my mom out to c this after it just stayed for over 5 mintues in its spot. She came out, asking &#39;what?&#39;. I pointed to the white light and she said it was probably a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Mom, its just been hovering there&#34; She kept saying it was just one of the two until a couple mintues passed and the white light turned from white to a blue, green then back to white. We waited until it moved a bit and then stopped once again. By that time I ran inside and got my parents digital camcorder, my digital camera and my bioniclars. I brought them out and managed to film the white light. For some reason, my digital camera refused to work but the camcorder did, although at 1st it didnt want to, It even had a full battery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was doing that, my mom watched and noticed it dart to the right really fast then stopped. I felt really excited cing this. I stopped filming and handed over the camcorder and picked my bioniclars up. I couldnt at first see any good image just that strange really bright white light. I brought the bioniclars down and stared as my mother and I spoke softly while keeping a eye on the light. When I put the bioniclars up once again the lights flashed from white, blue, green, yellow and white again. Althought this time, I managed to see a small shape with the white light. It looked like a trianglar shape to me 3 lights. The other two seemed like it was under more than the one we were seeing. Soon my dad, brother and his girlfriend came out and also saw the white light but couldnt see the shape I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while we just went inside but I called KOLR10 News to see if they knew anything and got told they would look into it. I hope we can find out what that strange light was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could still see it hovering for a hour and the last time I went to spy on it, the white light had completely vanished.

The sighting that I had was during mid day on a very bright sunny day.  The silvery (mercury like) single colored object was traveling from the SW to the NE in a non-linear path.  From almost overhead I followed it to a place fairly well before the horizon.  It was a single object that took about 20 seconds to disappear into the sky.  My first inclination was that it was a balloon, but following it fairly high in the sky I was positive that it was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would guess the elevation to be 10,000 feet or below.  It did not leave a con-trail and did not resemble anything that I had seen before in my 46 years of life.  The path was not an ordinary North - South commercial jet flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw it, I was very awe struck; so much so that I remarked to my wife just moments after it dissappeared that I had just witnessed my first UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not one to be fanatical about such things but am now convinced that I did see a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Coming home from church about 7 in the evening we were coming down Triplett  Street in the city and pulled up under a stop light that Griffith Avenue butted into. As we were waiting for an arrow to turn left, I looked up straight under the light and saw what I thought was a Hot Air Balloon. I contained a circle of fire that seemed to be about 10 to 12 feet wide . But then I realized that  jets appeared at differing places around it.That caused doubting on my part. Look at the balloon I said to the rest of the family. Everyone looked up and then to our amazement it shot to the horizon in a split second across the Ohio River far into the state of Indiana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second incident of a mysterious flying object was observed between Orlando and Sebastion Florida about 11 PM September 2007. The object was first seen with two fire-like exhausts going across the black autumn sky. Many cars pulled off on the shoulder to see the strange rolling fiery “&gt;” shaped exhaust roiling horizontally across the night sky. From our vantage point it appeared to be 10 to 12 feet wide at its widest point. It flew over the swampy area and then suddenly came to an abrupt stop. It was then that we were able to detect a huge bell shaped object with one light in the top of the tallest area. The bottom of the had a light at each corner. These were not bright lights but appear to be much like looking through a round glass behind which was a florescent light, illuminating a room inside. After observing the still floating object for about 45 minutes all the cars began to pull away as we did. Still puzzled and wondering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It appeared to be at a very high altitude.  I assumed it to be a weather balloon as it seemed to move in the same direction as the clouds.  These clouds are the wispy type usually found at high altitudes.  After thought not too much about it until I saw another object in the same general vicinity.  By the way, I am looking to the southwest at about a 75 to 80 degree angle.  This other object is moving from Northeast to southwest at a much slower rate than the first object.  I no longer see the first object so get my digital camera and start taking pictures. I am taking pictures because this is now quite unusual.  They do not seem to be aircraft as they are not shaped like one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former Air Traffic Controller who used to work at Lambert.  I am familiar with aircraft and their flight characteristics.  I continue to take pictures hoping that the clouds can give some reference to size and altitude of this object when I notice another object in the same vicinity.  It seems to be higher than the second object.  Both these object are either stationary or moving very slowly because the clouds are now obscuring them.  The clouds eventually became a little thicker and I could no longer distinguish the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will attempt to send the pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was on SR-417 when I happened to glace out and up out of the drivers side window. I saw two objects flying in formation, one slightly behind and to the left of the lead craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was clear with scattered cumulous clouds. What struck me most was the brightness of the craft, brighter and whiter than the clouds they flew in front of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was two jetliners, but I know that commercial liners do not fly in formation and also because there were no visible vertical stabilizers on these two craft. Plus their shape appeared to be like a 2x4 board.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were flying north to south, but could not estimate the altitude, although they seemed quit big and close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this time there was a Southwest Airliner heading north out of Orlando International Airport. The objects were bigger than the commercial jet. They seemed to pass over the airliner, but I can&#39;t say if they were actually over the plane, it just looked like it from my perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the airliner passed, the trailing object did a 90 degree turn to the right although I couldn&#39;t actually see it turn, it just went from going south to going west without any sign of deceleration, but it did seem to pick up speed and move rapidly away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I got my vehicle pulled over to the side of the road the objects were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were flying a perfect V-formation for about a second and changed to a straight line, while the outer two objects were swerving from left to right (almost touching the next objects in the row) at a remarkable speed, without the merest break at each turning point. Following characteristics of the objects exclude the possibility of them being normal aircrafts, balloons or animals:  -          The speed of them (about the speed of a military jet flying one kilometre above us), the covered roughly 100° of sky in about four seconds. Because there were now clouds what so ever and we could merely see the dull glowing lights of the objects it was impossible to tell the height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - They emitted no sound at all, despite flying directly over us  -          The way the outer two objects were swerving  -          There was no wind that night  -          The fact that they glowed  -          The size of them (about three millimetres in diameter)  -          The light always stayed the same: it neither blinked nor changed in brightness (not as bright as that of a passenger aircraft), each object had one light  Neither the Swiss army nor the Swiss Aviation Control is aware of anything, nor could anyone else give us an explanation of what we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can you tell us what kind of crafts we saw?

Most closely resembled an equilateral triangle.  I couldn&#39;t see the actual outline of the object- only the lights that formed the shape.  Three small white lights formed each corner of the triangle, with the tip clearly pointed in the direction of movement.  One large blue light, softly blinking on and off, was in the center of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object came up over the tree-line at approximately a 45-degree angle, continued in this direction for several seconds, then suddenly reversed its course in a strange motion, like a rotation, and came back down in another 45-degree angle, until it disappeared behind the trees and could no longer be seen.  The entire path it traveled seemed to the upper part of a triangle.  It was the only time I ever saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was almost there but she texted me and called me so I ran back but then her plans changed so I just laid on my sisters car to wait for her, in front of her house there is a light that flickers on and off, like a street light. I was laying there and it went off and my eyes got used to the darkness so was star gazing like I do all the time, the light flickered back on and a couple minutes later went off, I looked into the sky I saw this object flying above my head, it was shaped like a comet but not really because I think it was like a barrier because it was moving way to slow. I was like WTF!? It was really high and it wasn’t shaped like a bird or plane, it reflected the light the way a cloud does at night over a city and it started turning but I followed it, tree obstructed my view so I had to if I wanted to get a better look. I went into my sister’s neighbor’s yard and continued to watch it until I couldn’t see it anymore. I walked back to my sisters car and my friend came to pick me up and I left.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were of equal brightness. They were not as bright as the lights of an airplane and were approximately the color and brightness of bright stars. If I remember correctly, they were white with a slightly blue tint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights traveled over the city from slightly north of my position to directly west of my position. At its closest, the triangle appeared to be twice the size of a full moon.  It took approximately seven seconds for the triangle to travel into the distance when I lost sight of it near the tops of the houses on the west side of the avenue. (I was standing on the sidewalk of the east side of the avenue.) The triangle appeared to tilt slightly as it traveled into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two airplanes in the area at the time. One was to the southwest and one was to the northwest. Their lights were considerably brighter and one airplane was loud. They crossed the sky at a much slower pace and with noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I lost sight of the unusual lights, I wondered if they had slightly changed formation near the end of my sighting or if the appearance of such a change was the result of the change in my perspective.<n>

I tracked the object through my telescope for about 25 seconds when the object stopped , and disappeared.

I am not sure whether they were ufo’s or not, but I can’t think of any other explanation for what they might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 5-6 of the objects.  They were small and resembled very dim stars so I believe they were very high in the sky.  They fluctuated  intensity in their brightness as they moved in very erratic patterns.  They would seem to drift for a moment or two, then all of the sudden they would fade and take off in a totally different direction at many times an accelerated speed and then slow down again.  They were not moving in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This activity went on for hours until I had to go to bed.  This is not the first occasion  that I have witnessed this same phenomenon.  The first time was in 2005, For several weeks following Hurricane Katrina.  On these occasions my roommate at the time witnessed them with me.  This year, however, she was not with me and this is the first time I have seen them since. I would like to submit a photo, but unfortunately I do not have a good camera so the objects were too small/far away to capture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if anyone else has reported these or not, but I would like to know whether what I saw were in fact ufo’s or not.<n>

It was at least half way through the show so it must have been about 8:15-8:30.  I can&#39;t remember why but for some reason I glanced over toward one of the main stages to the west of where I was.  I saw it about 20 degrees over the horizon and about 30 degrees to the north of the sliver of the moon.  I saw a flashing light and a steady dimmer light.  At first I thought was a helicopter since a police helicopter had flown over the festival several time that night.  If it was a helicopter I would guess it at about 3 or 4 miles away based on the separation and brightness of the lights.  Then it did something that freaked me out.  Suddenly a huge triangular pattern of big bright green lights began flashing very rapidly.  No two lights seemed to flash in sync, it was just wild random flashing of too many lights to count.  The lights were all on the parameter of the triangle pattern with none in the middle.  The weird thing was that if it was a helicopter putting on a light show, then the lighting attachments would have to have been at least the size of a football field or two.  Compared to the distant object I thought I&#39;d seen a second before the triangle light display was enormous.  The light display continued for about 10 seconds as I stared in disbelief trying to figure out what the heck it was.  Just as I started to get the attention of my friend the light show stopped.  I was left explaining to him that the tiny flashing light that he couldn&#39;t hardly make out from the other distant aircraft in the sky had just put on a massive light show as if it was right over the festival.  It continued to fade into the distance until I couldn&#39;t make it out any more.  I&#39;m ready to accept that this was a human aircraft putting on a lighting display.  The only thing that doesn&#39;t make sense to me is the brightness and sure size of the triangular green light display compared to the other lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw 2 bright lights go flying by extremely fast.  The lights were above the tree line.  I jumped out of bed and quickly went to the front of the house and looked out the front window.  It was then that I saw a huge, bright light hovering in the eastern sky, seemed to be about 400 feet in the air.    I then went outside to get a better look, it was extremely cold on that morning, and I was only wearing boxer shorts.  I watched for a few minutes, then scanned the rest of the sky for the original two lights that I saw while still in bed, but could not see them anymore.  I did see two airplanes coming from the western sky with their blinking lights.  The huge hovering light that was right out front of my house just sat there still.  I then went inside and told my room mate to get up and go look and then went to get my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to snap about 5 photos of the object.  The photos are semi-unclear, you can see the object but it looks like the object was moving in the photos - you can see a &#34;trai&#34;?!?!  In any event, I saw it, my roommate saw it and it was there for at least 15 minutes.  I actually stopped looking at it and went back inside to get ready for work and forgot about it.  I  ended up getting quite ill from being out there in the cold wearing only boxer shorts.  A week and a half later and I&#39;m still sick.  The object was never there before and I have not seen it again since.  It was definately not a planet, a star, a plane, or swamp gas!

Originally, I thought it was a reflection in the window, but as I got a closer look from several angles, including outside, it was definitely in the sky. It stayed in relatively the same spot for at least 45 minutes (possibly more, I fell asleep), with slow and subtle movements upwards and side to side. It did not change color, no moving lights, and no beams – just a white glowing orb. It was definitely not an airplane tower, but who’s to say it wasn’t a weather balloon or a new lab experiment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Two weeks ago me and a customer saw a very bright light. It was like a spotlight in the sky not moving like a normal plain or helicopter holding altitude but not in space but near to earth. The light was remarkable it shimmered and was a brilliant light so clear. My customer was so amazed by it we followed it. But it zipped off and that was it. Then on the 14th day of  the 9th  Month in 2007 I saw the same light again over the same area. I had my digital camera on me and I took one still image of the object and a half hour video of it,  I think it the best footage of a ufo iv ever seen. When I zoom in you can see a circle with the flat side at the top and the shape of the craft is like a doughnut. After looking at the Video footage of the space shuttle video I believe it’s the same type of craft but cant be sure. The centre is concave or indented and you can almost make out the panels on the craft. It is self-illuminating with some kind of energy field running over the skin of the Craft. Every now and then it starts to shimmer the energy grows and it moves at an amazing speed and turns in to a blur moving about so fast it gives the impression of a slinky or a snake moving and changing colours. Brilliant white, electric blue, purple, red and green. It then slows down stops and goes back to normal it kind of vibrates or moves so fast it looks like it is vibrating. It did this several times until I ran our of battery I caught all this on my hard drive cam recorder the Sony DCR –SR72E. I don’t want to pass this video over the internet because I believe its worth some money. Id like to know how I can pass this footage on to make it public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.  PD))<n>

It was around 9:30 p.m. September 13-19, 2007, (unfortunately, I’m not quite sure of the actual day anymore.)  I was on County Road 550, after going through Pleasant Valley.    Shortly after going past a school, the area opens up to a large corn field on the left.  It was at this area that I first noticed muted “lights” at the very top of my driver side door window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day care provider lives in the country, and at that time of year, it was completely dark-- so I am unable to determine the shape of the “craft”.  However, these lights were amber in color and were clustered in, what seemed to me, two different V-shaped formations; one set of three lights were slightly lower than the other set and angled somewhat differently.  It’s rather difficult to express in writing the pattern in which I saw the lights but after watching it for about 10 seconds, the lights started, to the best of my guess, splitting off and the two sets of lights became three.  I don’t recall any movement other than the lights transforming, (in other words, I don’t believe the craft(s) was traveling as much as it/they was just hovering and changing shape.)  I eventually lost sight of the lights in the trees as I went around a curve.  I actually slowed the car down and contemplated pulling over into the drive way of a little camp ground but thought better of it.  The whole thing, while it seemed to carry on longer, really only lasted about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I’m not going to assume that I know what these lights are but I will state this… my mental health is sound and what I witnessed was NOTHING I have ever seen before.  No one will convince me that this was an air plane, (there were no blinking lights as you would see on a plane and while it appeared to be flying low to the ground, there was no noise.  Additionally, at this altitude, had it been a plane it would have flown over the car and out of sight quickly.)   Furthermore, I don’t believe it to be any sort of “government experiment” as I’ve actually seen similar lights, in the same formation, on an amateur video taken outside of the U.S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize that this has been some time ago, but I think about it almost daily.  (The experience was just too commanding not to.)   I know that there are real risks to admitting seeing something like this, (most people would call me “crazy” if they knew,) but it is my hope that someone else may be able to write a comment if they saw the same thing that night in the same area.  I know that there were other witnesses-- I recall looking into the rear view mirror at one point to see a motorcycle directly behind me and another car or truck behind the motorcycle.  I contemplated calling the city police or local radio but was concerned that they would not take me seriously, (and living in a small town, everyone knows everyone else, I just couldn’t take the risk.… my father is a doctor in the area… I plan to open my own business here shortly… etc., etc., etc.)  Anyway, any information or witnesses would be greatly appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I first called out to my son Jeremy with excitement. Time was 21:30 and the night shy was crystal clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being an amatuer astronomer and know aerodynamics I knew this was no ordinary phenomena. We watched these objects go on and off. At first I thought they were flares but they changed there position to quickly. We continued to observe these objects as we got in our car and headed on KY HWY 9 going east 9 miles from Maysville KY. Color of objects were bright orange and continued to be pulsating on and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were a total of four to five objects as the would go side to side with lights going on and off. I mentioned to my son that these objects were similar in nature to the Phoenix lights. We are in the path of Greater Cincinnati Airport as I also could see Commercial Airlines in the distance sky.  This lasted for 30 minutes tell objects just dissapperaed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However, at closer and more precise inspection we noticed that it was changing direction quite frequently and at times seemed to almost hover. We followed it as it flew over a few farms (most had no produce, one had some livestock). At one point the craft flew very close to our vehicle (say, about 1000ft overhead) and you could clearly see two blinking white lights, a solid blue light and a solid red light ( one of each color in each corner and a white one in the middle). Eventually the craft flew directly over the airport behind Oliphant Lane,(this is when we became skeptical thinking it was a plane, however), it flew very low towards the landing strip but then immediately changed direction very quickly and headed back towards the farms where it almost appeared to land. It seemed as though it was surveying something. After about 5 more minutes the craft began to fly high west into the night sky until it was out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No apparent noise like you&#39;d expect from a military fighter, although looked like could be tail flames.  Could not have been, they were too close to each other and hovering, and they disappeared too quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It would have been about the same size as a first quarter moon. It seemed as if it was very high and passed very quickly. It seemed to have skipped through the atmosphere and could have been a fireball but was very dim and I have seen a number of fireballs and this did not look like any I have ever seen. It was only visible for a few seconds and covered the distance of about 1/5th of the night sky. If it were at a low altitude in the sky, the speed would be that of a jet fighter at mach speed. There was no sound, and no flash and no tail to the object.<n>

She stated that between 7:30 at dusk between Farmington, and Kirtland, New Mexico. She said over seven people were looking up into the sky watching these strange objects. She stated that suddenly the military appreared, which is strange since this community has no military bases or operations in the area other than one small guard unit.

This evening, as I started my workout just after sundown, I noticed two bright star-like objects to the west, about 15-18 degrees above the horizon. One object was extremely bright, perhaps magnitude -2 or -3, and resembled a brighter-than-normal planet Venus. About 10 or 12 degrees to the south of it, at the same height above the horizon, was a lesser light, but still bright, about magnitude -1 or 0. The larger, brighter light was blue-white in color, like Venus, and the smaller was an orange-red, like Mercury when it is visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was, “oh, what a beautiful Mercury/Venus display!” But then I realized that I had seen Venus this morning at dawn, rising ahead of the Sun!  As I had this realization, the smaller light dimmed and disappeared, within about 5 seconds, without changing position relative to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the brighter object, and marked it’s position relative to the horizon using some tree branches that were off to one side that allowed me to sort of triangulate the light’s position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several airplane contrails were visible nearby, illuminated by the sunset. These came and went while the object remained still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the course of the next 35 minutes, the light did not move relative to the horizon in the slightest. However it also, though much more slowly, dimmed in brightness and turned more and more red, until, once twilight had ended and it was completely dark, it was orange instead of blue-white and perhaps magnitude 6 or 7. A few minutes later it became completely non-visible. Up to the point it was no longer visible, it did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Jupiter??  PD))<n>

I can only guess it was centrally located in the Jemez Mountains/Caldera region of Northern New Mexico. It did not move - it was too bright to be a star since 6:30PM had a fair deal of sunlight in the sky. It was extremely bright and didn&#39;t resemble any sort of weather balloon. I thought it was a star or planet at first but after dusk it slowly disappeared. The witnesses I contacted during the ordeal also confirmed it was not a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I don’t know what altitude we were flying but this object was even with us.  I saw it out in the distance in front of us and pointed it out to my Dad who was beside me and the passenger behind me heard me talking about it and had been watching it also.  It was a very bright light in an upside down teardrop shape that appeared to have a hole in the center.  I first thought it was an approaching airplane that may have been their bright headlights but as we got closer to it and began to pass it, I observed it didn’t move from the hovering area.  We were 1 ½ hrs from Los Angeles so I am not exactly sure where we were but I’m guessing over NM maybe.  As we passed the object, it began to glow orange with still what looked like a dark hole in the center.  Shortly after passing it, it began to shrink into a white ball very rapidly.  Either flying away very fast or disintegrating, who knows but it vanished very quickly but while approaching it, it lasted for at least 15 minutes or longer and then as we passed it, it quickly disappeared.  At one point it appeared to have some multi colored lights flashing around the shape but was hard to distinguish with the extreme bright white light.  But as the light turned to an orange glow, which was very bright also, the multi colored lights seem to go away.  It looked like an upside down hot air balloon on fire or glowing.  As we passed it, the object didn’t seem to move much but did appear to be hovering a little with a little movement up and down.  But it did NOT fade away in the same appearance as when we approached it.  It turned into a ball shape white light and shrunk down until it was gone in very little time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When one of them came back inside, a woman working out near me asked him what they were looking at. He said “that UFO that’s just hanging up there!” She and I both immediately went outside to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw, about 30 degrees from the horizon, a spherical object hovering motionless over SSE Santa Fe. It had the transparent appearance of a soap bubble, and was about 1/8  the size of my thumbnail held at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The woman who walked out with me instantly cried “that’s a weather balloon!”, and went back inside, cursing the staff person for a fool. And it may well have been a weather balloon, I don’t know where to look up stuff like who’s lofting weather balloons, where and when. I’m hoping you guys can do that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Her conviction convinced me for the moment, and I went back inside to shower and change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However the object was still there when I came out to go back to work, and it had not  moved in the slightest, for at least 15 minutes or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I carry a pair of inexpensive 2x8 opera glasses with me in my truck for observing wildlife. Using those, I got a better look at it, and it was perfectly spherical, not the teardrop shape I associate with weather balloons, nor was there any observable gondola or dependent payload hanging beneath the object, nor any visible tether that could explain its complete lack of motion. It was a calm day, but one would think there would be some breeze at the apparent height of the object, which seemed to be about 500 to 1000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained in place all the way back to work, and was still there when I went inside my building, approximately 20 minutes after I first went to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At approximately 06:55, My son&#39;s bus was on Beck Road at the Joy Road intersection, in Canton, Michigan. He looked out the bus window to the west and he saw 3 dim white lights at about 40 degrees above the horizon.  The lights then started to brighten and became very bright white. The object then began to move slowly upward and to the north. It went a short distance then stopped, changed direction, going upward and to the south for a short distance. The object stopped again, then began moving slowly north and upward. It stopped again, then flew south and upward again for the last time.  It stopped, tipped vertically revealing a distinct saucer-shaped craft with 3 bright white lights in a triangular formation.  Remaining in that sideway&#39;s position, it slowly ascended, then instantly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son was too shocked to think to point it out to anyone else on the bus. He said no one else took notice that he was aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That evening, I told my wife that our son saw what he thought was a UFO while riding to school and I didn&#39;t describe anything to her about what our son said to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She immediately said that she saw something very strange that morning also, while driving to work. She said, whatever it was, it had 3 impossibly bright white lights and was hovering in the field north of the road, just above the trees, as she drove past it on Ford Road, going west, near the Ridge Road intersection. She said it was huge. She said it was about the size of a small ranch home. She said she wanted to stop, but there was too much traffic and she couldn&#39;t pull over safely. She saw this very similiar looking craft approximately 10 to 15 minutes earlier than my son at around 06:40.  Her location was approximately 2.5 miles away from my son&#39;s location when he saw the saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was amazing since I didn&#39;t give my wife details of what our son saw and to have her tell me the same number of lights as our son along with seeing it 10 minutes apart in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Drawings and a map are attached.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was on a Delta Airlines flight that left Mumbai and connected in CDG airport in Paris, France. I was in a busines class seat that had the option of watching the plane&#39;s location on a GPS map on the seat-back in front of me. It was dark and in the middle of the night; most everyone on the flight was sleeping at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a right window seat near the front of the plane. Since I have trouble sleeping on planes, I routinely looked at the GPS and then out the window. The route took us north through Iran, then turns left at Tehran and heads NW towards Europe. While still heading north through Iran (before Tehran), I noticed a light to the right of the plane, not too far away (less than 1 mile I&#39;d guess), and slightly behind us. It was a white light, but soon it pulsed into a green light, then pulsed into a red light. It alternated between those 3 colors, but sometimes appearing yellow. It did not change colors in an pattern (white, red, green, red, white, green, yellow, green, white, and so on), nor were the times in a patern...sometimes it would go 10 seconds before turning colors, other times it would go 2-3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was definitely pacing our plane, but would sometimes pull even with us nd other times fall back a bit. It was flying at the same altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since Iran is hostile to the US, I began to get concerned that perhaps it was a military aircraft with malicious intent. I got the attention of a flight attendant and pointed it out to her. She too was surprised to see the other craft. She said she&#39;d ask the Captain about it. At that point I&#39;d seen it for perhaps 15 minutes, and then we began the left bank to head towards Europe - we were over Tehran. The light fell back and out of sight. As we straightened out and began an even flight again, I kept looking back. Sure enough, about 5 minutes later the light reappeared, catching up to a spot in about the 4 o&#39;clock position. It continued to pulse and change colors.  As the pre-dawn light started to lighten up I thought I could make out a shape...it looked like a rounded triangle - kind of like a football, cut in half, tip up.  The lights apeared to be spinning with the craft, but very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight attendant returned and said the Captain was too busy to discuss it at length, but he wasn&#39;t aware of any other aircraft flying with us and he couldn&#39;t see it when he looked (maybe we had just turned).

I first noticed a slowly flashing while light, dimmer than the surrounding stars.  The flash was at a much slower pace than a typical aircraft warning light, perhaps three seconds between flashes.  After a few minutes, two more of these slow flashers appeared.  The sky was clear, so it shouldn&#39;t be assumed that they arrived under cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They began to move south at a slow rate of speed.  Suddenly, the top-most light emitted a bright red &#39;projectile&#39; of some sort that sped out in front of it, growing dimmer as it went until is seemed to extinguish.  The other two light began to emit these projectiles, one every 20 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After roughly 15 minutes, the lights simply went out, not far from where the event began.  I waited for another 15 minutes, but the lights did not return.  I&#39;ve witnessed similar lights on two occasions in the past two weeks.  The events last no longer than 15 minutes and I&#39;ve yet to see the lights entering or exiting the area where the lights are firing the red projectiles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could someone contact Wright Patterson AFB to see if this might be a training exercise?  I couldn&#39;t find a number for them that would allow me to speak to someone who could clarify.  The red lights traveled in a straight path out from the lights, so it didn&#39;t seem like any flares that I&#39;ve seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am located in the Burbank area (southwest of Chicago). I noticed one very bright light while looking toward the west, it was south as well. I then noticed a blinking light just past the very bright light which seemed to be moving in a north to south fashion. As I glanced directly west, I had noticed two other lights, one was located over some trees in the neighborhood, this one had a very odd flicker, like none I have ever seen before. I am accustomed to planes and seeing stars, this one was unlike anything I have seen before.  My fiance had noticed this one starting to move. Also, there was another flickering light in the vast distance which seemed to flurry in and out of our sight horizon. This one definitely was moving back and forth in a north to south manner. It was exceedingly odd. I have seen some odd things, but standing back, I seemed to have had four unidentified objects that seemed to form a rectangle. Again, they consisted of one VERY bright stationery light, two objects that seemed to hover north to south, and one light that had a very UNIQUE flicker to it. It was a very breathtaking and odd experience. I confirmed that I was not crazy when my fiance had taken notice to the exact same experience I had encountered.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And the quality of the light from it was different, being more of a glow as opposed to reflected light or &#34;light bulb&#34; type light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very white, with a blue tinge. It also slightly pulsed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And that &#34;star&#34; just stayed there, not moving...and NOT like the way the headlights of a plane can seem to not move when coming directly towards you...it simply DID NOT move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of minutes, it began to move very slowly towards the southeast, in what appeared to be a straight path. Suddenly, as I watched it, it went from being at a 45 degree angle in the sky, to about a 55-60 degree angle...and when it did this, the position of the craft did not change...no pointing upward or aiming...it was just suddenly &#34;up&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From that angle, it continued southeast for a minute or so, then, as suddenly as it was &#34;up&#34;, it was back down at the 45 degree level, moving at the same steady rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During its movement, the pulsing and color tone never changed, nor did the flight angle of the craft. Its size was approximately that of a BB pellet held at arm&#39;s length, slightly larger than the two stars I regularly see at that point in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will send you a sketch of this event later today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please feel free to contact me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upon stepping out with my dog, motion caught my eye and I glanced up. Despite my classes in astronomy, merit badges, and 25+ years of amateur sky watching I have no name for what I saw other than UFO. I&#39;m college educated, a respected member of my community, and former Army Reservist that held a Secret Security Cleareance. This is my first sighting, and I have debated about whether to even say anything to anyone, for fear it may harm my professional reputation. I was certainly a skeptic until last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw when I looked up was at a very high altitude, its initial position in the sky was just north of the constellation Orion and about 75 degrees above the horizon. I believe it may have been initially traveling either due west or descending because it did not seem to be traveling fast. Then almost immediately it turned sharply to the south and crossed the sky at a speed I can only compare to a meteor. Much faster than any satellites or planes I have witnessed. The object was illuminated at first, perhaps from entry; it then faded in intensity as it crossed the sky to the south. The object did not streak, or trail however. It also did not seem to be producing the light itself. It had a white-blue glow and seemed large. The glow disappeared when it was about three quarters of the way across the sky, and I could no longer track the object. All of this took place in about before I was able to light my cigarette, I think maybe about 5 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eye on the sky for some 2 to 3 minutes trying to see if it would reappear, I had about convinced myself that it was just a meteor, when out of the north a fast moving triangle of 2 red and 1 blue (non-blinking) lights flew across the sky at a increasing altitude, on what appeared to be an intercept course. I assume the lights were a single craft, but may have been a formation of three crafts at a much higher altitude. This one also moved much faster than anything I am familiar with and I have lived in this area for 31 years. I counted 6-mississippi as this craft crossed the sky, but it remained in my field of vision longer, and its lights did not extinguish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In both cases there was no noise. I pondered what I had seen and watched for additional movement in the night sky. I did spot a plane flying northeast possibly towards Chicago or further north, it was too high to be flying to KC. I could hear it, and it took several minutes to cross out of my field of vision. I called a friend of mine at 4:18AM according to my cell phone, after finishing my cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had what appeared to be an oval shape and had strobe lights that changed from red, green, blue, and white. While sitting in the same spot for the first fifteen minutes, from the edges of the craft it emitted round bright white balls of light. These balls would come out of the craft horizontally then disappear altogether. This happened a total of four times then no more came out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a friend to confirm what I was seeing, and she saw another one to the south of Springfield. Oval in shape but turned upright. With the same colored strobes as the one above. No balls of light came from the second craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To ensure it was not moving I placed a couple of pieces of tape on the glass surrounding the object and watched from the same location. The stars were of course slowly dropping below the tape line but not this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one to the south of Springfield had a bright flash that was produced several times from the craft. Similar to a camera flash at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched both objects from 04:00 hours until they went dark suddenly at around 04:47. We could not figure out if they left or just went dark and remained in the same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first it seemed to me that it could be something normal, but then after it moved slowly for about 10 seconds it faded quickly into the sky.  Judging by how far away it must have been, that ship must have been very large.  I think it went back into space quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a star flickering as they often do on clear nights, and then out of the corner of my eye I noticed a blinking white and red light heading north.  I wrote it off as a plane, but kept my eye on it.  It was moving exceptionally fast considering how far away it was.  I was born and raised in an area where jetliners and helicopters frequently pass over heading to the Scranton/Wilkes Barre airport, so it&#39;s safe to say I have a good idea of how fast a plane that far away should have been moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I watched the craft move off to the north I noticed another identical set of blinking white and red lights coming from the south west heading in the same direction.  Then, before that one was out of sight, another flew by, then another, they all came from different areas of the sky heading towards the same point.  There were times that I could see three or four of them in the sky at once, which struck me as odd because I always considered airplanes to keep more of a distance from each other than the distance these things were maintaining.  At one point I watched a couple of them pass behind a cloud, and the most incredible part was when I saw one coming from the north heading straight towards another coming from the south west, they moved very quickly and passed very close by one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a friend and some of his family come over, and they arrived just in time to see one dissappear north into the distance.  Within fifteen minutes another came from the north heading south.  After that we didn&#39;t see any more of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout this sighting I only heard the sound of an airplane once, when one of them passed nearby, however several other crafts followed the same path and were silent.  I cannot shake the idea that they were most likely airplanes because the blinking lights are so typical of the safety lights airplanes use.  My reason for reporting this is that there were so many, I counted at least nineteen and god knows how long they were doing this before I noticed.  Also, they passed by each other so closely and traveled far distances very quickly for the most part without a sound.  Anyways thats it.  I plan to call the airport just to see if maybe there was an issue that prevented jetliners from landing, forcing them to circle the skies for a while.  I&#39;ll keep it posted.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

OR???????????<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was back in my hometown for a funeral and was spending the night at my deceased father&#39;s house, which is out in the country near Oglebay Park.  I love the peace &amp; quiet and wanted to go into his field to look at the massive array for stars out that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx 10PM, In the SSW sky I spotted to what I had assumed to be a star, but quickly deduced that it must be a plane because all of the starlight was a &#39;white-blue&#39; when this was an &#39;yellow-white&#39; and was MUCH lower than any star. As a guess I&#39;d say it&#39;s altitude was 5 miles and distance (from me) approx the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realized that it couldn&#39;t be landing gear or lights on the front of a craft because it was moving away from me in a constant SSW direction.  Overhead, a plane passed, coming from the NW--towards the &#39;light&#39; to the SSW. As the plane got to what I would say about a 1-2 mile range, the light went out, then came back on as the airplane vectored to the SSE.  I ran to get binoculars and continued to watch.  This light did not twinkle as were all of the stars that night (it was crystal-clear), rather it was constant.  I will note that another airplane was headed towards it and the light disappeared again, only to come back on another 90 seconds or so later like the first time.  After about 15 minutes, the light then was completely gone as it continued heading SSW. Any ideas?  This was I believe about a week after one could look straight up and see the space station..is that what I saw? Perhaps a satellite? I thought the light going on &amp; off with appraoching aircraft was odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in this exact sky that approx 20 years ago I witnessed, as many people have reported on here, two objects (in the night sky) &#34;playing tag with one another&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Jupiter??

At approximately 9:40 pm a triangular shape of three lights appeared directly overhead going from north to south traveling very fast and without a sound. It seemed to come into view not quite over head like a satellite does when it come out of the shadow of the Earth from the sun, but then continued consistent until it went behind the neighbor’s tree line. It lasted about a five to six second count. The lights were not bright. They were dim or orange in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just entering Hwy 5 we noticed two large strings of lights in the sky on the east side of the highway.  First thinking that they were C-130 aircraft from the airbase we pointed them out to our ten year old son.  We observed that the lights were stationary.  Closer observation showed to prove the craft much larger and much farther away than we first thought.  We took note of the lights remaining where they were first observed util we drove out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/11/07 21:00|New Holland|OH|Light|45min-1 1/2hr|strange bright lights in sky south of New Holland Ohio|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58687.html|302|ndxe200709| strange bright lights in sky south of New Holland Ohio<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 51 year old of sound mind. I was watching television last night around 9pm.  The weather had cooled of enough, that I shut off the air con. and opened up the house.  I was watching Fox News and was sitting on the couch.  The front of our house faces south, into open farm fields.  About 1/2 mile is a tower for cell phones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have all the lights on in the living room, and that makes it hard to see anything outside. I see a bright light light up in the sky on the east side of the tower, then it fades within a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing I think is some kind of missel flash, it is 9/11 and this is on everyones mind.  I go to the front door to get a better look, and I see 3 very bright lights light up, not realy in a row, just randam. These also fade to nothing within 5 to 6 sec. I witness this for the next 15 min. not in any pattern, or time frame. I can also see regular air craft flying normal off in the distance. These lights were not aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I think I must be nuts. I go outside and stand in our driveway. Again I see the 3 bright lights for about 6 sec. and they fade. I call my husband who is at work in Circleville and explane to him what I am seeing. As I am on the phone I see it at least once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I go back into the house to get my camera to take a picture if I could. I go back to the driveway and see the 3 lights again, the do not at any time light up together, but light up like counting one, two, three and then fade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last time I saw the lights, was on the west side of the tower, and one became very bright, and in a very straight line five or six others appeaired, one right after the other, and then faded in the same way as the rest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a little scared at that point, I guess the unknown. I am not a nut case. I own a boarding and grooming kennel, I have raised 3 sons, two of them are Police Officers. I have never seen anything like this. I do not think they were flairs. We have also have a home at Lake Erie and I have seen flairs over the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was up till three am watching, and nothing after the row of them on the west side of the tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were round, very bright, like a planet in the sky only ten times brighter and fades in a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They pulsed independent of each other in a random series three times.  They all took off in different directions with what seemed to be sparks flying behind them faster than any airplane or helicopter.  My husband at first thought they were comets but they circled back over the house again.  Two of them seem to stay together while the other two flew into the woods across from us and the other over the back of our house. We could not hear a sound except where ever their location was, the dogs in those particular areas would start barking.  Our two dogs were barking and they were in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have lived in this location for a short time. My father has lived here for the past twelve years and he claims he’s seen the same type of ‘stars’ many times.  Most people in the area blame the goings on with an Air Force Base over thirty miles away. This area was much closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object was apparently traveling away from Earth at a very high speed. Object was no longer visible after about 4 seconds. The object remained bright white and did not flicker, blink, or emit any meteor-like trail. Do not believe it was a &#39;shooting star&#39; or any known aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Those lights appeared to be traveling around the circumference of a disk, disappearing on the right side and coming back around on the left, with the white light at the center of the under side. Even if, in the distance and darkness, I could only see lights, the impression of a disc-like object was reinforced by the flattening of that shape as it moved away in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first the apparent size was that of a compact disc held at arm length. By the time I lost site of it behind trees at the Coldwater off-ramp it had shrunk to maybe a quarter of that size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later when I had again an unobstructed view of this area of the sky, all I could see was the regular air traffic. A plane was taking off nearby Burbank airport directly in the flight path of  whatever I had seen and a couple of choppers or small planes were up over the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my knowledge, nothing was ever reported by local papers or radios.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent a report to a local newspaper but never heard back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 43 years old professional designer and art director. I am married and a father of three lovely kids. I have lived in this neighborhood for 14 years and I am well accustomed to the usual air traffic in the area including the occasional blimp.  This was nothing I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely.<n>

We were hiking in the area near Old Tucson Studios with Golden Gate Mountain in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 9:00 a.m. September 11, 2007 a golden triangular object hovered west of Tucson, Arizona over the Tucson Mountains between Golden Gate Mountain and Old Tucson Studios.  The object was as big as a dime with arm extended, on a clear day with few clouds. The clouds closest to the golden triangular object were most brilliant and vivid compared to the other clouds furthest away from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There appeared to be a dome in the center of the golden triangular object with the sun’s shadow visible on one side.  Also the triangle reshaped into a golden half moon or dome before vanishing into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Image of the golden triangular object was captured on digital camera and printed on 8x10 enlargement glossy Fuji photo paper at a local Walgreens by my friend, a Tucsonian, who immediately recognized it as a UFO.

9/11/07 00:10|Vancouver (Canada)|BC|Formation|5 minutes|4  bluish-white lights flying in fomation at very high altitude|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58887.html|311|ndxe200709| 4  bluish-white lights flying in fomation at very high altitude<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to my backyard to move the sprinklers to a new position before bed. The sky was perfectly clear and the typical visable stars were crystal clear. As I was returning back to the house, I noticed a moving light in the upper left portion of the sky. As I observed closer, I realized the light was actually four distinct lights not one. Three of the lights were in a triangular pattern and one light was off directly off to the right. They were moving south-west across the sky. The altitude was very high. I intially thought the lights were a single satillite. I have seen numerous satillites over the years and these lights looked nothing like any satillite I have ever seen. The altitude seemed right but the speed seemed faster than a satillite. I realized that these lights were not multiple satillites travelling together or a commercial airlliner. The lights were bluish-white and did not blink. The lights stayed almost equal distances apart without any variations in formation. The lights were definetley seperate entities as i could see the night sky between them. They made no sound. I was able to observe the lights for approxiamatley 6 seconds before they faded from view. I couldn&#39;t see any high altitude clouds but figured that may possibly have been the reason I lost view of them. I was in trying to associate the lights to all my past experience with aircraft or satellites to make sense of what I saw. I have never seen anything like these lights before. I&#39;m still mystfied. I don&#39;t drink or smoke (anything). I was well rested and not under any stress. I cannot expain what I saw. I find it hard to believe that in the highly populated area of North Burnaby, BC. that I was the only one to witness this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking up at the sky and noticed a series of lights which living on a flight path thought it was a jet at high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon further viewing I noticed that there was more than 1 light (8 or maybe 10) in a straight line formation going across the sky from East to West. The line was a series of dots (a bit like tracer bullets being fired). These were in a perfect straight line but for a moment the back 3 or 4 fish tailed up then went back into formation. They travelled faster than a jet and were uniformly spaced out. This is a legitimate sighting but I have no other proof. I asked my wife had she seen it but she put it down to a plane. I just needed to tell someone about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

After that I went to my part time job.  There was nothing to my mind that was out of the ordinary.  It was a boring day at my regular job and slow at my part time job since there was hardly any customers.  After getting out of work I went to Target to buy a coke and Doritos flirted with the cashier and went on to the bus stop that takes me to the corner of Wickersham and Oltorf.  This area is at a high point and you can see the downtown area and it’s sky line.  There was a thunderstorm also moving in and was coloring the sky red then lightning would flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was walking to my apartment I saw something flying over the downtown Austin area heading south.  I was standing in the middle of the side walk between Oltorf and the High Point Apartments looking at this thing because it was slowly making it’s way south and it was flying to low and too slow to be a plane.  When I thought it could be a blimp it flashed several colors of red, yellow, blue, in a multiple square formation.  A helicopter with one spot light was flying south and keeping it’s distance from the object.  I would say it flew above the Ben White HWY area and it was flying higher then the object I was looking at.  That was when it reversed it’s direction and headed north east.  (It did not make a U-turn).  I needed a witness but nobody was walking near by.  I called my sister via cel phone but did not answer.  Then at 8:55pm I called a co worker who was outside her house and told her to look south and she let out a big gasp she yelled, “what is that”!  She lives in north Austin.  We stayed on the phones looking at this thing.  As it moved back to the downtown area it moved around the downtown area and moved north east.  It then picked up speed and moved faster and out of my sight.  We stayed on the phone for a while more reveling at what we saw and then ended our call.  I told my roommate of what I saw.  He said he believed me and I told him if he were to come in that night and said he just saw what I just saw I would not believe him.  I am typing this because other people have come forward in the past on a web site called http://www.ufomaps.com/city/Austin My co-worker and the people who saying they saw the same thing I saw is more then I want to think about.  Why it was not in the news I do not know.  About an hour later my best friend called to talk about a possible hunting trip for December.  I did not talk about what I saw.  To me it is now the difference of living my regular way of life.  I do not do drugs, don&#39;t drink, nor was I on any medication.  I do not consider myself wanting any special attention from strangers.  I will never mention this to anybody even if the subject is about UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know where to go from here.  I think UFO’s exist I just would never think I would ever see one myself.  This to me is just plain mind numbing.  I don’t want to think about, talk about, let alone write about what I saw that night.  This will go as far as I would want to go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were hunting out in the desert about 100 miles south of Burns Junction, when just at dusk I saw what were extrememly large Chevron shaped amber/orange glowing lights all in sink, shaped into a &#34;V&#34; (but a horizontal V), approximatley 20 miles away and each one was about the size of the moon.  I yelled for my buddy to hur ry up and come look, and within that time, 2 of the lights, one by one, went out, then they came back on. Then a few minutes later, all of them went out.  About 10-15 seconds went by, and the 5 lights reappeared again, however, this time they were about 100 miles away and the lights looked about half the size of the moon.  Then they all disappeared at once and we never saw it again.  There was no sound whatsoever during any of this, and normally, with how close, we should have heard some type of sound from it, butbeing out in the middle of nowhere, you could hear very well, and we heard no sound at all from this aircraft.  We were extremely weirded out by it as we have NEVER in our lives seen anything remotely like this.  Even my buddy who is a retired Federal Agent - and neither of us feel this was any aircraft from here, unless some type of undisclosed govermental experiment as it was just too large and eary.  We are truly perplexed by this.  We got a little worried and decided we should pack up early and get out of the area and go home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Developer in the construction business, age 54 My buddy, a Retired Federal Agent, age 63<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone in the Southeast Region of Oregon see anything similar to this around this this date/time?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We were facing west, and the sky was partly cloudy, with low humidity. The clouds were passing by with alot of space between them, and the sky was very blue. As we talked I saw a silver sparkle over my right shoulder. I looked and saw a tube/cylinder shaped object passing through the clouds. I told my son to look (we have seen 3 objects while together since 2003). He saw it and we started making comments to help us remember what we saw. There were no wings, no con-trails, no sound, and the tube shape was very visible. The object was heading southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Unsure if my eyes were playing tricks on me I asked my roommate who was sitting next to me if he thought the star was changing colors. He agreed that is was definitely flashing different colors. Being extremely high up it was hard to make out a definitive shape but it was flashing red blue green and white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He reasoned that it could be a plane extremely high up and heading straight for us and that was why it looked like it wasn’t moving. However, after about half an hour of watching it continued to remain stationary. Also, agreeing that neither one of us had ever seen a plane that flashed that many color and in such rapid succession. The flashing most resemble the flashing of a police car if you added green and white into the mix. I looked at other stars to see if maybe there was moisture or something else in the air that could be causing the color changes however all the other stars, including ones near the UFO appeared normal not even showing much scintillation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed a pair of binoculars and peered at the object however they were to low power to help much. The colors and strobing was easier to make out with the binoculars but not much else. I took some pictures with my digital camera to see if it could give many any detail however it is to old and cannot zoom so it was of little use as well. In conclusion, we both agreed it was not a star however we cannot explain the multicolor strobing no why it remained stationary. The object was still in the sky when we retired to the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keep in mind that both my roommate and I always look for the most likely causes for this type of phenomenon but were not able to reason one on this night. It should be noted as well that neither one of us was on any king of drug or medication at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It happened a while back so the date isn&#39;t exact, but the year and time is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing on my front porch in a very rural part of North Robertsdale.  I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and noticed out of the southwest (My porch faced west) this spinning object moved across the sky due east.  At first it looked like one of the many satellites that can be seen moving across a clear sky at night, but I noticed it was rotating like a well thrown football does (Sorry, best way I could think to describe it).  As it moved closer I could see the light wasn&#39;t just on the object, but was beaming off of it, like a hugely powerful spotlight.  As the light rotated around the craft the beam was reaching out a great distance as it rotated around the object.  As it got closer the beam was brighter, until finally as it moved over head, the beam made a sweep across my yard, again directly over me, and continued across the field behind my home and presumably along the entire direct route that the object traveled until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light was very bright, and swept rather quickly, but lit up everything it went across like it was daytime.  I was frozen in terror.  I had of course heard UFO stories and never really knew what to make of the subject.  But that thought in my mind that it might be a UFO scared me like few things have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately went inside and started searching the internet for satellite sightings and if there were any that rotated and would maybe reflect the sun off it&#39;s panels.  I never did find an answer to that question and I&#39;m hoping maybe someone here can help me come to understand what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve only told a couple friends about it and never reported it because I always thought it was probably a satellite.  But every year or so it pops back in my head and I search for a while to see if anyone could explain it for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So please, if anyone can help me understand what I saw or reaffirm that it actually was just a satellite, please get back to me as soon as you can.  Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

At least that is what I thought at first,then maybe a plane,mmm. Wasnt moving, saw other planes flying flashing lights, but what got my attention was the flashing light changeing red, green, blue, then bright white. The light is north of me, so I went and grabbed my binoculars.So once I had them and took a look I was and am still not sure what I saw. Very bright green then red then blue and white flashing lights. Now this sounds strange but I thought it changed shape from a small star shaped light to a triangle shaped light, all the while change colors. So I then picked out a couple diffrent stars and looked at them,not the same. I watched it for about fifteen min. Don&#39;t have a clue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of Sirius.  PD))<n>

9/9/07 22:00|Keizer|OR|Formation|Aprox 7 Minutes|Two bright lights hovering and then accelerating.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58654.html|324|ndxe200709| Two bright lights hovering and then accelerating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was just outside, around 10pm my time, having a smoke and looking up at the constellations. Watching for shooting stars and satelites like I always do. Out of the corner of my eye I notice 2 bright white lights that are sitting right over my head way up in the clear sky. They are a little ways apart, but definately sitting right next to eachother. My first thought was &#34;Why are there two super bright venus&#39;s right over my head tonight?&#34;. I just wasn&#39;t comprehending what I was seeing. It shouldn&#39;t be there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I am watching these two very bright stars that have never been there before for about 2 or 3 minutes when suddenly they start moving! They go north a bit. Then they stop. The one on the left stays put and the one on the right takes off! It goes North a bit more and then stops, winks out.. I&#39;m thinking I&#39;d lost track of it at this point. But no... it lights up with this brilliant white light, fades out for 4 or 5 seconds, travels and then positively pulsates with brilliant white light... goes out for 4 or 5 seconds, lights up again. It eventually gets too far north for me to see and I lose track of that one after about 2 more bright pulsations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one on the left is still hovering, after another 30 seconds or so it fades a little like it gained altitude, starts to move, and then... zip.. shoots off after the other one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither object made any noise. As bright as they were I would have expected to hear something if it were any kind of conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still trying to comprehend what it could have been. I was so awestruck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an ex military wife and have done some government work. My husband is disabled and I am returning to college concentrating on the health information technology profession.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in the path of Salem airport and I am used to seeing air traffic and even some odd looking experimental type planes traveling north to south and back.  This was something I&#39;ve never seen before. There were no planes within sight during the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This made me stop and pull over at the intersection because as I was sitting waiting for the light, the object made two distinct 90* turn&#39;s while still in forward flight, in other word&#39;s, it was still maintaing it&#39;s forward speed in our direction but jumped to it&#39;s right without turning or making an arc, and the back to it&#39;s original position in the same manner. I stopped the car after rounding the corner and pulled off in the dirt, my son and daughter both opened their door&#39;s and looked up with me, at this point it came to a halt directly above us and hovered I would say between 2 and 3000 ft, the biggest difference the object and a helicopter was that aside from the serious lack of sound from this thing, was that as it hovered, it&#39;s movement&#39;s were likened to that of a plate with a string superglued to the middle on it&#39;s top and being spun by hand kind of gently as to give it a slight wobble, the light from our area of town was slighty lighting up the bottom of the craft so asid from the emmission&#39;s of it&#39;s own light we probaly could have seen it to some degree with it&#39;s light&#39;s off if we knew where to look, the shape of the object was as best as I can describe it was semi-rounded on it&#39;s forward direction but fasceted to some degree on the rear area, the object started heading by my reckoning to the south-east kind of heading down the valley, not fast at all but it would hold-up in a position for short period&#39;s of time while makin small directional change&#39;s within the are! a it was stopped in. The manerism&#39;s it had for making directional change&#39;s was the oddest part for me, if you have ever seen a radio controlled aircraft go through directional change&#39;s, it&#39;s kind of jerky and eratic, but still make&#39;s nearly 90*turn&#39;s, I contacted sacramento metropolitan airport but found no one who cared, oh well!!<n>

The object appeared to be a bright star/light and would change colors from red, white and greenish blue. This was a very fast color change that took place. If you had blinked you would have almost missed it .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had appreard to sit idle for sometime in the sky as if were waiting for direction . While sitting idle hoovering in the western sky over the gulf of mexico, it would dim and then just about fade out completely and then become super brilliant in color , always maintaining a star/light like shape or visual appearance to the naked eye. Its movements were not what one would think an airplane could do almost zig zagged at times and seemed to disperse a very faint light like flare or a spark if you will , sent out in any direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes I telephoned a friend who had witnessed the same type of star/light like object a week prior to what I was observing at the moment and had for the past 3 nights . I asked her to describe what her and her daughter had seen in the skys over Clearwater the week prior because I was watching an object that was very similiar in nature to what they had witnessed. (Clearwater is About 30 minutes from St.Petersburg.)  She described that same light pattern , Star/light like appearance of the object and the same idle and cruising pattern as I had observed and the movements of the object, we talked for almost ten minutes about the object as they searched the sky south west of their home for what  was being  described to them .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object began to pick up speed and was out of my eye range in seconds (blocked by a ten story building) as it headed east north east over towards Tampa Bay .  Just then I spotted a second Star/light like object with the same pattern of lights, movement and flight path as the first. This object appeared out of no where just like the first had .<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends couldnt see much due to the Clouds over their area. I wished them a good night and would keep them posted as to what was observed at night . I ended the call and researched on the pc about any sightings in this area or across the state of florida this month or the month prior . Your site had come up on the search and here is my post.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a 3rd object just as typing this post was nearing an end .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object my friend had witnessed was reported to be in the AM some time around 4:30 am - 5:30 am .  The objects that were witnessed by myself appeared between 8:00pm - 9:00pm .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hopefully others have seen these objects and will have similiar accounts to tell .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best Wishes, Spotted in St.Petersburg<n>

9/9/07 17:00|Austin|TX|Sphere|10-15 minutes|Afternoon sighting of stationary white spherical object|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58665.html|328|ndxe200709| Afternoon sighting of stationary white spherical object<n> <n><n> <n><n> Late in the afternoon of a bright and clear day, my daughters and I were taking a walk along what is known as Auditorium Shores in downtown Austin Texas.  The Colorado River (or Town Lake as it is called) runs through the city of Austin and there is a green belt, with hike and bike trails running parallel to the river on both sides.  I was looking up at the sky, which was particularly blue with beautiful cumulous nimbus cloud formations, when I spotted a small white circular object almost directly above us.  The object appeared to be stationary and was positioned very high in the sky.  I was very surprised and I pointed it out to my two (almost) teenage daughters.  I tried to recognize it as possibly a planet, or a balloon or even a strange and bright star but could not say it was any of those things.  It was the same color as the beautiful cumulous nimbus clouds but of apparent solid structure with a definitive circumference.  We stopped walking and began to only observe the object.  Like I mentioned it appeared to be stationary, white in color and circular in shape.  While observing the object a large plane, which I recognized as a commercial airliner, flew near it and I was able to compare the object to the plane.   The object appeared to be higher in the atmosphere than the plane which looked pretty small.  The plane was at an angle as if it was climbing to cruising altitude.   The airliner cruised on by the object, strengthening my conviction that the object was not traveling in the sky, but was stationary.   I looked around often to observe the people out walking, running, biking and fishing along Town Lake.  No one appeared to be aware of the object.  We began walking again and periodically looking back up at the object.  After a few moments, my daughter started exclaiming that the object was breaking into two pieces!  I looked up again, refocused my gaze.  I too observed what appeared to now be two circular objects; however their sides appeared to still be touching.   I readjuste! d my eye s for several different looks as I know that an object at a distance can appear to be two due to a trick of our eyes.  No matter how I readjusted my gaze the object did appear to be morphing into two circular objects.  After only a few moments, it appeared to morph back into one object again.  My daughter and I where exasperated and excited by the strange behavior!  A few minutes later, we came upon a man fishing and we stopped to point out the object to him.  Due to his confinement in a wheel chair and apparent poor eye sight he never was able to see the object.    He could not position his head to look almost directly above us to see the object.  The man felt it might be a planet and politely dismissed us.   Not wanting to appear strange I quickly agreed with him.  About that time a cloud began to move in front of the object.   I could still see it through the cloud cover for several more minutes but by this point the novelty was wearing off and we resumed our hike.   Even if it is a UFO, I thought to myself, it is positioned too far off and people where not even noticing it.   Nevertheless, I looked diligently in that area of the sky for the remainder of the hike and did not see the object again even though the cloud had moved on.  I took the man’s assumption that it was probably a planet to heart.  I felt that if it was a planet I would be able to see it when the clouds moved on, but I never saw it again during the rest of the day.   I scanned the whole sky looking for the object but it was gone.  So upon returning home I looked on the internet to see what planet might be visible to the naked eye during daylight hours at this time of year and at our location.  I could not find any information pertaining to a day time planet visibility for our area or anywhere near us for that matter.   I am baffled as to the odd behavior of the object and felt that if it was a planet it would not have apparently morphed into two objects nor would it disappear from view.   A planet would have remained on its path thro! ugh the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Directly above the couch on the ceiling is a skylight. I happened to gaze up through the skylight at the blue sky and noticed what I initially thought was a very bright star. But, as I watched it it moved slowly from left to right. It also changed in light intensity. When I initially spotted it it was very noticeable; it would fade and re-brighten. After a few moments I decided to get my brother to come look at it too (to make sure what I was seeing was real). Once he came downstairs and I pointed it out to him he also thought it was very strange. He confirmed that it was indeed moving back and forth. At this time he also noticed some fainter star like objects close to the main object which also appeared to move slowly. As we watched them some of the objects would disappear and then reappear a few seconds later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen satellites on clear nights moving across the night sky, and know that these were definitely not satellites. As far as I know satellites move along a linear trajectory; these definitely were free moving. The fact that they could disappear and reappear in a different spot was mysterious. I have no idea what these objects were but they were definitely not like anything I have ever seen. To give you some background, I am located about 20 miles from O&#39;Hare International airport, so I see alot of aircraft in the sky here. This was absolutely not a high altitude, man-made plane of any type.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly, over the tops of the trees we both saw a V formation of 5 lights swoop in the sky.  It strongly resembled the size and formation and height in the sky of Canada geese.  Each of the five objects seemed to be a single glowing white-yellow light.  There weren&#39;t any rays of light.  The formation moved quickly and silently.  The v-formation moved in tandem like a ribbon undulating across the sky. It followed the direction of the road. It disappeared over the tree tops at the end of the street.  It was too fast for birds.  It was too dark to see birds.  It was too late at night for birds to be flying in this manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 11:30 pm.  I saw what looked like a shooting star in the sky, in front of us (it was in front, in the general direction toward which we were heading, slightly toward the right) and I immediately pointed it out to my 11 year old son who was in the back seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, (and this all happened pretty quickly, driving around 65mph) as I continued to look where the shooting star was I noticed there was a blue light with a red light next to it right where I had seen the shooting star.   I figured it was a plane.  I kept my eye on it, though, and it didn’t move.  We got closer and closer, until we were both looking up at it, and eventually driving under it.  I slowed down a bit, to see if maybe it was moving, but it wasn’t.  I didn’t slow down for long, though, because once I realized this thing wasn’t a plane I got out of there.  The lights were in a cigar shape, right next to each other, both sort of elongated, if that makes sense – I say this so as not to give the impression that they were two dots next to each other.  They were sort of like a bar, some blue to the left, red to the right.  I didn’t get a good enough look to see if there was anything black behind them, or any other shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a little freaked, as before posting I read two other recent reports from Arkansas where both descriptions sound a little similar to our experience.  I definitely saw the white light, it made a flash, moved a bit (I figured shooting star?) then the defined blue and red lights.  Again, it was stationary as we approached, stayed right where it was, and we passed under it, with it staying a little bit to the right of the car, high overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college graduate and an agnostic (rare for these parts) if that makes any difference.  I’ve never seen anything like this before in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was totally clear – all you could see were the stars.  I was putting my head back in disgust of how fast the day had gone by in other words, in other words..  I wasn’t looking for UFO’s… in fact, I never look for weird things in the sky. Within seconds of looking up at the dark sky I saw a bright white light that seemed could have been as high as 10,000 feet in the air, suddenly became smaller and smaller as it seemed to climb in elevation and move in a northwesterly direction at a startling rate of speed. I jumped out of my lawn chair and immediately pointed to it trying to get my wife’s attention.  She was able to see it climb and disappear in probably less than 5 seconds.  Unfortunately she missed out on seeing just how low to the earth it was and how incredibly bright it was before it started to take off.  She agreed that it did appear to be moving upward and very fast. My wife who used to be a flight attendent, obviously has been around a lot of airports and has seen a lot of thing- but she said this was certainly something to report.  It was truly amazing to see something like this.  I have seen satellites, shooting stars and have even watched the space shuttle land.  This was something special to see and for me – unexplainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But a minuet or so later my friend was bagging on the window again so this time I grabbed my phone and got it ready and was able to take a picture and also record the lights (the lights were a orangey yellow) as I was recording the lights started to dim and on light started to move away to the point were I could no longer see them, when we both went inside my friend asked me if I saw the too jet planes that went passed at full speed which sadly I did not see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be posting the picture on youtube under the key words of Ufo, nw1, camden<n>

The speed was quite fast and made no noise whatsoever despite the appearance of behing fairly close. The V Shaped formation remained perfectly distances from each other during the whole occurance. I ran inside briefly though my patio door to get my wife, sister in law and my son. I turned back to watch the formation just in time for the lights to dim completely and then disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We see quite a lot of airplanes land and take off from ST-Hubert&#39;s airport, commercial and military on occasions by at the speed these thigs flew, there should have been noise like other usual take offs and the lights were not regular red/white/blue blinking position lights were used to see. Just plain orange/redish dots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously, my wife and sister in law now think it&#39;s a joke buy I am certain I am not the only one who noticed as the sky was ckear and the temperature outside was quite pleasant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don&#39;t knopw what exactly I saw but I absolutely saw with my owb eyes,  Is there any way I can find out if soneone else say this too ?

It appeared to be illuminated underneath and was da dim red color barely noticeable but it could still be picked out in the light cloud cover it moved into. It moved from North West to the South East at a high rate of speed and then began to slow somewhat. My outdoor flood light which is on a motion sensor went off illuminating myself in the backyard and I then saw the object slow down and hover for about five minutes. My flood lamp timed out and shut off and I then watched the object move off to the South West. It was almost as if the thing was watching me watching it because it did not stop and hover until my flood light went off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I ran and got my digital camera and took a short video clip and a couple of pics which I zoomed in as much as I could. I ran back in and got my binoculars and ran back out, but it was gone by then.  So I came in and put the memory card into the printer and uploaded the images.  When I watched the video clip all I got was a bunch of weird noises. So just in case the camera was not workin&#39; right, I took another short clip in the house and outside and each one of those were just fine.  I shall send these to you email.  Hopefully you can know what kind of craft like that can go thru at that altitude and not make a single bit of noise.  I&#39;ve seen regular jet planes and airplanes go about and they make A LOT of noise.  It was like they were emitting some kind of static and the camera picked it up.  A couple years ago me and my ex-boyfriend were sittin&#39; outside and we both saw one go by at that same altitude and no noise.  I didn&#39;t have a digital then tho.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Watched for about 2 to 3 mins for it to reappear but it did not.  This was from the Costco parking lot looking towards the Monroe area.  The object was about jet flight high.  A lone one engine plane passed and the object was about a dime sized  behind this low flying plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/8/07 14:00|Grover Beach|CA|Triangle|15-20 Seconds|Small Triangular object seen while flying at 9,000 feet over Grover Beach, California|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58628.html|343|ndxe200709| Small Triangular object seen while flying at 9,000 feet over Grover Beach, California<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred in flight on 8 September 07 at approximately 1400 PDT in the area of Grover Beach/Arroyo Grande California. I was flying a single engine civilian aircraft on an IFR flight from Monterey California to Santa Barbara. We were southeast bound flying direct to the Gaviota VOR (a radio navigation beacon near Santa Barbara) at 9,000 feet. We were in visual meteorological conditions with clear skies and 30+ miles of visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really don’t know how to describe what I saw. This wasn’t a classic “flying disc” type UFO.  As I stated earlier, we were in cruise flight at 9,000 feet pretty much directly over the Grover Beach area when I noticed a small object or objects at about our 10-11 o’clock position perhaps 300-500 feet below us and traveling in the opposite direction. It passed under the wing and I lost sight of it for a few seconds until it reappeared just behind the wing. I lost sight of it as it passed to about our 7 o’clock position. I observed it for perhaps 15-20 seconds. Not long, I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing I want to emphasize in my description of this object(s) was that it was small. I would say no more than 5-10 feet across. At first, I thought I was looking at two birds flying close together.  There were two distinct “bodies” or shapes that were either attached to one another or flying in a very close echelon type formation. One object slightly behind and to the right of the other.  As it approached, I became unsure if I was looking at two separate objects flying close together or a single object. As I said before, this thing was small but as the object got closer, I thought the two separate bodies looked somewhat triangular or diamond shaped. What was really remarkable about the object though was its color. This thing was an amazing blue color. I find it difficult to describe the shade of blue but I would say it was slightly darker than a “sky” blue but not much. The color is what really made me think I was looking at something artificial. It stood out against the generally brown/tan color of the ground but if you were below and looking up at it, it would have been very difficult to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A wayward kite? Some sort of remote controlled aircraft or UAV? Something else? I have no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/8/07 10:00|Santa Maria|CA|Oval|10-15 seconds|It was oval and grey white with no lights traveling really fast and really low with no sound.|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61137.html|344|ndxe200709| It was oval and grey white with no lights traveling really fast and really low with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a slender oval shaped object moving at a high rate of speed over farmland then into city area and then lost visual sight of the object. This time line is only 10 to 15 seconds.  The color of  the object was a white grey.  I live in a small city of  Guadalupe which is 7miles west of  Santa Maria, CA.  Between these two cities is seven miles of farmland, very flat farmland. We were traveling east on highway 166 from Guadalupe when we saw this thing around 10am.  I was driving , my wife sitting shotgun and my three kids in the middle seat of our Suburban.  The morning was solid overcast, but very well lit.  The object was only approximately 50 ft. long.  It was flying very low only about 200 to 300 feet off the ground that is why we all noticed it.  As soon as I noticed it I immediately rolled down my window to see if I could hear it flying.  Guadalupe is only 17 miles from Vandenberg  Air Force Base, and Santa Maria has an airshow with fighter jets and they do travel fast and low.  When at the air shows those jets, traveling away from you low, make a tremendous amount of noise at high speed.  That is why when I saw the object I tried to listen to hear the noise, the kids think it’s cool.  While waiting to here some noise I notice that there wasn’t any distinct lines or features on this thing and then  it is gone over the city.   The object traveled into over the city of Santa Maria. We have a telescope, my kids and I look at stars, planets and meteor showers.  I hunt, fish and often record the rocket launches over the hill at VAFB.  I see the airshows and this did not look like any plane.   This incident happened on 9-8-2007.   The reason I haven’t  reported it until today  1-23-2008 is I just learned there was a place in which to report events like mine.  I remember the date and time because my son lost his soccer game socks and we were going to buy a new pair so he could play.  Not telling anyone of this incident really bugged me. Meaning people like you, so others could see if th! ey were not the only ones too.  I know in my case you don’t want to say anything in fear of being ridiculed.  Even though there were five of us who saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Got up early and noticed as I looked south that the same bright “star” I’d seen the night before was still in the same spot. Within a couple minutes the “star” began sporadically moving, stopping in the east sky. The sun was just coming up but had not yet impaired my vision. It immediately became clear that the object was no longer star-shaped, but more V-shaped. It was white, like a wisp of cloud. I watched for about 20 minutes as it appeared to alternately thrash about, then float. After those 20 minutes  it’s movements stabilized and it moved toward the east and gradually upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took several photographs and did not notice until reviewing them that there was a second object below and slightly south of the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of Venus.

After spotting a couple of normal ones, I saw a very unusual one. This one’s flight characteristic seemed to be like a butterfly in a strong breeze except very, very high up (high up enough to reflect sunlight at about 4:15am).  It appeared to be climbing in altitude quickly also. It was headed in a southerly direction and headed into Orion. As it climbed, it seemed to slow and then just lazily move towards the westerly foot (star name = Rigel) of Orion. I pointed this out to a passing stranger who showed no particular interest. As it reached Rigel, it slowed to a stop and reversed course. It was as faint as a smaller satellite at this point, and proceeded slowly in a northern direction past Meissa (Orion’s head), past Mars and to Triangulum. At approximately the star Perseus, the object made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the east and started to slowly accelerate at first. A couple of women with their 2 children came to sit next to me and I pointed this out to them, they focused in quickly, and the object accelerated  to the point that it went from almost straight above us to the horizon in about 2 seconds while the apparent size grew from a small, dim star to a large size star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have watched the stars since I was a child, and have studied astronomy for decades. The flight characteristics of this object matched no known aircraft that I have ever heard of as far as fluttering, ability to make an instantaneous 90 degree turn at high velocity, or speed. To go from straight above to beyond the horizon at that altitude constitutes speeds that NASA could not duplicate in their wildest dreams.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We went out and proceeded to sit on the rocks surrounding the outside of the field at the Mount Misery campground portion of the forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was perfectly clear and there were no clouds nor was the moon visible. There weren&#39;t any planes either, just a sky full of stars. I was looking up at the Southwest portion of the clearing and my girlfriend had her back to where I was looking and was walking towards me, when out of nowhere a rectangular object with 4 bands of light ranging from red, orange, yellow and pink appeared in the sky roughly about a football field length away from me over the tree line on the other side of the field. It was low flying and above the tree line but not by much. It started out small, about 1 school bus in length and about 3 in height [relative for that distance away. that is the best measurement I could think of]  and then when it moved from right to left in the sky it expanded to about 3 school busses in length.  I shouted for her to turn around but when she did it disappeared from site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got pretty freaked out and proceeded to walk back to our campsite. I at first tried to convince myself that it was a shooting star but after talking to my girlfriend for a bit we came to the conclusion that what I saw was a possible UFO. We noticed that soon after what I saw, several planes were flying over the area about a half hour later.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I lay on my blanket steering at the sky all of a sudden a &#34;v&#34; shaped object flew out of the clouds into clear sky and back into clouds. There where 5 lights total on the object; moving extremely fast. There where other air craft in the sky as I had seen red/blinking white lights for air craft. This however was not a plane. The size was huge. Only white lights...not blinking.  It lasted maybe 8 seconds and then it was gone. Conditions outside over the gulf where rain towards the west out in the gulf with lightning burst.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went inside the house and retrieved my 8 x 30mm binoculars. I focused the lenses, and I cold barely see the object: However, it appears that it had a round center with bicycle spokes, and the object did not move. Since the object was so far I kept losing it since my binoculars were hand supported. i found the object several times, and it appears to have move just a bit or perhaps it was the earth&#39;s rotation. I found the object at approximately 18:05 and this time I was looking at TWO objects instead of one.my wife witnessed the first object, and I went inside the house to tell her that a second object had appeared. My wife did not get to witness the second object because both disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 65 years old,and my last sighting was in the late 1940&#39;s in the El Paso area.At that particular time the newspapers reported that they were Helium balloons., in the both sightings I had to really focus my eyes in order to identify the objects. The objects did nothing. I hope that you can notify someone in the El Paso,TX area who has the right knowledge and equipment since this incident happened in a clear and sunny day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I just got back from my vacation at Myrtle Beach.  We were there since 8/31 and just got back today, Friday 9/7/07.  We stayed in North Myrtle Beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night (Thursday 9/6/07) around 11:30 pm, my friend and I were walking along the beach toward the Apache Pier. We were in deep conversation as I looked up to my left at the clear night sky over the ocean.  There were a few cumulous clouds that were visible.  As I looked, I saw a bright orange slow moving object moving to the north.  At first I thought it was plane, but it didn’t look like a typical plane light you would see at night.  Before I could say anything to my friend, it faded away.  Consequently, I just let it go and didn’t mention anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after that moment, we turned around and started walking back to our resort.  About 15 minutes later, my friend nudged me as he pointed up to the sky and asked, “What is that?”  There in the sky, was the same slow orange light.  As we both watched in silence, the light separated into 5 or 6 other orange lights that lined up in a perfectly straight diagonal line.  Then, in perfect unison, they slowly started moving to the left.  Then they simultaneously faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither one of us could come up with a reasonable explanation.  My friend’s first proposed explanation was that it could have been a flare.  But can a flare separate into 5 or 6 other orange lights, evenly spaced apart in a perfect diagonal line, and all move in unison in the same direction?  We stood there staring for about 15 more minutes, hoping that the strange lights would reappear.  Unfortunately, that was the last we saw of them.  As we walked back to the resort we kept our eyes on the sky.  We even stayed on our balcony for a good while.  We were hoping that there would be something about it in the news this morning.  But no such luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would just like to add that I’m not a believer in little green men visiting the earth from other planets.  I’m just perplexed as to what this could be..  I’m sure that there is a rational explanation to this.  I would just like to know what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from this area of South Carolina.

As we were walking along a bright orange circular/cigar shaped light appeared over the ocean and then a few seconds later another one appeared.  The pair lasted for about 5 seconds. The lights were in a straight line.  We could see no planes, noise, or any other motion in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then less then 5 minutes later we saw another light.  This time roughly 6 appeared and they had moved north slightly. The first one appeared, then less then a second later the next would appear. They would only last for about 5 seconds then fade away.  In total it lasted about 10 seconds. Again, they appeared in a straight line. Both times I am unsure if they moved any distance in the sky or if they just hovered, it all just happened to fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have read many other descriptions on this site of very similar sightings to mine happening in Myrtle Beach.

On 9/5/07 we were looking out at the ocean and noticed 3 light orange lights in the sky that appeared for approx. 3 seconds and then faded away.  Then the 3 lights appeared again in a different spot and faded away after a few seconds.  This happened from 9:30PM until about 11PM and every time the 3 lights would change locations in the sky.   At times only 1 light would appear and fade away.  After about 11:30PM we didn&#39;t notice any more lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting out on the porch around 8:45PM on 9/6/07 and noticed 2 orange lights again.

None of us had been drinking or impaired in any way.  We even told our neighbors next door about it and they witnessed the lights with us on 9/5/07 around 10:30PM.  We have all seen the lights and think it&#39;s very strange.  We cannot hear any noises due to the high winds and waves crashing.  None of us here have ever witnessed something so strange so we decided to do some online research and found a bunch of other people who have seen the same type of lights.  What are they?  Will we ever know? :)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports of these lights.  We do not know what they are.  PD))<n>
9/6/07 20:40|Contoocook|NH|Triangle|5 Minutes|Three steady orange lights in a triangular formation, much bigger than a conventional aircraft, moving slowly from east to north.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58610.html|358|ndxe200709| Three steady orange lights in a triangular formation, much bigger than a conventional aircraft, moving slowly from east to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:40 pm I went outside to take a walk and noticed, in the northeast, two bright orange lights, moving slowly, in tandem toward the left.  The brighter of the two was about the same brightness as Jupiter, which has been prominent in the southwest sky for weeks now.  The second was a bit dimmer.  At first it reminded me of the tandem flyover of the space shuttle and ISS a couple months ago, except they were going the wrong direction and were completely the wrong color. However, the speed was similar, and the brighter light appeared to be following the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were low in the sky, and soon moved behind some trees. When they came back into view, I realized there were 3 orange lights, forming a broad-based triangle, with the two dimmer lights at the bottom and the brighter at the top, between them. As they headed behind some trees again, then behind the house across the street, I called for my daughter to come out of the house, and I ran around in my yard trying to find a clear view. Once my daughter was outside with me, I saw the lights once more in a gap between trees. By this time the lights were in a different configuration – as if the brighter light were “catching up” with one of the dimmer ones.  They were all slightly dimmer by that time, so I had the impression that they were moving away, toward the north. They soon dropped below the treetops and I didn&#39;t see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I think about it now, the 3 lights may have represented the corners of a very large triangular object (way bigger than an airplane), which turned toward the north while it was behind the trees, thereby changing the angle at which I was seeing the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size - if I held my arms out straight, and pretended to put one finger on each light in the sky, my fingers would be about 5-7 inches apart between the brightest light and the two dimmer ones, and about 12-13 inches apart between the two dim lights  Out of the 4 or 5 minutes that elapsed, I had perhaps 60 seconds, total, that I could actually see the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t hear anything. But then again I saw a conventional small aircraft in roughly the same area, and couldn’t hear that either.  The conventional aircraft seemed to have circled around in the same general direction as the UFO, then back again toward me. Or it could have been two different aircraft, going in two different directions. I’m wondering if there’s any way to find out if the pilot(s) saw anything?<n>

We were sitting on our music stage at work. We were facing the restaurant. I looked over my left shoulder at my buddy.  I noticed these lights. I tapped him on the shoulder and asked him what that was.  He saw it and replied, “I don’t know.” I then slapped him on the shoulder and asked him again, “What the f*** is that?!  The lights were grouped together in a kite shape.  There was one in front, one light offset to the right(just behind and to the side of the front light,) one light offset to the left(just behind and to the side of the front light,) and one light in the back( there was more space between the front and back light, than there was between the side lights.  The lights were pointing down to the ground, and you could see beams of light below these lights.  It appeared to over the trees, but was close enough to know that whatever it was, it was big.  We then stood up.  Almost as if they heard us, as soon as we stood up the lights started to dim.  I thought they were going behind the tree line.  But when I stood up, the tree line was 20-30 feet below where these lights were.  The lights dimmed to nothing, and it disappeared.. We kept our eyes on the sky.   After the lights dimmed out I could notice approx. 12 twinkling lights flying erratically in a northerly direction.  They kept moving until out of sight.  Shortly after, a small prop plane flew by, quite low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the first noise we heard in the sky. The small plane flew over the area where we had spotted these lights.  He flew by and continued towards town.  We could see and hear him circle back and then he started flying towards us.  His headlights were coming right at us, then he darted back over the highway where the lights were.  This time when he got in that area he did a complete turnaround. When he turned back, my co-worker and myself saw 6 twinkling lights coming back at us from the north.  They were heading in a southerly direction.  Then all the lights disappeared, except one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night last night. And not a whole lot of traffic in the sky, except after what we saw. For a while there, it looked like the sky was dancing. We have been trying to come up with some explanation for what we saw.  The first thing we thought was maybe it was a light tower.  But there are no light towers in the vicinity of where witnessed the lights. The lights were as bright as the ones at a football field.  They were unlike our parking lot lights, they are more reddish.  These were very bright. And then they just dimmed out, like on a dimmer switch.  No noise in the sky when the lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing like this had ever happened to us before.  We are both mind blown by what we witnessed. You can guarantee we will be out there for the next few nights.  This time I’m bringing my camera in hopes of getting it on film.<n>
9/6/07 20:25|Mechelen (Belgium)||Light|3 or 4 minutes|3 big round/ovalshaped balls of light, magnitude -4 aprox., hanging still in a triangle formation 25-30° above the western horizon|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58608.html|360|ndxe200709| 3 big round/ovalshaped balls of light, magnitude -4 aprox., hanging still in a triangle formation 25-30° above the western horizon<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday evening (Thursday 06 September 2007) around 20h25 I was travelling alone by train from Leuven to Mechelen (Belgium) reading the newspaper. When I looked up I dropped my paper cause I saw suddenly 3 balls of light hanging still in the air in a wide triangle-form. My first thought was it was maybe a reflection of my window, but it definitely kept hanging there on the same spot and when a rising cloudformation covered 2 of the 3 objects after 3 minutes of watching it out of my train window, it ruled out the possibility of being a window reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared like they were reflecting sunlight though because they were hanging in the late-evening western part of the sky, and looked orange/yellowish. They appeared to have a round form but rather oval, it’s hard to say, but they definitely didn’t appear to be pointy like a star. Furthermore, the light didn’t appear to be coming from a concentrated spot like you have with the flare of a plane or a planet/star, they looked like bright ‘ink’spots in the air, so they should have been really big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe they were hanging 25 to 30 degrees above the western horizon and I could look at them for at least 3-4 minutes! Then a cloud covered the bottom 2, which formed the basis of the triangle you could say, and only the upper one was visible. The train then made a curve and I lost them out of sight. Later in the car I pulled over a few times to have a look when I was outside the city, but that cloud had risen so they were just gone or behind the cloud but I haven’t seen them after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate they had the magnitude of Venus at its brightest, magnitude -4, but it was like there were 3 wide (no-pointlike/starlike form but broader in shape) Venuses hanging in the sky exactly in a wide triangle form, on a great distance I guess cause a cloud at the horizon covered 2 of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ‘ve seen all kinds of phenomena and have been a member of an observatory/amateurastronomer for 8 years (not anymore now) so I know basis meteorological and astronomical phenomena. I have watched the skies for so many hours and nights and seen a lot, from magnificent fireballs and meteors to satellites and iridium flashes, but nothing that was unexplainable. Never ever I saw something as yet uncomprehensible like this. If it was there, there should have been lots of people who saw it cause it was bright and clear., I don’t understand it hasn’t been on the news yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks in advance for reading<n>

The OBJECT was at a 10 to 20 degree angle from the intersection of QUINCY AND NAVAJO, and seemed to hover at about 500 to 600 feet above the ground. I turned left, parked and got out of my car. With me I had a 2 to 5 power monocular. Using a fence to steady the image, I could tell the object was indeed a cylinder, flat-black and approx. 50 to 60 FEET LONG and the WIDTH was about 1/4 of it&#39;s length. It did appear to have TWO ANTENNA&#39;S in seperate places on it&#39;s surface. It would HOVER not moving for awhile then start to TUMBLE in place. When the tumble would stop it would either just sit still or ZIP VERY FAST to the EAST or to the WEST always returning to the original spot. It seemed to cover about 8 times it&#39;s length in less than a second. NO SOUND was apparent. Sighting was AT LEAST 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These were perhaps at 2000 feet and moving very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned onto 14 heading north and again observed the cluster of strobing red lights, and as I did so I saw a smaller, bright white light separate from the group of red lights and travel at high speed in the opposite direction of it’s course, back toward Ann Arbor. It was quickly lost to my sight, so I looked back at the cluster of red lights while trying to stay on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should have just pulled over and got out to watch, but this was an unusual thing to see, and I was so absorbed in it that I didn’t think of that at the time. As I watched the group of red strobing lights moved slowly in seeming increments along I-94 in a westerly direction and about a mile north of the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued on 14 I lost sight of it. I considered the smaller bright white light that had come out of it and the speed at which it had left, it’s lack of any navigation lights, and thought that perhaps the two observed objects were not ours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of the cluster of rapidly strobing red lights I observed that it in no way complied with our standard aircraft lighting conventions, there were only red lights, and the rapid strobing also is not something one of ours would do, and the acceleration of the small bright white lighted object was quite beyond anything we can do with a manned aircraft, so all of this was pretty non-conventional.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Things like this keep life interesting. I’m glad to have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/5/07 23:55|Roswell|NM|Changing|10-15 seconds|dim lights moving in u shaped formation over Roswell|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58576.html|364|ndxe200709| dim lights moving in u shaped formation over Roswell<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was letting the dog outside for the night, and was sitting on the ground looking up at the stars, when six &#39;lights&#39; in a u-shaped formation moved overhead.  They were much dimmer than the stars, seemed to look &#39;faded&#39; almost, and did not blink.  They moved overhead without any sound, heading toward the west and then arching to the south-west/south, like they were heading toward White Sands.  The formation did *not* block out any of the stars as it moved, and at the apex of the semi-circular &#39;turn&#39;, the objects seemed to &#39;twist&#39; in on themselves, before regaining the formation.  They moved quickly and fluidly through the sky, it took less than ten seconds for them to disappear over the horizon to the south.  There was still no sound, even after it was gone, and I could hear one car go by on the street we live on.  There was nothing &#39;chasing&#39; the object, either.  I quickly called the dog in and locked the doors (not that THAT would help?).  I&#39;m not sure what it was, but I really wish I&#39;d never seen it.  Maybe someone else saw it, so that I don&#39;t think I&#39;m losing my eyesight or something.  If so, then you have my permission to post this report or use it as you want to.  You can not contact me, since I don&#39;t want to be associated with this sort of thing and we are moving out of the state in less than a week...and right now?

9/5/07 23:40|Hondo|TX|Formation|15 seconds|Arc-shaped craft / formation of lights moving at very high speed East to West at low altitude|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58591.html|365|ndxe200709| Arc-shaped craft / formation of lights moving at very high speed East to West at low altitude<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were walking on the Hondo High School track for almost 45 minutes without incident.  The night was partly cloudy and low clouds were moving northward with patches of open sky and stars visible at times between the clouds.  The wind was blowing from the south at approximately 5-10 mph.  Temperature was approximately 78°F.  Visibility as reported by the Weather Channel was approximately 10 miles.  At approximately 11:38pm CST, as were walking on the northernmost point of the track, my friend was startled and pointed to an object observable above the northern tree line moving East to West at a high rate of speed.  My first thought was that it was a falling star due to it&#39;s silent flight.  Then, as I noticed NO downward movement of the object and what appeared to be either 1) multiple lights OR 2) several different objects flying in formation, I quickly realized that the object was moving in a trajectory PERPENDICULAR to the horizon and not FALLING as I had first assumed.  The object continued it&#39;s high-speed horizontal movement and as it was going to pass behind the town water tower, I ran to the next visible observation point to get a better view.  I was able to observe the object continue it&#39;s East to West path and when it once again was going to disappear behind the treeline, I ran to another spot where I could possibly see it again.  When I got to where I could see the area where the object was headed, it was gone.  I can&#39;t say for certain what direction it went in after I saw it the second time but it was definitely gone by the third time I was able to see it&#39;s path.  It was traveling completely silent, with no engine noises whatsoever.  It was not a helicopter (too fast and too silent), it was not a propeller-driven plane (too fast and too silent), and it was not a jet because their was no sound whatsoever even after it passed.  Its appearance was blocked a bit by the low clouds but the lights showing from behind the clouds.  It was either one LARGE silently moving obje! ct OR se veral objects flying in a VERY TIGHT arc formation for a considerable distance with no real deviation from a perfect arc.  The object traveled at an elevation that was in a straight line with the local water tower and approximately at a 25° angle from where I was standing.  The object&#39;s distance from me was unknown.  I have had experience with the observation of flying objects in the past.  I know what a jet, plane, helicopter, and falling star appear like in the Texas sky.  This object had NO visible running lights.  The only lights visible were the bright white series of lights that made up the arc that made up the object or objects.  The object appeared to be moving faster than any jet or aircraft that I have observed in the sky in the past and with NO sound whatsoever.  My friend is a Certified Nurses Assistant.  I am an entrepreneur/business owner and hold a BS in Ecology from Texas A&amp;M University.  All details are as we saw them at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They both stopped right above our house and we watched them for about an hour. They were moving back and forth, sometimes circling each other and sometimes not moving at all. They were about the same height as the stars. After a while they seemed to be getting higher and then they just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

They had a bright orange diamond like shape. As they moved up in the distance they changed into more of a white sphere. At one point they all appeared to be one object then they split apart, appearing like they were dancing or playing in the sky, with a pendulum motion. They appeared to be about 2 or 3 miles away and the size of a dime held at arm&#39;s length. The higher they went the smaller they appeared, their lights became dimmer and then no longer were visible. They gave the appearance like they just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/5/07 00:05|Salem|OR|Rectangle|30 minutes|A large, bright orange rectangle appeared in front of the mountains, changed shape and produced orbs.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59503.html|373|ndxe200709| A large, bright orange rectangle appeared in front of the mountains, changed shape and produced orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after midnight of the morning of September 5, 2007 I saw a bright orange rectangular object in the northeastern sky. At first I thought it was the moon seen through clouds, but the shape was too close to the horizon and in front of the Cascade range to have been the moon. And the shape was so unusual and so ‘unnatural’ that I was totally puzzled. As I watched for about the first 10 minutes, the object moved away back toward the northeast and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left my window for about five minutes but returned out of curiosity to see if the object had returned. As I looked, the object did begin to reappear but this time the shape changed to an actual triangle but retained its bright orange appearance. I decided to go quickly and get my binoculars that were in the car in the garage. I was not sure if the object would be there when I returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned, perhaps within 30 seconds, with my binoculars, I was able to focus more clearly on the object. It was definitely a triangle and had moved closer moving toward the southwest. It stopped and stayed in one place and as I watched through the binoculars, three orb or globe-shaped spheres, all smaller in size than the object itself and seemingly ‘colorless’, emerged and moved around the object. Two of the orbs floated at the base of this triangle of light. The third remained somewhat stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The now four objects remained in place for about 15 minutes and then seemed to drift back toward the northeast and finally disappeared altogether. I called our local police to see if anyone else had seen or reported what I had seen, but the police said that no other calls had been reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if I even believe in UFOs, but I have to say, I saw something I could not identify, it was flying and it was an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While laying still, the light would move slightly to the right and back to original spot, then slightly up and then back down.  Could see it changing locations/moving based on blinds on the windows.  Ran for binoculars.  Through binoculars, the object was plate like with lights in a straight line going around the shape of the saucer.  Lights were blinking different colors at different times from red to ivory to occasionally green.  Then a bright white light would shine on occasion.  Definite flat shape with lights around the border of it.  Clearly three lights with approximately five or six most of the time.  Showed two more people, tried to get in the telescope but could not.  Quite clear in binoculars though.  Stayed in same position for about an hour then lights softened to all ivory and and seemed to fade away from us.  This was in the west - northwest direction from our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Our oceanfront beach house had a great covered porch where we all spent the better part of our evenings.  The weather was beautiful all week and we were aware that there was a good chance to see meteor showers.  As we chatted, we were gazing at the stars much of the time looking skyward over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening mid-week, we saw a rectangular shape of three vertical rows with 3 or 4 lights in each row of bright red (slightly orange) lights.  The lights were huge and looked like they were located just under and slightly to the left of Mars in the sky.  They appeared out of nowhere, were stationary and blinked out after about 3 to 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later, lower in the sky in the same direction were more red lights (3 or 4 lights more or less in a horizontal zig zag row) they also appeared and disappeared  within a few seconds.  These second set of lights reminded me of flares, but they did not move or stay lit like a flare would have.  I know Camp LeJeune is close by, but I do not know what those lights were.   It was a fascinating event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I couldn’t see the actually aircraft but I did see three distinct flashes followed by a phishew like sound.  This happened within a few seconds and a few more seconds later it happened again a bit farther down the road.  We drove to try to get a better look but we could find them.  There wasn’t a jet stream or anything.  We thought it was some sort of military aircraft but after doing some research online I decided that if it was a military aircraft then it is top secret and not publically acknowledged.  Unfortunately I couldn’t make out the shape or color of the object but there was a sort of glow that went from a yellowish hue to a more blue color as it flashed away.   This is the first such encounter with UFOs and am quite interested to get any information regarding UFOs or UFO sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were no lights on the edges of the craft, nor on top unless they were tiny lights on top near the multiple uneven texture of the top.

I was hoping other witnesses would soon join me as I continued to look up at this huge object in the sky, but cars just continued to speed by, apparently nobody else noticing what I was seeing or curious about why I was looking up at the sky. It was just after sunset, dark and yet clearly visible because it was so close and almost directly above me, lit by the city lights and the three round lights, where I pulled over and got out of my car.  I could hear no sound made by the object over the slight sound of many cars rushing past so close by to me. It continues to hover silently over me without moving, without blinking, without changing anything the entire time I observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about maybe fifteen minutes of staring up at it, I gave up hoping someone else would witness it with me. I regretted not having my cell phone with me or I would have called police to see it. I didn&#39;t dare try to catch anyone&#39;s attention from the passing cars, fearful of causing an accident at those speeds if I tried to wave somebody down.  So I got in my car and went home, watching the news later for any mention of anyone else seeing a UFO like what I’d seen, but heard nothing so I never reported it.  I decided since it was so easy to see because of its size and location and so much traffic and so large a population directly underneath it in downtown Salt Lake City, I decided it must be something from our military since I didn’t see any military craft at all in the area, which is also by the way so close to the Salt Lake City airport that it must have shown on their radar so that’s why I assumed the airport radar people and local air force radar in Layton weren’t paying any attention to it, so that&#39;s why I decided nobody else was thinking it was extraterrestrial.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, it so happened that within the next year I happened to go out on one date with several men I met through internet dating sites who happened to work with top secret NASA or air force projects locally through a company called ATK (used to be Morton Thiokol) and another guy worked at area 51 before retiring whom I dated a few times, who gave me a copy of a video that shows him with a top secret aircraft before it became declassified (so I believe he knows top secret aircraft).  I told him about what I had seen and one other guy too, but they told me that our military has nothing like what I saw, &#34;nothing that big that can hover silently&#34;. The one who worked at area 51 who is himself a pilot with his own airplane told me I might have seen something  called Aurora.  &#34;Sounds like you saw the Aurora but that is still classified.&#34;   However, I have in the last day gone online and viewed photos of hundreds of triangular shaped crafts and the photos of so-called Aurora and I have seen nothing that looks like what I saw, except for other triangular-shaped craft with a round light in each corner, but none of those look like what I saw.  What I saw, I’m also sure is NOT the TR-3B because the top of what I saw is so very different from all internet photos of the TR-3B I&#39;ve browsed.  I don’t recall any light in the center of &#34;my&#34; triangle either.  I also don&#39;t remember &#34;my&#34; triangle having rounded corners, but sharper corners from the TR-3B images online and it was more equilateral triangle than the Aurora photos online, much less aerodynamically stream-lined on top than Aurora photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am embarrassed to say that I never wrote down the date of this incident, thinking I would never forget it, but unfortunately I have forgotten even the year of this sighting.  To fill out this form, I was required to estimate and exact date but I do not know at all the date within a period of a few years nor even the exact season or time except that it was well dark and it was warm enough outside that I don’t recall feeling cold while I watched outside my car, and I remember clear roads all the way on my drive home from visiting friends in Ogden that evening, coming into Salt Lake City just as night was falling.  I cannot believe that no one else saw it because it was so huge and there hovering in one place for so long in great clear weather!  So that&#39;s why I&#39;m trying to find out if anyone else saw it that night, to help me figure out what the exact date was.  I’m certain that the date of my sighting was after Spring of 2004 because I know I was divorced when I saw it.  I know I saw it at least three years ago.  That’s all I can say for sure.  I’m also pretty certain that I did not &#34;lose any time related to this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The light did not move and was there for close to 20 seconds then it went out. As soon as it went out another light appeared slightly higher and to the right of the first light. It remained for severl seconds. I watched for another 30 min but failed to see anymore. I finished my shift 22:00EST and began to drive home. As I was crossing back over the highway 1 mile south from where I work I looked back th the north and observedthe same kind of lights. Again they were low on the horizon, I would say about 15 to 20 degrees, but this time there was more than one. I was able to see 6 lights in total but only 3 at once. The light on the far right was not that bright. The one to it&#39;s left was brighter. The one to that ones left was even brighter. When the one on the far right went out there was a very bright light that appeared to the far left. Again as the light on the right went out another appeared at the far left, this light was slightly dimer then the &#34;center&#34; light. 2 more lights appeared to left in the same order as they went out on the right and became slightly dimmer. The total time of this event was close to 40 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Within the flash  was a disk  shaped prism of rainbow colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was locking up my garage at 9:00 in the evening.Sept 4th.2007. I heard a strange&#34;humming&#34; sound coming from the top of the tree line, so it made me look up. Suddenly off to the right, I saw a brilliant white flash. Contained within the flash was an oval disk. The disk was filled with clear vertical rainbow stripes like a prism. It was dazzling in the intensity. The rainbow rays extended outward from the shape but they were softer, hazier... Then &#34;bam!&#34; it was gone. It&#39;s hard to say how close it was. The &#34;humming&#34; sounded fairly close, but the flash of colors seemed much higher. The oval shape could have been covered up with quarter, and the total flash with a tennis ball(to give you an idea of perspective.) The whole thing lasted only a few seconds 3 at most.And to be clear, I didn&#39;t actually see a metallic structure of a disk. It was a clearly defined disk of light with very defined vertical stripes like a prism. There may be a natural way to explain this, but it was definitely startling to see this. It could be light refracting off something, but it lasted a long time, and coupled with the strange noise. I don&#39;t usually give the idea of ufo&#39;s much thought, and I don&#39;t go looking for this kind of thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

While I was driving, everyone in the car claimed to smell the sweet sweet aroma of vanilla cupcakes. We were out in the middle of nowhere, not knowing where we were apart from the fact that it was en route to irvine. They thought it was rather strange that the smell would be so prominent in the middle of the night, when we&#39;re surrounded by nothing but hills. Soon after, everyone in the car started exclaiming, &#39;omg, wth is that?! look at that!?&#34; from the corner of my eyes, all I could see were lights. It looked like a car was coming from a merging lane. When I actually looked over, i saw this triangular shaped aircraft. It had two lights, and was tilted at a 45 degree angle. It was flying at the same level as us, as if it were a car. And then, for some incomprehensible reason, this unidentified aircraft flew right in front of us, cutting us off. I was driving at 80 miles per hour, and was forced to brake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It might sound bizarre and a little egotistical, but it really, really, really, seemed like it was out to get us. It pretty much intercepted us. changed directions right when it came in front of us. And when it was ahead of us, it took off, and decided to head towards the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no noise. You know how airplanes and things like that make an insane amount of noise even if you&#39;re about a mile way? well, it was close as hell to us and we heard nothing from it.<n>

Almost looked like stars but weren&#39;t twinkling, of course. I witnessed this event for approxamately 7 to 8 minutes until they were out of my field of view past rooftops.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a clear blue sky overhead.  Suddenly, my mother said, “Look, there’s some hot air balloons.”  I looked but couldn’t see anything.  Then my brother said, “Oh, I see.  But they can’t be hot air balloons—they’re too high up.”  He said he saw three white objects in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After looking for some time, I could finally make out one of the objects.  The other two, said my brother, were hidden by a tree branch.  I saw a tiny white speck in the sky.  We talked for a while about what we saw and thought they might be weather balloons.  But they were so high up, if they were weather balloons, they would be invisible at that height.  And why would three weather balloons fly in formation?  We made some jokes about UFO’s and went back to eating our dinner.  The sighting lasted approximately ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There is a low to medium level of light pollution, and looking almost straight up under an overhang cuts out most of that.  I was outside about 5 minutes, and I was looking up, as I usually do at night, looking at constellations, and I happened to notice and watch a very high flying airliner flying approximately east to west.  I then noticed an object flying very fast approximately north to south.  It was a dark grayish shape, with a tiny spot of an orangish color that really seemed like a reflection of light versus an active light, and it was almost unnoticeable except for the movement.  I would say it was almost oval-ish.  It first appeared directly overhead, and was flying at a much higher rate of speed than I&#39;ve seen any aircraft at a visible level.  It was going slow enough to follow it with the naked eye, however.  I first thought it might be a helium ballon due to the characteristics of appearing smaller but moving faster than a plane may.  However, there is no wind during this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea how high or the size of the object, but I would guess possibly 2000 feet up, possibly more, but no where near the height of the airliner.  It traveled in a straight line, jinked to the right similar to a bat would move, about 6-10 degrees, flew about a second on that heading, then jinked back to the left, again in the same instantaneous motion, a smooth, quick motion, while continuing on.  I would say from noticing it almost directly overhead, until I could not see it, lasted about 5-7 seconds.  I shouted at a coworker to look up, but they had just stepped out of hearing range at the time.  I am not taking any medication, do not drink, and have been at work about 6 hours when this happed, so I am fully awake and alert.  I called Charlotte Douglas airport and asked for a controller to ask if they saw anything, they replied the only thing they had was a plane flying around to land at the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know there is no way this thing was a plane.  No flying lights, no blinking lights, the 2 smooth curves it made while flying.  If there was a helicopter that could angle that fast, I might believe that is what I saw, however there were no lights and I don&#39;t believe helicopters fly nearly that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent 10 years in the Air Force and have seen a few planes fly.  Nothing this fast, seemingly lower height, and the turns/curves it made.  Would like to hear if anyone else saw anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Because we have seen these fast moving things before, we were looking again to see if we could spot them again. Within about 5 minutes or so we spotted one which was very bright off-white cigar shaped object that was going south to north direction at high speed. Within a short time anouther one of these objects came into view, however it was going slow, then stopped. That one did not move again from the time we seen it to the time we went home. The other two were seen at the same time, going really close to eachother, then continued on in oposite directions. The only difference in these ones compared to our very first sighting is the shape of the objects. Once again these objects were moving at high rates of speed, no noise at all. Not sure if my camera is strong enough to catch these objects, but were going to try it on the next clear night we have. I also will send drawings of what we first seen and these ones tomorow.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It did not leave any kind of streak behind it, or have any kind of tail, it just looked like a formation of stars in a V shape traveling in a straight line at a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not have an explanation for what I saw. I hope someone may by chance have seen the same thing at the same time as me somewhere in the United States.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was on a southeast heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am located in central Wyoming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly believe there were a total of five lights, I said three in the first post because I was trying to describe a V shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure these weren&#39;t lights on the forward edge of some kind of giant object. There was no blocking out of adjacent stars around the lights. It just looked fast moving stars flying in formation, and I didn&#39;t get the sense they were even in earth&#39;s atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was explaining it to my wife we did see some meteors that were streaking from the east to the west. Perhaps they were from the Aurigid shower, and we also saw a satellite or two orbiting, but trust me, I am a country kid used to seeing all kinds of stuff in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This forever changes my thoughts about what kind of stuff that out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was 9 p.m. and we were sitting on our deck. I noticed 2 blinking, bright star-light objects moving from the western horizon in a straight line toward the east. They were followed by 4 to 6 more similar objects. Then numerous blinking lights appeared traveling or following the lead lights. At one point they appeared to be zigzagging still traveling west to east. The blinking was at about two blinks per second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they passed 45 degrees overhead they grouped together. Then another group appeared in the western horizon traveling west to east. Meanwhile the first group paused till the second group approached and then they continued on to the west and out of our sight. We estimate from 80 to 100 of the blinking white lights.

Each light seemed approximately as big as 10 stars put together. If I took a quarter and stretched my hand toward the lights, I would cover them with the quarter. The lights were hanging in the air for a few seconds, and then with a fraction of a second they jumped over the freeway (approximately one mile) and started rapidly approaching as. As they moved, we saw that they changed colors (I saw one white color changed to red; however, we could not agree the exact colors).  Then, they froze in the air for a few seconds and jumped back where they came from. Then the lights started slowly twisting around one light and formed a triangle that looked like a starched V (if you connect the dots, it would look like a long arch). Then the lights flipped over and started rapidly moving away to the fields. The altitude was so low, that they would hide behind the trees a few times. Finally, the lights faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole scene lasted for about 40 seconds. The night was clear (we observed lots of stars). There was no sound (except the sounds of highway). It was no hallucination, because we all described the scene in almost the same words (I talked to each family member privately after we came back home). Also, I looked this place up in the map and I found out there was so called Crow Landing Field not far from where it happened. Two weeks later I called the Modesto County Police Department and local newspaper, but there were no reports about such thing.<n>

It was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife tried to take a picture but our camera did not work.  We continued to watch i.  It stayed bright the whole time.  Clouds started to move over it and it would peak through the breaks in the clouds.  We took some pictures of that.  In one of the pictures the bright light is reflecting onto the cloud.  The object disappeared soon after we took the pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is an odd disc shaped object in one of our pictures that we did not see at the time.  That second object may be a cloud but I am not sure because we did not see at that time (it was just interesting to see when we got home).  I am not sure what we saw.

We were staying at a camp site just outside Heber, AZ. We noticed this object while on a hayride through the forest area. There were several other witnesses at the camp, however I am not familiar with who they are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was clearly visible for over 25 minutes and stationary. It was the size of your thumb nail at a full arms length. It was as bright as a full moon, and too big and much too bright to have been a star. There was what looked like a bright ring with a darker center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed this object climb in height until it was about the size of a star; it had by then changed to an amber color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching this object I talked to a man who worked at the camp and had him look up at this object. He said he had never seen anything like it in the area in his 15 years of working at the camp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no strange movements or fast accelerations, it was just stationary until it climbed to a distance that we could no longer make it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the hayride stopped I and used my Sony Digital camera to take a couple of still images and video tape the object for about a minute or so. You can make the object out on this video but the Sony camera only has a X3 zoom.<n>

They were flying west to east. All the airplanes were going along the same path to the west of where were sitting in the yard. Then we looked to the east of where we were sitting and we spotted a shiny silver cigar shaped object that was also flying west to east towards New Jersey. It was flying slower than the planes we had just seen, it seemed more like it was just floating. It didn&#39;t make any sound and didn&#39;t have any blinking lights like the planes did. The thing that was really strange was how shiny it was. It was a pretty clear day and the sun was getting ready to set but the sun&#39;s light was just beaming off of this object. Myself, and two others thought it was very strange. The other three people there just blew it off as nothing. Apparently they don&#39;t believe that there could be other life out there somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was watching the sun set when I noticed a light about 45% above the horizon south west of my location it was about as bright as what Venus would be at night. At first I thought it was Venus and then a few minutes later I looked at it was gone. There were no clouds in the sky so I knew clouds did not make it disappear. I then scanned the area then about 50% above the horizon to the SW over Lake Michigan I noticed a light or metallic type object half as bright as the first object and moving (SW)  in the direction or where I saw the first bright object. This object I watched for about 2 minutes then it too disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I scanned the area to see if I could find it again. Then about this time a saw another object about 5% to the right of where the second object disappeared heading in the opposite direction (NE) this too disappeared after a few minutes. This area is a commercial airline route between Chicago and Detroit so it is possible what I saw was the sun reflecting of the fuselage of jets maybe at high altitude. However I did not see any wings on these objects and did not hear any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I happen to look north down the alley and up into the sky and noticed an object hovering about 45 degrees from the horizon. I asked my friend what he thought it might be and he said he didnt know and there was another one just like it directly above us. The one above us appeared to be larger. I immediately got my binoculars from my truck and had another look. It was a dull metallic sphere and appeared to be getting smaller or it was going straight up. About this time there was what appeared to be a jet plane flying between the objects and as it passed, the objects just simply vanished. The objects did not drift or move from thier position. I could not tell how big they were or the distance from us. However the jet plane I estimated to be around 30,000 feet up. My friend and I are middle aged and just regular guys. I was returning his ladder I had borrowed and we had just put it away in his garage and just hanging out in the alley talking when the event occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Without the contrast-filtering of the white smoke, I probably would not have noticed because of it’s size, and the bright sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared more round, and reminded me of a night star, or satellite. It was almost directly above us, in the 1:00 position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: We live about 22 miles from the Akron-Canton airport, so I am well familiar with seeing various aircraft, and the speeds they travel.

At that point, we said it must be a weather or party balloon. Seconds later, it made a sharp left turn to the north, and accelerated in speed. My husband lost track of it, but I followed it to approximately the 10:00 position, where it simply blinked out of sight. I watched for moments after, scanning the sky, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> .<n>

The exact time of this phenomenon (12 hours 25 minutes PM) has been fixed on the big clock of Jersey City presented on the photo.

All 4 lights flew in a synchronized formation and would shimmer, disappear and reappear laterally in a different part of the sky a second later. They did this continuously for about 2 minutes until they just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to describe the event was that they were almost &#34;dancing&#34; in the sky. They were shaped in a triangular shape and very shiny, and could move from one area in the sky to another area in the sky in less than a second. The sky was clear and sunny with almost no clouds in the sky. There was no obstruction of our view. We did not notice any vapor trails or hear any sounds.Unfortunately I was unable to obtain any images.<n>

I looked out of my bedroom balcony toward the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up into the sky and saw what appeared to be a &#34;white&#34; (colored) object.  It&#39;s shape is difficult to discern, but it was a solid mass, a compact object, with no wings (like an airplane), no propellers, just a mass moving at a very, very slow speed giving an appearance that it was hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What immediately struck me as odd about this object was the rate of speed by which it moved.  I have never seen an object move that slow in the air, like at a snails pace. I observed the object for about 15 seconds, then turned way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked back, I could not find the object in the sky, it simply disappeared from the morning blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best I can describe it&#39;s flying altitude is that it was significantly higher than what a helicopter typically flies, and lower than a high altitude plane (the ones that leave a cloud like trail).  So, it&#39;s shape is difficult to identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All i can say is that it was unidentified, it was flying (hovering), and it was an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Then, the rush hit me as I saw a cloaked looking craft stopping perfectly on and off going toward the sun. I said out loud, &#34;I GOT ONE!

During the intermission I went to the restroom and when I came back my wife was in the bed of the truck looking at something in the sky. She asked me where the binoculars are and I got them for her. She was looking at a bright light in the south/western sky that started to emit red, yellow and bluish/green lights to a smaller light. It then appeared to turn and do the same to yet another smaller light across from the 1st one (the 3 of them together made what appeared to be a perfect triangle) it appeared to change shapes as it was turning. At one point it looked like a diamond and then went into a circle. After which, the 1st smaller light flashed back to the brighter light as did the 2nd smaller light. We watched this for about 30-45 minutes. We decided to drive out west to see if we could still see it. As we drove along I-80 west we could see the brighter light the whole time. About the time we got to the Grantsville area it began to fade in and out disappearing and reappearing in about 2 minute intervals. This happened 3-4 times we pulled off of exit 77 and drove south for about 3 miles and watched the same thing. After about 20 minutes I was looking at the North and saw 3 more lights doing the same thing again with the brightest one on top of 2 smaller ones on either side making a perfect triangle. We watched both sets for about 20 minutes repeating their flashing back and forth until it began to get to cloudy and we then drove home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The planet, Jupiter, is in the southwest sky.

Before it completed an arc, just before the horizon to the north,  it appeared to straighen it&#39;s course and move in a northwest direction, thus moving out of it&#39;s arc movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lake is approximatly one quarter mile wide from north to south so this object was moving quite slow, slower than planes we have observed and there was no sound.

I was not with the news guy when I saw this, but my friend who knows him said he saw the same thing a week or so later.This thing came in fast and then I could not see it any more. No impact was reported and I am sure more people saw it than us two.I have a couple of degrees and a carry permit they don&#39;t give those to crazy people,This was too big to make it that close to the ground without breaking up first and no impact was reported.I&#39;m very far from stupid,and have seen many shooting stars etc etc.This was quite different...That&#39;s all I got.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I pulled into the 7-11 on the corner of  Aurelius &amp; Jolly, got out of my car, and called to the attendant and customer in 7-11 to come outside and look at the sky. What I saw were 3 round, red objects about 50 feet apart traveling silently to the north in the area bordering Jolly Road to the south, Aurelius Road to the west and Dunckel Road to the east. The objects seemed to keep the same spacing between them, traveled in silence, and were not just merely floating. I would estimate their speed at 20-30 mph. The only description I can think of would be that they looked like red, Chinese globes that one might see in a Chinese restaurant or Chinese ornaments. There was the appearance of flickering light at the bottom of each object that I thought could have been a flame. As we watched, the flickering in the southernmost object disappeared, leaving only two objects that I could see. Those two objects continued north toward Lansing and disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights appeared in the southwest and I thought it was the lights on top of a tower. When we got closer we could see way more lights than there should be on a tower. It was up two or three hundred feet. By the time it was due south of the driver&#39;s window, I could see five stable, white, evenly spaced, very bright lights in the shape of a triangle with several orange and blue lights that flashed randomnly. No two colored lights flashed at the same time. It remained for 10 to 15 seconds directly next to the driver&#39;s window so it must have been moving very slowly. We watched it continue to the northeast until we could no longer see it. Because we were on the interstate we were not able to stop or listen for sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were two craft, somewhat oval in shape, flying in perfect formation with each other, one above and one below. They bottom one was mostly white with some silver in the center, and the top was more silver with some grey. The bottom one was about twice as large as the top one. They did not deviate from each other and moved in perfect harmony. They were flying at a very odd forward angle that of which I&#39;ve never seen a plane or helicopter fly. I have been watching planes and helicopters at a local airport for years, and these craft behaved drastically different than anything I’ve ever witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They stayed moving in the same direction as me as I traveled north up the turnpike. I was able to observe them for 2 or 3 miles when they suddenly changed direction directly east and were literally completely out of sight in a matter of 10 - 15 seconds. Considering the sky was completely clear, going from that close to me to completely out of sight that quickly is extremely impressive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am extremely disappointed I didn&#39;t have my camera with me, and before I left the house I had a funny feeling I should bring it, but I was in a rush. I&#39;m keeping my camera in the car with me from now on. It was truly an amazing sight. I always believed, but now way more than ever.<n>

It would disappear and then reappear and flew up and down. It emitted an goldish color. It look like a disk except the top was pushed up.it was right across from the Culvers on the east side of the road.Then it suddenly vanished. About an hour and thirty five mintutes later when we were in Oconomowoc it with another craft flew out of the sky. They changed color from gold to yellow to red to orange and finally to a silver color. They looked like the one in Dodgeville and were flying in the same direction. It left a blueish purple haze after it. Then shot straight up like rocket and vanish. I personally do not believe is UFOs but this a very real. And life like.<n>

It was actually moving in the video and you can see 2 big black eyes a small nose and mouth.  There is nothing in the room that could be mistaken for that image.

She escaped to a back room to do something so I was sitting alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked through two standing trees in her yard and saw two silverish colored, clear balloon type objects in the distance - circular I suppose - in the clear sky.  I figured they must&#39;ve been helium balloons that were escaping into the sky as they were moving as balloons at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch and yelled for my girlfriend to come from a back room - she then came and witnessed the UFOs with me.  After a few minutes of watching we were not able to identify them as balloons - they rose higher and continued to float at what I believe to be - thousands of feet - in the air - slowly - not exactly erratically, but not as though being propelled by the wind either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became excited when I saw two neighbors outside in the front where I had moved after the ufo&#39;s floated over the treetops from the backyard to the front.  I saw THREE very clear unmistakable shapes - lights or light reflecting - as the sun from a balloon shape.  But as my neighbors and I gazed straight up overhead at the object - there were two others close to this object - same size and dimensions - we could not say if it were a weather balloon or not - it did not seem to move as a weather balloon might - although I don&#39;t know what a weather balloon looks like in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel this is a significant sighting as there were witnesses and we all saw the same thing for several minutes before the objects just continued to float out of sight.  They did not zip off into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what I saw.  I would like answers as to how this lit object could appear so large in the sky - I have seen balloons before as I live near a place that has helium balloons escape all the time from it&#39;s premises (auto dealership) - and I have watched these balloons travel high into the sky before they just disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects we four witnessed were not balloons such as these - transluscent balloon shaped - well - lit objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt they were intelligently manned but that is just a guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please advise.<n>

As we stared into the night sky, we noticed a light moving across the sky at moderate pace. It was moving about as fast as a jet liner would be, however, this was not a large plane. The light was about as large and as bright as mars. It was traveling from the southeast to the northwest for about 10-15 seconds and slowly went dim until we could not see it anymore. It did not change direction, just traveled in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 minutes had passed and we saw another, very similar object floating through the sky. However, this one passed almost underneath the moon moving in the high sky from the north to the south. As it passed right by it, the light intensified to a much brighter light than the stars and was about twice the size of the largest star. After it passed the moon, the light went dim, almost to complete darkness and then slowly brightened up again. Finally it went completely dim. Same as the last light, not once did it change direction. This lasted for about 10 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It couldn&#39;t have been 10 minutes later when we noticed yet another light traveling through the sky, and again, in a straight line. Except it didn&#39;t pulsate and was not nearly as bright. This one was traveling from high up in the eastern sky to the eastern horizon and also lasted for about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all three instances, the only visible thing was that one white light. There were no other flashing lights, no red lights, no lights you would normally see on the wings of planes, nothing. Even passing by so close to a moon two thirds full, you would think you&#39;d be able to some some sort of shape/silhouette, but we saw nothing. Only that white light flaring up. We also knew they definitely were not meteors. They were moving too slow to be meteors and meteors, from what I remember, do not pulsate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although the objects seemed as though they were moving slowly through the sky, if they were normal planes, they would have to be really high up to not be able to see other lights or a silhouette. And if they were planes at that altitude, then they must have been moving at ridiculous speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I’d chosen to travel at this time to beat heat and traffic.  There were no other cars for as far as I could see in either direction.  I was driving through one of the wooded areas along this highway when flashing bright lights in the sky started to descend downward.  I couldn’t make out shapes, but I knew it wasn’t a plane or a helecopter.  The light was a warm color, like the “golden hour” film makers and photographers talk about.  There seemed to be a dash of color at the edges of the light as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept driving toward it for about two minutes, wondering the whole time what was going on, when I suddenly found myself waking up on the side of the road, parked in a stand of trees, a couple of hours later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back on the road and kept on toward the L-C Valley, since I wasn’t sure what else to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn’t until I saw a story a few months later on KREM 2 news that I thought about sharing my experience.<n>

I looked to the left and noticed a couple of odd-looking &#39;stars&#39;. They seemed a bit orange or to have an orange glow to them which I don&#39;t think is unusual (could have been &#34;old&#34; stars) except that as I was looking at each of them, actually staring at each for a time, I noticed that  the oval shape was more solid than I saw when just glancing at them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were multicolored lights in the center that seemed to be spinning.
