Loud tonal/buzzing<n> <n><n> <n><n> Van Nuys, Calf. Second or third saturday evening about 10 pm in august of 1983. I was home alone, no other neibors came out. First I was indoors and heard a strange plusating, swirling sound, it could be heard for a distance of a mile buzzing like a electronic keyboard/organ with all the keys depressed, not a combustive sound. Flew at a speed about 15 MPH at a height of about 350 feet. Pipes, holes and waffle impressions underneth. Blue and white lights seemed to bounce independently, lighted the driveway I was standing on. Each of the three sides were about 300 foot edges. I was standing right beneth it and I was over taken with a sensation of awe. after it was out of sight and sound I phoned the nearby airforce post at Van Nuys airport, the direction it came from, (moved eastward) an officer put me on hold indefinetly.  2 years later, it was mentioned on a local TV program (EYE ON LA) by witnesses on a nearby moutain, 2 or 3 miles away. 4 years after, I met one other Van Nuys resident who also saw it that same night and over head as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

For the longest time I didn&#39;t tell anyone but my husband, partly because I didn&#39;t know who to tell and partly because I was afraid of how it would sound.  I am 53 yrs old now and have no psychological disorders, nor have I ever suffered from such a disorder. I have also never seen anything like this again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 5:30 p.m. one evening I turned onto route 78 traveling south towords our home in a little town, Laura, Illinois.  There were no other cars on the road when I saw it, and I was in a farming area which was open fields only.  I am sure that many other people saw the object also that night, because it must have been seen by the cars passing on the nearby expressway.  I was 10 miles from home at the point I first noticed it, and near the intersection of Illinois route 78, and U.S. route 150.  The sky was dark, and just as I turned south onto route 78 I saw a large, redish-organge cigar shaped light traveling what I estimated to be upwards of 500 miles per hour.  The light was traveling due west and it took only moments for the craft to travel completely accross the sky and out of my sight.  The object was at least 10 times the size of a commercial airplane but made no sound whatsoever, and was flying at about the height of a 20 story building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I saw it, I drove as fast as my car would travel twords home, believing that my world was coming to an end because the only thing that I had seen that looked something like this was a picture of a guided missle.  When I arrived home I thought my husband would be meeting me at the door since something like this would surely have been on the news.  After it became clear that this was not the case, we waited for the evening news to hear what I saw, but apparantly no one else had reported it either.  I have never heard anything about what I saw in the sky that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m glad that I&#39;ve finally gotten this out in the open, and thank you for listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

We all looked up when this huge saucer shaped object floated from the south west to the north east It made no noise and had several irregular lights in what appeared to be port holes. The object was spinning in a clock wise rotation about one full turn every two minutes, Its speed seemed to be 10 mph and it appeared to be about a quarter mile in diameter and was about 500 ft above the ground. The object appeared to resemble a space station similar to to the one I saw in the movie &#34;Close encounters of the third kind&#34; If you remember the scene where Richard Dreyfuss was at the RR tracks and he looked up and saw this spinning space station type object. A master sergeant was mad at us for looking up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The underside of this UFO had five round white lights (one at what seemed to be the front, one at each rear tip and one between the front and tail end of each side of the bommerang shaped UFO).  I was at least the size of two football fields and made no sound except for a very low vibrating hum. As it hovered  approximately 100&#39;over us the hairs on my arms and the back of my neck stood up as if touched by some sort of static electricity.  When it began to move it did so very slowly. Every one passing by us stopped their vehicle to see what my friends and I were looking at.  It was creepy as though the occupants of the UFO knew we were looking at it. It was headed in a SE direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.  PD))<n>

A friend and I were out walking through the subdivision at night around 9pm in the middle of the summer. We were walking on a desert section of road and a strange shaped craft flew over us maybe about 300 hundred feet above us, it looked like a plane at first but no lights expect on head light shining straight in front of it. It was flyingnot straight but sideways. It had a large wing span but a short body, didn&#39;t know which end was which expect for the direction on travel and head light. It suddely came right over us and it&#39;s light turn down on us. It made no noise at all and it&#39;s light was so bright you could see dust particles floating around in the beam. It stayed over head  about a minute or so, enough time for me to fall in a ditch and get up a run, and then it went dark and took off like a bullet. We ran off back to my house and I sprained my wrist when I fell. The part I will remember was the bright light that spot lighted us and the complete silence when it came over head, all of the night bugs went quiet and I could only hear me and my friend breathing. I was 15 years old then.<n>

The house was north of us about a 1/4 of a mile.  At around 9:00 pm we saw a shape moving in the sky to the north west of my house. It moved over my house at around 200 feet above the ground and slowly and moved towards our spot that we were camping. No sound no wind just a very large v shape.  One bright white light on each end one on the front. We ran to the top of the gully that open to a field and stood to watch it go over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then noticed circles of light on the ground I don’t remember too much after the lights got close to me. Then the next clear thing I remember was watching it leave to the east.  I was standing under a small tree and my friend was standing by the fence line about 80 feet from me which was where  we had been right beside each other  and the craft was a 1/4 mile from us going a different direction .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran back to the house after going to put out the fire that we had started for camp but it was burnt out.

It was a hot night, probably in July or August.  All of a sudden a small fireball appeared to the left of the car, as if having fallen from the sky.  It landed on the road near my car and must have rolled under my car.  My friend screamed, &#34;What the H**** was that?&#34;  I was scared that it would ignite the gas in the tank and make the car catch fire.  That&#39;s all we saw of it, even though I looked in the rear view mirror to see where it went.  We never had any explanation of this except that maybe it was a meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We slowly approached the old Cherry St. bridge and I yelled,&#34;STOP!&#34; We stopped directly in the center of the bridge. Though it was a busy route, no other car was witness to this. I stuck my head out the window, looked directly up, and saw a flat, triangular form against the night sky. A triangle with one point missing. The craft was small, maybe 50ft across and absolutely silent. A red, green and blue light were diagonally across the underside. When I finally confirmed what I was looking at, I was terrified. I told my mother to hit the gas and we watched it behind us as we sped away. I was 14 at the time and though its been 15 years, this one is etched in my mind forever.<n>

In 1983 I lived in the town of Cookstown, N.J. This is a town just outside the main gates &amp; reserve of Maguire Air Force Base in addition to Ft Dix. After dinner I had took my (2) dogs for a walk through the adjoining field of Balasko Oil Co next to my house, it was dark, there was no wind and it was very humid. The field was isolated which was ideal for my needs as my dogs were vicious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something then happened which I can only verbalize as a sence of something terribly wrong. As this thought was registering in my thoughts, both of my dogs began to growl which escalated my feelings and I could feel the hair raised on the back of my neck. Please know that I have never felt this sence of fear while in the presence of my dogs! As a dog handler, I knew their perception was keener than my own and I looked to where both dogs were focasing their aggressive behaviour. To my complete shock &amp; fear, both dogs were looking up in the same direction at a 45 degree angle. I looked but did not immediatly realize what I was vaguely beginning to see was the silouete of a triangular shape no more than 100 ft above me and no more than 200 yards in front of me. The most upsetting feeling was consuming me as this shape was standing still in the air without the slightest sound! In retrospect to the angle, nose straight up with bottom triangular sections down. A terrible sence consumed me which I can only ascertain was what was making my dogs snarl and show their teeth. I did not stay any longer and pulled my dogs and took them back to the house. Many years later when the Stealth was first revealed I was amazed at how similar it was to what I witnessed in 1983. Possibly could have been the testing of the stealth but I still question why it would have been over Cookstown in lieu of the endless barren miles of the military range. The key I would assume that would solve this or separate this incedent from question would be if the stealth is capable of hovering 100 ft off the ground, nose straight up without making a sound or vibration.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/15/83 17:00|Citrus Heights (Sacramento Area)|CA|Disk|5 Minutes|Witnessing what I saw that summer day in Sacramento still leaves me in awe.  My sisters and I saw an immense object hovering very close|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05626.html|12|ndxe198308| Witnessing what I saw that summer day in Sacramento still leaves me in awe.  My sisters and I saw an immense object hovering very close to our back yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember this incident so vividly.  It was a clear, hot summer day around 5 or 6pm in Citrus Heights, when my sisters and I were socializing in our back yard.  I was 17 and my sisters 14 and 19.  Out of nowhere, a VERY LARGE saucer (50 ft or so)descended and was partially over our back yard--at the southeast corner approximately 70 feet away.  This saucer was a medium gray metallic color and had bright white lights that traveled in a circular motion around the perimeter--it was so immense and so close!  We couldn&#39;t see the top of the saucer because we were basically looking up at this object.  At first, we thought that it could be a military aircraft, but it was eerily silent, especially since it was stationary and hovering so close to us for some time.  Living in Sacramento for 16 years with four military airbases close by, I have seen every possible military aircraft that you can imagine--this was not an aircraft!  My sisters and I were hysterical while scrambling to get our polaroid camera; the picture  we attempted  to take came out blurred (strangely, it was still light outside and usually does not get dark until 8 or so during the summers in Sacramento).  We watched as the saucer slowly ascended and headed south.  Why am I reporting this story so late in life?  First, I didn&#39;t think anyone would believe me even though I have two sisters who could corroborate my story.  Second, there was a program on last night about UFOs (2/17/99) that compelled me to investigate after seeing an interview of an Ohio policeman who saw a saucer and described that it was so close but made no noise.  This was the first time I have heard a witness recount their experience which was somewhat similar to mine.  Finally, when a person experiences something of this magnitude, its disturbing; when there are so many people who have experienced this, but no real answers, it is extremely disconcerting.  I am not a &#34;spiritual&#34; person but a discerning individual who comprehends by facts. I felt the need to share my experiene in furthering the research of UFOs.  I want to know what I saw that day. My sisters and I are college educated, well read, successful and very normal people.  I am a vice president of a large high tech firm based out of Philadelphia and have been an executive in the high tech field since graduating from a university at the age of 21.<n>

I heard no sound but my windows were shut.  I got a good look at this craft and kept it in my view even as I sped away looking in my rearview mirror.   It was the size of the pond hovering just over the treetops.  There were lights on the craft.    I saw other cars, noticing the southbound cars on the Thruway.  I have looked at sites before looking for someone else who may have seen this.   Through the years I have told my story - always hoping that someone else witnessed this.  It was truly amazing and I thought many times -- maybe it was the lights on the dashboard or fatigue from work - but that is not the case.

Looking north from my bedroom window I could see lights just over the hill behind me.  I watched for a hour or better as the lights neared the top of the hill and again dropped behind the hill.  I still was not concerned thinking it may be kids or something I could exsplain.  Then the craft broke the top of the hill and slowly moved east along the ridge.  I know my military aircraft and this was not military.  I grabbed a monocular and glassed the craft as it dropped again behind the ridge.  It looked like a aircraft but with very short wings less than 6 feet, the fusalage was aprox 25 feet long, with a high wide tail.  Note this was not a airplane it was moving very very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I was becomming concerned, I watched it return to the top of the ridge now moving west along the ridge.  My blood went cold and I was shooked when it&#39;s pilot turned looking directly at me then slowly accelorated making a growing huming sound until the craft made a boomings sound and disappeared in a flash of bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One last note the being inside was typical large head large dark eyes, but when it looked my way, and this may sound weird.  It told me it knew I was watching it.  It communicated this directly to my thoughts.  I have told three people about this since it happened in the 80s, I did not want to sound like a UFO kook.  I know we are being watched.  I stood guard the next three nights it did not return, this exsperiance left me with a feeling that I needed to protect my family.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was about 23:30 hours on August 12th, 1983.  The sky was fairly clear with a few light wispy clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten minutes my wife pointed to the northeast and said &#34;There&#39;s a meteor&#34;. I looked in her direction and saw what appeared to be an airplane. I told her, &#34;No, that looks like a plane to me, because it has 3 lights.&#34;  We watched the craft come slowly from the northeast to a point nearly due east from where we were standing in our yard. It had made no sound in its approach. Due to the darkness, it was hard to judge how high it was, but it was nowhere near the altitude that normal passenger planes would have been flying.  It appeared to be above the wispy clouds but no higher than a light plane or helicopter would fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft suddenly came to a complete stop in midair. There was still no sound. When it stopped a very bright light, similar to a searchlight, was turned on and aimed out from the craft. It was pointing to the west. We were both shocked and amazed at this. I told her I was going to get my camera, but before I could even take a step, the light shut off as suddenly as it had come on.  It was on for about 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as suddenly the craft headed due southeast at an extremely rapid speed. It was traveling much faster than when it first appeared. It just disappeared into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft seemed to be triangular in shape with rounded edges, and had three lights. One was on each corner and the third was toward the front. It never made any sound such as a helicopter or other machine capable of stopping in midair. Yet it moved much too fast for a balloon or other gas propelled vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We told a very select few people of our experience at the time, but most just laughed it off so we dropped the subject.  But we had written down what we viewed: the time, the date, and a general description of the craft. When I found this website, we thought it appropriate to document what we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

An hour or so later I awoke  and noticed a light coming from another room. I instantly was aware that it could not be a light inadvertantly left on as it had a distictive illuminating glow about it. For reasons unknown to myself, i instinctively had the impression that &#34;it was coming&#34;. I lay completely still as this light became brighter as it moved closer to the bedroom door. In the doorway appeared an extremely bright illuminated spere. This thing had the color of something so bright that it was almost bluish. It remained bobbing in the doorway a short while, then moved directly over me, moved from over  my head to my feet staying up near the ceiling as it did so. It then moved directly over my abdomin and descended slowly until it was inches, I mean inches, from my stomach. It then bobbed there for thirty or forty seconds, then slowly rose to about two or three feet above me. I then realized my husband was sound asleep during all of this and tried to awaken him. I was being subtle as I was afraid that too much motion would disturb this bobbing orb above me. He finally awoke and I thought he was going to have a seizure. At the point of his gasping, this thing rose quickly raced out of the window. At this point we both jumped to the window to see where this thing went, but it was nowhere to be seen. My husband was completely shaken by this event and over time has decided it didn&#39;t happen. I, myself, have been timid about mentioning it to anyone because i do not wish to be percieved as some kind person needing psychiatric attention. I do so now because I have always been perplexed by this, but have never heard of anyone experiencing something like this. I hope that at least by reporting it now, someone with similar experiences can be assured that they are not delusional.                                                I do not know if this was a UFO or not, but people mentioning seeing illuminated spheres have prompted me to report this.I have seen th! em on and off for years at a distance,                                                                I only want to add that they do not seem mechanical at all, more like something alive, with presence.                                                                  Please feel free to toss this out if it does not fit with your forum here, as I am not sure what forum in which it does belong.<n>

I commented to my wife (Girlfriend at the time) that a B-52 was coming towards us.  We joked that maybe it was a UFO. As it moved with a 1/2 mile distance, we stopped joking about it possibly being a UFO and we got in our car and drove quickly to a spot with more people.  We were frightened by the fact that it moved slow and made no noise.  The UFO had red and white lights around the perimeter with a smaller trailing light. We drove from a parking lot where we had just gotten off work (Caldors) and drove to a near-by gas station (ARCO).  The craft flew over our heads slowly and we watched it for 5-10 more minutes.  There were a number of people at the ARCO and all the people were stunned.  I haven&#39;t thought much about the incident since it hapened, however, the stories out of Arizona in 1997 were remarkably similar.  I believe by the descriptions, that the UFO&#39;s were the same, only they were 14 years and 2000 miles apart.  At the time, the authorities said it was a joke by ultra-light aircraft pilots. If it was ultra-light pilots, they moved to Arizona 14 years later!!<n>

8/1/83 01:30|Santa Rosa|CA|Unknown|15 mins|Slow flying, noiseless object with red strobes.|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16201.html|21|ndxe198308| Slow flying, noiseless object with red strobes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident occured several years ago when I was 7 or 8 years old.  Since the incident I have been keenly interested in military technology and the UFO phenomenon. I have always sought an explaination as to what I observed but so far have been unsatisfied. I was staying up late with a younger child.  I believe it was a summer night about 1:30 or so in the morning.  I don&#39;t think we were supposed to be up but when you are that age and you have a friend over you sometimes want to stay up all night and play.  My bedroom window faced north just outside a highway and I was looking outside at the sky and hills when I noticed an airplane.  I would guess now that it was 5 miles out?  The airplane was rather odd however.  Instead of the alternating red/green wing strobes it had 2 red strobing lights evenly spaced that flashed slowly and simultaneously.  I became very interested because I had never seen an airplane at night that had lights like that.  I watched for a while and it seemed like the aircraft was floating in the air.  It was moving (north-south), but every airplane I had seen fly before would have passed over by then (I had been watching for maybe 5 mins.)  I wanted to know what kind of airplane it was!  I opened the window hoping to hear any engine noise.  Was it a jet or rotory craft?  as it came closer over the window, I turned off the light partly out of fear partly to cut the glare from the room light.  Fear.  I still couldn&#39;t make out the shape, just the lights.  I began to stop thinking it was an airplane.  I was very afraid but excited and curious at the same time.  The object was just overhead.  I cannot remember the silhouette.  But it must have been 200ft overhead just gliding over slowly lights blinking.  Absolutely no noise!  I could have ridden my bicycle faster than it was traveling.  My friend saw it too, but I don&#39;t remember his reaction.  As soon as it left my field if view (directly over the roof), I ran to my parent&#39;s bedroom.  I wanted an adult to see it!  They told me to go to bed.  I rushed out the front door I was no loger afraid, I wanted to see it closer.  At the rate of speed it was going it should have still been over the roof.  When I went outside the night was still and quiet and the object was gone. I have seen all kinds of airplaned since.  Blimps, ultralights have motors...  Other airplanes have engines that make much more noise.  I have seen a jet at night with only a single red strobe, but never two that flash slowly and simultaneously.  Now that I know more about aircraft, I realize that at that altitude and speed it should have stalled.  It couldn&#39;t have been going more than 15mph. I wish I had more visual details to report.  Many years have gone by and it was night.  The memory still strikes me.  I hope taht someday I will find a decent explaination but I am afraid I will never find one.  The impression after the incident was that it wasn&#39;t man made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
