My passenger and I left Summit, SC, heading toward Leesville, SC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw an incredibly bright flash of light.  It was like I saw this coming from a mirror on a mountain? (like used in a signal or something) yet, I couldn&#39;t see an aircraft.  The flash appeared to be white/silver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My passenger said that they thought the flash had originated from the right side of our vehicle.  I saw the flash on my left just above the tree line.  It was very strange that we saw this flash on opposite sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both said, &#34;What just happened?&#34;   This was a very strange occurence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still think about this often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, note that the sun was not out, it was an overcast winter morning<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
