This was in 64/65.As students, we were outside for a meeting with the principal, re: something for all students to attend, such as a student body meeting. The weather was clear. A silver disk shaped craft  flew over the school grounds with no noise. North to South, very low, just above the tall pine trees.We all watched, teachers, secrataries, students...Over 45 of us... as it went over us and appeared to land in back of the school grounds, behind some trees. The area was woods and no houses.We, as students were immediately sent to our classrooms, where we sat silent, due to teachers orders, until 2 pm. I observed a man walk by the class window. He was not a sheriff, as we had been told the sheriff had been called. He was in a black suit, with a black briefcase. I did not see any others. He was walking towards the craft, to the south, and not on the side of the principals office, which was on the east side of the buildings. At 2 pm. The alarm to go home sounded, and we were told we could go. A girl and I headed towards the direction of the craft where it had landed. The tall pine trees had covered its descent, but we did not see it leave. My friend and I met other students coming back from behind the school from the landing site; some had went to find the ship.. We were told it was gone, but we still went to the site, where we found a large approx. 40ft diameter ring. It appeared to be burned at the ring all around the edge..(  Later on when older,I would return, and find for years nothing grew there.) My friend and I saw nothing but the ring, so we left. Something scared us, and we began to run, but I do not recall what. I went home and told my mom, who came back to see the ring. She saw it also.That night something scared me again by my home, which was not far from the school. Later on in the 70&#39;s there would be many sightings in the county. I would know people who had major sightings, and as far as I know besides a report in the papers occasionly,  few people reported the many sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It made no sound and flew very fast. It came from the western area of the city and stopped in mid air above the general area where we were walking. Immediately it flew back to a hill in the western portion of the city. I am not sure if it flew over the hill or landed on it since it was quite aways away. We were dumbfounded and that is something I will never forget!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

As a child I thought it was some sort of toy that had gotten away from someone. The closest thing that I had ever seen to it at that time was my uncle&#39;s fishing bobber. The object sort of float-drifted down toward me kind of like a blown soap bubble. When it got to about eye level it stopped about three feet in front of me. I wanted it so I reached for it but it backed up and stopped again. This time I grabbed for it but it zoomed away quickly and was gone. I have no doubt that it &#34;knew&#34; to get out of the way for its safety. It startled me when it made evasive manouvers. Also the color was a light blue off color, great for aerial camoflage. No one has ever believed this story. It is true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

5/12/65 21:00|Massapequa Park|NY|Oval|5 seconds|Fast quiet objects moving in formation with unheard of speed and precision.|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20990.html|5|ndxe196505| Fast quiet objects moving in formation with unheard of speed and precision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a typical night staring out my bedroom window with my dog at my side.  I was looking out my window facing what would be north and suddenly saw moving at an incrediable rate speed about 6 to 8 bright white oval shaped discs low on the horizon (it was dark outside at the time).  It was amazing and at first and did not comprehend what I had just seen.  I actually remembered rubbing my eyes afterwards in disbelief!  The astounding speed and quitness of these ufo&#39;s was just incredible (window was opened).  The distance of these objects appeared to be far off as the shapes were small but very distinct.  I sat there and tried to understand what it might have been in those 5 or so seconds (it felt longer).  It was a steady speed and I had the advantage of a broad playing field in the sky to see the trip.  I tell you, I have never ever seen anything like it.  I recently saw, two summers ago, a small meteorite enter the earth&#39;s atmosphere (orange with lots of afterburn behind it) and it couldn&#39;t compare to the speed of that event burned long ago into my mind!  I have never before made public this event to anyone as I thought it would be shund upon or laughed at.  But now after all these years, I can still paint an exact picture as I think about it everytime I hear or see ufo information.  And, to all of those thinking, it wasn&#39;t a meteor shower, as it was too deliberate of formation and moving parralel to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

5/5/65 17:00|Scotland|AR|Other|not sure|I had to go outside, saw it when I went out with my little boy.|4/26/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12675.html|6|ndxe196505| I had to go outside, saw it when I went out with my little boy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother, brother and sister left my son and I at home.  It was late, before 7 pm.  It was warm and did not get dark until around 8:30.  We were watching TV and it went out. I tried to get it back on but could not. I tried to call neighbor that had worked on it, but phone was dead. I could hear the dogs barking at something and I picked up my son and went out to see. It was daylight.  When I went out, the dogs had quit barking and were standing perfectly still. I thought that was strange but before I could dwell on it, I turned to my left and saw an object, round, no markings, no openings, in the corner of the field under tree branches. It was a warm, not hot, yellow and orange, several feet above the ground and about 15 to 20 feet tall. I could see under it and tree limbs above it. This is mountain area and we were in a valley, the area behind the UFO was a mountain. I walked to the fence and I felt so happy to see it.  I ask it to come closer that I was not afraid and it did.  The next thing I knew, I could hear a car or truck coming up the road, my thought was that I hoped it could see what I was and when the lights hit me, I looked back and the object was gone.  Now, I know it was then dark, something I only remembered in the 80&#39;s.  It was Mother and I wondered why they had come back early, I ask her and she said they weren&#39;t back early.  I told them about it and they thought I was crazy.  We went back in the house and the TV was working and the phone was working.  It was then that a report came on TV and said a UFO had been seen over Jacksonville, Ark., about 70 miles away and it was described like the one I saw in the field. I pushed it back in my memory because I felt no one would believe me.  In the 80&#39;s, TV was full of investgations on UFO&#39;s, still I did not talk about it. My friend and I were going into town and she ask if I had watched TV and saw the UFO thing, and I told her I had not.  It was then she told me that one evening she had gone outside and saw a round object behind my house a few months earlier. She said she lost an hour. I said nothing of what I had seen, she did not know about it. It was then that a mental picture came to mind about that night in 65, of the clock at mothers, when I returned to the house it said 8:15, I had gone out at 6:30, apx. That time period is still blank for me. The time I saw it was at mothers and the time my friend saw it, it was 100 miles away. I moved back to Scotland last year. One day I walked to the spot and put my hand on the ground and said that I was back and I wanted to know why. A blinding headache hit me, I left the area quickly and have not done that again.  I never liked this area, where I now live, but last year, I changed my mind and insisted that we move away from the Benton area to Scotland. I was very surprised, but I had such a strong need to get back here. In the months after I saw the object in the field, I had such bad headaches, that I was put in the hospital, they found nothing wrong, and they went away in October of 65. My son that was with me that night says he remembers nothing, he was 3. But all his life he has fought to live here and he lives on the place. In order to work, one has to drive at the least, 50 miles for a job.  I drive to Little Rock to work, 70 miles one way. By the end of the day, I begin to get anxious about getting back, I am almost sick with the need! I am ok once I get here. In 1962, I was pg with my son.  Several times I would wake up in the mornings with the bottom of my feet black. I have a slight memory of talking to someone in the alley at our house. I had never sleep walked before and no memory of doing so, again. What concerns me now is the need to be here, as if I am waiting. I would like to know if anyone has seen the object I recreated. Last night I found a picture of the same thing on David Fowler, Unknown UFO, picture #2.<n>

Cutting across the rear of the adjacent school parking lot, a bright streak of light caught my eye. After a few seconds, the streak reappeared and I followed the light in the direction it was traveling.  Whirling to my left, the streak of light came to a halt and revealed a shape like that of a jet aircraft fuselage.  It had a tail fin but no visible side wings.  It had an overall color of light yellow and lightly colored bands of various colors running along the length of the fuselage. The object emitted no sound and there was no noticeable trail of exhaust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident I’m about to reveal occurred when I was about nine years old.  For several days after this incident, it was something I thought about quite a lot but soon I put it aside in my memory and never really thought much about it until several years later when I was a teenager.  It was then that I sat down, drew a picture of what I saw and jotted down a few short notes about what happened.  Although this happened some 34 years ago, it feels (the emotion of the event) as though it happened just yesterday and I remember it quite clearly. I was walking to church very early on the morning of May 5, 1965.  It was still dark as I was heading to church to serve at the 6:00am Catholic Mass.  From the subdivision where I lived there were a set of concrete steps from street level up to the back of adjoining school grounds.  I got to the top of the stairs and began walking across the rear school parking lot when a bright streak of light, off to my left, caught my eye.  I looked to the left but saw nothing.  I continued to walk around the side of the school building when again a bright streak of light caught my eye.  This time I stopped and faced the West to see if I could catch this streak of light.  After a few seconds the streak reappeared and I tried to follow the light in the direction it was traveling.  As I whirled around to my left the streak of light came to a halt (at a position about 180 degrees from when I first caught sight of it) and revealed a shape like that of a jet aircraft fuselage.  It had a tail fin but no visible side wings. It’s overall color was light yellow, which seemed to glow and it had lightly colored bands of various colors running along the length of the fuselage.  This horizontal pattern continued up through the tail fin.   It’s hard to determine exactly how far away this object was from me.  It was not hovering directly over me but it was stationary, off some distance in front of me as I faced the East.  It seemed to be quite huge.  I’d say, at arm’s length and using my thumb as a site, this object had to be some 10 feet or more in length. The object emitted no sound and there was no noticeable trail of exhaust such as there would be from a typical aircraft moving through the sky.  My gaze was so fixed on the object itself I cannot say whether or not the object’s illumination cast light on the ground or nearby homes (less than 100 feet away) that it seemed to be hovering over.  I stood there looking at this object for what felt like a full minute.  First in awe at something I had never seen before and then extreme fright.  I turned and began to run as fast as I could around the school and toward the church.  I could feel my heart pounding and as I began to run my legs felt wobbly and I fell down.  I got up but again my legs felt very heavy and I fell a second time.  I began to cry and covered my face.  I felt that if I could cover my face I would be safer.  After what seemed like a minute or two, I got up and was finally able to run but all the while feeling like the object was still stationary in the sky.  I ran all the way to the church, opened the front door and went in.  I was 9 years old at the time. Although I always have had an interest in space exploration and science fiction I do not remember being preoccupied with such stories before this event that could have led me to dream or make up this story.  I do admit that when this event occurred I did embellish the story about physical evidence that would indicate the object did appear.  I thought that my parents or other adults would never believe me without this added information.  I had claimed at the time that a rock I threw struck the side of the object and that the object burned the top of a chain-link fence.<n>

I&#39;d say it would have been a good whip but at 11 years old, I believe I could have hit it with a small rock, of course I didn&#39;t do any thing that foolish. My older sister was 13 and my younger sister was 9.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed this craft for at least a couple of minutes, I say it was about 21 ft in diameter and had a steady hum of near 60 Hz. There was no exhaust but heat waves seemed to disapate from metallic surface. There were several different colored lights around perimiter of craft. Also on upper deck there was a rectanguler window which appeared to have 12 yellow lenses or lights behind it, of course as craft would rotate this window would come around once per revolution. I must say it looked very simaliar to many popular craft filmed and photografted many years later in Switzerland.  All of a sudden it picked up it&#39;s 60 cycle hum to maybe 70 hz hum, and believe it or not disappeared right in front of our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event was reported to the Outagamie County sherifs department. A deputy came to our house after my Father called him because there were alot of sightings in Wisconsin at that time, the deputy used alight form of interagation on each of us at a time in squad car and he then informed our parents that this event happened and these kids are not making this up.<n>

There was a telephone pole between me and the air craft.  I stopped my car confused as to why it wasn&#39;t moving and watched it for quite some time.  There was nothing in my life experience that I could draw on to explain what was happening to me.  I sat there tranfixed just looking at it for what appeared to be a long time trying to make some sence out of what I was seeing.  It was approx. 1 1/2 car lengths across and was made of a material that looked like burnished aluminum.  There was a &#34;seam&#34; in the center as you would see if you put two plates together in a () direction but on it&#39;s side.  Strangley enough there was no sound coming from the saucer nor from anything else.  No sound from birds or any other noises one hears at this time of day n a country road.  I was about 15 to 20 feet from this object and it never moved until I lost my nerve and drove away as fast as I could.  I had two other sightings that summer.   All three were up close and personal.  The third time my mother was with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

All of the sudden they stopped wrestling and stood straight up.  At the same time all three of us looked directly above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There, hovering, was a large, round, silver object directly above us.  It was low enough that I could make out what looked like dimples in the skin of the object - almost like hammered metal.  Since it was right above us, I don&#39;t know whether it was a sphere, or whether we were just looking at the bottom side of a saucer shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the object it slowly moved behind a cloud.
