I got off work at approximately 11:15 and headed home.  The town that I live in is very remote and absolutely zero activity at this time of night during the week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving I noticed a bright light which was white and occasionally had red random flashes of light with a very rare green flash at times.  The object was moving in a way that made me feel as though it was following me.  When I came to a 4-way stop I thought that it would move on away but it didn&#39;t.  It came to a sudden, complete halt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat there in my car, scared to death, and just watched it for approximately 5 minutes, afraid to take my eyes off of it or make any move myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided that I wanted to get home as quickly as possible so I made a right turn and started out in the direction of my house very slowly.  The object started moving again along with me and every turn I made it followed.  When I reached my house, which is about 1 1/2 miles down a dirt road in a very desolate, isolated area, I pulled into the driveway and stopped and, once again, the object made a very sudden, abrupt stop.  It did not move at all for a few minutes and then it began to sort of hover slightly to the left and then the right. It stopped again and I just sat and watched because I was too afraid to get out of the car and then it took off at an unbelievable speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went in and woke up my husband and told him.  He is one of the biggest skeptics in the world and of course told me it was my imagination.  Well, the next night I guess his curiosity got the best of him because he went outside and just watched the sky for quite some time and said that he finally saw the same thing that I had seen, exactly as I had described it to him.  He even called my mother to have her go outside to see if she could see it from her house which was approx. 8 miles from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She did not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a few years ago I had a niece at my house out on the back deck when we noticed the same type of object that just sat there and then moved slightly from side to side and up and down, completely stopped several times and then just took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve discovered that people think you are crazy when you tell these things so we keep it to ourselves now.  I even called the weather station with the second incident and they just pretty much laugh at you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I are both very intelligent people and we know what we saw.  It may have been something from this earth but if it was I would just like to know what it could have possibly have been then I will be satisfied, but until then.........<n>
6/30/94 23:00|Springfield|MA|Triangle|20 minutes|Missing time with triangular craft.|7/13/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44854.html|2|ndxe199406| MIssing time with Triangular craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was returning to my mother&#39;s house late from visiting with friends. My two teenage children were at home with her, so I was alone in the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming down Parker Street, which is a suburban area, I started going past part of the golf course on the left.  There are many trees here and the night was dark although there are streetlamps.  I was compelled to slow down the car (windows were open) and look over to the left as I pulled over to the curb.  There were no other cars on the road, which is strange for even this late hour as Parker Street is a main four-lane throughway.  I know the radio was on, but cannot recall any music playing just before, during or after the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized that hovering directly over the treetops (maybe 40&#39; at the most as they are predominantly maples) was an immense black triangle. No lights, but it blocked all stars and ambient lighting from the surrounding area so that it was like dense black velvet. It was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I recognized it as a UFO, I recall nothing else until I was pulling away from the curb and driving on my way home.  I had a hard time understanding why I had been pulled over in the first place and struggled to recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few moments later it came back to me what I had seen.  Then I heard the music playing, looked at the car clock realizing I was missing 18 minutes of time.  I cannot recall the exact timing but I do recall the 18 minutes as the number 18 is a lifelong pattern of synchronicity. I had to laugh at that one!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my mom when I got back to the house about what had happened. Her reaction was, &#34;It doesn&#39;t surprise me!&#34; (UFO&#39;s are a &#34;known&#34; 4-generation experience for us!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1994 is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date above.  We have requested that the witness attempt to try to recall the exact date.  PD))<n>

We were on our way to Doncaster to drop one of our friends off and it was about 10pm. Looking up at the night sky i was pointing out constellations when accross the sky came a shooting star, however this shooting star stopped dead on the horizon.  We all thought this was strange that something traveling at that speed could stop dead as it did.  My friend from Doncaster was training to be a civil engineer at the time (since passed) and concluded that maybe this was a star that we didnt notice before!!!  I reported what i had observed to RAF Finingley, needless to say they did not take me seriously and cut my information short.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at Doncaster and dropped of my friend and decided to take a different route back to Rotherham Via Wadworth, Tickhill, Maltby (the A60) mainly because it was getting late and my cousin could put his foot down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While traveling towards Wadworth Hill where it goes over the A1(m) we began to notice something to the left hovering over a field.  As we got closer we noticed it was Triangular in shape, Black (but it was night) with lights in each corner and more lights in the centre.  I cant really remember what colour the lights were but i do remember winding down the window to listen for engine noise.  I wanted to stop but my cousin did not. Arriving into Tickhil i managed to get my cousin to stop the car so that i could use the phone box.  I rang RAF Finningley again expecting the same reception, however this time they asked me questions which seemed to be set. I.E. where in the sky, location etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After getting home i left the subject on the back burner.  A while later, possibly days or weeks i recieved a letter in a brown envelope.  With marking On Her Majesties Service.  I opened it and read a type set letter stating that what i had seen was one of many things: flock of geese, car lights, plane.......<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was all around the same time that the Belgium air force were chasing Black Triangles off their air space and others were seen over Yorkshire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated by source of report is approximate.

I have witnessed numorous UFO&#39;s, during the day only.  Please I will take a lie detector, or any other tests you want.  I am serious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sightings have only been during the day, with my sister a witness to only one sighitng.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a single Mom, I do not wish to be thought of as a crazy person, I know what I see, so if you are interested in the truth, talk to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the first one when I was pregnant with my four year old daughter, needless to say my life has never been the same.  I have always had the sightings in brood daylight, they are very shiny and big, the closest one is when my sister saw it with me.  We were driving down a little road in Spotsylvania, she was driving, I was in the passenger seat.  I looked out of my window I saw one way up, almost to be following us, I said look, she tried but she couldn&#39;t see it, it vanished, then on her side it was back she saw it this time, but then just as fast aa it had appeared it vanished.  Then we were coming to the end of the road where we could either go left of right, we stopped at the stop sign, and right in front of us, just above the trees, not more than 50 feet in the air, was the object, just hovering, so bright, we could barely look at it.  It stayed there for atleast two minutes, we got out of the car and just stared at it.  Then it went straight down, then straight up, and vanished right in front of us..  If there is someone out there that really wants to know what is going on, then ask me, test me, do whatever you have to.  I never believed in any of this until it kept happening to me.  Now I believe with all of my being.  I believe that they somehow foolow me, taunt me, know one else sees them, why?  Spotsylvania is hot bed of activity.  I want someone to investigate me, prove me to be a liar.  It is very hard for me to go against everyone else when they say that it is not real, because I see them, and they are very real.  Ask my sister.  If somebody out there can help me, please do.  I am a single mother, I have no money for a good camera, or video camera, but I tell you even if I had the pictures of what I have seen, who would believe me.  I see what the people have seen above Mexico, in the multiple sightings, but no one believes those pictures are real.<n>

But I swear this really happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back in about 1993-1994 early morning (don&#39;t remember the year exactly) my boyfriend (at that time) and I were wrestly around. At some point our ears touch each other at the head (if that makes any sense).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When our ears touch, it was like a quick few seconds where I heard what i can describe like millions of tiny voices. but they weren&#39;t like any language and they were all speaking at once but like no sound i could ever describe without making a fool of myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled away from each other as i was so blown away. I immediately screamed toward him and asked if he just heard what I heard. and he was so freaked out, that he did not want to discuss it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just pleaded over and over and asked if he heard all those voices of whatever that was. He admitted yes and would NEVER discuss it again. The wierd thing was that after that day, his bedroom window had no curtains and there was a driveway and bushes to the side. Well after that for the next couple of months or so (until we broke up), there was a bush that every night as the night lights outside went on was the most perfect shape of a large head of what we normally see described at what aliens look like. It was a large bush and by day it was just a bush, but by night it was just the side view of a large alien head because of the lights around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, this was not an actual sighting of an unidentified object, just the most bizarre unexplainable thing that I have EVER encountered in my life, especially since the bush thing appeared that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can remember those voices as if it was yesterday. Never heard anything again after that, as believe me i have tried to copy the ear thing again, but never worked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

6/29/94 23:00|Dull Center (near Bill) (north of Douglas)|WY|Light|5 minutes|Lights in shape of "radio tower" flew north|11/20/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04026.html|10|ndxe199406| Lights in shape of &#34;radio tower&#34; flew north<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of us, former Marine NCO&#39;s, were varmint hunting in the grasslands north of Douglas, Wyoming. We had gone into town to eat and upon our return to camp we noticed a radio tower (rather the lights) east of the road, two of us were quite familiar with the area and unaware of the tower. We stopped and commented on the tower which was just over a hill from us. As we drove on a taller hill occluded the tower. When we rounded the hill we looked back to try and triangulate the position of the tower. We found the tower had moved! It was still due east of us and much too close to be parallax. It was a warm evening, the windows were open, there was no sound. I shut off the engine, the &#34;tower&#34; began to move, it moved due north at an increasing speed. One of my friends aimed his varmint rifle at the &#34;tower&#34; and watched it until it disappeared from view without any course deviation, this was perhaps a minute after it was lost to naked eye view. There was never a change in color or configuration while I watched. The lights were in the shape of a pyramidal type TV or radio tower all lights were white in color, and about as bright as the marker lights on such a tower, much brighter than any stars. My friend stated that through the 20x rifle scope he could see no features or shape only the lights. He stated there was nothing between the lights, he could see the stars through the formation. The speed of the objects could not be estimated, but appeared to move at a constant acceleration, probably at about mach 2-3 before dwindling from sight, alternatively the lights dimmed and the formation closed at a constant rate. Discerning the difference would require a range finder or triangulation neither of which was available.<n>

What I saw was not recent, but about ten or eleven years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at a party at an apartment complex in Burbank, California. It was anywhere between 8 and 9pm at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember standing outside in the courtyard of the complex and looking up to the eastern sky. I noticed what I thought to be a row of stars lined up vertically, straight up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought to myself it was the belt of Orion, but for some reason it didn’t look right to me. Within a matter of seconds, the bottom two stars (lights) began to move. The middle one going left and the bottom moving to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first they started to move apart slowly, but then they began to increase in speed. They both started to move really quickly in circles weaving across eachother, all the while staying in the same general location they started in. They never moved very far from their original location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually they disappeared into the sky. When that happened, the remaining star began to move in the same rapid way and making circular movements, also eventually disappearing into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing could not have lasted for more than one minute and thirty seconds, since I first noticed them. It was one of the most mysterious and fascinating things I’d ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought I had truly seen a UFO. To this day I really don’t know what it was, but what I saw was way to remarkable to be anything different.<n>

At first it blinded me and the neighbor taking her toddler out of the car seat then it switched to three white lights under a skinny cow looking saucer with long blue lights on the sides.  It hovered over the cul de sac within two jumping distances of me at the time and looked as if it was checking us out.  After a 10-20 second checking me out it made a right flank about 1/10th of a mile into the sky and then went into hyperspace to the right.  If you want the feeling think about the talefane from Dr. Who with a twist being a flying saucer that was black and had to of come from some secret military base as I have never seen any aircraft like it.  I was not the only one who saw it either.  The neighb! or saw it with her son and her toddler and it was later found out that half the city called the sheriff as it was put on the news even though they saw it during the day and I saw it at night.  I filed a report with the Sheriff’s office but they swear that it was a helicopter or a plane on a training mission despite all the accounts of damages from the UFO and the military base not having any planes or radio surveillance.<n>

I had finished my workout and was standing outside the chow hall alone waiting for it to open (it was 2345hrs).  The night was extreamly clear and I could see tons of stars.  I am an avid star watcher so this was a great time to just stop and look up.  I noticed an extreamly bright star and stared at it for a moment, then it seemed to move and I looked at it harder and it almost seemed as if it noticed me, im sure that it didn&#39;t but the reason I say that is becuase when it moved and I really started to look at it, then it zipped down so fast and as it zipped I thought immediately that it was a shooting star but then then stopped, then it zipped across the sky to the left and I would have to estimate 100 Miles in air space or more within a split second then it stopped again, zipped back to almost the same location only this time higher up and then zipped what appeared to be straight up and then it was gone.  I cannot be sure of the actual distance this object was traveling but I know for a fact that there is no craft that the USAF has that can travel at such speeds and the flight pattern that this craft was making.  Picture an odd shaped triangle it started at the top zipped down then to the left then back up to almost its original position and then poof it was gone.  There were no sounds at all whatsoever.  Now to confirm something.  Where I grew up in California I was lucky to see the SR-71 Blackbird fly many many times.  I saw the SR-71 go sonic and let me tell you that was one fast plane really really fast but there is a catch to speed and that is a Sonic Boom.  When that plane went Mach whatever it did, there was a boom that shook my whole house.  Last note, no pilot could withstand the g-forces that this object would have created to instaniously move the distance and speed this object was traveling at.  This was no slow motion thing zip zip zip gone.  I will never forg! et this and am only reporting it now because I was working with nuclear weapons at the time and could have been considered crazy for reporting such a thing and lost my security clearence.  I made a simple drawing of the pattern of flight if you would like it just let me know and I would be happy to send it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I used to live in Darby,Montana about 7 years ago. One night while a friend, and myself sat around a camp fire, I saw something different than I have ever seen before. I am not sure exactly what it was. I was looking up at the night sky, and saw what looked like stars moving. These objects seemed to be pretty high up in the sky, so I really could not give details about what shape they were, etc. They just looked like stars moving very fast. They were all moving in pretty much a straight line at first. I watched these things moving, and told my friend to look. We were both kind of wondering what this could be because we had never seen such a thing before. The objects appeared to be fluttering, kind of shaking rapidly as they moved. I grabbed a flashlight, and beamed them, and then one branched off. The others went on in the same straight line. I kept my eyes on the one that branched off, and after a minute or two lost it behind a tree. My friend, who is the toughest guy I know went inside with his eyes wattering! I just wanted to share this with you because it was pretty unusual.I remember at first thinking these might be satellites, but I am not sure that a satellite can flutter, and make a ninety degree turn in the sky! I wonder if anyone else has had similar experiences. What I saw was not to spectacular, but pretty unusual. Not sure of exact date and time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Couldn&#39;t get it to focus clearly. The pet cats were climbing all over us, and they usually don&#39;t want to cuddle with me, so I thought that was odd. I got up from my chair in the driveway and looked up above the tall, surrounding trees to see if I could find the moon, easier to focus on. I turned around to look behind us , and above the Douglas firs and the house was a bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Complete circle, breifly thought it was the moon, but it had an electrical glow. I asked my friend&#34;what&#39;s that?&#34; She said she didn&#39;t know- not a lamp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She tried to focus on it with the telescope, and when she put her eye to the eyepiece the light flashed brightly. My friend jerked her head away and exclaimed that the light had hurt her eye. Then the light shrunk down to star size, zipped diagonally to the left. then took off up further into the sky and zig- zagged to the left and dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

No sir, you are not nuts, and I guess I&#39;m not either, should this be the only consideration. Aproximately 9 years ago, my wife and I were driving on Coquina Key  late at night when I saw, seemingly just beyond the skyway bridge, to the SW, a very bright green &#34;meteor&#34; head apparently into the gulf. I remember thinking it might be a flare, due to the odd colour and the startling brightness,... but I considered the speed, (meteoric), the size, even if it was nearer than I suspected which is unlikely, and concluded that it was indeed some extraordinary low atmosphere event. It happened so quickly that my wife missed it, much to my consternation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This report also entered into the report from Pinellas County, FL, for July 27, 2003.

6/15/94 22:00|Montgomery|AL|Triangle|10 minutes|A huge, very low, black triangle traveling at a very low speed and making a low hissing sound traveled directly over my home.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98594.html|24|ndxe199406| A huge, very low, black triangle traveling at a very low speed and making a low hissing sound traveled directly over my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the late spring, early summer, of 1994 (not exactly sure of precise date but am very sure of this time-frame), I was home alone in South Montgomery, Al., located just south of the southern blvd.  It was dusk and just had become dark.  I heard what I assumed was the &#34;bugquot; that used to spray for mosquitoes during the summer late in the evenings.  I quickly began to go around the house closing windows and resumed whatever it was I was doing.  After a few minutes I realized the sound of the bug truck wasn&#39;t going or moving very fast so I stuck my head out of the door to see what it was doing. If you have ever heard the bug truck in your area, it makes a distinct sound.  I saw no vehicle or lights on the road out front coming from either direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curious, I walked outside in the side yard and was puzzled because I continued to hear the truck spraying but didn&#39;t see it.  At this point it sounded as if it was driving or moving away from my! location.  I then caught movement above my head moving in a southeastern direction towards the Alfa Insur. angency and the Dannelly Field air port.  What I saw was stars disappearing way out in front of me in a wedge formation, probably several hundred yards away, and stars reappearing just over my head in a straight line.  I then realized what I was looking at was huge, jet black or the same color as the sky, and in the form of a giant triangle. And low!  I feel like I could have shot a rock from a sling shot and hit it in its belly.  That night was very dark and still other than what I was seeing and I recall this object having low or dim lights in a straight line along its three edges that were constant or not blinking.  These lights were no brighter than the stars in the back ground.  It&#39;s span from left to right was several hundred yards and its nose or tip was several hundred yards away from me.  Again, I couldn&#39;t believe how low it was.  As it was moving away, so wa! s the bug truck sound.  I recall being scared and excited at t! he same time while I was out there and was talking out loud in amazement.  As the rear of whatever I was seeing was disappearing over the tree line, my neighbor&#39;s Dad stepped outside.  I recall asking him loudly if he saw what I saw.  He said he heard the bug truck.  I remember  telling him what I saw but also remember he didn&#39;t understand what I was trying to tell him or what I was describing.  I immediately went back into the house after it disappeared completely in the Dannelly Field direction and called a number listed for Dannelly Field.  I don&#39;t remember if who I spoke with or what number I called, but they seemed puzzled about my story.  I remember asking the person all kinds of questions but they didn&#39;t seem to believe me.  I don&#39;t recall calling anyone else but have always wondered who else saw this thing, and how many people actually reported it to either Dannelly Field or Maxwell Air Force Base.  I&#39;ve only told my parents and wife about this story since this happened only! because it sounds so far-fetched.  Who else saw this during the late spring or early summer of &#39;94?  I don&#39;t know what I saw, but it was real, was huge, was moving slow, was making that bug truck sound, and was a pretty awesome experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I have been keeping these stories to myself for a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think the time is right to tell someone.I have two stories that happend years apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time I saw what I think was a UFO, To tell the truth I dont know what it was  but reports on the news and pictures made me rethink what i had seen. The first  time I was camping with friends for the weekend. It had gotten late and we all went  into our tents. I came back outside my tent to, Well you know. Anyway while I was  doing that I happend to look to my left and I saw three bright white lights.The lights  looked like a triangle.one light on top and two at the bottom. They looked to be a  mile or so away. So I thought it must be someone with lights on a  hill but the next  morning I looked in the direction that I saw the lights and the ground was flat for as  far as you could see. The lights were in a vertical position. So its no way it could  have been lights on a hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Case number two, It was midday about six years ago my wife and I was on our way in the house. I looked up and saw what I thought was a balloon, It was silver But then I thought the wind was blowing and the object was not moving. I called too my wife to look. She asked me &#34;What is that&#34; I said I dont know when we looked agin it was gone. Like I said it was silver and round mybe a little oval but more round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I almost forgot...I&#39;m from Saint Louis Mo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They were both glowing with a light that was somehow blurry, while nothing else in my sight was blurry.  After about ten seconds, it changed its course, and after about ten-15 seconds of that, it sped off at a mind-boggling speed.

I&#39;d thought someone had been pulled over by police or something and were behind me at first but then strobe? lights were swirling in the car moreso, and as I was turning to look out the window to see what was going on I then was blinded by the brightest white beam or spot? light!  It shown on me so brightly I couldn&#39;t focus and had to turn from it.  Then as I tried to look out window again the light on me seemed to get less intense backing off so I could see it .  Then after being able to focus, the light source got bigger as if someone had turned a switch on making it brighter (this time not blinding or blaring in my face), then bigger again as if someone had turned a switch a sec time to increase it.  It  hovered for a couple or so min right above the car I&#39;d say approx 40 ft away: it was so close!  It seemed to also be observing what husband was doing in office.  Then the light went back smaller, then smaller again then blinked out totally (the same way it had became bigger and brighter- it went out -like in sections).  Couldn&#39;t see any form of craft : was a slightly hazy night that night . No sound was heard for it was already noisy at location .  When it blinked out I got out of car and tried hard to find it for about a min or so then off in the distance approx a few miles away (though I&#39;m no expert) suddenly out of the darkness it lit up again one time then blinked out again.  Husband came out after it all had happened with a min or so.  Told him , family and friends about my experience but this time officially reporting. I&#39;d seen a few planes prior but whatever this was it wasn&#39;t using traveling lights like aircraft are supposed to do. And it&#39;s had me soooo curious for yrs.

It was however the same day of a Shuttle launch. I was on my way home from work driving home from Orange City on I-4 then I had just got off 4 on to I-95 south. I was looking ahead and saw light&#39;s about a mile in front of me. I always see planes because the airport is near by. This time the lights stayed stationary and I was thinking it was a chopper and it was a speed check. So I slowed down...... As I got closer it remained in it&#39;s position,to the point I was able to drive under it. I was able to see that it wasn&#39;t a chopper,there was no noise. It had a shape un-like any other that I have ever seen on TV. One that I can not describe  cleary in writing. But I could draw,which I have several time&#39;s. But I will try to do so here................. ---------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- -------     -----------------      ----- -----      -----------------      ---- ---        --------------        --- ------------ ------- ----- This is the best that I can do.. This is not a disk shaped object.. In the center was a large black circular window...front and back.. on both ends..front and back smaller round dark black holes appeared to be about the size of tires. I believe on the back side....because of the direction it was moving...Where 5 strobe light..horozontally aligned on the upper part of the craft. It did not turn like a plane as it left me...which it did when I pulled over and got out of my car.It turned and went over to the north bound side of I-95 and headed north.then it was just gone.......I went home and told my family....and of course everyone just thought I was crazy.... And for the rest of the night and the next day I had a headache that wouldn&#39;t go away. I have just now in the last 6 months got a computer and was watching sightings and felt it was time to at least tell someone of my sighting and that there is another shaped craft that hasn&#39;t been shown yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to confirm the precise date.

I was sitting in my patrol car at about 0300 hrs., when I noticed movement in the sky to the north. What I saw was a very large, triangular shaped object with off-white lights at each corner slowing moving from north to southeast. The craft could have only been maybe 300-500 feet high and there was absoulutely no sound coming from it. I watched in dis-belief and tried to make sense of it. I thought about the Stealth bomber, but wouldn&#39;t that at least make some sound? I could tell that this object was solid, as the middle of it darkened out the clear sky behind it. The lights seemed erie, not bright, but not dull, and they were steady, but also seemed to flicker. It took maybe two minutes for the craft to pass over me and as it began leaving my field of vision, I finally realized that I needed to follow it. I followed it for about another two minutes as it travelled southeast out of my city limits and Im not sure why, but I decided to stop my &#34;pursuit&#34;. I also am not sure why I didn&#39;t tell anyone about this incident until fairly recently, when I told my wife. I&#39;m a 15 year police veteran, who has seen alot of weird stuff late at night, but I&#39;ve never seen anything like this. There is a Naval Air Station nearby, but I&#39;ve been out there many times and as far as I know, they don&#39;t have anything like what I saw.<n>

Never a sound, just a display.

It was erly in the morning I was tired.  I accidentally crouched north insted of going 40 west.  I took the first exit I could and decided to take that highway.  I&#39;m driving ten minutes and I pass a house on my right in a valley it was lit like daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped because I&#39;m woundering why.  I back up looked down the drive way it just was bright. In the middle of the night?  No I got to check this out.  So I got out and closed my door softly I didn&#39;t want to wake my girlfriend who was sound asleep.  I walked around the back of the car witch is sitting in the middle of the road.  I stoped listened crickets were chirping the tree frogs were crying for rain lighting bugs were lighting nothing was out place except for the two story waltons looking house lit up brighter than day!<n> <n><n> <n><n> So down the drive way I start slowly I get maybe ten yards and stop I don&#39;t know why.  I crouched down and then I saw what was bothering me.  It wasn&#39;t that the house was lit up brighter than daylight it was lit up inside and out bright inside and out.  WHAT how in gods name?  Then I crept a couple of feet and saw what haunts me to this day.  I saw a light round soft light then I started looking for the out line of what was holding the light.  It was a triangle shaped hole in the starsand it was big the light was the size of the house.  I was close anuff to toss a rock and hit it.  To say the least I was in aw.  To say the most I was in heaven because I&#39;m a skeptic if I don&#39;t see it I don&#39;t beleave it and here it was something I can&#39;t explain.  let me qualify my next statement I am ex-military I worked on helicopters 68 be 10 was the job.  This craft was stable had no hum wine or rumble silent.  Im takeing this all in I&#39;m seeing a large craft not man made wow!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend woke up and started yelling for me I told her to come to me.  She got out car grumpy and started to where I was kneeling.   When she got to me started to speak and I just pointed to the light.  I must admit that was stupid because she started screaming when she saw the light we got run!  I asked her how they flew that thing here though space and a long way how did she think we could out run it in a car?  That made her stop and think she was scared unbelievably I wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said lets look a few more seconds just then it got crazier a woman floated out of the light and in thought a coosed window.  I told my girlfriend ok I&#39;m done get in the car this to much.  And we got back in the car and left.<n>

Minor details I felt should be included.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to make a note to my previous report, which I filed for this same date and location. The craft I witnessed was clearly visible in the glow cast by the street lights. I could make out every detail on the under body. Along with the strange size, color and placement of the lights, I could also make out what appeared to be two arched shaped tubes running along the bottom back side of the craft. In the glow of the street lights the craft looked to be of a dark non-metallic color. Its shape I would say, is not beyond the imagination of a human mind. However, this craft exhibited maneuverability characteristics far beyond that of any known current technology. The G-force&#39;s involved in the maneuver I witnessed would have been too great for a human. The craft seemed oblivious to any form of inertia. It approached at a constant rate I can only guess to be around 50 to 60 mph. It did not slow down. It simply just stopped, spun around and accelerated back to about the same speed it approached, all in an instant. It didn&#39;t even drift. There was never a sound or any sign of smoke or exhaust. Now here&#39;s the weird part. Not long after I filed my initial report, the street lights on the big bend part of the sawgrass highway (by Coral Springs) where removed!!! This I find very strange. Why would they take down the lights? Can anyone else confirm this? It may just be coincidence. I have done an incredible amount of research into the UFO phenomenon and to this day I can not find a sighting that resembles mine. I still recall that night clear as day. It will forever be burned in my mind. When a person see&#39;s something that defies all known logic, it tends to leave one feeling unsettled. I just want to know that I&#39;m not crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

First of all the whole area i was in went dark as if something huge was over the top of me. Then i saw a huge black object hover over the top of me. At first i couldnt really see it but the the clouds become clear and i could see it in detail. It was very big and it was a kinda triangle shape. It was also black in colour. I saw the underneatth of it very well and it was very smooth with no kind of indication as to how it was held together. I could see wot looked like some kind or entrance which was also triangle but a lot smaller. It hovered above me for about 5 mins and i just stood and looked at it. I could also see some kind of distortion around the object too. It looked like it was folding the air around it because it was distorted. It was quite low down and must have been about 10 metres above me but i couldnt feel no wind or hear any noise from it. As fast as it appeared, it dissapeared. One minute it was there and the next it blinked out like a light as if it had some kind of advanced acceleration.<n>

I had just finished flying a trip into Boston&#39;s Logan airport. The weather was warm and there was a broken cloud deck above Logan with bases of about 10,000ft and the tops ranged from 10,300 to 10,500. We had just come from Quebec so I knew pretty well where the clouds were hanging. I was walking from the airplane to our operations area in one of the large hangers on Logan&#39;s North ramp.  I looked up through a pretty good hole in the clouds as I was walking and noticed 3 objects in the sky just above the cloud tops.  The first two were in a tight echelon formation and the last one was trailing about 1/2 mile behind.  Whatever they were, they were trianglular  in form with rounded corners.  Their coloration looked black except for that they glowed  red much like a caste iron poker would glow once heated.  They approached from the west and were heading east a a high rate of speed.  Their size was emmence as from where I was standing they appeared to be a good 1&#34; long. They were in snd out of the cloud t adjusting for my prespective that  would have them hughe.  I called a close friend at the approach control to see if they had picked up anything.  They had not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It had little orange cicles along it.  It was very dark.  It was an outline, really, with circles on it.  It changed shape, which frightened us.  It glided very smoothly.  It was too low to be any kind of aircraft, too quite too.  It made a slight pulsing humming sound.  It eventually disappeared out of view.  We stayed outside.  A few minutes later another one flew by.  It was sort of H-shaped.  The circles blinked lighter and darker, and some blinked on and off.  It came from the same place and moved the same.  It gave a high-pitched beeping sound.  It followed the other&#39;s path and was out of view in a few minutes.  We were spooked enough, s!o we went inside.<n>

My wife slept through it. I may have been sleeping lightly because my two daughters were in sleeping bags on the deck next to our bedroom. The sound was early in the morning, maybe three thirty or so. I didn’t get up, but rather fell back to sleep. If I was to describe the sound I would have to say it was like that of a sound effect from a sci-fi movie. It was a combination of humming low with whooshing and whirring . It was close to the house in the back yard just beyond the deck. The oscillation  accelerated as it rose and faded out of earshot at an angular direction. It’s funny how much information can be gleamed from just a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I began to wake up at my more normal time, fivethirty to six, I was absently distracted by a steady irregular tinging sound in my lower back yard. I was getting my lunch ready for work, shower and the usual routine with this sense of this background noise just not being part of it, not being part of the usual. I always run late to work but I had to walk down to the lower yard on my way out to see what was making the noise. My lower yard consisted of a stand of older growth fir trees and I had the habit of collecting junk and storing it down below. One such item was the drum off of a cement mixer truck. Anyway the ground was covered with pine cones from the trees; they had been falling off by the hundreds out of the tree stand apparently for several hours. The ting sound was the ones hitting the cement drum. I first considered squirrels but there were so many cones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was called out to by my neighbor from across a fence from which she had no view wanting to know what I was doing. She was obviously hearing the cones as well. It wasn’t until later that day I connected the early morning sound with the strange de-coning of my trees. I believe this was a close encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For reference my house is on the west side of Vashon Island in the Puget Sound  in Washington State.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

6/5/94 00:35|McDonough|GA|Other||I and two others saw a reddish orange ball of light with a tail traveling through the night sky under clouds while fishing.|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80977.html|50|ndxe199406| I and two others saw a reddish orange ball of light with a tail traveling through the night sky under clouds while fishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had come home from Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota to enjoy a couple of weeks at home in Georgia.  One evening, my brother, my girlfriend, and I decided to go fishing for catfish at a local pay lake in Henry County.  We started fishing around 9:00 PM that evening.  We hadn’t had much luck. We only caught a couple of small cats about twelve inches or so.  My brother had been fishing there before, and he told us that the fishing usually started picking up around midnight.  My girlfriend, who was also in Air Force at the time, was ready to go.  However, my brother and I talked her into sticking it out with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night, the moon was bright enough so that we could see the top of the tree line against the sky just beyond the damn of the lake.  The night sky was littered with patches of clouds all around. Sometime after midnight, we all saw this object in the sky.  We were looking in the direction of the damn which was to our right.  I believe the damn was to the North of our location.  I can’t be sure, as I had never been to the lake before.  The object was a reddish orange oval shape that had some sort of a tail or exhaust in the same color as the object itself.  It wasn’t like any light that I had ever seen before or since.  It didn’t have a constant solid light color as most lights do.  Instead, it seemed to be more like a ball of lava. I don’t want to say that it was like a ball of fire, because it had a cooler appearance, almost like the stuff in a lava lamp.  The object was at a lower altitude than the clouds. It did not make a sound at all as it moved through the sky.  We watched it! for approximately 10 to 15 seconds as it continued its straight path through the night sky.  The tail maintained the same distance from the body of the object the entire time.  We finally lost sight of it to the farthest right part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen all types of aircraft flying at night during my time in the Air Force.  I was in Desert Storm, and I was an aircraft armament systems specialist. My duties were on the flight line.  I have seen shooting stars and meteors before.  I also know what a comet looks like, and they aren’t within our atmosphere the way this thing was.  This was something that none of us had ever seen before.  My brother and I were talking about it just the other day, and I finally decided to tell someone to see if they had an answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were visiting Berkeley Plantation near Williamsburg in June 1994, and I looked up and saw what I&#39;m sure was a Stealth bomber. It looked just like the pictures - black and triangular. I never regarded it as a UFO sighting since we were near military bases and I was very sure that it was a military aircraft that I saw. I don&#39;t remember it making a sound that I could hear, but it was flying pretty high so that&#39;s not surprising.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The B-2 &#34;Stealth&#34; bomber is very loud, when it is flying at a high power/thrust level.  However, at a distance, it might be audibly undetectable.  We have no way of knowing whether the event is in any way related to the 11/01/02 event.  PD))<n>

There was another white light which zig zagged around the stationary lights, and this light would move from extremely bright to dim, this light merged with the stationary lights, then a white flourecent looking ball appeared and passed us, dissappearing below the horizon of the hill, none of the lights made any sound, I ran to get a closer look at the lights, the other two were insistant that we get back in the car and drive around the Penninsula to get a closer look, we never sighted the lights again. This was all close proximity, approx 100-200 m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really wish we had a video camera with us that night!!!<n>

This was just my friend and me in the car.  Anyway we were driving on top of South Mountain near Stabler Arena when I noticed what look like a helicopter above a new housing development.  They were still building this development.  This was about 7 football fields away or so.  I said to my friend as a joke &#34;look its a UFO&#34;!  We thought it was a Helicopter because it was just staying still and hovering.  I said to my friend to flash your lights at it in which he did.  This object began to move upon us flashing our lights coming directly towards us.  We then began to drive towards it as well.  It amazed both of us that it responded to our flashing.  There were no other cars in the area either.  Anyway we drove closer to it arriving at the main road and we stopped our car in the middle of the road.  This object was still coming right at us and moving very slow.  I got out of the car and my friend stayed in until curiosity finally got him out of the car as well.  I said to my friend &#34;what is that&#34;? We both at this time were filled of adrenalin as this object slowly passed right next to us. It was close enough to throw a rock and hit it.  We could both see it wasn&#39;t a Helicopter or a Airplane.  I can remember it was Triangle shaped with 3 lights.  One in the front and 2 in the back.  You could see metallic on it as it went by, we looked at the side of the ship and some under belly.  We were both stunned at what we were seeing, the thing that always got us was that there was no sound, maybe just a slight hum.  You couldn&#39;t hear an engine!  It slowly went passed us.  It disappeared when it went behind the other side of the mountain.  I&#39;m still shocked at this.  We both got back into the car and drove off.  My mind still tries to figure out what really was that thing.....My friend and I talked about this recently bringing back a lot of memories etc and we wanted to report this to you.  We both pledge that this is 100% true, we were not drinking and in a normal solid state of mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 In PA<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

My Mother, My cousin and I were north or Nortwest and directly to the East where there are hills that are high if you can find information on them, they also have sattelites on top in some areas. There is an Airplane Museum/Golf Course on the bottom of these hills just above the sight area. As I was saying we were north or Nortwestbound on Central Avenue and it was a &#34;mutual&#34; (everyone saw at the same time) sighting which was the red lights appear one by one (6) or so towards the north. My mother and I looked at each other and my mother pulled over, so we could see the event taking place. They appeared like christmas lights do in a line until the all the lights are lit, then the lights turn off, and start over. But they didn&#39;t turn off. I cannot remember the amount of time we were observing the event. I was about 15 years old or so and an amature astronomer at the time. My eyes wandered further up and saw a small point of light high in the sky (the point the same size as the stars) moving NE. I yelled to my mom and cousing to look up in the sky above us. Without any sound or time the sky light seemed to turn dark but what it was was the craft appeared directly above us either from the point of light in the sky, I&#39;m not sure. It seemed like it just appeared in front of us. at that moment my mother had a feared look in her face and being her son I knew when my mother is scared and I never noticed it but she felt &#34;warm&#34; whether from the fear causing the warmth, I really don&#39;t know. In an instant the darkness left, because I was focused on that light high in the sky. It was like the saucer shot up in the sky at a very high speed, became the point of light again and soon I lost sight of it. The lights on the hill had disappeared also. We rushed home to get my father and other brothers and sister and went back to the sight. but saw nothing after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There were 3 white lights spaced in a triangular pattern and I believe the lights were circular in shape. There was absolutely no sound. I began to franticly flash my high beams and low beams over and over again. I wanted the object to notice me so that it would leave the watertower. As I was about a mile away from the object (north of the object), it began to move away in a southern direction. There were no colored lights whatsoever. I thought to myself, why on earth would an object be hovering over a huge watertower within an eighth of a mile of a university. I could not actually see the shape of the craft because it was pitch black night. However, since the lights were triangularly spaced apart, I assume that the craft itself was triangular. I told my mom and girlfiend about this incident but I have never reported it to any ufo agency until now. The weird thing about that night was that it was real quiet. By that I mean I was the only one on that road (no other vehicles) and there was strange silence. I will never, ever forget that night.<n>

After seeing these lights poised in this perfect circle ,the rotation and the rate of acceleration,I am sure they were not a fixed wing or helo.I am retired from the Navy where I worked in aviation .<n>

I had always thought that my story would be irrelevant because it was only a sighting, but after watching a UFO show on the Travel Channel, I&#39;d report my experience just to have it on record.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around June of 1994 and i was living in Las Vegas in an apartment complex on Desert Inn and Pecos.  I was living with my girlfriend named Dana Scavone at the time and was a dice dealer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got off from work at 8pm and went to the apartment.  It&#39;s been a long time so the exact time of the occurance escapes me, but i want to say around 9:30 pm or somewhere in that time frame.  I smoked outside, and we lived on the second floor of our apartment complex, and stepped outside of the apartment door onto the balcony, lit a cigarette, and as i was smoking the cigarette i happened to look up...and that&#39;s when i saw a HUGE, black, perfectly triangled craft slowly moving across the sky making no noise whatsoever.  The craft couldn&#39;t have been more than 1000 ft. up, moving from the northwest towards the southeast.  This craft was black, had no bright lights, but did have some kind of circular metallic object in the bottom side middle of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked in awe for a few moments and then yelled for my girlfriend Dana to come out and look at what i was seeing. Dana came outside and looked up and said, &#34;Oh my God, what is that?&#34;.  I replied, &#34;I think it&#39;s a UFO&#34;. I then ran into the apartment, grabbed the telephone and dialed 911.  The operator answered and i proceeded to tell her exactly what i was looking at.  I said to the 911 operator, &#34;I am looking at a huge black triangle in the sky right now as we speak, and it&#39;s flying right over my apartment&#34;; or something to that effect.  The 911 operator was not mad at me as i had thought they might be for calling in a UFO (Which i didn&#39;t even think really existed), but was more interested in the idea that i was really looking at a UFO.  I think i asked her if she had heard aything from other callers, and she replied that she had not.  Then one of us decided that i should contact McCarran airport or Nellis AFB to see if they might have anything on ra! dar to explain the craft.  I remember just saying something like, &#34;Maybe you guys should contact Nellis and see if they have something because i am definitely seeing a huge black triangle fly right over my apartment&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hung up the phone and watched the craft continue on towards the Southeast as it climbed and eventually disappeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no noise.  I am absolutely sure of what i saw.  And if you can get the 911 audio, you&#39;ll clearly see how startled i was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event happened.  This was not an airplane.  This was a triangle.  It moved slowly, without sound, directly over my head.<n>

It was a very calm and peaceful shade of florescent blue or soft powder blue light<n> <n><n> <n><n> To whom it may concern,  On approximately June, 1994 at 21:00 hours a girlfriend and I were at a Carnival in North Bergen, NJ. There was a crowd of people there but no one seemed to catch a glimpse of what my girlfriend and I saw that night. She tapped me on the shoulder and said “What is that!” I looked up to where she was pointing and there was a disk shaped object out in space.  It was a very calm and peaceful shade of florescent blue or a very soft powder blue light. It was a very clear night and I know definitively the unidentified object was out in space and not a hoax. It hovered there for about 20 seconds and as soon as I tapped my husband’s shoulder and asked him to look up at the sky, from the time it took me to tap him on the shoulder and the time he looked up which was only about a split second, the saucer left in a flash and instantly disappeared into space. My guess it was traveling the speed of light to disappear that quickly. I would say about 0 to light speed in approximately ½ of a second. I thought to myself how lucky I was to have seen it because most people have to go through life wondering if UFOs and life on other planets exists. Now I know the answer and I consider myself privileged to know. When my girlfriend and I tried to tell our husbands what we saw they just looked at us like we were crazy and then she dropped the conversation. I just kept telling everyone and did not care if they did not believe it. It was an amazing memory. This is the first time I am reporting it because I did not know there was a site where I could report such events. I just came across your site today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The dog and I were diagonally across from our house.  All of a sudden many transparent green balls of light shot out and drifted down from the bright light very slowly  dissipating well before it came in contact with a tree line.  The bright light in back of the clouds disappeared and I returned home describing what I saw to my wife when she told me the cape cod times had many reports of sightings that week.  I will never forget these few moments.  Approx a few days or week later a coast guard helicopter landed about a tenth of a mile from location ( very weird location for it to have landed on land adjacent to Parkers River.  Could not find out any reason for them to have been landed at night at this strange location on Main Street on Rt 28 South Yarmouth there were a few people that pulled over because it was so odd to see such a large craft land in a tiny area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were in our living room with the tv on and a light on, the room was bright. We had covered our window months ago with a thick black-out curtain because we wanted the room dark because we both had a habit of sleeping in our recliners and liked it dark in the morning so we could stay asleep. This curtain was closed when, while we watched tv, we both turned to the left toward the window at the same time and saw an intense flash of light that seemed to be white/yellow and then turned blue. This light did not illuminate the room but was defined with clear edges on the curtain. Imagine someone cutting on a 500000 candlepower ligt and pressing it firmly to the window. This all happened in an instant and we turned to each other and said &#34;did you see that?&#34; Something had made us turn toward the window at the same time.

It was only recently that I recalled the event in a rather strange way. On Sunday morning, Dec. 11,05, I awoke suddenly, not from a dream or nightmare, but to a vivid memory of a large, Galaxy Class starship being escorted up Puget Sound by military helicopters. I was trembling and in shock, not from fear, but the thought of how I could forget such an fantastic event. It was then that I realized how &#34;they&#34; can get away with visiting and not getting caught. But this story has many facets to it that I can&#39;t try to explain it all. It was in the evening, I heard the copters flying over my house, which is on the bluff over looking I5 and the Nisqually Valley. There were two copters excorting what I would interpret as a large carrier,mothership, N.E. along the I5 route. They were moving at a slow deliberate pace. The carrier was typical battleship gray,and since it was still suuny out, I did not observe any lights. Since the craft was virtually overhead, I could only see the bottom and side of it. The side was lined with what appeared to be large bay doors. The size of the craft I can only say that 20 football fields may be a concervative estimate. Now why were there two copters excorting it? I can only speculate that it may have mechanical trouble and was being led north to the pole, out of public view. I seem to recall reports that this was observed along the sound and into Canada. Obviuosly, contact with the ship was made, and the military was coopering with them. I believe that through minimal media coverage, and the extraordinary nature of the event, things like this are quickly forgotten in the collective consciuosness. As long as we are distracted by lights in the sky, and unexplained objects, then the truth remains buried. I am seeking help to further clarify what I witnessed that day, since I cannot recall exactly when it happened. I do know it did happen, and there should be thousands of witnesses to this event. But if I am made to forget, then they are too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Everyone was talking about it and I don&#39;t know anyone that believes in UFO&#39;s. The lights were triangle in position and hovered for hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never could really see them very well until about the third day into this when just like the other gentlemen I was watching television and noticed this strange object with lights flashing out the window. Some of my friends were in another part of the house when I went to get them to come outside. We all stood in silence and looked at this retangle shape object with what I remember to be different colored lights and they were flashing. It looked like something you would see at an amusement park but huge. Like the other post this was also near a water tower but on another side of town from the other post. From what I have read this object must have traveled from AUM to over the VA hospital to where I am near baptist hospital (East to West) This object was approx. a quarter mile away and went below the tree line as if landing. We all piled in the car to see if we could find it but there was no sign of it and we never heard anyone else talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always wondered what it could have been and don&#39;t think it was aliens or anything like that but after that we never heard or saw anything about it in the news and the story quickly faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The location was east Sugargrove road just east of U.S. 31. we started down Sugargrove and I noticed a black ball about the size of a basketball which seemed to be hanging in the sky.  It was at about a 30 degree angle. As we gained speed the object stayed with us. As I watched, it began to change shape from a ball to a disc as if it were rotating.  It continued to pace us until we reached the Stop sign at Custer road. When we stopped, it resumed the ball shape and sped off to the north and was out of sight in just a second. It never made any sound. I didn&#39;t make any report at the time as I didn&#39;t want anyone to think we were crazy. Now that there is a place to report, I felt it was necessary. I have never seen the object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Basically, this craft appeared during the daytime and was travelling N-NE at a high altitude.  It was definitely travelling above the normal flight path of the incoming planes which usually come in the E-W directions at a few thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft flew over at a constant speed and looked spherical in shape, I say this because the reason it caught my eye when I was talking to my friend on the phone was that it was glaring like a silver object reflecting the sun.  I have seen planes glare the sun before, but this was not a plane because it was pulsing this glare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In other words, it travelled across my window and pulsed a silver glare as it flew straight across the sky.  I kept asking my friend who lived about 2 miles away if he could see it relative to my point of view but he didn&#39;t see it... it was very high up(maybe ~20 thousand feet) or it was just closer and small, but it was only in my view for about one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently a ((deleted)) in the ((deleted)) Engineering Dept. at ((deleted)).<n>

I was sitting on my couch when I heard a loud scraping noise on my roof, although it did not sound scary, sounded like it could just be something logical like a huge tree branch. When I drew the curtains back, just about my house was a giant circle shaped ufo, a dull metallic tin foil color. The bottom was all I could see, it was covered in piping. It was so big, so close, no more than 20 feet above my home, as it passed- another one fallowed. No one seen this but me, I called my friend who live a few blocks up and she had no idea what I was talking about. No one was outside, no one heard it, it was almost like it was only meant for me to see it. Like it camouflaged it’s self to everyone in the world but me. When my parents got home I tried to tell them, I grabbed 2 paper plates placed them together, covered them with tin foil and tried to draw the piping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I have perfect vision, on no medication, etc..<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s 1997 now, but in 1994, an incident occurred. This has been occurring to me lately, I saw a, lets say, UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im from Dayton, OH, but I was in Fairborn, OH, this particular day It was around 12:00 noon, full daylight, little clouds in the sky..  I walked out outside of a apartment complex, mind you id been up since about 9:00 am, as soon as I get outside, I noticed a round, rather large object sitting in the high air, hovering.  A friend was with me but I was so attached to the object in the sky, I wasn’t able to say anything to him till it was all over.  I continued walking and starring, after about 8-10 seconds the object ascended, or rather departed farther into the sky.  Estimating another 5-7 seconds to depart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this is the reason why I believed what I saw.  Not only a full beautiful day of sunlight, hardly a cloud in the sky, but... As the object departed, whatever part of the sky this is actually visible, (I’m not sure if our own space shuttle does this, I could be wrong, but I don’t think so) I noticed I could see a distortion around the object.  Simply I could see black around the departing object, rather the distortion allowed me to see, without the blue sky, right into space, or rather the point of leaving the atmosphere allowed the, or didn’t allow light as normal.  I cant really explain, but my brain, or rather I would have never have thought of that occurring. The process that took place I’ve never considered.  I believe what I saw only because of the sunny day, perfect vision, not really, the distortion around the object as it departed, like I say, I could not have conceived the Idea of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I, in general do not think of this memory, vary rarely, but an idea popped into my head to write and send to , somewhere.  I don’t expect belief, anyone can say anything, I would like an explanation of a similar distortion that occurs as an object departs, or it only happens under certain conditions, as I explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its thursaday, Jan 25, If explanation, please reply..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My report concerns a sighting by a very close long-time friend of my family whom we regard as a very honest and trustworthy person who lives outside of Scottsville, Kentucky.  She told the following story to my late Grandmother only because she trusted her, and she truly believed that nobody else would believe her fantastic story.  My Grandmother told me the story a little later on.  I, as a person who has witnessed a UFO up close before, did believe her story.  I cannot be sure about the exact date of her sighting, but I do know that it was sometime around the middle of the 1990&#39;s.  So I used the date of 1994 to be as close to the accurate date as possible.  This lady who saw the object lives directly beside my late Grandmother&#39;s residence in Scottsville.  Anyway, as she told it she was driving to work early one morning from her home in Scottsville to her job in Franklin, Kentucky.  Her travel route takes her from the old White Plains road exit in Scottsville that leads directly into Franklin about twenty-four miles away.  She works in a medical facility there.  Shortly after she has crossed the Allen County line into Simpson County she said that she looked ahead of her through her automobile windshield and noticed something rather odd.  It seemed that something was sitting out in the middle of the road directly in front of her line of sight.  After slowing her automobile down she finally saw that the object was indeed a perfectly shaped disk, and it was hovering directly over the road ahead of her.  The disk was hovering low to the ground and was very silent-no noise at all.  Being alone, she did not want to stop and investigate, so she just kept driving slowly and passed directly underneath the disk.  The lady said that as she drove underneath the object she looked up at it and saw that is was definately a disk and somewhat large.  We did believe her story because I can tell you for a fact that she is a lady of honesty and integrity as was stated above.  There is absolutely no way that she would ever make up a story such as this.  She stated that! she had never seen anything like this disk shaped object before, and had no idea of what it was or where it came from.  I do wish my name to remain anonymous in this report.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

My co-worker and I were at the gas station early in the morning  on our way to work filling up and making small talk when suddenly he is startled grabs me and says holy crap look pointing above the Sierras due West was a huge fireball.  Just like in the movies. In scale it was about the same size as a dime at arm&#39;s length and we could actually see the flames. It was moving similar to the speed of a fast moving aircraft and we estimated it to be about 5 miles away.  It was coming down at about a 30 degree angle and it seemed strange not to hear a loud noise as it disappeared behind the mountains. We had expected an impact but there was nothing.  We both immediately called our wives and told them and had them check the TV news as we continued to work.  We turned on the local news radio in the car but found nothing. I even called the newspaper but they had no other reports and were not! very receptive.  It really seemed like it never happened but it did.  We think the fireball may be in Lake Tahoe or Marlette Lake which would explain the lack of impact but not the lack of reporting.  After a while of looking and listening we just let it go.  It has never been substantiated.  This is the grandest event I have ever witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Did you see it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know the exact date or year for this, I apologize, it has been about 10 or 11 years as of this posting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband went outside with the dog &amp; saw a craft in the near distance. There were several lights that shot out of it in a loop form &amp; then they were gone. He came inside to get me, by the time we got back out there it was VERY strange. This is around 3AM &amp; we saw the lights that shot out just as they returned &amp; seemed to go back in the ship. They moved VERY fast. The clouds slowly rolled back &amp; opened up as the large craft came closer passing over Casey&#39;s. The large craft had no lights at all, it was totally dark, like blacker than black. The sky was a deep red (like a sunset)but the clouds themselves were stilldark. The craft seemed to stop &amp; hover over the area on the other side of 58 from SkyVue (at that time it was all field there, now there is a duplex/4 plex housing). It came in so slow, you would have thought it was going to fall out of the sky. It did make a very slight sound while hovering, but I can&#39;t really describe it. It wasn&#39;t a hum. but it was very quiet &amp; ONLY made noise while it hovered. We just stood there watching, didn&#39;t really say anthing to each other, I think our brains didn&#39;t know what to think. But it sure wasn&#39;t the way we would have ever expected to react. It was almost like we were frozen in that moment of time. When the craft left, it moved as slowly as it did comming in, traveling E-NE. And the clouds seemed to roll back into place behind it returning to a normal 3AM night sky darkness. As it floated off (it went so slow it was like what I would expect out of a floating object, not a flying one) it went right over 58. But as soon as it was behind our house &amp; out of our view, we silently &amp; slowly walked back into the house, sat down &amp; basically just sat there saying nothing, as if we weren&#39;t supposed to talk about it or just didn&#39;t know what to say maybe. Which to this day is very strange for us, seeing a UFO is something we would have expected to talk about between ourselves for years, until this actual sighting occured. After this sighting, I spent a couple weeks being unable to sleep. I would fall asleep ok, but every night around the same time of the sighting, I would be woke up by a VERY bright white light through the bedroom window. And when I awoke, it was like I had been awake for hours &amp; had just sat up, vs. wakeing up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is retired military, we know what a stealth is &amp; this WASN&#39;T a stealth. Yes the military base was still open back then, but this WASN&#39;T from there &amp; they had no air traffic during this night. And the lights that came out of it &amp; went back in were a combo of changing colors. But we are sure they were ships too, because the moved with purpose. We never talked about it much, every time we started to we felt as if we were in a extreamly mellow state....sorry very hard to explain the feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many years later they came out with Independence Day with Will Smith. The way the clouds roll back in the movie is exactly what we saw...we instantly looked at each other in disbelief. But still said nothing, it&#39;s like some major secret to us but we don&#39;t know why. This is the first we have said of this night &amp; I still feel like I&#39;m saying something I shouldn&#39;t. But typing feels different than speaking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else has possibly seen this that night we would like to know...PLEASE post it we beg of you. The town just seemed so dead that night. No house lights on inside or out &amp; not one single car on the road. Granted Raymore is quiet at night, but the quietness &amp; darkness was very &#34;A&#34; typical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time, K<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We where in the tent and Greg had fallen asleep, I saw through the masquito netting what looked to be lighting. So I went out to put the tarp over the tent. When I got out of the tent I saw what looked to be a giant ball of lighting with lights coming out of it. I kicked ((name deleted)) to make him get up and told him to come see. When he got out I asked him what the hell is that? He said I don&#39;t know what to go check it out. So we got our flash lights and started walking across the Pasteur to see what it was. It was a good 300yards away. It did not move the whole time we walked toward it. It was off my parents land in a pine thicket and even when we got close to it, it still looked like a big ball of light and lighting. we had turned our flashlights off because it was lighting up the pasture and the trees. When we got to the gate to cross over in to the other Pasteur owned by ((name deleted)) and go to the pine thicket (maybe 20 yards away now) we turned our lights on to see to undo the wire. When we did it vanished like someone turned it out. That spooked us and we decided to go back to camp. We had walked maybe 200 feet when ((name deleted)) told me to stop and listen. I did and I could hear some rustling in the grass. We looked around with our flash lights for a few minutes and ((name deleted)) said look there. I turned and could see maybe 6 to 8 shadows moving in ((name deleted)) Pasteur coming toward the fence (The looked kinda like people to me) ((name deleted)) turned to me to say should we run but I was already on my way back to camp. I got back to camp a few seconds before ((name deleted)) and we got in the tent and zipped it up. We did not sleep well the rest of the night and we where awaken a few times by strange noises. When it got to be day light we broke camp and got the hell out of there. Neither one of us has ever seen anything like that before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was slightly moving back and forth...only slight, like a &#34;tremor&#34;.  I kept staring at it.  She finally asked what I was looking at and I said a hot pink light in the sky.  She looked out and was amazed too.  We both watched it until it left.  I can&#39;t remember HOW it left now... if it vanished or just shot off, but it was one of the two.  I brought up at work the next day (as a joke) that I saw a UFO the night before, and the doctors at the table took it very seriously and told me it was a common site over the city there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

If I hadn’t been looking for dim stars in the exact spot I was looking, I wouldn’t have noticed them. They appeared to be the same brightness, color, and distance of the stars. (I know stars are at all different distances from Earth, but this is the best way to describe their appearance.)  It was a clear night in early summer. There were many visible stars, no moon. Myself and my friend (about 20 years old), were watching the sky from a field in the countryside. I noticed the lights and was able to direct my friend to see them. We both watched them and discussed how they were moving. We agreed there were no aircrafts that could move like that. We saw them for at least 15 minutes, but it could have been longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not move in regular patterns. Each light would move independently. They were not traveling across the sky, they were staying in a proximate area, never moving very far from each other. This was easy to see because of the abundance of visible stars around and behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each light would move in a straight path, at a steady speed, and then change direction immediately. The light would not slow down or change speeds mid-flight. The direction-change was immediate. They did not curve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A light would sometimes become more faint and then brighter again. (I assumed this to be it moving further and closer from us.) Their speeds could vary at each direction change. (I assumed this to be a result of the angle they were moving relative to Earth). I don’t remember if they ever stood still. Their speed was not too fast to watch, (Not like a cat chasing a rapidly-moved laser pointer.) though I’m sure they were moving at high speeds. Our distance from them made them easy to track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights eventually became too faint to see, but not all at once. I assumed this to be a result of the group moving further away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We agreed that the movements were intentional (controlled by some intelligence - presumably the pilots of the crafts). But could this have been some naturally occurring phenomenon? If so, I’d assume someone would know about it, or it would be common knowledge. After all, there are astronomers who study space for a living.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said, I believe these moving lights were controlled by an intelligence. Not because they were doing anything logical, but just that they were deliberate and unmistakably calculated. If these were actually government crafts being tested or whatever, I don’t see what their tests could have been proving. Furthermore, why would they have 5 of them up there? If they were testing, wouldn’t they just have one craft? Or two? I don’t kow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If they were alien craft, I still don’t see how those ‘acrobatics’ could have had a useful purpose. Unless they were just joyriding in their crafts, like some of us do after a fresh snow. We saw this 8-12 years ago - don’t remember. Haven’t seen anything like it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
