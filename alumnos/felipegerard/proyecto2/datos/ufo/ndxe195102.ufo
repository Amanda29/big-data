While at my grandmother&#39;s house, my mother sent me to our car to get a sweater for her. It was in the trunk. While opening the lid, I got the feeling that I was being watched. I looked all around, but saw nothing alarming. I got the sweater then looked up for some reason, and I saw a round object at about 1500 feet (maybe a 100ft higher or lower). I watched it for about 2min...It just hovered there, right over my head, not moving. then it shot up at an extreemly high speed and in less than a second was almost out of sight. It was round-It had a cone like shaped bottom, with what looked like about six rings around the cone. I remember some movement at the outer edge of the air-frame. when I got back to my mother with the sweater, I told her what I had seen, aand i got spanked for taking an hour to get her sweater...I would have to bet my life I was only gone 5min....I have no recolection of those other 55min. My friend at that time was the other witness to the event, and he had no time loss at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

Time was about 10 PM. My buddy, Bill and I, and our dates, Just drove in to the parking lot behind the Friendly Ice Cream in Thompsonville,CT, when my date spotted a small golden-orange glowing ball in the distant southern sky toward Hartford. In a few seconds, the object was overhead and the shape was that of a bowl, flat on top. It looked about 2 feet in diameter, but made no sound. It hovered motionless for about 30 seconds, then in a streak lasting about 3-4 seconds, was gone in the direction from which it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove the car to the parking lot in front of Friendly&#39;s and got out and ran into  Friendly&#39;s telling all what we saw, and everybody inside looked at us as if we were dilusional. Needless to say, we were embarrassed. The next day in school, several classmates from other parts of town confirmed what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers were 2 basketball players and our cheerleader dates, ages about 17.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I served in the USMC from Jan 53 to Jan 56 as a radar operator.It was sometime in 1954 or 55 in K-3 Korea, Po Hang Dong,while on radar watch, I observed 3 blips on my radar scope which crossed Korea from east to west in about 20 seconds. The object was not identified. I hold a BSME from the University of Hartford, class of 1961. I am the inventor of a lightweight golf club carrier, U.S. Patent #6,471,055, which can be viewed on www.litegolf.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
