All the stories tallied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Captain Wood, 42, said he and the Tri-star crew made sighting reports when they arrived at London’s Heathrow airport but kept it all a secret for fear of being ridiculed.  Captain Wood has come forward in the hope that Britain’s ufo experts will turn a serious eye to this particular sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Suggestions that the three objects were balloons, stars or satellites, strange clouds or reflections are quite unacceptable to us,&#34; he said.  &#34;As I looked to the west we saw this very bright headlamp in the sky.  All the cabin staff saw it too and I told the passengers.  Then it was joined by two cigar-shaped objects as big and solid as battleships.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the return trip, captain Wood tilted his radar scanner.  &#34;There, in exactly the same spot, were these two cigar-shaped things.  We got to within seven miles of them when they disappeared from our screen.&#34;<n>

I was riding my bicycle up and down the street in our apartment complex, which was approx. 1/3 of a mile long.  From the North end of the street a &#34;classic flying saucer&#34; came hovering over the tree line about 40 to 60 feet high. It was like right out of the movies, a metallic disc with colored lights rotating around it (I&#39;m colorblind so sorry I can&#39;t tell you the colors).  Diameter was about 30 to 40 feet, 10 to 15 feet in height symetrical top and bottom.  It made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was not scared, but only interested and I followed it from one end of the street to the other.  I literally road my bicycle under it the entire length of the street (1/3 mile) which it strangely hovered directly over seeming to follow the road.  I was easily able to keep pace with it so I estimate its speed at no more than 15 MPH.  At the end of our street I stopped and watched it continue on at the same pace.  Because of its low altitude it disappeared from view before to long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time the Goodyear blimp was a regular sight in Lauderdale and TV/movies portrayed UFO exactly like this one; so even at that young age I was skeptical, thinking that this was to good to be true.  I figured I would hear of a hoax or some explanation.  That never happened.  Now as I&#39;ve grown older I realize the importance and significance of such a &#34;clear and close&#34; sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will try to send(email) more info(map and illustration), Thanx<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

7/28/76 03:30|Fort Lauderdale|FL|Disk|15 minutes|Classic "flying saucer" moving low and slow through condos in gated Ft. Lauderdale prestige golf community.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48510.html|3|ndxe197607| Classic &#34;flying saucer&#34; moving low and slow through condos in gated Ft. Lauderdale prestige golf community.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived on the 6th floor of a condominium in a gated, private golf community.  It had a balcony that faced (what I remember may be) Commercial Blvd. in Ft. Lauderdale.  I had gone out on the balconey (as was my habit) to watch a boyfriend drive out of the complex on his way home in the early morning hours.  It was a beautiful and clear night.  As I hung over the balconey watching for the boyfriend&#39;s tail-lights (which he&#39;d tap to say goodbye), I heard a very low, throbbing sound to the back and right side of the building.  I had a good view of the space between the condos nearest me and I peered around the corner.  I saw a &#34;craft&#34;, which I at first thought was some kind of advertising thing-- because lights were revolving around the mid-section slowly, like a marquee of some kind.  It also was bathed from the top and bottom by soft red and green light-- I cannot remember at this time which color was at the top or at the bottom, red or green. But those were the two colors.  As it moved between the buildings, very, very, slowly, I saw it was, well, a saucer.  An honest-to-God &#34;flying saucer&#34;.  It was no more than 75 feet from me on the balcony. It was so close that I could see the &#34;windows&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dull, gray metallic looking and seamless.  It had a dome-shape on both top and underside.  It was well-proportioned. It had &#34;windows&#34; or &#34;ports&#34; encircling the middle circumference that revolved slowly.  I could not see into these &#34;windows&#34; as the light seemed to be opaque.  The &#34;windows&#34; were similar to, I guess, airliner windows; rounded at the corners, appearing to be slightly recessed.  The light was not bright, but not glowing, either, possibly a little bit &#34;fuzzy&#34;.  They revolved slowly and clockwise.  The red and green glow(s) at the top and the undersurface pulsed, but only slightly.  The sound it made I have best described as a low &#34;warbling&#34; of two tones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off it, of course.  I was trying to believe what I was seeing.  It continued over the grounds moving south, and the thing that freaks me out to this day is that it started to follow the exact same road my boyfriend was traveling on out of the complex.  It was pretty much right behind him.  I thought, &#34;He MUST be able to see this thing, it&#39;s right on his tail.&#34; This was BEFORE cell phones...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the road out after a few minutes and couldn&#39;t figure out if the craft had left the area over the road, but I think it did as it got closer to what I THINK was Commercial Blvd.  At that point it quickly gained altitude, like pretty much straight up into the air.  It didn&#39;t go up slowly, but just popped up like a balloon on a string you let go of, and then took off quickly southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Ft. Lauderdale police immediately and asked if anyone had reported a UFO in the area around Environ.  They simply said, &#34;no&#34;.  I didn&#39;t make a report, I just said thanks and figured I&#39;d read something in the paper the next day.  I didn&#39;t see anything reported, however.  I told my boyfriend the next day and he said he wasn&#39;t looking up and behind him, and didn&#39;t notice any lights other than his on the road.  But, the craft didn&#39;t have &#34;beams&#34; shining down on anything, anyway.  The road was fairly well-lit with those orang-y lights.  He believed me.  I&#39;m a sober, logical, well-educated and intelligent person, not very excitable, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took the experience in stride.  I know I saw what looked like the classic &#34;flying saucer&#34;, and that&#39;s as simple as it is.  I don&#39;t know if anyone else saw the same one I saw, but I can&#39;t believe I was the only person awake in a great big complex such as the one I lived in at the time.  This sighting was smack dab in the middle of an extremely well-populated and popular area.  It still makes me wonder why, if this was an extra-terrestrial craft, why it would chose to show itself so low to the ground and in a place where it could expect to be seen clearly if anyone looked out a window or was walking a dog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve told other people in a matter-of-fact way exactly what I saw.  I never thought to find a website like this to report to until I finally got mad at the zillionith TV program about UFOs STILL with no explanation about similar sightings and went out to find a place to report my experience to add to all the others.  I&#39;d like an explanation for what I saw, please.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/27/76 01:00|Cowley|WY|Cylinder|10 min. ??|Witnessed a cylinder shape object, very close, moving slowly, deep humming sound,  illuminated portals showing mechanical rooms.|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74329.html|4|ndxe197607| Witnessed a cylinder shape object, very close, moving slowly, deep humming sound,  illuminated portals showing mechanical rooms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event Location: On Farm about 1 mile North of Cowley, Wyoming  I was 27 years old, mother of  three small children.  I was sleeping and began dreaming of an airplane, it was flying closer as the sound grew louder until it flew through the window.  The dream was so real, it startled me fully awake, then slowly coming to the realization the sound was still there.  From our farm looking west, B-52 bombers could frequently be seen flying quite low in a north-south direction.  What I was hearing was consistent with a large group of low flying heavy bombers directly over our house going East to West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside and stood on the steps looking up and to the west.  It was a moonless night and the only lights were the millions of stars seen in the clear Wyoming skies.  I could detect a smooth flying motion overhead moving west, and the sound remained a constant deep droning/humming sound.  I continued to watch still thinking it was a large number of large airplanes, but I was curious why they would be flying in such close formation so late at night and in the middle of nowhere. It was unusual, but thought they must be moving a fleet to the West Coast following the end of the Vietnam War.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered how many there were as I could not distinguish individual shapes, so I began looking intently for indications of wings and lights that should be at least on the tips.  I could detect no wings, no lights, no silhouette of a wing shape.  All the while the massive  object continued slowly on its westerly trajectory.  There were no lights either on the craft or in our yard to help illuminate to assist in giving a better indication of size, color, material, shape, and distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch, a portal came into view.  It was in the underside of the craft and illuminated with a soft florescent light.  Over the years, my memory has become a little fuzzy on whether the color was green or blue, but it was a very pleasing color to the eye, not harsh and I lean to it being a pretty blue florescent.  The light made it easy for me to clearly see inside the portal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was an immaculate mechanical room.  There was what looked like a large boiler with pipes connected to it.  Everything was the same color, but the shapes were very distinct and familiar.  Very Earthly.  I continued to watch as the portal slowly moved out of sight.  It was interesting that the light was obviously very bright and illuminated a large room, but did not extend outside the craft.  After the portal passed from view, I could no longer detect where the portal was.  There was no glow of light emanating from beneath the craft.  I continued to watch, and after a few moments another portal came into view.  The light was the same and the room’s contents appeared to be identical to the first room seen.  Another mechanical room, with an identical “boiler” and connecting pipes.  Everything I could see appeared identical to the first portal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch trying to see any details that might be visible, but it was so dark the shape was determined more by the absence of the stars.  It was long and cylindrical, there were no sharp edges.  I had a clear view to the West for about 15 to 20 miles.  The craft was so close it shut out all of the night sky as I looked north and most of the night sky as I looked west.  It was very low, but not able to determine exactly how low, and traveling very slow, but not able to indicate how slow except that I was able to get a very good look inside the portals.  So, maybe between 5 to 15 MPH.  Again, there was never a change in the sound, it was a continuous deep, humming or droning sound.  I never changed my opinion about it being consistent with large airplanes flying over head.  It was flying level in a true East to West direction.  I never saw the beginning or end of the craft.  What I did see was larger than a football field, but did not see the craft in its entirety. ! There were no unusual odors, no unusual wind movement, and there was no disturbance of animals (cattle, dogs, etc.) that I was aware of.  Everything was silent except the sound indicated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to become uneasy, even a little frightened and decided to go back inside.  My children were sleeping and I was just beginning to understand that what I had been watching was very extraordinary and there was nothing in my reference that explained it.  I sat quietly in the living room, did not turn on any lights to look at a clock, and just waited for it to pass. I did not look out the window, I did not want to do anything to bring attention to myself, our home, my family.  I continued to hear the sound for sometime after I went back inside and was relieved when the sound finally ceased.   I do not remember that the sound faded away as planes would as they went into the distance, rather it just stopped and became quiet.  I do not know the total duration, but it was several minutes from the time I first became aware of the sound in a fully conscious state to when it finally ceased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not tell anyone about this experience until some years later.   I looked for something that would explain what I had seen in logical terms.  I married a retired Air Force Pilot with thousands of hours flying time and over 4 millions air miles.  We attended many military air shows together, and I would look for anything that resembled what I had seen.    Over the years I never saw anything remotely like what I had seen years earlier.  My husband Bill was the first person related my experience to, followed by my children after they were grown.  I have also since told a couple of my siblings.  I told my brother after he related an experience he and my mother had with light orbs following them on a deserted highway traveling late one night in Wyoming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the experience I had as I remember it and choosing to report it officially while the details are clear.  It occurred on a moonless summer night, approximately 27 July 1976, probably after midnight.   I am positive of the year, the month was most likely July, but may have also been June.  My young brother was in the hospital in Billings Montana when this occurred.  The window of possibility is indicated below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> New Moon in May 1976 - 29th  - 1st Quarter June 5th New Moon in June 1976 - 27th  - 1st Quarter July 4th New Moon in July 1976  - 29th  - 1st Quarter Aug 2nd   Credibility Factor:  I was 27 years old at the time of the occurrence with 3 small children.  I remarried a Air Force officer and pilot with a distinguished career.  I am a college graduate with High Honors.  My career was in finance, accounting and government finance. My work titles were Assistant Treasurer for a local large municipality and Executive Director of a Consortium of Cities and Counties where I managed Millions of $$ in Federal Funds, and Management Analyst.  I have been a long time contributing member of my community and believe, well respected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It continued to do this for about 2 minutes and then moved in a diagonal trajectory, continuing to pulse in a out of visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still daylight. I asked my boyfriend if he could see it and he said he did. I asked if he knew what it was and he said he did not.

It was during the summer because the sun was just setting and my parents myself and my grandfather were standing out by his pick-up. My mother looked down our street and at the top of a hill she pointed out a white ball shaped object just hanging in mid air not moving. We all stood and watched it for several minutes with the object not moving at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went with my grandfather to his house and as we started driving the ball started moving with us. We got to my grandfathers house and stood in the front yard and watched it change colors. It went from white to yellow to a light green and then back to white again. It then started moving off getting higher and higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother called us an hour later and told us that after we had left she had gotten into her car with my dad&#39;s very powerful banoculars. She went up on a hill that over looks Casper and could see the object very well. Behind it she could make out the contrails of 2 military jets closing with it. She said that they got to with in a certain distance of the object before it accelerated up and out of sight so fast that it left the 2 jets far behind in a matter of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day it was reported as a &#34;weather balloon&#34; in the newspaper. That is the fastest balloon I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a cloudless night with no moon at the time.  We arrived at the top of the mountain about 9:45pm.  We had an unobstructed 360 degree view of the horizon.  We ate sandwiches as a late dinner, and gazed at the stars, locating several constellations, the Milky Way, etc. in the clear mountain air. After eating, we lay on our backs and looked at the sky with our 8x35 binoculars.  Almost directly overhead, near the constellation Cygnus, we saw two objects that we were uncertain about.  Both were slightly larger than stars, one bluish and one orange-tinted.  Neither were familiar to us, though we had been amateur astronomers throughout our youth.  They were no brighter than Vega, an Magnitude Order 1star.  We commented to one another about these two objects of which we were unfamiliar. I looked at the orange-tinted one through the binoculars to see if it might be a planet, but could not identify it as such.  As I was watching it, the binoculars stable against my eye sockets and my head resting directly on a rock, I observed the object begin to move in a zig-zag pattern toward the southeast, with abrupt near-ninety-degree turns at each zig or zag.  The zig-zags were not large, but were about the distance of the width of my index finger held at arm&#39;s length, relative to the stars.  After zig-zagging about the distance of the width of my hand held at arm&#39;s length, the object accelerated in a straight line for another realtive two inches, then faded from view.  The object did not change in intensity of brightness or color during its movement. The duration of movement was about four seconds. This amazed me, and I exclaimed how cool it was and asked my sister if she saw it.  She answered with an anxious yes.  We discussed what it might have been, and she asked for the binoculars.  I gave them to her, and we commented on the strange bluish object.  As she was watching the bluish object with the binoculars, and I with my naked eye, it proceeeded to move in the same manner as the orange-tinted object, and faded from view. There were no sounds emanating from either object.  We ruled out helicopters due to the no-sound factor, and that we were already at almost 6000 feet.  We ruled out airplanes, due to the impossibility of performing the stationary moevement, then the zig-zag.  Same for balloons.  While they might have been satelites, this does not explain the erratic and substantial zig-zag movement, nor the change from being a stationary object to being a moving one.  They were not comets, as these obviously do not have an apparent movement over that small a time-interval.  They did not behave like meteors, in that they were clearly visible in a stationary fashion for at least five minutes before they moved.  We were left with no aceptable explanation in identifying these. My sister was a rising junior at a state university, and I was a rising freshman at UNC.  Neither of us took drugs or alcohol.<n>

On one of the recent shows they had a guest and were talking about unidentified flying craft using stealth or camouflaging technology to imitate star patterns and such. I think what I witnessed may be similar to this. I wish I could be more specific in the date but it was some time ago and only hearing the show caused this recollection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was during the summer months in central Connecticut between 1975 and 1978 as best as I can remember between 10:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. I was with a bunch of friends at local gathering place, away from city lights out in the country. We were just hanging out as we did on many summer nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason I looked up at the night sky at the stars, which were exceptionally bright, as there was no moon and no clouds. I was just gazing at the different constellations when I noticed something out of the ordinary. A sizeable section of the sky was blacked out. Then I realized this section of black out was moving if I remember right in an east to west direction. I don’t recall if there was a noticeable shape to it, but you could see the stars disappearing behind it the reappearing as it passed. This did not have a false star pattern as some that were mentioned on the show just darkness. The only reason I saw it was due to the motion. If it were sitting still you would not have seen anything. I’m not sure of the altitude with nothing to reference it to, but my gut feeling is that it was quite high not quite Airliner high but much higher than small Airplanes fly. It did not do any sudden or erratic moves just cruised across the sky. With out being sure of the altitude it would be hard to say how fast. Again my gut feeling was that this thing was big  if it was as high as an Airliner it was really big and moving faster than an Airliner. And I did not hear any noise no jet sounds, no helicopter sounds, or visible contrail. I am very familiar with what Airplanes, Helicopters and Blimps look like and sound like this was not any of those things. I do not know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if this information is helpful or not, maybe it will correlate with something else that happened during that time. All I know is what I saw or didn’t see in this case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((initials of witness deleted))  now in Florida<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I let them off their leashes and let them run.  I stood under a group of eucalyptus trees and looked northeasy admiring the sky.  In the distance there are mountains (not high).  Between the mountains came what looked like the lights of an airplane in the distance.  I was just idly watching waiting for the dogs to be finished so I could go back to the house, as there are normally many planes on this part of the sky.  However, the plane lights seemed to be heading right where I was standing and considerably lower than normal.  I was hypnotized by the brightness and then realized that it might be going to crash.  I called the dogs to me and they came running and I felt I would not be able to escape the crash.  The dogs were frightened.  Suddenly, a large cloud, swirling and brilliant appeared.  The sky had been clear as a bell.  I awaited by seconds the crash and the plane to come through the cloud.  In another second it was again clear as a bell and no plane , no lights nothing.  It was very dark and soundless.  I gathered the very excited, scared dogs and went back to my house and told my husband and l3 year old daughter what had happened.  He just went to bed but my daughter came out and we crossed the road again and looked to see if we could see anything but it was too dark. Next day I again went over there and found nothing different.  I was very amazed and intrigued by this experience once I realized that the plane was not going to crash.  Afterwards both my daughter and I saw many unexplained things in the sky and in the mountains nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I walked down a dirt track towards the cemetary, there was a large alfalfa field to my left forming a gradual downward slope. It was still dark, just a hint of light on the horizon. I sensed, or heard something, like a strong breeze moving the trees in the woodline to my left, as I turned to the left, looking downhill, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Feeling spooked, I turned to keep walking. A dark moving shape came from my left side, rising quickly, traveling to the right. I saw it best when it was about at my ten o&#39;clock high position. It looked like a Huey helicopter, with a similar style windscreen, towards the front, the rest of the craft reminded me most of a Star Trek shuttle craft, but it was very dark in color, and I only caught a glimpse. It hung in the air with a nose down attitude, like a helicopter taking off, then, was gone. I saw it only for in instant, it made absolutely no sound. I didn&#39;t really see it fly in any direction. It was just there for an instant, then gone.It just seemed to &#34;flash&#34; away, although it emitted no light. My heart was racing, though I did not feel afraid, just excited. After I walked the 2 miles to work, where at the time I was a clean up boy at a bakery, I remember telling a co-worker, I saw something really strange this morning...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

While walking on a dirt road on the way back to the farm ,(Kelona, Iowa)we noticed a strange pattern in the stars in the north west sky. As we walked we watched these stars and began to notice that they were infact changing formation, as planes might do. As we walked and entered the yard the objects got closer. Enough interest was genarated amoung the group that upon reaching the house we summoned the adults. What I saw outside of the back of the house made me a believer. At about 100 ft I saw a cigar shaped craft, about 100 ft in lenght.A strobing band of lights ran lateral across its underside. No sound,just light patterns. The next sound we heard was a USAF jet that swooped past the barn at low level.30 minutes or so later, observing the southern sky, we saw nine (9) stars moving away ,again changing formation as they went. The local pap! er reported a sighting and confirmed a chase by the USAF.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the time above, to reflect an evening sighting.  PD))<n>

I had to be paralyzed in mid stride. I distincly flash back to see the looks on the faces of the aliens. Especially the elder, raised eybrow they seemed intrigued...they had to show me what they were doing as i remained in this state....examining each of us. They showed me a very large screen where children were taken to a remote desert planet and led to beleive they were actually on a carnival ride similar to ours.....circular rotation with rise and fall with an increase and decrease in speed, and minor g force fluctuation. they thought they were on a carnival ride, yet they were actually being studied for their space/time/gravitational awareness!! ingenious....Why?? because as we evolve we will be able to focus more on our sense of gravity and spatial awareness. Our sense of sound touch smell and thought will be finely tuned to be able to alter the physical, as they do.....that is why they communicate with telepathy..it is easy for them, and there are a lot of humans as well. they have told me they have evolved much differntly....a more light oriented and denser atmosphere where there ocean is more jelly like and plasmic, so as to create a bipedal amoebic....hence they have an exoskeleton..their evolution was much more rapid in this plasmic state....and yes it does consist of some silicon...but not sure of it all...They like to communicate with those they have visited previously through intergalactic talepathy, as in viewing remotely....the one that coms with me most even told me that our theory of everything as in &#34;string theory&#34; is not extrapolated enuff, that in the multi dimensional we must be able to have the physics/chemistry/gemetry/stats/ all interconnected, and that our understanding of the &#34;depth&#34; of all consumates the interconnection of all theorem. Thus, E=Mc squared is missing volume and geometry and also a chemical and statistacal probability of the Mass as the entity relates to the energy and constant. Also that kinetic energy involves a molecular exchange of particles between two objects whether static or not. IE a human hand may walk by a radio and its signal interupts via the exchange of human boundary (kinetic) and radio /soundwave (kinetic) that the understanding of the Mass/size/Molecules of this energy and its fields surrounds EVERYTHING!. And that our Superconductors are way way to big!<n>

At the time, I was almost nine months pregnant with our first child.  As I went to the back poarch (we live in a very rural area), I caught a glimps of a bright, luminous cicular object moving across the horizon in front of me.  The object seemed to have a pulsating action to it like a heart, and the entire object would dim the brighten back up.  There was darker areas in it, but it too was not so dark that it did not look luminous or pulsate. I began screaming for my husband to come to me, but before he could get our of the shower and get there the thing just took off across the horizon and disappeared - vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I began explaining to my husband what I had seen, his comment was, &#34;Grandmother saw the same thing several years ago.  She described the same identical thing to me.&#34;  Grandmother had lived in this house for years before she had to be put in her oldest daughter&#39;s home due to poor health - just one half mile to the west of this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a long time, we did not share what I saw with anyone; it is still to this day very disturbing to me.  But - while watching SciFi&#39;s UFO documentaries, I have seen the same object as other witnesses.

I only visited a UFO web site once, and that was just yesterday! I will say however, of all the reports I&#39;ve ever heard about on TV, I have never heard of a incident similar to the one I am about to describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE SETTING: LOCATION &amp; TIME: Leominster, MA; Mid-July, 1976; Late evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WEATHER: Clear, warm, calm winds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WITNESSES: Myself and wife and one neighbor (two days later).<n> <n><n> <n><n> LIGHTING CONDITIONS: 	a. OUTSIDE: Dark (no Moon to my recollection) and one Street lamp a hundred yards+ to the NE (across &amp; up the street) . Also, this lamp was blocked by neighbor house, not directly visible. A street lamp directly across the street was not working at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> b. INSIDE (house): Table lamp (2), 40W bulb each, no active TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE INCIDENT: It was a Saturday evening and wife &amp; I had just come home from visiting family across town. I had gone to bedroom on SE corner of house to get ready for bed. My wife had just come out of bathroom and gone into living room to turn the TV on for evening news &amp; weather, when she called me to come and look outside with her. This was at the opposite end of the house or towards the west or NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She directed me to the raised (open) window facing west, where our large garden was located. There was a bright beam of white light shining onto the garden from above. The light was extremely bright, in a straight column, not &#39;angled&#39; at all and I would estimate the width to be 15-20 feet. My first thought was &#34;Why would a Helicopter be shining a spot light on our garden?&#34; I then realized there was absolutely no noise or &#39;wind&#39; associated with this beam of light. Both of us tried to look UP to see what was causing this, but the light was so bright nothing but the light could be seen. As the light slowly moved west-to-east, basically along the north side of our house, it was apparent the beam had defined edges. By that I mean, where the beam ended it was normal dark (outside) and the light didn&#39;t &#39;splash&#39; over or fade away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, while the light was slowly proceeding east, we noticed a faint sound associated with the light that went: TICK, TICK, TICK, BOOM. Where each &#39;TICK&#39; was like gently tapping two pieces of metal together, and the &#39;BOOM&#39; was like hearing a base drum from far away.  All were very faint, but auditable and in sequence. The sound stayed with the light throughout the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We followed the light and the &#34;TICK, TICK, TICK, BOOM&#34; as it crossed the street, went over some woods and then out of sight. The sound slowly faded and was gone after the light was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire incident lasted approximately 5-7 minutes. The light was visible as it passed across the street, over the woods and then out of sight. Even then, nothing could be seen at the &#34;top&#34; of the beam or from where it was emitting. It was simply a beam of light that seemed to have no source, and it was accompanied by that sound: TICK, TICK, TICK, BOOM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

One cra|4/26/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/006/S06077.html|22|ndxe197607| stargazers looking at a beautiful sky full of stars on a perfectly clear night, wittness several craft buzzing over Cross lake. One craft approached and observed the group shined lights on us, windows appeared and we were able to see two creatures gazing at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A group of five people were star gazing on a beautiful clear Minnisota night, after 15-20 minutes of sky watching, we noticed a cloud cover converging over the lake from the left and the right (simultaniously) we thought this strange since clouds seem to usually come from one direction We were sitting lake level at a friends farm (away from it all,out of town on dirt roads the farm house itself was about 50 yards away), we were at the boat landing area and talking and visiting. Earlier we had commented on the sounds of the night, crickits, frogs, dogs night birds etc. As the clouds closed up the entire view of the sky, we noticed a dim light which appeared to be about 20 yards out on the lake. The only thing I could think of that this might be was someone night fishing with a lantern or some kind of light source in a rowboat with that source being below the rim of the boat, thus giving of a weird glow.We could make no lines out so we had no idea of shape or distance, out in the country on a lake it gets very very dark. It was myself and 4 lady friends there that night,heres where it gets strange. From the lenght of the light and the size of a row boat I figured it must be about 20 yards out, I called out,..hey are you catching anything? No response ..I repeated myself again.. no response. While listening for a response I noticed that all of the night sounds had vanisher and there was no sounds at all, except.... the sound of a finely tuned engine ,barely detectable, but every thing else seemed oddly still. Since there was no response and knowing a person would usually respond to a call out, I picked up my flashlight a shinned it toward the light...it illuminated nothing, thats strange, I decided to walk up the hill towards the farm and get an elevated view. Walking up the incline with the 4 girls close behind.(inches) I got a veiw of a good portion of this good sized lake, to my surprise ai saw 4 other light buzzing around the lake also at a foot or two above the water it seemed. I turned to the girls and asked them if they saw what I saw and they said what do you see? Anyway we all saw these lights moving around on the lake. By this time the hair on the back of my neck was standing on end.We ruled out all possibilities except UFO&#39;S. As we stood there with our jaws dropped the light that we had first thought to be a fishing boat, began to levitate to our eye level,about 30 feet above water level. Now I always said if I had an encounter, I would make friends, forget it, as the light followed us up the hill to the stairs of the farmhouse I along with the girls were fearful of the light. My friends family was sleeping in the house(father and grandmother)we noticed that the trusty dog that lives on the front steps that was there earlier was gone, we were there to camp by the lake and were set up there. I didn&#39;t want to go into the farmhouse out of respect, and I still was in a state of disbelief over all this trying to convince myself it wasn&#39;t happining. So I told the girls , lets just sit on the steps for a moment and see what happens. The length of yard was about 35 feet before a small 20 foot incline down to the shore, we sat down, the light now out over the water directly in front of us glowing like a light with a dimmer on it at a very low level. We sat in disbelief as the light at once became brighter, we could now make out some kind of shape, it was like a coffee saucer was upside down, wider at the bottom than top,there appeared to be a pattern within that light(window)and that was like those iron grates you see on sidewalk accesses for sewer systems, kind of honey combed. Behind the grate and in front of the light source were two silhouett figures. I was unable to make out any features since it seemed the light source was behind them. They had triangular type bodies with the shoulders being the wide point, same with their heads shaped like drawings of Greys. These two seemed to be observing us, moving side to side, we were mesmerized. After a few minutes the light once again dimmed, this scared us enough to get inside the house. I decided it was time to wake up  my friends father, I went into his bedroom and woke him saying that there were flying saucers outside, he&#39;d been drinking and mumbled we must be on drugs and drifted back to sleep, I then tried Grandma ..same thing. I grabbed a shotgun out of the closet and went back to the kitchen with the girls who immediatley convinced me to put the gun away, that it would only make things worse if they felt provoked...I listened.   We then not knowing what else we could do and driven be fear as well as curiosity we went back to the steps sat down and watched the low glowing light in front of us. We werent sure how big this thing was because as I stated it was dark out there and it was just a light and we couldn&#39;t see the whole thing,anyway after a minute the light got a bit brighter and from underneath three laser type lights popped on and started scanning very quickly the house the trees,us etc. The lights were straight beams about 6inchis acroos that were very strong and as I said in a laser type beam, it scanned everything in a very deliberate fasion this went on for mayby 15 seconds then the lights went out and the saucer lights also got very weak and we heard about 6 very loud splashes in the lake, I imagined that beings were jumping into the water(like frog men)and would be comming up over the hill any second, we all got very scared at the thought of this and ran back in the house to the upstaires, where the family had some extra beds for company. The upstairs was unfinnished, the farmhouse was over 100 years old and didn&#39;y have a ceiling just the roof then a few wooden cross beams or rafters. this was a summer getaway and was not insulated upstairs. On the center beam going accross the ceiling there was an old ceramic light fixture with a bulb and a string to turn it on and off, there was an open window with a screen on it on one wall. We were all very frightened so told every one to pair up and take one of the three beds. This put  us two to a bed all staring at the window. I said mayby it will just go away, we sat there for maybe 2 minutes which seemed like forever, then suddenly it got very bright above the house it seemed as if the sun were shinning we could see dust particles and light comming through cracks and nailholes and it was like daytime outside the window, then suddenly two little balls of light the size of say handballs came through the screen without making a hole! These things were circling around each other at a very fast rate, they zoomed around us and the room and went to the hanging light bulb fixture on the ceiling beam they seemed drawn to it for 5 seconds or so then thew swooshed back out the screen as fast as they had come. Two seconds later it was dark again. We all sat there virtually paralized! Soon I guess our senses came back and we could hear in the distance the sound of a car comming down the dirt road, the sound got closer and closer we heard the car pull into the long driveway and a car door slam ( we realized it was my friend whos farm we were at that we had split up from earlier in the evening finally returning home ) I ran to the window and saw it was our friend, I then shouted to him to stay there!! We all ran outside to save him! As we ran up the driveway to warn him we must have seemed histerical, trying to explain we looked around, the sky was clear , the night sounds back, the old trusty dog was back and it seemed like every thing was back to normal. The local town paper reported several people seeing funny lights and passed them off as meteors. NO WAY The next thing is I looked at my watch and noticed it was about 12:15 am, this started around 10:pm it didn&#39;t seem possible that 2 hours could have passed...maybe 21-30 minutes.<n>

It was a very dark night, few clouds in the sky.  He saw the lights first and so saw them a bit before pointing them out to me.  I recall the lights being higher up than a jet would fly but moving very quickly across the sky.  I remember thinking that there was no way that an object that high up could be moving that fast - at least a man made object.  The lights were perhaps as bright as one of the planets (Mars or Jupitor). I recall - all these years later the three objects (lights) moving as a triad together across the heavens.  After a few minutes (maybe three) they stopped at the zenith of the sky and stayed there just a moment.  Then one zoomed off at a very high rate of speed (no way it could have been a man made craft)in one direction; seconds later a second one went off in a different direction; and then seconds later the third went off in another direction.  I remember looking us looking at each other and saying - did we really just see that?  Since then, I&#39;ve been an avowed UFO believer.  We had not been drinking or using drugs.  The following is what my friend remembers - it is not prompted except to ask him what he recalled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best I can remember, I think it was during the summer of 1976.  I have pictures of you visiting in my photo album, in storage, of that trip.   I could dig them out and see at least what month and year it may have taken place.  I believe that was the summer my grandparents were adding on the new kitchen to the old green house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were riding bikes up and down Ranch Road 1120 between Leakey and Rio Frio.   It was about 9:30 at night.  We had stopped briefly to rest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked up at the stars.  A few minutes later, I saw a bright light come from the west, another from the east and another from the north.  They were probably (wild ass guess) 15,000 miles up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caught my attention was that they were coming at a high rate of speed from the three directions. They all came to a point and then came to a complete stop together (from our perspective).  After about 60 seconds, they suddenly shot off into different directions at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

One friend went down two doors to his home and returned with a 12 volt sealed beam lantern. We were looking for the part for several minutes and then found it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got up and walked out on the sidewalk in front of the house, I looked to the east and noticed this bright light hanging in the sky just behind the very top of a tree. I said nothing and went back to my mechanic duties when my friend noticed it a few seconds later. She asked if that was the police helicopter that had frequented our neighborhood on regular patrol during the summers. (We would run out in the street and wave at the pilots and they would blink the carbon-arc spot at us to say hello. Those were the days...). Curiously I looked again to see if that was the same light I had noticed a few seconds earlier and it was. I said that if that were the helicopter, we would here it as close as it was like we always did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My other friend, with sealed beam flashlight still in hand, turned it on and shined it on the &#34;object&#34; through the tree top. I told him I didn&#39;t think that was a good idea, but he being a year older (15), over rode that idea and did it anyway.  At this point the &#34;object&#34; slowly moved out from behind the tree top as if to get a better look at us or our light source and just hung there quietly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He turned off his light, and about 2 seconds later the &#34;object&#34; began to move and he shined his light on it again and it stopped. I excitedly told my other friend to get our parents and she ran in and only returned with her mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She saw the &#34;object&#34; and assured us it was an airplane or our helicopter friends until we questioned her as to where the moving BEAM of blue-white light was and pointed out that the white light was WAY too bright for normal running lights on an airplane, it was WAY too low to be an aircraft of any kind without making noise or kicking up dust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not until my older friend  said, &#34;...and watch this.&#34; as he shined his light on it again and it began to slowly move (east) our way that she was convinced and noticeably shaken when he turned off the light and the &#34;object&#34; stopped! Here she nervously ordered us all in the house (mine being the closest)and to my parents surprise who thought were playing jokes. She also told them something strange was low in the sky and relatively close but they, still showing no interest chose not to investigate. We all four returned to the porch expecting it to be gone saw it still quietly hanging in the sky right where we left it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We studied it for about 30 seconds when it began to move north. My older friend again shined his bright flashlight toward the &#34;object&#34; and it stopped once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all beginning to become concerned at this time when it began to resume it&#39;s northward course along a north-south street but slowly gaining altitude until it got to which is now by my estimation, 50-60 feet above the rooftops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My older friend tried to chase it on his bicycle for a closer look and my other friend and I scaled a brick swimming pool fence and stood atop it to get a better look as it flew off over the neighborhood and sped out of sight within 1 or 2 seconds and disappearing after making an extremely sharp turn to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend&#39;s mother then used our phone to call Memphis International tower to see if anything was flying around our area. After what seemed to me to be about 15 minutes on the phone with them they said they could find nothing unusual. She retold these events to my parents as we kids returned to the front porch hoping it would come back but as far as I know, none of us ever spoke of this event again among ourselves or to anyone else. I&#39;m just wondering if I am the only one that remembers this now....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We had climbed up on the roof using a large tree at the rear of the garage. We were sitting side by side at the edge of the roof facing south when we both saw a circular glowing Orb move in a perfect straight line roughly from the preachers home to the back of the garage where the tree was located and we heard leaves rustling. My friend and I were in disbelief of what we had seen as we turned and looked at each other. My friend who was a few years older than me got up and ran franticly to the moveable basketball hoop located at the front of the garage and climbed down. I then got up and did the same thing. We were both very scared as we thought it was going to come up the tree. After a few minutes when we calmed down we went to the back of the garage where the tree was located and looked for it and found nothing. At the time I was about 8-9 years old and! the year was about 1976-1977 and now at the age of 43 I decided to document the event as I still to this day wonder what it was. Some years after the sighting I considered that it could be ball lightning but there were no thunderstorms in the area. All I can say about it was it moved in a perfect straight line moving at about 15 to 25MPH and was about 1 to 2 feet off the ground. It was circle orb in appearance and did glow but I don’t recall it being super bright…more like a dim to whitish medium glow. Unfortunately, my neighborhood friend who was the one on the roof with me past away years ago so I cannot consult with him on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For my professional background I am a laser engineer and manager.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was vacationing in Orlando, staying at my grandparent house.  I had set up a tent in the backyard next to the pool and was next to the tent drying off after the last swim of the day..when all of a sudden, I noticed a large disc shaped saucer approx 50 ft above my grandparents neighbor&#39;s house.  There were light panels (I don&#39;t remember the colors) around the edge of this saucer.  There was no viewing bubble..or window on top of this disc..you know, what flying saucers are normally described as..but as the disc just seemed to float there...I felt no fear..just curosity.  I walked through the house and into the front yard..and then noted that the disc seemed to jump in the sky to the left..and then head south in another leap..out of sight and in an instant.  This viewing has always made me curious of what is truly out there..People have dismissed it as an angel or someother type of supernatural being...But I have always been curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The mountains are as high as 14,000 feet. The elevation of Silverthorne is around 8000 feet. The population of Silverthorne was less than 1000 people then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In front of me were mountains, and as previously mentioned, we are in a valley surrounded by mountains. The time was around 8:00 PM, and it was mostly dark. As we were preparing our equipment, a light appeared to my left and a metallic object suddenly appeared, saucer shaped with little windows or portals around it, I clearly could see little portals on the craft. When I first saw it, it was as though it just appeared, yet it was moving across the sky. It was flying in front of me; I estimate its elevation was around 1-2000 feet above where I was standing, moving across the sky, from my left to right, towards Dillon Damn. it was around 2000 feet in front of me. The mountains where in the background and it was definatlely flying in the valley. It was traveling fast, but not to fast for me to observe the little portals. The object was very bright. I followed it for probably 8 seconds and it just disappeared right in front of my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The friend I was with only saw the light of the object, as he was busy with his equipment and just looked up as it disappeared. He did see the outline and the light of the object, but for only a second, and was not able to describe it, only that it did appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything that happened is engraved in my mind as if it happened yesterday. The memory of the UFO remains with me, as clear as when it happened. I am 54 years old now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is an event that I shall never ever forget! From that day on, I not only believed in UFOs, I knew they existed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rarely tell anyone of this event, as people generally seem to think I am a nut, or a druggie or some other silly justification of my so called &#34;delusion&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did call a hot line the following day, and I remember the guy I spoke to saying, &#34;Yea, there were a lot of sightings last night&#34; and did not take my name or a detail description of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I really should have reported it - but in 1976 in London if I mentioned it peoples assumed I was mad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were about 12 of us - I can&#39;t remember - squatting in St Johns school (disussed), Richmond London, England, in the heatwave of 1976 London. These people had been telling me they had been seeing UFOs in the sky, and I did not believe them - I thought they were seeing shooting stars, satellites, aircraft etc. So I agreed to sit up with them and watch..<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was computer science student at Kingston Polytechnic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We dragged chaisse-longes / sofas into middle of what once was playground. The site meant that the incident lightiung/light pollution was unusually reduced for London area. Also in this heatwave the visibility was exceptional - I could see whole of milky-way clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a couple of hours nothing much happened. We saw a few shooting stars and also some satellites which I think I identified correctlly. ACtually we saw a lot of satellites - the conditions were that good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this stage I was convinced I could explain everything and they were mistaken. Them suddenly something looking like a dull orange ice hockey puck slid over from one horizon to the opposite. I thought that a bit odd but wasn&#39;t freeked. A bit later there was another similar in different trajectory. Someone claimed it was a pidgeon. I didn&#39;t think so but wasn&#39;t too impressed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after that the main event happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see the consellation very cleary. It seemed an extra constellation appeared - accompanied by vague red steaks in sky according to some. The new constellation was mostly symetrical but not quite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It suddenly moved off - in formation and pointing &#34;forward&#34; (it was basically diamond-shaped but I would need to draw diagram). There was no accelleration I could see - it went from 0 to something serious instantaeneously as far as I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This formation then went clean through an angle - I&#39;d guess about 45% or so Im not sure - with one of the &#34;stars&#34; taking over as leader in the change. At no time did this formation slow down during this impossible manouver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the entire formation just stopped dead instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the &#34;wing&#34; stars of the formation just took off in curved tradjectory leaving red streakes to my eyes, being replaced simultaeneously by similar incoming to make new though similar formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They held that for 1 or 2 secs - then the whole lot just took off leaving red streaks to my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had about 10 friends with me witnessed this. I got them to write all details down. Unfortunately this has all been lost now. I quickly found if I mentioned it people thought I was mad. Some of my freinds -in fact most - saw slightly different stuff from me. I was watching one particular part of the sky. If I assume my friends were not crazy, then there was stuff going on all over the sky and I only saw one part of it. The reason I think so was that their reports just differed enough - like when we see real events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this event I tried to rationalise it. The best I could come up with was lasers or car headlights shining through a temperature inversion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the truth is it gave us all the serious impression of the cosmic &#34;red arrows&#34; - had intelligence written all over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realise I could be wrong - but I do sympathise with people who have seen stuff because I am one.<n>

Many stars where visable and after perhaps an hour...probably more, 3 of the brighter stars directly above us, I would guess 20 degrees left to right began to move at a high rate of speed (guessing twice the speed of an airliner at 35.000 ft.) and at different intervals each starlight would make sharp 90 degree turns without slowing down.  This really caught our attention as we didn&#39;t believe any jet could do this. This went on for possibly 10 minutes and then just seemed to disappear as if fading away.  Later the same night, guessing 1 hr. later we were discussing how bright this particular star was, and how it didn&#39;t seem to moving with the passing of time.  Several minutes later, to our astonishment, this star began getting bigger and within a few seconds was guessed to be about half the size of the moon, as if it were falling on us.  Needless to say, all 3 of us sat up at the same time in disbelief.  At this moment a large cloud passed between us and  the star.  I said to the others, Did you see the same thing I did, and everyone described it the same way.  Of coarse, this was an exciting moment.  Nothing else was seen this night, but I will always remember the experience.  This was so long ago that I&#39;m not certain about the exact date, but I can tell you the rest is ever so true.  It was as if the stars were a disguise for whatever it was we saw. We heard no sound. We were at the Isaac Walton Lake in Nevada, MO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I had beem working steady with very  long hours, six day a week for over six years-, in a large lumber mill as a computer tech and electrician., previous employment as a Electronic Designer and Engineer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I&#39;m a rare divorced dad, with  full custody of three children.  So I asked them where they would like to go, &#34;lets get Grandma and go to Salt Lake City as she always wanted to see it&#34; was the unanimous desician , my Olds Cutlass Supreme was a great road car and in perfect condition so it was loaded with camping gear and ready to go!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sunday morning after Church off we went, up to Hat Creek for the night and in the morning down to Reno, after seeing the town then drove out to Winnimmucca, Nevada for  a late lunch, continued driving to Salt Lake City where we stayed for the night.. We saw the Mormon Temple and Temple Square and all had a good time. After sightseeing I remembered a lake campground east of Salt Lake City so we went there, a lot of fun!  That evening there was a bad storm warning  for late the next day,on the radio. We left early.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to drive to Pendleton Or,  and while there stocked up on some really neat clothing!  How about Portland, down the Columbia river, we went to Meryhill, WA., where the stonehenge replica stands--We were having a great time,  and all the above detail is to show our frame of mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving from Maryhill on the freeway {84), I was thinking about the Hanford Atomic facility somewhere to the north, as we were headed west.  Grandma said &#34;Look at those three funny airplanes&#34; , looking north,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw three, black, triangular objects, above the other side of the river gorge, headed our way, and grandma and kids were talking with great excitement!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, as my eyes were on the road,  everything quit working, engine, dash lights, radio, CB, so I  coasted over to the side of the road--wondering what&#39;s going on ?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next thing I knew, I was standing in front of the car, wondering what I&#39;m doing out here, Gradma and the kids, in the car &#34;were looking at me like what are you doing out there&#34;?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got in the car, started up fine, everything working,  except the dashboard clock--we all acted dazed and dis orented--we decided to stop in the next town and get something to eat--and then continue on and see the dinosaurs at Fossil Or, that excited  everyone, so we stopped at a drive in at The Dalles,<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Man In Black!  While munching our burgers and fries, the hair on the back of my neck stood up as if some one was behind me, I turned around and this Man was sitting two tables away, not eating but just staring at us, nothing was on his table and I sensed danger!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood up and walked over to him, he was thin (like a person that had rickets), olive-brown skin, coal black hair and beady eyes framed by bushy-black eyebrows and pointed chin!  Black shoes and suit, white shirt--feeling this was unreal asked &#34;May I help you with something?&#34;   He shot back crisply, &#34;Where are You Going&#34;? Feeling very uneasy I stated &#34;going to take the family down to Fossil, and see the sights&#34;!   He replied, in a low but distinct  voice, &#39;DO NOT GO DOWN THERE, THINGS BIGGER THAN HOUSES, COMES  IN OVER  TOPS  OF THE TREES, !&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> With that he stood up and went out the door,  stunned, I went back to our table and discussed the events of the day and it dawned on us that some how we were unable to account for three hours  of time, and then this weird guy,  Then we all saw him drive very slowly by the side glass door of the diner, in a very black- highly polished utility truck. (painters vans we called them then}, just staring at us as he passed by .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quick vote, panic setting in, lets go home quick!  Down highway 97 we raced, past Bend Or, we started feeling a little safer, Forest road, star lit sky, was beautiful,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a Big Black Car passes us like we were standing still, with that Same face looking at us as he passed, (I was doing 65 mph).  And was quickly out of sight.  Everyone was quite upset again!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I  mashed the gas  pedal  up to 80 and let it roll, quicker out of there the better!  Again that black car, with that stern face passed us again,  Panic now, find a place with people, Grandma found Dechutes State Campground on the map just ahead., quick right turn, and there standing by the side of the road,  was that strange man.!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This Is Nuts!! Shaking, I quickly found a camp site near the bathroom, removed my 30-30 from the trunk, and stood guard the rest of the night!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next morning we traveled on home, wondering what had happened! Still don&#39;t  know!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Oldsmoble never ran after that trip, too many  problems with it!  The storm?  That when the Estes Dam broke.  Was the man in black bad or good, good I think, but I don&#39;t want to meet him again,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The missing three hours, just gone, not sure I want to know!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other strange experiences, yep, since I can remember, UFO  perhaps, don&#39;t know!  Sincerely  .<n>

I was alone, but there was two other cars parked near me with people sitting inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Off in a distance I saw a bunch of bright lights coming closer. The object darted suddenly up and down and sideways. There was red and green lights all around the base of the object, which flashed on and off. The object was moving extremely fast, and within a few minutes was within 40 ft. of my car. I look in total shock as I had a very clear view of the object, which looked like nothing Ive ever seen before. It stood in the sky maybe 75 ft. high and 40ft away from my car and just stayed there, totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked made of metal, and was very shiny. It was weird shaped, and didnt look as if its huge size could fly, as there was no wings, like an airplane. Some white lights started to flash, brightly. I got out of my car and walked towards the object. I was within 25ft of it and it just stayed where it was. I knew at this time, it wasnt from Earth, but I felt no fear. Maybe 30 minutes passed as I stood there. Then all of a sudden it went straight up and enormous speed and went sideways and totally vanished within 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove away from the area, I looked into the other cars parked there with me, and saw very shocked faces inside. Later in my life, Ive seen many more sightings, but never saw this particular object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d be willing to take a lie detector test! I&#39;m also willing to be contacted by a researcher using email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I might also note, Im not sure of the actual date this sighting happened, as it was many years ago, but I&#39;ll never forget it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was cool but not cold, and the air and sky were crystal clear.There was little light pollution as there were hardly any street lights and little to no noise to speak of. We were just hanging out and talking when I looked up and saw three lights in a triangle shape moving quietly across the sky against a starry night sky.  It was about the same height as jets fly and I told my friend to look up and they also saw it. All I could see were the lights and they were slowly spining in a circle while moving across the sky at about the same speed as a jet would fly. Stars would dissapear as this craft would pass between me and the stars and then reappear. I was too young to pay too close attention,so I am not sure of the size, but I was aware that this was something out of the ordinary and mentioned to my friend that it was a ufo. We watched it it till it moved out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My father was driving, my mother in the passenger seat, my niece in the back driver&#39;s side, and I in the right back passenger side of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was in a position of about 1 o&#39;clock (To my right, SW), hovering at about 200&#39;, over a vacant corner lot, on a busy city street, in the midst of tall office buildings.  It&#39;s altitude was below some of the tallest buildings, so that it should have been seen by anyone looking in that direction, either from the ground level or out of any of the buildings&#39; windows.  It must have been casting a shadow directly beneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a highly polished, aluminum-looking disc-shaped craft, round, about the size of a third of a city block (it covered the entire vacant lot).  The best way to describe it would be that it had the appearance and proportions of a fat silver dollar with rounded edges, but absolutely smooth.  There were no extraneous antennas, wings, tail, propellers, insignia, doors, windows, etc..  It hovered motionless, without sound that I could hear (my window was open).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 6 seconds, thinking, &#34;Oh, there&#39;s one now.&#34;  In other words, I was very calm.  There was no question in my mind that this was an extraterrestrial craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my attention to the interior of the car and asked my family, &#34;What&#39;s that?!&#34;  Unfortunately, at that exact moment, a small private plane was buzzing the freeway, very low, right in front of us, from right to left (from the direction of the craft).  Everyone in the car said, &#34;It&#39;s a plane.&#34;  I said, &#34;No, not that!  That!&#34; and as I turned to point to the object, it was gone.  No one else in our car saw it.  I do believe that the people in the small plane came close enough to call it a near miss.  Maybe that was why they were so low over the freeway; they had spotted it and came down for a closer look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it had just disappeared, or had taken off straight up (the only two possibilities, considering the close quarters it was in amongst the tall buildings), I looked up and down in every direction (as much as possible from the back seat of a car) for miles.  The sky was absolutely clear with only one small cloud to obscure any view.  I watched this cloud dissipate, as they do in the desert, trying to see if maybe the object had flown into it.  One can see for miles in the flat desert around Phoenix, and I could not spot it anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I believe it was a Sunday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time:  11:45pm-midnight<n> <n><n> Location: 	 driving south on highway 95 is SE Georgia, near Kings Bay, approximately 20 minutes north of the Florida border<n> <n><n> Observer Background: White male, age 24, in military (Navy), aviation electronics technician, honors college student, married 1 child at the time; living in Jacksonville Florida; only observation in life; generally a disbeliever until this event<n> <n><n> Witnesses: In my vehicle – my wife’s brother who slept through most of it  That specific event – at least 100 observed Leading up to that event - Hundreds, possibly thousands  Description: Glowing/pulsing round ball of yellow light, turning yellow/orange when changing directions, then back to yellow.  Approximate sixe was up to 50’ diameter. No sound, no disturbance of ground objects – just a big yellow ball. Weather was clear, bright moon-light night with only a couple thin clouds far off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Encounter:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.0-While driving south on highway 95, I witnessed a glowing/pulsing yellow ball of light on or very near the ground across the opposite side of the highway. The ball of light was visible for over a mile while approaching, and was located approximately 100 yards into the woods on the east side of the road. The woods consisted of a pine tree farm with very specific rows/density of pine trees. The light provided by the object was bright enough to establish a clear definition of the numbers of rows and size of trees (established distance into the woods) for a fairly accurate guesstimate of its size and location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.0-I slowed my vehicle to a crawl to get a better look at the object and pulled off the right side of the road. I sat in the vehicle, observing the object (Okay, staring in disbelief) for approximately 30 seconds with the window rolled up, but decided to roll it down to listen for sound – there was none. I continued to sit in the van for approximately another minute and noticed in my rear view mirror, several (4-5) other cars behind me with passengers watching the object. When the driver of the car behind me got out of his car, I also got out and began walking across the highway with him towards the object. It was at that time I realized several cars (5-6) had also stopped on the opposite side of the road, closer to the object. None of those occupants appeared to be out of their automobiles. During this time, many (20-30) cars also slowed down to look, but did not stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.0-Before I got across the road (south-bound lanes of highway 95), the object changed from pulsing yellow to solid yellow/orange and began a slow but steady rise out of the trees. At this point all automobile occupants who had left their vehicles immediately returned to them, with most driving away at very high rates of speed. I decided to stay, after running as fast as I could back to my vehicle. The object hovered above the trees and immediately returned to a pulsing yellow. The hovering lasted approximately another 20 seconds. During that time all but one or two of the other cars left the area but many more slowed down to watch without stopping. There continued to be no sound coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.0-The object again turned yellow/orange and began to move away at a slow speed. It moved in a southerly direction at a consistent altitude of approximately 200-300 feet above the trees. There was absolutely no sound and no tree movement under the object. I started my vehicle and began to follow the object south on 95. After about 1 minute of stable, horizontal flight, the object turned yellow/orange again, and abruptly stopped. It hovered above the trees, returning to yellow.  It was no longer pulsing but was a consistent bright yellow. It hovered there long enough for me to catch up to its location and pull off the road again. This required less than 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.0-As I was pulling my vehicle off the road, the object again turned a yellow/orange and began a slow ascent, at approximately the same speed as it was travelling horizontally south. The yellow/orange turned back to all yellow almost immediately. The object continued to rise for approximately 10 seconds, when it turned yellow/orange again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6.0-From where I was sitting in the vehicle, on an elevated overpass, I could see out to the eastern horizon with sufficient clarity to make out land, water, and thin/small clouds with help from a near full moon. The object, which had returned to yellow/orange momentarily, then back to yellow, sped away completely over the horizon, behind the clouds, reappearing again after them, all in less than 2 seconds. No sound, nothing – just gone. At a speed I had never seen or imagined possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After Encounter:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.0-Because I had an established habit of ridiculing people who had claims of seeing UFOs, I told no one of the encounter, until it began showing up on the news and in the newspapers.  Based on what they reported, this, or an identical object had been seen all across the southern United States during that weekend – from Arizona to SE Georgia. It had been witnessed by hundreds, possibly thousands of people according to the news reports. I believe this may also be the UFO reported seen by President Jimmy Carter in 1976, a Georgia resident at that time.  It’s been too long to remember why I thought that. I do remember his Playboy interview where he disclosed that he had seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.0-Approximately 3 days after the sighting, another person located where I work admitted to seeing the object but had hesitated to admit it because of the stigma associated with seeing a UFO.  I asked him for a description and location and he described the EXACT object in exact detail, flying almost exactly the same – west to east, yellow except when changing directions, on the ground, then hovering, ascending, and then disappearing over the horizon at unbelievable speed.  His location and time was approximately 10:30pm in south western Georgia.  He was returning from a trip to Atlanta.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.0-I admitted to seeing the same object and provided the crew at work with the description provided here – and of course received the appropriate amount of heckling. I never mentioned it to anyone other than my wife again until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My friend, the driver, had to hit me on the shoulder several times so I would look at “It”....apparently, I was in a trance, and at first,  I could  not look at the huge perfectly circular amber light just ahead of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, I observed it long enough to see exactly what it was---it was, a UFO!  Then, in an instant, the big light went out and 2 comparatively smaller cobalt blue zig-zag flames, like lightning bolts appeared---while my eyes followed their very quick vertical assent---they then, instantly disappeared at the blink of an eye, virtually, at the speed of light, and, it was all gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw a Craft, just those 2 amazing lights!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the sighting occurred after the fireworks, it would have been 24:00 hrs., not 00:00 hrs.

There were at least 50 people in our group of people (in the area we were at) who were witness to what we say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the fireworks show people started talking and pointing.  My father told me where to look and I saw a round shaped flying saucer.  It was quite high in altitude.  The total time we watched it was probably about fifteen minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We know it was not a shooting star, plane, helicopter, etc., the object moved quickly across the sky and stopped instantly (super-fast speed to a full stop), it hovered for some time and then started moving again, it made a 90 degree turn in mid-flight without losing any speed and continued its flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it stopped again and after a short time it just “warped out” (?)  I don’t know how to explain it any better; it just instantly zipped off into outer space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was circular/round in shape, it was white/light blue (probably very light blue), it had no blinking lights (no lights like a plane might have, etc.), it was quite high, but I cannot estimate the height because I have no clue how large it was (it could have been a smaller ship closer to us or a massive ship further away).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed and the instant stop, instant warping away and turning 90 degrees instantly in mid-flight really let everyone know it wasn’t anything our civilization was capable of doing (this was almost 40 years ago, and we still don’t have the ability to make a turn like that).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crowd of people was quite large, and a lot of people saw it, but I remember my father telling me to not talk about it after it happened.  He clearly told me to never forget it because I would likely never see anything like it again, but was told to not tell people we saw it (probably a fear of being ridiculed?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure if it was reported in the paper or if police reports might still be available from that far back, but I have no doubt we saw a ship that was not from our Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You may contact me if there is any information I can give you that I did not make clear in this report, but I do not want my name displayed publicly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you!<n>

VERY loud, VERY slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad, my friend, and I were fishing on the beach late at night. For almost an hour, I had noticed a large, dull orb of light across the lake at approximately tree-top level from the perspective of where we were standing. It had the brightness of a street lamp, but just looked strange to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my surprise, the object rose straight up, appeared to pause, then slowly started to move toward us, across the lake. As it approached, we could hear a distant whistling sound, followed by a whirring engine sound, then a faint low rumble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it came even closer, we noticed that it was actually a dark rectangle with a  colored light at each corner. I recall seeing at least one red light, and a green light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved VERY slowly, and was not more than 100-150 ft overhead. It was VERY loud, also. There were many houses just behind us, but we didn&#39;t see anyone come out to look, which has always baffled us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad had previously been in the Air Force, and he noticed what he called &#34;super-structure&#34; underneath the craft. He described seeing &#39;girders&#39; underneath the craft, as well. He said that it was moving too slowly to make that much noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft moved directly over our heads, and disappeared behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a strange addendum, when we got back to the cottage, we told my mom, and she came outside. We immediately saw the same craft (I assume) in the sky, much higher up, with no sound audible this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even stranger, the very next year, we stayed at a different cottage on the same lake, and I was half-expecting to see the object again. I had a different friend with me this time, and early in the AM of July 4th (Exactly one year later), we were sleeping, and I was awakened by my dog&#39;s whining. I heard the same faint whistling and whirring sounds outside, woke everyone up, and I was actually shouting &#34;It&#39;s here!!&#34; We went outside to find the same type of craft moving overhead, a bit higher up than the previous year. My parents were flabbergasted, and I was giddy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never went back there for vacation again, but I wonder if anyone else has ever seen that object over Ridinger Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were both eighteen years old and did not have much money so we were sleeping on the beach (Black&#39;s Beach).  My friend had gone to sleep in his sleeping bag near by and I stayed up to look at the stars.  I liked to watch satellites going by when away from city lights.  I spotted what I thought at first was a satelllite straight above me.  It was very faint at first and going in a straight line heading west. But then it suddenly changed direction. It began heading southwest for a time.  Then Northwest.  Each change of direction happened instanly i.e. not in an arched tradgectory but more like an instant change, if that makes sense. At this point I woke my friend and he watched it with me.  After doing these maneuvers for ten minutes or so, it began to get larger and move toward the western horizon over the ocean.  It finally came to a stop just above the water. At this point it was quite large, perhaps the size of a nickle if held straight out.  It was a white, glowing ball. It just sat there for about ten minutes.  Then it began to ascend again and grow smaller. After a while it just faded out and disappeared.  Even thought this happened a long time ago, I still have a vivid recolection of it because it had a big impact on me at the time.  It did not fit into the profile fo any aircraft I could think of and its maneuvers were beyond anything I knew of.<n>

We were out in the country looking up at the stars. We saw a circular object with flashing lights move quickly across the sky. It was definititly not an aiplane. Then it stopped and moved straight down to the ground. We did not actually see it land. Then at least 3 jets zoomed across the sky. We knew that they had been scrambled to intercept the ufo. We were excited and thought that we could find it.  We drove around where we thought it might be, but it must have been farther away.<n>

I looked up and sighted a cigar shaped craft directly over the highway. The craft was at a low altitude probably below 500 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was just beginning to set and was to our backs, the craft was a little to the east of us and you almost had to luck straight up to see it. We observed port holes and you could see lights inside the windows. The craft did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Hudson police officer who was in the store came out and was about to get in his car and my mother got his attention about the cigar craft. The officer was stating he had not seen anything like it and did not know what it was that we were observing. It was getting darker and the cigar shaped craft was starting to blend with the dark sky and by now all you could see as far as lights was the window lights. I can&#39;t remember how many windows there was but more than 3 windows and they were in a row toward the bottom of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had no anti collision lights of any kind on this cigar shaped craft. No sound was heard emitting from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We looked up, and saw what I thought was an oval object in the sky.  We came up to the corner and my husband ran up the street and got his father, who came down to the corner.  We watched for several minutes until it went over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 20 minutes later my husband, son and I continued on our journey.  At approximately 11st and Olney Ave we again saw the same object.  It was a lot closer, and hovering.  What I remember is that it was enormous.  It had windows (I think) and lights going around.  There was no noticable noise coming from it.  We parked our car and watched the object for approximately 10 minutes.  Then, as weird as it sounds, we got bored and decided to go on our journey assuming that we would read about it in the newspaper the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, the Philadelphia newspaper had an article about a citing of a UFO near Baltimore Pike, which is probably 20 miles from where we saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My memory is that the object was more circular or oval; however, my huband remembers it as cigar shaped.  I think that it was a silver metallic color.  It was hoving over a very congested area of the city.  People were walking on the sidewalk, but I did not notice anyone else looking up, and we did not tell anyone to look up.  Another odd thing is that after that night, none of us spoke of this for many years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My house was in the last row of the development, and there were plans for extending the housing development to include hundreds of new homes in what was the wooded area over the fence of my back yard.  The construction companies had finished the main asphalt road, and the street lights had been installed and were operational.  Other than the road itself, there were only woods on all sides for miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One clear summer night, I was watching bats catch moths underneath one of the new street lights.  The moths would be attracted to the lights, and the bats would be attracted to the moths.  My friends and I would pick up pebbles and throw them into the air, and watch as bats swooped down and approached them before breaking off the pursuit after realizing they weren&#39;t prey insects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was kind of lost in the pleasure of just finding pebbles and throwing them up in the air to watch the bats chase.  There was a large full moon overhead.  That&#39;s what I was doing when I had a life-changing encounter with a small UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too small for a person to occupy, approximately 2.5 feet in diameter, and it moved so quickly that it could not be seen except when hovering motionless at different points. One moment it was in the night sky directly between me and the full moon, lit so that it was perfectly camouflaged against the moon behind it, perfectly still and silent. But as my binocular vision adjusted and it came into sharp focus, I felt a sudden shock as it appeared that the moon was very much closer than it was supposed to be. At the moment it registered in my mind as out of place, I became slightly disoriented and it instantaneously moved to within inches of my face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so close that I could see a mirror image of my own face displayed on its convex bottom surface. If I hadn&#39;t seen it so illuminated before, I would have guessed that its coating was a perfectly reflective polished metal. There was a soft humming electrical arcing sound coming from inside it, like statically charged particles being sucked through a very quiet vacuum hose into some other place entirely. It surprised me so completely that I was literally frozen in the deepest visceral fear that I&#39;ve ever felt. It was as though I had been in the jungle blithely examining an innocuous plant, and out of nowhere a 9-foot-long man-eating tiger had pounced on me. The part of the brain that registers fear is the amygdala. When it is active there&#39;s normally an urge to fight or flee. In this case, it was so directly stimulated that I felt only a primal, overwhelming, paralyzing fear. I remember thinking, &#34;Oh my God! This is really happening to me.&#34; The next thing I remember was &#34;waking up&#34; walking on my way home about 50 yards from where I was before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This level of propulsion and active material technology might be representative of advanced nanotech. While there is a slim possibility that some elite and secretive humans had that in the 1970&#39;s, it seems much more likely that it was of a non-human or post-human origin. Given the probable scenarios that are described by futurists such as the inventor Ray Kurzweil, it seems inevitable that we will eventually modify our own biology and become vastly different than the species we are now, with many orders of magnitude greater intelligence and computing power. When we reach that level of advancement, it is quite likely that we will no longer need the large, cumbersome, inefficient bodies that we have now. So different will be our physical structure that it&#39;s not unreasonable to predict that our minds and machines will be structured on a scale too small for modern humans to sense, even with our most sensitive instruments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This must be the case for the advanced civilizations that came before us. Just as we may find it desirable in the future to return the Earth to its pristine natural state, free from human structures and pollution, so too may those who came before us. We have no evidence of their existence precisely because they were so thorough at cleaning up the mess that they made on their way up the evolutionary and technological chain. They were simply very efficient at disposing of the evidence of their earlier civilizations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So that UFO I came into contact with must have been a machine of their design. Perhaps they monitor and manage us, in the same manner that we manage wildlife in nature preserves and zoos. Perhaps they prefer to remain undetected as they intervene in our affairs only in the most subtle ways, such as steering our ideas or dreams from within our brains. Perhaps we are their grand experiment, or maybe even their toys or their pets. Rather than communicate with us through left-brained verbal symbol sequences such as speech, they prefer to communicate in a much more efficient way, which is to choreograph our behavior, interactions and culture. Perhaps they are responsible for our more complex dreams. For example, my dreams often include higher beings that demonstrate nearly unfathomable powers within the simulated reality of the dream, and complete telepathy in terms of understanding my thoughts and intentions immediately as they occur or even slightly prior to my awareness of their occurrence. Perhaps we belong to them, and they own us, while most of us remain ignorant of that reality.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Divisional game between Carroll high and king high. Skylab is in orbit.  During the middle of game the PA announcer who is calling the ball game, says that Skylab will be visible to the crowd (about 2500people) as it makes its orbit around earth.  The PA announcer knows the exact time and the direction from which Skylab will appear from the horizon, I believe he told everyone to look to the southeast of cabinis field, as I looked up into the ‘clear blue sky’, directly out of the south in clear view came an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was cylindrical, dark and gray, had no markings, some external equipment and crooked arm sticking out of it with red glowing bulb at the end of the crooked arm. It was clearly visible, the PA announcer and another man in the booth began to argue about the object, about it begin too low and not coming from the correct direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object came directly over the ball field, not more than a few hundred to a thousand f! eet high. Its details were very visible to me.  The object cleared the horizons from southern horizon to northern horizon in less than 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The men in the PA booth of the ballpark continued to argue over the loud speaker about the object until finally the head PA announcer said to drop it, nothing more was said.  I remember going down the stands to the concession stand and people looking bewildered and dazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got in my car and drove home in disbelief.<n>

Let me give you the geography of were we are. Metropolis is the home of a plant that makes R238 or some kind of chemical for nuclear bombs. I beleive they call it &#34;yellowcake.&#34;  Over the Ohio river (in Kentucky) there is another plant  that takes this &#34;yellowcake,&#34; and refines it into, well, only the government knows.  In other words there is a lot of uranium in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One Sunday myself and two of my friends were on the road between Joppa, Ill, and Grandchain, Ill. This road runs a mile or two north of the Ohio River, but there are places that you can see the river. And this spot was one of those places.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We just passed over the Cache River bridge and was coming on a little rise and curve.  My male friend was driving, a female friend was in the passenger seat, and I was in the back seat behind the driver. I&#39;ve been down that road hundreds of times so I knew to look to the south to get a view of the river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something caugh my eye just over the Illinois bank of the river.  I&#39;m no good judging heights, but I would say it was 1000 ft. over the trees.Well, I don&#39;t care if you believe me or not. I don&#39;t want any plubicity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What it was, was an airplane, I don&#39;t know much about planes but I swear to God it looked just like a piper cub, the kind where the wings are on top of the plane. ??  From the very instant I saw the plane I knew somthing was wrong.  The windows weren&#39;t transparent.  The windows looked like it had silver looking tinting, and the plane was not moving at all.  It was just setting there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t recall ever saying a word to my friends.  As we were moving along the road  I kept watching the plane and all the sudden this huge green fireball came down to earth and exploded on the ground 3 times.  But made no noise at all. (Now keep in mind that that Kentucky nuclear plant is in sight just across the river).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The wierdest part of this whole thing was right after the explosions (I&#39;ll never forget this), I was turning my head around to look foreward I watched my two friends heads turn back foreward at the same time mine did.  We never said a word about it just went on down the road like nothing ever happened.  It&#39;s like we forgot about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even though this happened back in 1976 we never spoke about this to one another.  EVER!  The female friend of mine died about 4-5 years ago of cancer and we never said a word about it to each other.  Every time we were around each other we just, I guess forgot or was blocked from saying anything to each other about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But another strange fact is that I can tell other people about what I had saw.  But after a few rolling eyes, I thought it best just to keep it to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m getting older now and I had to tell someone that may actually believe me.  I&#39;m just getting my first computer.  And if we were abducted I&#39;m not going to be hypnotized to remember it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another funny thing is that I saw a show on ufo&#39;s once and they were talking about having small pieces of metal in thier bodies.  Well, in 1987 I had surgury on my arm for radial tunnel.  The Dr. showed me my x-ray on day and ask what those two pieces of metal were.  Smaller than a BB and lodged just above my elbow on my left arm.  I have never injured my are in that location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you don&#39;t believe me, thats fine. I have never heard of a ufo looking like an airplane before either. But I swear this on my Grandma&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I forgot to mention one thing.  There isn&#39;t a time I go by there that I don&#39;t think about that day.  I moved to Texas in 1979 and moved back to Metropolis in 1985.  My wife and I went down that road one day and the state of Illinois has bought the same property that thing exploded on and put a resturant right over the spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me give you my summation of what we went through. [maybe]<n> <n><n> <n><n> (1) If it was a UFO they can transform there crafs to look just like earth planes [because there was no dought in my mind that thing I saw looked like a plane]<n> <n><n> <n><n> (2) Some kind of mind control was used on us or we would have been able to speak to each other about what we had saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (3) And it scares me to think I&#39;ve got some kind of transmitter lodged in my arm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll probably think of more things later that I wish I had said to you but had forgot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But that&#39;s it and that ((deleted--&#34;is true.&#34;))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>
7/1/76 00:00|Santa Cruz|CA||two events that happened|Organized human-alien abduction|11/26/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33109.html|62|ndxe197607| Organized human-alien abduction<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im not sure if this is the correct place to explain what happened to me when i was ten years old back in the mid seventies..but it wont hurt to tell my story. It was a week of my life that kinda haunts me to this day. I havent discussed this to anyone before..because..it does sound kinda crazy..but the older i have become and the more ive learned about alien life forms..the more creepier i felt about what happened to me back then. Ill start off first by stating what i believe...I believe through my learning and hearing about how aliens basically make their own humans..by impregnating women....in lack of better terminology..using humans..human Dna whatever..they have the technology..like we almost do..to make their own humans. Who knows....that couldhave been the way Mary got impregnated with Jesus....CRAZY? Yeah some people think so..but ???  Anyways...i was ten or eleven years old and i signed up for this soccer camp one summer. The soccer camp was more than a soccer camp..cause it bused all the kids who joined way up into the mountains to camp and play soccer and fish etc...It was alot of fun. West Valley Soccer camp was the name of the &#34;oganization&#34;.A couple of really weird things happened to me that week...and at the time i just shrugged them off, and didnt pay to much thought to any of it....but the events are still with me today more than ever..and im 37 years old now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this could be just innocent weird things that happened that have nothing at all to do with other life forms..but who knows maybe someone else might have had something like this happen to them too.   Well..all the kids in the camp slept in bunk beds in lil cabins.  One morning,,all the kids awoke..and wheni woke up..from the top bunk..immedaitely the kids that in the cabin strting asking me what happened to me that night. Did i fall out of the bunk?? Why did they see a couple of the older counselers carrying me and putting me back in bunk in the middle of the night???  Now i had no recollection or memory of any of this happening to me.  That in itself is really bizarrre because..if i would have fallen out of bed i would have remembered.  Well..one more event took place...they had a big 7 mile hike they called it..where the counselours and kids would all hike somewhere for 7 miles and camp out for the night and the next day hike back. Well yeah..it waqs at least 7 miles..and when we came to the place where everyone was going to camp for the night...it was a public lil campground or something  but the oddest thing that didnt trip me out then but does now..was that all over this lil camp ground..posted on the trees...and taped to the port a pottys..was these papers stating that campers should be aware of some kind of bubonic plague or something that was out of control in the wild animal population in the area.  Were these signs there..to scare away people and make this area ideal for the &#34;Soccer camp counselors&#34;?. I dont know...but i do know one thing.,..i woke up in the middle of the night..a hundred yards away from the other campers who were asleep...just .. i guess&#34;walking in my sleep&#34;???? In that week two things happened to me that never before or after happened to me ...it was just all too weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/1/76|Johnstown|CO|Triangle||triangular with lights.....seen by town sheriff also upon arrival at cousins farm in johnstown colorado|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38072.html|63|ndxe197607| triangular with lights.....seen by town sheriff also upon arrival at cousins farm in johnstown colorado<n> <n><n> <n><n> this is second hand...but in the mid seventies.....my cousins witnessed a triangular ufo...just south of the town of johnstown co...on their farm...near the town power plant.  They called the sheriff...whom also witnessed the craft stil there when he arrived....after some time...the craft slowly moved parallel to the ground..away...and the police chased it as best they could...and it dissappeared over the ridge.   I believe that the airforce or military department, instructed my cousins to hush up about the event...as they were very reluctant to ever speak of it again.....My cousins last name was DAY....one name was FRANK...the father of my first cousins....He was my mothers age.....at this time i would have been 13 or 14 years old. and Frank Day...now deceased was about 37 or 38.  can you please investigate this...as it must have been a very serious event...covered up...thank you ((name and personal data deleted))…<n>
7/1/76|San Diego|CA|Triangle|60-90 seconds|Summer of 1976, San Diego, CA, visiting Father stationed in CA for 3 weeks.  One evening saw large red Triangular shaped object.|11/17/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/010/S10518.html|64|ndxe197607| Summer of 1976, San Diego, CA, visiting Father stationed in CA for 3 weeks.  One evening saw large red Triangular shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the summer of 1976, my brothers and I had gone to CA to visit our father for 3 weeks.  At that time he was stationed in San Diego CA.  One evening, my brothers, stepbrothers and stepsister had all gone out to play in the cul-de-sac after dinner.  It was evening and the sun was beginning to get low in the sky.  While playing, I do not remember who, someone noticed a large red triangular object in the sky.  I remember that the altitude of the object did not seem to be very high because I noticed that the object had 3 inverted &#34;V&#39;s&#34; on what appeared to be a flat bottomed triangular shaped object.  We all stood and watched the object disappear into the horizon.  I cannot even begin to guess the speed at which the object disappeared, it was amazingly fast and was gone in just a second or two.  The object then reappeared again, coming back from the direction it had disappeared, it again flew directly overhead, never making any sound, disappearing into the horizon from which it had originally come from. I am sorry I cannot provide more information, It was the summer of 1976 around the time of the summer olympics.  We were a bunch of kids out playing, the youngest of us was 7, and the oldest was around 16.  There may even have been a few neighborhood kids playing with us as well. I honestly do not remember. I have never forgotten what I saw that day, I remember thinking that it looked like someone was taking it out for a test drive. The object appeared to me to glow a very bright red.<n>
