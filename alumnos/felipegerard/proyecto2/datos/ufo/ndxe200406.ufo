Driving down the 91 freeway south of the 60 freeway when to my eleven o&#39;clock a green neon light a sphere, just appears for about two maybe three seconds then just blasted across the sky,<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like something out of star wars it was amazing, the reason that I&#39;m reporting this now is that it happened very very close to March Air Force Base might have been above it and low very low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was the air force with their jet with the laser that shoots down missiles but recently i seen the documentary on that jet and their laser is not neon green and does not shoot out the way this did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s been over four years but it seems like yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I&#39;m not saying it was something from outer space but as an ex marine what i saw that night was impressive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The object floated straight up about 150 feet and instantly stopped. It then instantly started moving west about 20 or 30 miles per hour. The object was completely silent, and had a dull yellow color. The lights were arranged 1,3,4,6 on the objects underside. The sides of the object were probably 40 feet long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/30/04 22:00|San Diego|CA|Sphere|20 minutes|2 lights hovering around south san diego, bordering tijuana.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51876.html|5|ndxe200406| 2 lights hovering around south san diego, bordering tijuana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> H1, although this event occured roughly 2 years ago, I felt that I wanted to share my story after watching a few documentaries of UFO&#39;s on television.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To begin, my family had a small get together at my house for dinner, and after we were just hanging out with my younger nieces and nephews playing video games. After the games, my cousin and I went out for a walk in my street, it was about 9-10 pm. Just about 2 houses away from my house, something from the sky caught my eye. I looked up and I saw 2 spheres(?), can&#39;t clearly classify it because the objects were far away, however they were clearly visible due to their illumination. After spotting the objects, I looked at my cousin, in which he was staring at it in the same amazement as well. Having to be skeptics of everything, i quickly suggested that it was an airplane or star of some sort. However, my theory was proven false after 10 minutes of staring at the objects. See, we&#39;ve always noticed that airplanes have blinking lights, however these objects did not have any. Another thing, these objects moved in a wierd manner that they were like chasing each other. Also, after moving fairly fast, (unfamiliar to our eyes )they would just stay in place and be stationary for a minute or 2. Later they would resume moving around. Having to be a bit scared, my cousin and I were satisfied that these were UFO&#39;s. However, it doesnt stop here. After 10 minutes, the objects would suddenly dissappear in a flash, either they migrated in the speed of light, or they just turned off all their lights. So my cousin and I were looking everywhere, and still no sign(let me note, it was a clear night no clouds). 30 seconds or a minute later, they would reappear again and do the same routine, they would chase each other around and then stop all of a sudden and hover in the air. However it gets even wierder, one of the objects shoots some kind of light(laser), in which the light dissappears after a while it has been shot. We were thinking, that either the object shot the light towards the other object, or towards the ground, i don tknow, because like i said the light dissappears after a while it travels in the air. After all this they become stationary again, and all of a sudden one of the objects flashes away into the sky, and the other one follows. (again in such a speed, not familiar for us to observe). The whole siting took about 20 minutes, and those 20 minutes were standing in the same exact spot that we were, when we first spotted them. And believe me, after we saw those UFO&#39;s my cousin and I were still in awe of what we just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was a quiet night with no activity.  I glanced to my left and suddenly a glowing red ball (larger than a softball, a little smaller than a basketball), slowly rose up from the ground toward the sky diagonally.  It was about 5-7 feet away when it started to rise.  It was not a tracer bullet as it was much larger and slower and there was no sound.  As it rose, it picked up speed and was quickly out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Unexpectedly, a strange, horizontal light emanated from the light.  The sky gave the impression of rippling with the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the event, the object vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

The clouds were a ghostly grey. There was a slight and mild breezy. I was at summer school for p.e.2 to get ahead. My ex-girlfriend,my friend, and I were walking out into the school courtyard during a lunch break; as alway the p.e. class was given a few minute early before break to clean up and so we snuck out early to the yard. During our walk, I meation how cloudy and moody the sky look and as we look we saw a strange object hovering in the sky.We laugh and joke about the idea of it being an alien space craft but all of us knew for sure it was an u.f.o. and so we didnt dismiss the idea of it being a party plate or a fisbee caught in an updraft. It flew in a strange way. It hover and shake. It was high in the sky, so it couldn&#39;t thrown up. Also, it was a greyish and brownish color. I don&#39;t know what it is but it didn&#39;t seem to care about us or have any signs of intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The wings were shaped as an isosceles triangle, as are many military planes and some commercial, but the entire length of the wings had lights, don’t recall colors, rather than the relatively few lights of regular aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying relatively slow, and appeared large, but I took it to be a plane coming in for a landing, which would not be unusual for the location, which was about 15 miles from RDU airport. (We also have several military bases in NC, and National Guard base, but I’ve never seen any military aircraft other than helicopters and cargo planes.)  I saw this many times around rush hour over Raleigh/Cary area over a period of a couple to several months, usually when I was returning from walking my dog at a park, around rush hour.  Given the location and hour, thousands of other people had to have seen it.  Since I never saw any UFO reports just assumed it was a regular aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still, it struck me as unusual, and when my teenage daughter saw it, she too thought it extremely unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then, I’ve never seen anything like it around here or elsewhere, and also the unusualness of it has stuck with me. So today I started looking to see if I could find photos of aircraft with that kind of lighting configuration, but have found none.  However, I’d love to have someone tell me it was just a regular plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 2004 is approximate.  NUFORC has assigned an arbitrary date in June 2004.

I saw a big light that lite up the corner intersection, and part of our street.  Then we both saw a fire ball low in the sky, horizontally racing east.  This fire ball was maybe 7 stories high.  I called the police because we are on the flight path of Ohare airport and I thought a plane part fell or a plane when down.  When 911 answered the phone, they asked where would it land.  I said it had to be close because it was so low but it wasn&#39;t coming down in a vertical descent.  It was confusing.  I asked if there were any other 911 calls and they said no.  There wasn&#39;t any reports of things crashing to the earth.  The fire ball was maybe 8 feet across.  This was years, maybe 2, before the Ohare reports and I didn&#39;t know what to make of it.  Only after the Ohare reported sightings did I rethink this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

And he was still above the tall trees just slowly floating down!   But as soon as he floated down lower he disappeared behind the tall trees and apartments.  I ran as fast as I could to get to the area where he would have to be if he landed, but THERE WAS NO ONE THERE!  AND, THERE WAS NO PARACHUTE EITHER,  Yes, I did check for a parachute because I could not believe what I had seen!

Normally people would take I-10 all the way, but for some reason my friend who was driving at that time, took some other route which lead us further away form civilization. I think we were somewhere near New Mexico.  It was about 4:00am. The sky was still kinda dark. Not a single car on the freeway. I was sleeping in the passenger seat when all of a sudden my friend who was the driver, woke me up and pointed to the sky above and said what is that?  I sat up and cleared my eyes and looked above. There it was, a UFO no more than 150ft above our car on the freeway.  At that time, the sky was still dark. But as close as that UFO was to our car. There&#39;s no mistaken that it was a UFO. The UFO was coming down as we were looking at it. Surpisingly, the UFO made no kind of noise at all. It was moving very very slow. It was 360 degree with three circle lights under the flying object. As the UFO came down and hover to the side of the freeway it got so close to the ground, the UFO was literaly touching the grass. Then it started to move into the dark and out of our sight and that&#39;s when we lost total sight of the UFO. To this day, I still remember what I have seen that night. It was unbelieveble. I Don&#39;t deny what I have saw that night nor could anyone tell me that I could of mistaken it for a plan.  This UFO was so close to us that it was literaly sitting above our car no more than 150ft and coming down even closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

6/30/04 03:00|Rosarito (Mexico)||Unknown||It put its hand near my face, but stopped and spoke to another one that told him to leave me alone, for they were &quot;done here.&quot|5/2/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108983.html|24|ndxe200406| It put its hand near my face, but stopped and spoke to another one that told him to leave me alone, for they were &amp;quot;done here.&amp;quot<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back in Rosarito, Mexico, I was about 6 years old.  I had no thought of aliens or anything, the farthest my questions went was how did we start, and what are stars.  Well my family are Christians, so I thought I had my only answers, until that night.  I was sleeping on the 2nd floor of my great grandparent&#39;s house and woke up in the middle of the night.  I was sleeping in a sleeping bag in between two beds where my mom and grandma slept.  I had seen a bright blue light shining through the curtains that covered a sliding door the other side of the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked over to the sliding door, having no fear or suspicion, just simply curiosity.  I opened the curtain, the house is like an L, and had seen the bright blue light glimmer on the other side of the roof, but couldn&#39;t see what the light was.  I had seen to 7 to 8 ft. tall aliens.  I didn&#39;t think of aliens at the time.  My thoughts were, &#34;I thought we were the only walking smart animals on the planet, I didn&#39;t know there were others.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> And there were four of them, two on the other side of the roof so I couldn&#39;t see them, and two on my side.  One of them had a device in its hand, best description would be like an Ipad as thin as paper, and was swiping its finger over it as if it was a touch screen.  The other paced back and forth, not fast, but quickly as if agitated by something. It stopped and started speaking in a weird tone I can&#39;t explain, and the other looked up and responded, then quickly went back to its work.  The other went back to pacing, but stopped, looked up, and turned its head towards me.  I was kinda scared then, but continued looking at it. It started walking towards me, but I thought about how the roof ends before it reaches the sliding door. I was concerned about how it was going to fall and why it didn&#39;t realize it was going too. So I watched until the fateful moment, until it stepped on the air.  It took 3 steps on the air as if it was flat ground, at that time! i panicked, thinking that&#39;s not normal, this is not real. I r! an to my sleeping bag and covered my eyes for a literal half second, the house is designed weird, the stairs lead straight to the room, the sliding door is right next to the stairs. I peaked over my sleeping bag and had seen its head poking up in the sight between the railings for the stairs.  I did my flash peak again and it was standing at the top of the stairs, I did it again, and it was standing in the middle of the room, again, it was at the foot of my sleeping bag.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was teleporting, also it got to the stairs when a couple seconds earlier it was walking on air outside and you have to open a door to get to the stairs, the door is so loud, you&#39;ll wake everyone up it you open it, it was closed.  And it was looking me in the eyes, it had a slit for a mouth, I couldn&#39;t see a nose, but it was dark besides the shimmering blue light.  And it had large black eyes, at the time I described him like Spider-Man.  He bent over and was about to grab my face it looked like but stopped about, 3-4 inches away.  I examined its hand and it had long fingers that ended in round bumps, like frog fingers, and its skin kinda glimmered like a frog&#39;s skin.  But it was more of a greyish color with a tint of green.  I looked past its open fingers and saw its head turned to the other side of the room, where an identical being was standing at the top of the stairs, but it was like I could feel their differences through their energy or something.  And then I could hear them in my head, like they were speaking through telepathy, and the other one said something like, &#34;Leave it alone, we fixed it.&#34; or &#34;Leave the boy alone, we&#39;re done here.&#34;  And the one standing in front of me looked me in the eyes, and pulled away its hand and started to walk away, still scared, I did the flash peak and they were gone, and the light was gone too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 seconds of self encouraging, I ran to the sliding door and looked outside, but saw nothing, not even in the sky.  My mom and grandma, were asleep and unaware of anything that happened.  I was so scared of that moment that the idol I basically worshipped, Spider-man, I had my grandma throw everything away that had to do with him, because his eyes reminded me of them.  I threw away my clothes, blankets, pillow cases, figurines, even my tv, and old school gaming system representing him. I hadn&#39;t told my grandma why, just that he reminds me of &#34;them.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> And a couple years later, after I calmed down about it, and I was ready to talk about it, I told them what had happened, but ever since, I have had numerous weird experiences, that follow up aliens and even ghosts.<n>

6/30/04 01:15|Hubbard|MN|Other|30 min.|It was the strangest blue light we had ever seen and then it changed and started following us all the way home.|7/8/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37895.html|26|ndxe200406| It was the strangest blue light we had ever seen and then it changed and started following us all the way home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were coming home from a casino taking the back roads home as we normally do. It was a bright night out-almost a full moon and the stars were very bright. Very clear. We were coming up a hill and at the top of the hill on the other side of a row of trees was a bright blue light. I was driving slow because the area is known for alot of deer. The light was nothing I had seen before and I asked my friend to look at it. I slowed down to almost a stop and observed it for a short time. We were talking about it being a strobe light like on a police car or something, but it was solid blue and wasn&#39;t emitting light in a fixed manner. It was almost throwing light like a laser but like ribbons of light. It didn&#39;t light up the field it was in so you couldn&#39;t see what it was attached to. We discussed it being a tractor but the light was so weird I had never seen anything like it before. Then the light started coming  straight towards us at a fast rate and I freaked. I hit the gas and started down the road. I told her to keep watching it and tell me what it does. We came upon another hill so we lost sight of it for a second then she said that it must have been an airplane because it&#39;s in the sky now. I asked her what it looked like(I couldn&#39;t see it-we had an old Rambler car and I&#39;m missing the side mirror). She said she wasn&#39;t sure what kind of plane or what it was. Then I told her I would stop and take a look. We slowed down and I rolled my window down and I looked out and I knew immediately it wasn&#39;t an airplane or helicopter. It had two panels of light on it and they were changing colors randomly from left to right. They would be green, yellow, red, white, orange and blue. At this point I had no doubt in my mind what it was we were observing. We were a ways from the next town and no cars on the road so I drove the old Rambler as fast as it would allow. The thing in the sky followed us at a distance of maybe a mile. When we came to the next intersection and I had to turn it turned wi! th us and kept following us out the right side. It stayed a mile away from us at all times until we got to the next town. There is a lake there and it was hovering over the lake and that is the closest it got to us. We got to a major highway 4 miles down the road. I figured we would wait for a car and follow it. We waited at the stop sign but nobody came so we sat and watched for it and it appeared north of us again. I sped out for home-15 miles. My friend saw it only once in the next 4 miles. It stopped dead in the sky and headed due east and a high rate of speed. We had to go through another small town to get home yet and nobody was in sight so we kept speeding home. We never saw it again until we got home and it was coming at us about 1-2 miles out over town. The lights were doing the same thing on it the whole time it followed us. We were so freaked out we headed home and ran in the house and thought about what to do next. We went into the yard after our blood pressure came down to look for it but nothing but stars and the moon. Thank God.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This event occured in I believe 2004, and it greatly interests me.  Many believed that a UFO exploded above Indian skies that year, and the red rain had to link with it.

Union Pennsylvania, a small light moved irregularly, giving the appearance of a UFO|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43936.html|31|ndxe200406| At Creation East in Mt. Union Pennsylvania, a small light moved irregularly, giving the appearance of a UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> At a music festival called Creation East (basically a christian rock music festival for which I went for the music and not the preachy element present), I decided to go off by myself and lie on my group&#39;s truck for awhile while they all discussed religious issues around a campfire. I just stared at the night sky, trying to clear my mind so I could get my own issues sorted out, which I had initially gone to Creation for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stared into the sky, I noticed a small light that kept moving, slowly at first, then it would zip over across the sky a bit, near some other star which was stationary. I thought I must be seeing things first, so I watched the light move about for about 10 minutes alone, then went to ask my friends whether or not they saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of my friends saw the light, and noticed that it seemed to be moving, and that it would zip away at certain points during its movement to another part of the sky not too far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then proceeded to ask the campsite next to ours whether or not they saw the light&#39;s movement, and, as they were drunk, they didn&#39;t believe me and decided instead to mock me for being blind or something of that nature. Regardless, I watched the light by myself a few minutes later, then noticed it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light itself seemed to be spinning in place, which struck me as very odd indeed, and then what happened next was a bit scary; the light started spinning in place, then a little red light flew off of one end of it and traveled in a straight path for a bit, then faded out, while the main light kept spinning. This phenomenon occurred several times, until eventually the light was obscured by clouds and I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nobody who saw it could tell me what it was, and those three who assumed it might be a UFO said nothing about it after that, though I think about it often, wondering what exactly went on that night.<n>

I had heard the same static befor when I saw the &#34;black&#34; area. I went outside to look for the &#34;black &#34; area and sure enought it was there. I guess it was about 150 feet in size. The stars were NOT visable in the &#34;black&#34; area. As the area moved slowly the stars in the &#34;rear&#34; of the area came into view and the stars in front dissappeared. The sky was clear except for this area. The dogs in the neighborhood were barking and howling. The area moved against the wind and slowly move from SE to NW. I have seen this &#34;black&#34; area in the sky one other time but it may be there other times. There was no noise from the area except maybe a slight hum. It sure causes the dogs to go nuts and causes weired static on my CB radios.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had a fire burning on the beach, a pretty big fire as a matter of fact. As we looked out towards Puget Sound we seen what we thought was a Stealth Bomber flying slow from the north towards us.  At the time we spotted it we estimated it was approximately 5 miles away.  I know a Stealth bomber is black but it had lights on the corners and it appeared to be shaped like a triangle. We thought it might have been from Whidbey island where Navy planes take off from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However it was moving very slow towards us and low. We estimate that it was approximately 500 feet above the water and closing. As it got closer we did not get nervous but excited. What was weird is that we started to feel like we had static electricity on our bodies, kind of like an electrical charge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it hovered right above our heads we were looking up at it when it all of a sudden vanished, not took off in some direction, but just vanished as if it disappeared.  When we looked down the fire we had just started ten minutes ago that was blazing 10 feet high was just a burned out group of charred logs. For some reason we all felt very tired and instead of building another fire we just went to our tents and went to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was way too far to be a space shuttle or a aircraft. The object compared to a plane was 1/30th of the size. The object moved upwards never downwards. It moved so fast upwards that if we swung for 10 more seconds, the object would go up about a fingers length up in the air from where we were standing. The object was oval and had a flashing light which had no pattern like on a airplane. It would blink then stop then blink 5-10 times then stop again for about 3 seconds. The object was small and very scary to look at.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw 2 tiny beams of light shining down from the sky from a very far away source.  They were extremely narrow and coming from very high up.  Higher than anything I knew of.  I yelled for my family to come see, &#34;Quick&#34; and my husband ran in the room, finally, and just as he did, the lights disappeared, but only momentarily.  They had bent, with angular shafts, behind clouds (?) and then reappeared.  I was so glad he could see what I saw!  We watched in awe and then we saw this tiny, blue helicoptor drop lower and lower from the sky where the beams were.  I thought, how funny, I&#39;ve never seen a helicopter so small before! It came down to tree level and started moving around the trees and bushes next door, outside the window we were watching from.  Then it landed and wheels appeared.  it looked just like one of those sleds in the Olympics... 2 man bob-sleding.  It began moving around the neighbors bushes and driveway, going in and out everything it ran into. It made me think it was a robot. I thought, it&#39;s like a dog sniffing around the property.  Eventually, it made it to our house! Something told me it was looking for drugs! I knew I had none, but it stayed a really, really long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They had extreme fast speed and stopped on a dime and rose up and down the terrian. If anyone wants to contact me write to mlrmtn7@yahoo.com<n>

However, it seems I want to report it just in case.  While watching the movie JAWS, on Bravo TV over the last month there are two scenes wherein a UFO flies across the screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both are towards the end of them movie, right after the shark starts to attack the ship.  In the first scene, the sherrif is on the bow of the boat trying to get his gun out.  A bright object moves from right to left across the sky at a very high rate of speed.  It leaves a con trail.  When the scene is stopped, there is a bright object that can be seen.  It travels across most of the sky in about one second and disappears behiind the Brodie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the next scene, the camera moves back showing the boat from a distance.  In this scene, the same type of object appears and moves across the sky from left to right and moves into the clouds.  Based upon the speed of these objects, it does not seem likely they are airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is it possible the entire world has seen film and documentation of UFO&#39;s by way of a very popular movie?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have seen both passages in JAWS.  The objects appear to be below a solid layer of overcast.  We do not know if the objects were inadvertently filmed by the film crew during a &#34;take,&#34; or whether the images were included artificially by the Director.  PD))<n>

They flew west to east changing formation in a circular pattern whenever the front oval moved north or south. They disapeared at about an angle of 3:00 from my view. It took less than 1 minute as I was sitting at the stop light at the shopping center. It started over the car dealership and ended over the trees above the shopping center. They were very bright and shiny yellow-gold.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/28/04 17:00|Saskatoon (Canada)|SK|Sphere|3 minutes|2 sightings in daylight|7/8/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37914.html|44|ndxe200406| 2 sightings in daylight<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just thought maybe I should start reporting some of the things that are being seen in the skies over Saskatoon, Sask. I think I mentioned to you in my last communication with you that over the last few years we have experienced some pretty amazing sightings right from our back yard here in Saskatoon, but I never took the time to report them to anyone. After each experience, I always tend to think, well, that will be the last one we will every see, but it definitely isn&#39;t turning out that way. It seems myself, my family, are seeing way more than our fair share.  I do plan on sitting down and writing a report  of descriptions of what we have seen over the past few years, but for now, I thought I would send you a quick report of what we have seen over the last few days, with a couple of photos attached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 28th, my wife and I were sitting out on our back deck around 5:00 p.m. discussing our day when I noticed something in the sky to the east. From past experiences I have learned to always have a pair of binnoculars close by on the deck, and immediately grabbed them and focused in. I think my wife could see my jaw drop as I asked her to quickly run into the house and get a Christmas present she had gotten for me just for this purpose, binnoculars with a built in digital camera. While she was doing that, what I was focused in on was a series of bright white spheres, very high up, but yet very clear. I would say a series of 9 spheres that where joined to form a unbroken ring. I could even see the blue sky through the middle of the ring. The ring kept changing shape from almost a circle to oval and everything in between. I was stationary at first and then, the best way to describe it was, it just kept increasing in altitude until it disappered. Any ways it turns out that the batteries where dead in the binnoculars with the digital camera, so no photos of that one. Needless to say, we replaced the batteries.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The very next day, at the same time of day, we where out on the deck again talking about the day before, both of us not expecting anything, but sure enough, as we were talking something out the corner of my eye caught my attention. In almost the exact same location as the day before. Again, grabbing my binnoculars (without the built in camera, that one is sitting on top of the fridge in the house, geez) I focused in on a single sphere, very metalic looking as you could see light refecting off of it. Moving very slowly towards us from the east, it was hard to tell if it was changing in size or just increasing in altitude. What ever it was doing, it was doing it every few seconds. Something I hadn&#39;t seen before was a strange haze or distortion of some kind around the object, almost making it blurry at times. Meanwhile, my wife had run in and got the binoculars with the camera and I managed to get a few photos which the best two are attached in this email. Although not very dramatic, I think they give you the idea of the shape and also the distortion around the object that becomes clearer when you enlarge the photos. Have a look and any comments would be valued. An interesting aspect of what we have been seeing here is that they are all in broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was clear to the east and became slightly clouded as you looked west. I saw what I can only describe as odd clouds. About eight of them they stood out in a strange way. There were other clouds but this looked like the fall out of fireworks except they pulsated briefly. I heard no explosions. Thet were plain as day, I walked across the parking lot to get out of the parking security lights for a better look. They were faiding very slowly but just fast enough to wonder what the hell the deal was with them. I trecognized that they were dwindling and finially they faded out completely. I noticed that the first cloud to dim out came back for a second with what I thought was a craft like image in the middle causing it to be seen. I certainly have seen strange lights before but this was very strange. It was like I caught the end of something but when the first cloud came back it was too much to accept as weather related, something caused it. I heard nothing the whiole time except a train in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was not a satellite nor a plane.  It was moving in a southwestern pattern.  It was also pulsating.  It would get bright, then very dim as if to almost disappear.  I thought maybe it was a satellite, but it was different.  As I continued to watch, I did in fact see a satellite cross, and this thing was definetly bigger and brighter and did not move in a very straight pattern like the satellite did.  I then began thinking it must be a plane, but it was way too high.  I then saw a plane float by and I realized it definetly was not a plane either.  The planes have the distinctive blue and red lights that alternate, and the moving thing did not.  It was also way higher than any plane can go.  I followed it until I could not see it any longer (approximately a minute or so).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be very large and many miles north of us, about 10-15 degrees above the horizon.. the lights did not appear to be moving at all, and overall had a slightly saucer shaped silhouette. After viewing for about 15 minutes, object dissappeared instantly, only to appear 45 minutes later in the same position but not as bright, as only a saucer shaped white light.(The individual lights were not distinguishable.) Again, after a few minutes of viewing, the object instantly disappeared again. No &#34;twinkling&#34; as most aircraft lights appear through the valley smog, and it appeared and reappeared in the same position over too long a span of time to be commercial aircraft on approach to Sky Harbour airport. If it was a jet, it must have been enormous, and I can&#39;t explain its spontaneous disappearance and reappearance ... Commercial traffic to sky harbor usually clearly changes course and the lights of normal craft get dimmer but are still visible as the planes course turns away from an observer....not just disappearing. This anomaly was quite bright and visible for quite some time, 5-10 people at rocking rodeo(graham central station) viewed this.. I would have to assume elsewhere in the Phoenix metro area others witnessed it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Broadway runs northwest and southeast.  I was looking up into the sky northward, I saw a flash and what looked like a fireball appeared.  It seemed to flash into view suddenly.  It was predominantly red with white, maybe yellow intermixed and it changed colors as it moved on.  It appeared suddenly and streaked north diminishing in size as it streaked and left sight within milliseconds after I saw it.  I believe in addition to the change of size due to increasing distance as it moved, that it also got smaller itslef.  I screamed to my companions just after the object came into view, but as they turned it had already disappeared.  The sight of the object caught me by surprise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was clear, there was no wind to speak of.  The moon was clearly visible in the southern portion of the sky.  Since the street slants, I saw a flash and the object appear from behind a building as it went northward.  It definitely was above the buildings, it made no sound and did not leave a trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what seemed to be two commercial jets one flying north the other flying south shortly afterward as I reached the next block heading west and from my vantage point on the ground, I could see the commercial crafts for quite some time by comparison.  I&#39;m not sure if anyone else saw the fireball/UFO but I would be happy to know that someone else did, to confirm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then a few minutes later I hear what sounds to be like rushing air and the 5 to 10 seconds later I see around nine objects appear from above my patio cover heading south to southwest at a high rate of speed and low altitude. The objects were black in color, appeared to be triangular in shape and from the few seconds I was able to see them in the sky between the patio cover and the tree line, they appeared to fly almost in a formation with two offset from the formation on the right side.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I sat down on the porch to take a break and looked up into the blue sky. I saw a cigar-shaped object very high up that looked like a star with a faint white tail pointing downward. It did not appear to be moving. I pointed it out to my partner, who also saw it. The object was slightly to the northeast, at about 60 degrees from the horizon. I brought my telescope outside and attempted to view it, but I could not find it with the telescope. After about ten minutes the object was no longer visible. My partner and I are both in our 30s and college-educated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was admiring how nice of a day it would be, then I noticed something just above the tree line.  It looked black and shiny, I saw the sun reflect off of it.  Something about the way it was moving seemed odd, it seemed to be going too slow to be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I went into the garage and got my binoculars and took a look at it. At first I thought I was looking at a group of balloons that got away.  I thought this because  through the binoculars I could see that it didn&#39;t keep a consistent shape.  Then I had to dismiss that idea because when I looked at it without the binoculars I could see that it was going in a straight horizontal line, not rising or falling, and there was hardly any breeze at the time.  It was moving from west to east and looked like it was about 300 to 400 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By my estimation it was out over the Boise airport.  I watched it untill I lost it in the background of the mountains east of Boise.<n>

It was staying in the same spot hovering when it did move it went very fast horizontally and vertical.  Also the shape would change from saucer to round to triangle at one point it looked like a circle with holes in it almost like a smile face.  It just was very odd almost like a lazer light show.  She did get it on video and called a couple freinds to see it too, I saw the tape and I cant explain it. A few days later alot of people have seen simalar things it was on the news, and the police dept took pics, the only explaination was a military manufacturer was testing a new aircraft around that time period so that could be it some sort of new top secret thing whatever it was it was nothing we have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at a celestial body, perhaps a twinkling star.

It moved very rapidly parallel with the horizon from south to east and disappeared behind a large thunder storm cloud. It did not reappear on the other side of the cloud. The duration of the event was only a few seconds. The light emitted by the object was greater than that of a full moon and lit up the bedroom. A parrot screamed from another part of the house having been awakened by the bright light. The residence is in a remote, country setting with no street lights or nearby house lights or through roads. It almost seemed like a meteor except that it was a relatively large bright green oval and moved across the sky parallel to the ground as opposed to intersecting it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had just left my friend Tony&#39;s house on Crab Tree Road.  I have made it about a quarter mile away from Tony&#39;s house.  I had the fog lights turned on because there was so much fog i could hardly see 30 feet in front of the car and I am driving very slow because of the weather conditions as well as the many deer out in that neighborhood.  Plus I am driving my room mates 2004 Nissan 350Z Roadster and I am very aware and careful when driving his car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am heavily concentrating in the foggy road ahead then all of a sudden I see this green light right there in the fog in front of us in the sky.  it seemed to be about 50 to 100 feet high from the ground.  If I had to guess I would think it was about the size of a school bus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew from the right to the left covering about 100 yards within 1 or 2 seconds, then it disappeared.  At that moment I was barely able to get the words out of my mouth to my friend &#34;What was that?&#34; and as he is saying &#34;Did you see that?&#34; the object appears again after it not being there for at least 3 seconds and it seemed as soon as it reappeared it shot upward into the sky at a left kind of angle, the same direction it just shot towards, but upward this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had two lady friends following us in their car riding together.  As soon as this happened I was concerned and pulled immediately over.  My friends pull up in their car next to me and I ask them &#34;Did you see that?&#34;   The passenger (Lisa) says &#34;That thing in the sky?  I thought I was just seeing things&#34;.  And the driver (Robin) says &#34;See what?&#34;  So I know that since Lisa saw it that there is no way it was a reflection, or anything we were able to comprehend.  We only stayed about long enough to pause for a moment and then we decided to go ahead and continue to head home.  I looked down at the radio and the time was 4:14 am.  I do not know what time it was prior to leaving, but I honestly do not think there was any missing time lapse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more we spoke about it, the stranger it seemed.  I was driving a 2004 Nissan 350Z convertible and even though the top was up, we never heard a sound of a helicopter or a plane.  The headlights on the car are florescent lights and gives a good visual in the conditions we were in and there was nothing to justify what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Grand-it was 4:14 am and you may be thinking what were we doing up so late, that we must have been drinking and just seeing things.  And I will admit we had been drinking earlier that night out at a bar, but had not had a drink for over 2 hours, since last call in Texas is 2 am.  I had had 3 beers all night long and was totally sober and the designated driver.  For the record.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So anyway, Yesterday I was thinking still how strange this occurrence was and that I wanted to find out more.  I was thinking of calling my local Airport, but thought asking some desk clerk about a UFO she would think I was nuts.  So I got on the internet.  I came across www.ufocenter.com and thought this is who I need to contact and report this strange sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I spoke with Peter Davenport on the phone.  He asked me to document this report and this is what I am doing.  Mr. Davenport took my report verbally and during the process he has pointed out some things that now has me a little worried.  I am referring to Sleep Paralysis.  Just last night, one day after this incident I had what I call a &#34;Sleep Paralysis Attack&#34;.  I will not get too into it, but it sure is strange timing.  I have these attacks maybe about once every year or year and a half since I was about 12 years old.  You can do a google.com search for sleep paralysis and read up more on it.  I did not have any visual during my attack.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So in detail about the object in the sky.  I will describe this object in the sky that I can not identify as anything I have ever seen.  Like I mentioned earlier the soul foundation of the object appeared to be about the size of a school bus.  It was long and narrow.  It had this distinct green light glowing in the shape of a bus.  And underneath the largest green light I described was this thin green line the same width of the large object.  And to the right of the object was a orange or red colored ball of light.  It all happened so fast, but the bright light of the object in the sky burned the image in my head and I can recall it like I am just seeing it now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will get my friends to try and give a statement of this occurrence as well.  I might be the only one out of us that is taking this so seriously, but I will try and get them to participate in anything you at the UFO Center need as well, because 3 out of the 4 of us were very fascinated and interested in what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time and interest in our story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) Austin, Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found her to be exceptionally objective and cogent in her description.

It appeared to be hovering.  Three of us were talking and I observed it and brought it to the attention of the others.  The object stayed for approximately 5 more minutes and then slowly left north.  We were in such shock that we didn&#39;t think about taking digital photos.  There was only one object in the sky, it did not make any sounds or transmit any light but it just seemed to glow and take off after we all saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So taking advantage of the clear skies over the weekend. We sat in lawnchairs in the driveway next to the side door of our house. Our house is about 6 to 8 houses from the lake, which gives us clearer skies away from city light. These things we see show up very often. They enter the sky or into view like a slow meteor getting brighter from yellow-brown to white-yellow. It got no larger or brighter than venus. It becomes visable directly over head going north. It also fades slowly in and out of brightness. From dim to bright to dim again, it takes about 10 seconds. It does this 4 times, while traveling a little slower than a satalite, until it goes out completely at an 45 degre angle from the horizon. I seem to see many of these things lately with different paths going north most of the time. When they come from the north, and become visable aroung the same angle to the horizon, they always stop when dim for about 10 to 20 minutes and go back north while doing their pulsing til they go out at the usual angle some where over the lake. Fiance and saw 4 of them last weekend at 1:00 to 1:45. I saw an intensly bright one on 5/5/2003 at 23:30 doing the same things exept for how bright it became visable. It got brigt enough to just make my eyes squint, but able to see it begin to light up the trees, house, lawn, everything around, way more than the moon can. I&#39;ve seen many satalites before, and they don&#39;t fade flicker or stop. They just keep going. Has anyone seen these things?<n>

These objects were pretty small when first appearing but as they raced east over our head they became very bright as they dissapeared over the eastern horizon past the mountain. They were moving at an unbelievable speed and were in the shape of a triangle, one very bright in the center, 2 spaced side by side behind it, and two more spaced wider in the back. I have seen meteors in the past, maybe these were a broken up meteor, but they were moving at a steady pace not to far from the ground. probably 10-20 miles up.

One large ball of flame and 3 smaller blue diamond shaped flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unidentified aerial event at night.  We are located almost between Cleveland and Akron, Ohio. There was no cloud cover at this time. At a bonfire our neighbor pointed to the northern horizon where we saw a large orange ball of flame, much like a meteor, moving across the sky surrounded/trailed by 3 smaller blue flames that looked like the signatures of fighter jets.  They were moving extremely fast from west to what may have been east by southeast. Based on our position it appeared as if it could have come from northwest of Cleveland but that is hard to say.  We all moved to the next yard to get a better look and it appeared as if the blue flames were slowly moving position around the orange ball of flame much like an escort. The orange ball of flame appeared to keep a straight path while moving across the sky.  After about 5-10 minutes it disappeared in the southeast sky from where it came into our view.  It didn&#39;t appear that any of the objects were coming downward at all but stayed at the same height.  We heard no engine noises from these objects even though they were very prominent. About 10 minutes after we lost sight of the objects a loud jet flew by heading in the same direction. The discouraging thing is that we didn&#39;t have a video camera nearby and there was nothing on the local news about over the next two days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would be nice to find out what the heck that was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pointed it out, and noticed 4 other objects.  The objects were at a very high altitude, they were north of us, probably above Pontiac Michigan, travelling east.  Within approximatly 30 seconds, they had travelled from my first sighting, on a west-east track and out of sight.  Approximatly 40 to 60 nm in distance.  The objects were in a formation with 2 objects above and to the left of 2 other objects  with one object in the centre, but at a lower altitude.  The lower object was the brightest and most defined.  They looked like a shooting star, with a defined, and bright white tail.  However, unlike a shooting star they didn&#39;t burn out, and were at an amazing speed.  No sound at all was apparant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For these objects to cover this distance in this time period, they would have to be travelling in excess of Mach 7.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a high knowlege of aviation, and this defies any conventional explanation except for: space junk re-entering the atmosphere, MIRVs, but it is definatly a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As the object approached closer it appeared to be in the upper atmosphere and began to appear like it was breaking up, much like the pictures of the space shuttle.  The 2 objects became 9 streaking objects that passed directly overhead in a period of about 15 seconds, and having crossed the entire night sky from west to east in that time.  The objects covered an area of approx. 20% of the night sky while looking straight up at them.  I have not seen any news on this event and wonder if anyone else knows what it was or saw it!

They traveled soundlessly from horizon to horizon, from the northwest to the southeast. There were four total. The brightest one was approximately the size of a pea held at arm&#39;s length and shown with a greenish, hazy light (approximately 2 or 3 times the brightness of Sirius -- without the haze surrounding the object, it would have been much brighter). Approximately half a degree to the right (SW) of the brightest object, two smaller, dimmer objects flew along side, one behind the other close enough that the second one seemed to fly inside the trail of the leading object. A fourth object flew to the left (NE) of the bright one; it was perhaps 4 standard magnitudes dimmer than the brightest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four objects traveled at a uniform, unchanging speed relative both to the ground and to each other (they never changed formation), and all four left a long trail behind them (approximately 4 degrees long), narrow at the emission point and fanning out much as an aircraft contrail does. None of them blinked or winked in any fashion and burned steadily for their entire transit across the sky. Their speed was much slower than the standard streaking &#34;shooting star&#34; but still 300-500 mph faster than a typical high-altitude jet liner. As mentioned earlier, they made no noise. It is difficult to estimate altitude but I would guess it to be somewhere between 10,000 to 30,000 feet (but this is could be very wrong). They traveled approximately 20 degrees to the north of the zenith (they passed close to the two &#34;pointer&#34; stars of Ursa Major, through the &#34;bowl&#34; of Ursa Minor, through the coil of Draco, into Cygnus near the star Deneb, and into Delphinus before disappearing behind a hill).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know these were most likely meteors, but I thought I would send a report just in case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of re-entering space debris.

The objects had luminous trails like meteors but the objects continued across the sky never fading out.  The brightness was consistent not strobing or dimming.  They continued on beyond the horizon.  The objects moved incedibly fast, not as fast as a meteor but much faster than an airliner of which I saw several preceeding the event.  Their speed did not alter any.  I was in my recliner chair enjoying the cool clear evening sky watching the stars, the moon, and airliners that cross frequently over my house.  I first saw the unkowns when they were almost overhead.  They crossed the sky in only about 7 to 10 seconds.  They seemed high up- about the altitude airlines fly.  But hard to judge.  Just after I saw two satellites which moved much slower than the three unknowns.  The satellites were the typical faint white.  I very carefully listed for noise/sound from the nknowns...cupped my hands around my ears to hear better.  They were absolutely silent.  I live in a rural area; it was very quiet at the time.  One of the objects was considerably brighter than the other two.  The brightest object was not quite as bright as Arcturus.  The two dimmer objects about as bright as Polaris.  All were reddish in color.  The trails were reddish also.  The trails did not remain visible.  I heard several dogs bark 20 or so seconds after the objects dissapeared over the horizon.  They were quiet before the sighting.  Were any known American or Russian satellites undergoing orbital decay to enter atmosphere over Waterloo/Chelsea Michigan (about twenty miles west of Ann Arbor) tonight?  A satellite breaking up reentering earth&#39;s atmosphere seems the only logical explanation.  This sighting was a first for me, I have never seen anything like this.  It was very unusual though that I could not hear any sound eminating from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of re-entering space debris.  PD))<n>

Lauderdale Airport and the Atlantic Ocean, and I&#39;m used to seeing helicopters closeby and jets approaching from the west and taking off to the east, over the ocean. Light planes are also fairly common to see; I&#39;m never surprised to see them and they&#39;re very recognizable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today, however, I saw a cylindrical object moving across the sky to my immediate west. At first I thought it was a jetliner, but several things about it stood out. First, it was headed north, which would eventually take it into the path of inbound traffic to FLL; secondly, I could not determine its altitude. It was also moving at a peculiar orientation, i.e., it appeared to be rising slightly but its nose seemed to be pitched slightly downward. Most significantly, I couldn&#39;t see any wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shy had scattered clouds, but none of any size - the sky was (and is now) a bright blue. I blinked my eyes and turned my head away for about two seconds, and when I looked back it had vanished. I jumped up and went out on my balcony (I&#39;m on the 24th floor with a panoramic view), but couldn&#39;t find it anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Later at 8pm, they both re-appeared in the West, moving back and forth and up and down. They appeared with &#34;wish&#34; or /pre-dandelion plant-like objects, but I quickly noticed the far distance between the two, and thought that the ufos were trying to distract possible viewers. Than one of them increased in size and brightness, than a short time later reduced itself to its original size. A short time after that, they both disapeared into the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was traveling west on Ave C Channelview, Texas at 04:15AM on 06/26/2004, going to work at a local plant.  The object was round, turquoise light blue in color and glowing brightly.  It appeared for about two to three seconds stationary, then moved Northward, on an incline, at a high rate of speed, with what looked like a white propulsion trail behind it.  It disappeared in about four second, it didn&#39;t move out of sight, the light when out!  The sky was partly cloudy, the clouds was high.  The object appeared below the clouds, it hard to gauge the height in the air at night, it was well above the tree line.  It look to be a few miles to the South of me.  When it appeared it light the night sky.  When it appeared I was thinking, there is a meteor, until I noticed that it wasn&#39;t moving and the size of the object was to big.  When I got to work, others coming to work saw the same object.  There was people working outside at work that saw the same object.  There was one witness at work, said he seen the object in the sky before it light up.  I didn&#39;t talk to this person, he had talked the the person I relieved at work (whom had also seen the lighted object).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

But, it was moving too slowly for an airplane.  And, it did not have any of the warning lights common to an airplane.  The object moved very slowly from north to south.  It was moving in a straight and level manner.  It did not twist and turn at all.  As I watched, the object slowed down to almost a stop.  At that point, I was convinced it was not an airplane.  The object was just west of the town of Bolivar.  It was moving parallel to 13 highway.  It had the appearance of a small airplane flying approximately 2000 feet above the ground.  I was standing on the east side of 13 highway and it was on the west side.  It appeared to be less than one mile away and approximately 40 to 45 degrees above the horizon.  There was some shimmering.  But, not much.  After about 10 or 15 seconds, the object sped up to its original speed.  It continued to travel south for about another 20 seconds.

It was definately too small to be an airplane at the low altitude it looked to be at, and what really caught my attention was how fast it was traveling and the fact that it changed position in the sky as it traveled through a low-hanging cloud, then dissapeared behind some trees (total viewing time was 2-4 seconds).  I drove up the block to see if it was maybe a plane, and I then I could explain what I saw but I was not able to view anything in the sky.  Another wierd aspect is the direction in which it was traveling, it traveled from east to west in a slight downward motion, I live about 20-25 miles northwest of the airport and we have planes travel over this area all the time, but I have never ever seen anything that looked like, or traveled like that in anyway. The next day, Saturday, I was telling my dad, who lives in the same area, what I had seen and he was totally shocked because he said that he actually seen something earlier that morning (Saturday) that was almost exactly what I had described...

The dim object was traveling in a straight line to the north east at a very fast speed compaired to the speed of the commercial aircraft in the sky.I observed the object for approx. 45 seconds to one minute.After that amount of time, the light in the object went out and i could no longer see the object.After seeing this i light up a smoke and was scanning the sky looking for more objects. after a few minutes of scanning the sky, i saw another dim lit object in the northern sky heading striaght to the south.The object appeared to be at about the same altitude as the first object I had seen a few minutes earlier. The object was dimmly lit, and while moving to the south,this object was zig zagging and stopping in mid flight and the moving again.

We finally stopped and decided to video the 3 objects from a stationary position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:50 PM, we stopped along the side of the highway to videotape the objects when we noticed that they had broken their formation.

I got some really good detailed footage of the two objects since the digital camera I was using has 240X digital zoom. As I focused in on one object to get more detail, the other one took off. What happened next I failed to get on video  but we also saw what appeared to be a rectangular shaped ship.  (Or a portion of a ship which was siver or gray but it was only a partial view)  For those star trek fans out there it appeared to have a holodeck look to it.  Like when you can see a portion of the holodeck when a majority of it still held the particular hologram it was projecting.  It was also masked behind what looked like clouds.  This occured for a few seconds then it too dissapeared.  A few seconds later the last ship also appeared to vanish. This ocurred about 10:52PM PST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then got back in the truck and continuerd to drive when we noticed that they had appeared back in the horizon.  This was at 11:02PM PST, we pulled over again to video the objects in which all three were back but in different formation all together. Two of the objects were side by side and the third was now quite a distance from the others. We continued to capture the event until 11:04PM PST when we finally got back to the drive to Phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I managed to get some great footage of the sighting and am amazed at the detail of the objects captured.  They changed not only dimension during our filming but also it seemed that they changed in composition.  What appeared to be a fireball one second changed to a flashing orb like object to finally almost a gaseous compostion, in which you can see it is definately a rounded object but also that their is definate light and that they are traveling in a circular motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I approached the window a sudden flash of light caught my attention.  As I looked out towards the woods, I saw a perfect circle of concentrated bright light (just slight glow or haze on &#34;edges&#34;)  The size at this time was about pea size. I was in awe and thinking &#34;what the heck is this..if it is a plane in trouble, it will hit our house too&#34;....the bright circle of condensed light grew larger and appeared to be approaching me in a direct line, or direct &#34;hit&#34;...the size grew almost twice it&#39;s size before just &#34;blinking out&#34;.  The color of light was a mix of &#34;white hot&#34; white...almost a blue/white, some yellow and some orangish/red combination...all mixed together.  My back yard adjoins a meadow and spans about 1 1/2 acres to a wooded area and &#34;the world&#39;s largest&#34; sandstone quarries.   No other houses or people in this area.(behind us)  I do not know how far away it was, as this happened so quickly and it was dark outside, but the sky still had a blue tinge.  The next morning I looked out at the area and thought that perhaps this light was about 1 acre away and less than twice the height of the tree tops. This area is still &#34;country&#34;, and still a village, even though it has developed a bit since my child hood.  Growing up in this area, I have experienced and witnessed many strange &#34;encounters&#34;, sometimes alone, sometimes with people.  I also noticed that at this time, I heard dogs barking in the woods.  I had an uneasy feeling that it &#34;blinked out&#34; when it &#34;saw&#34; me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw it up above the tree&#39;s as I turned onto 229 and the noticeable thing about it was how big it was compared to any other kind of aircraft in fligth. It was glowing and looked like it was made of a platinum like metal. It didn&#39;t move for a while as I was driving it just stayed in the same spot. Then as i pulled in and got some binoculars it flashed and flashed off. I had seen airplanes at nigth and all there planes had flashing ligths but this was brigth almost like a second moon and a little lower than the cloud line. It   disapeared when it looked like a plane was headed for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They appeared to her &#34;like angels or ghosts in the sky, but they were not.&#34; She noticed them for about 5 to 10 minutes. They seemed to be zig zaging and figure eighting around in the sky. Strangely enough there was a wind storm passing by at the same time. The lights were just white. My wife and I are Nurses by trade. My wife Heidi is a very concrete thinker and hates anything sci-fi. So when she told me about what she saw, she beleived them to only be helicopters. She asked if I had seen them. I did not see the lights or hear any noises loud enough to be a helicopter. According to my wife there was no special features or haze or beams emmitting from the lights. They were just lights to her. I asked if the lights looked like they were comming from the ground. She said no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I SAW 2 WHITE LIGHTS, PERHAPS A MATCH HEAD IN SIZE AT ARMS LENGTH, FLYING IN UNISON AND TRAVELING FROM EAST TO WEST NORTH OF I-40.  THE LIGHTS APPEARED TO COME OUT OF NOWHERE IN THE EAST NEAR MORIARTY, N.M., AND SEEMED TO COVER THE DISTANCE BETWEEN MORIARTY AND THE SANDIA MOUNTAINS IN ABOUT 8-9 SECONDS, A DISTANCE OF 20 MILES, AND WITH NO SOUND WHATSOEVER.  THE TWO LIGHTS WERE INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER AND WERE BLINKING-LIKE FLASH/FLASH, 2 TIMES, WITH ABOUT 2 SECONDS BETWEEN THE 2 FLASHES.  A FEW SECONDS AFTER FIRST SEEING THE LIGHTS IN FLIGHT THEY WENT ALMOST STRAIGHT UP SEVERAL DEGREES AND THEN ALMOST STRAIGHT DOWN.  BUT, STRANGELY, THEN IN A MATTER OF SECONDS LATER ONE LIGHT CAME TO A FULL STOP WHILE THE OTHER LIGHT WENT ON AHEAD AT A VERY FAST SPEED.  A FEW SECONDS PASSED WHEN SUDDENLY THE SECOND LIGHT ZOOMED AT A VERY HIGH SPEED TO CATCH UP WITH THE FIRST LIGHT.  BOTH LIGHTS APPEARED TO RISE OVER THE SANDIA MOUNTAIN RANGE AND INTO THE CLOUDS OVER THE MOUNTAINS WHEREBY THEY WERE NO LONGER VISIBLE.  THE PEAK OF THE SANDIA MOUNTAIN IS ABOUT 10,600 FEET SO IT IS LIKELY THE LIGHTS WERE BELOW THAT LEVEL IN HAVING TO RISE TO CLEAR THE MOUNTAIN RANGE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A LITTLE MATH AND A FEW FIGURES.  THE ALTITUDE OF MORIARTY IS 6200 FEET AND THAT OF THE SANDIA MOUNTAIN PEAK IS 10,600 FEET, AN ALTITUDE DIFFERENCE OF ABOUT 4400 FEET.  THE 2 LIGHTS COULD HAVE BEEN TRAVELING LIKELY BETWEEN 2500 AND 3500 FEET AND THEN RISING WELL OVER 10,600 FEET INTO THE MOUNTAIN CLOUDS.  THE DISTANCE BETWEEN MORIARTY AND CEDAR CREST, AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAINS, IS ABOUT 20 MILES.  THE 2 LIGHTS WERE IN VIEW FOR ABOUT 8-9 SECONDS BUT -- LET&#39;S SAY 10 SECONDS.  WITH 3600 SECONDS IN AN HOUR, DIVIDED BY 10 SECONDS FOR 20 MILES IS 3600/10=360 X 20 IS 7200 MPH FOR A PROBABLE ESTIMATED SPEED OF THE LIGHTS.  THE SPEED COULD HAVE LIKELY BEEN EVEN HIGHER.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object slowly rose higher in the sky, then moved right to left steadily. Object stopped high in sky and held position for approx. 10 minutes. At one point the object seemed to rotate or turn because the sun reflecting off it blinked. Object then moved steadily and fairly fast given it&#39;s height, this time from left to right. At that point 2 other objects which also appeared to be black spheres approached the first sphere from different points and took a triangle formation. The 3 objects moved slowly away from and then towards each other while still creating a triangle shape, then moved in their original formation steadily to the north and out of sight. The objects were very high in the sky, hard to find at times. Another witness (my friend) with better eyes then myself (I wear contacts) could see them more consistanly as they moved away. My 13 year old son also witnessed the event. There was no sound or contrails present.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our house is under the flight paths for both D/FW Int. Airport and the joint reserve base in Fort Worth, so we often hear and see jets. I was facing northwest when I heard the noise. I looked over my shoulder to the south and saw a very bright white contrail (or smoke trail), very dense and wide, extending from the south heading directly north. Airliners never travel in this path -- they always go east-west or west-east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I visually followed the contrail north until I spotted what initially looked like an airliner, EXCEPT IT HAD NO WINGS. The object and its contrail were higher than the clouds. The object had little fins at the back end like a missile. The contrail was much wider than the object. After about 20 seconds, the object faded out of view. At this point, I went into the house to get my 30-year-old daughter. She came outside and we both saw the contrail still clearly visible in the sky. The trail was slowly fanning out. However, we could both see that the trail started and ended abruptly. We took digital photos of the contrail, which show that it was above the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After taking the photos, I called my husband -- an ex-Air Force pilot -- to tell him about the object. He had no idea what it was. That night, he asked me to draw a picture of the object. The next morning, at work, he showed the drawing and photos of the contrail to his ex-fighter pilot buddies. None of them knew what it was, but all of them said it looked like a missile. They had no idea what kind of missile, but it must&#39;ve been huge based on its altitude. The object was too large to be a missile from an F-16 and there are no nearby launch facilities for other types of missiles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what airliners and fighter jets look like. This was neither. I have photos of the contrail and a drawing of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While I tried to snap some stills I ran in to grab my video camera which I put on a tripod and just filmed in the direction that we spotted the orbs. In reviewing the video there is two very visable white orbs that appear from the trail and then accelerate at an unbelievable rate of speed. The video has trees in the background, has birds that fly in the blurfo and one lense refraction. The orbs are none of these and the video is amazing as it shows it pop up out of the trail and then make a right angle exit that defies belief.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a craft, oval shaped (boomerrange) with rounded ends, he said it was partially cloked.  it was traveling north approx. 300 mph and approx. 1 mile high. he thinks it was a mining vessel. an airliner flew in the vicinity and you could tell the difference.  as i tracked the craft through the sky i began to also see molecules moving in the air.  the craft looked like a puffy white cloud,like other clouds in the sky that day, but obviosly was not.  you could tell by the way it was traveling it was not a cloud. then it blended into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Small tubular craft! Burn marks!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange dream last night. Here is what I can remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside with a friend at night in a sidewalk cafe in Los Angeles. I was looking at the stars and noticed that there were more than usual. Then, these small, what appeared to be remote drone planes flew by with no pilots. They were probably 3 feet in length...white, and very tubular in shape. I yelled, &#34;Look at these!!&#34; and that&#39;s when the sidewalk was invaded by men dressed in black, with guns coming from everywhere. They were herding us all together and there were hundreds of people now on the street, screaming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then something odd happened; they were shouting orders and threatening to &#34;put a button in everyone&#39;s neck&#34; but the man in charge was looking straight at me. I was freaked!  He should have known that I already had one, but he shot this gun at me that didn&#39;t have bullets; it had some type of electrical-tingly sensation instead...not pain...but it most definitely got me to stop in my tracks and pay attention!  Then he came up with this long, round tube about a foot long, and 2 inches in diamter and put it to my left eye.  Next thing I know is it Puffed into my left eye.I was SO scared.  I didn&#39;t know what he had just done to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People were still screaming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t hold on to much more of the dream, but I stayed awake all night once it woke me up because I didn&#39;t want to forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I did wake up, however, in the morning saw 2 very visible &#34;burn&#34; marks on me, one on the wrist, and one on my upper arm, at a diagonal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have only taken pics today, at your advice, on 7-1-04,...they have faded somewhat, but are still there.  I don&#39;t know why I did not take photos for a week!  I have a scar on my tail bone from a few years ago, and then, too, like this week, I did not think of documenting it!  How strange indeed!  There was NO pain associated with these burns, and that is what I call them because they were very red, and looked like I had put my arm and wrist to a hot coal, or seomthing similar.  However, I had NOT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We usually do not include dreams, and dream-related information, in the database, but we make an exception here because of a second, seemingly independent, report from Lafayette, CA, for the same date.

Our house is on the very top of a hill and the side facing most of contra costa county is all windows and sliding glass doors.  I was seated facing the windows.  Suddenly, the tree&#39;s outside lit up with an extremely bright white flash.  At first I thought it ust be lightning. Then 10 seconds later the was another bright white flash that lit up the tree&#39;s.  My girlfriend also saw the second white flash and we immediatly walked over to the window to see what was happening.  Not more than 5 seconds after looking out the window we both saw a bright green light lighting up the tree&#39;s and moving straight up towards the sky.  We both ran outside to get a better look.  We saw an aircraft hovering above the tree&#39;s for about 3 seconds and it then shot straight up into the sky and dissapeared.  When we were outside the green light emitted from the aircraft was so bright we could not tell what shape it was. We watched the sky for another 3 minutes and saw nothing so we returned inside.  What puzzled both of us is that once inside we noticed the stereo had turned on as well as the ceiling fan. There was no one else in the house! My girlfriends cellphone started ringing and was called 5 times in approxamately 3 minutes.  Everytime she picked up the phone she just got a dialtone.  Each of the 5 times her phone was called the caller i.d. just show the number ***.  Three star signs, thats it.  We both know what we saw and we were not drinking that night. I was not a full believer in ufos before this incident, but what we saw outside and then electronice in my house getting turned on and my girlfriends phone getting called with the number (***) haschanged my mind.

She was the first one to notice the object, then myself. It was just a speckle of light in the sky, starting off as a pinkish light then pulsing to red. The object would have appeared like a normal aircraft, except that this one slowed down to almost a stop then sped up again. We watched it for maybe 20-30 Seconds before it abruptly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/23/04 02:30|London (Canada)|ON|Light|5 Minutes|Star like, rapidly changing colours, pulsating, high speed movement, very high up ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??

I was well rewarded with a few streaking meteors, and several flashes.  During a lull I started looking in the west-northwest sky and an object about the size and brightness of venus (maybe not quite as bright) caught my eye.  My initial thought was &#34;wow, that&#39;s a really hyper twinkling star&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eye on it and noticing it was changing colour rapidly.  Almost &#34;pulsing&#34; you could say.  Seemed like there might be a pattern to it.  Then it suddenly stopped changing colours and stated sort of a blue-ish hue.  It suddenly zoomed over to a new location.  If you extend your arm, and hold your hand up to the sky and measure approx. 3 inches from your thumb to your pointing finger, that was the distance it moved in approx. 1 second.  It left a faint streak momentarily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That move seemed to be straight towards the north.  Then it stopped and then moved again, same distance, but this time seemed to be going down, or possibly East.  It was hard to tell because it seems to be at a great distance.  I would not be surprised if it&#39;s not even in our atmosphere.  (hard to guess without having any idea of it&#39;s size)  This was my very first UFO sighting.  I have always had an open mind to the possibility, but without actually seeing one with my own eyes I could never totally believe it.  I wish they would just land on the white house lawn and end all the charades.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out again tonight and saw the exact same object, same time of night, same general area of the sky.  Except instead of doing an upside down L in the sky, it seems to sort of just zig zag, and at one point did 2 circles.  Cloud cover obscured my view after only 5 minutes of watching it tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suspect that anyone with a clear sky around 02:30 Eastern time will be able to see it.  It seems to be a regular visitor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the possibility that the witness is observing a &#34;twinkling&#34; star would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that he was observing a UFO.

It looked as if it might be moving so I watched it longer.  It travelled to the West (about 3 hand widths). At this point I figured it was a satellite.  However, then it moved to the North and then to the East and then sporadically in all directions (though only about 2 or 3 hand-widths at a time).  I stayed watching it as long as I could (7 Mins?) before I retired for the evening.  Never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed.

The sound was coming from arround the bend of the path. I crept up to the bend and stopped probally about a 200 hundred feet away from what appeared to be a  dark colored sphere like object that appeared to be hovering only a few feet above the water. It moved back and forth across the width of the canal for about 2 minutes and then all of a sudden it illuminated a flash of vibrant colors.I could only pick out white,purple,red and maybe blue also. It began to rise slowly and it hovered for another 10 or 15 seconds, then the noise it made grew louder and the sphere lit up with a yellow glow and all of a sudden another sphere rose up from above the trees and hovered for about maybe 10 seconds and then the two spheres suddenly just darted upwards and faded from sight or possibly got to a certain elevation shut the lights off. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it in my life. I may be 17 but I know what I saw, there may have been others who&#39;ve seen it as well but not that I know of. There is many houses arround the area and the part of the path I was on has a thick barrier of trees and then there is a housing track, as well as houses accross the canal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Around 01:50 pst I noticed a group of stars in my windshield with one very bright one I took to be a planet. As I studied the &#34;planet&#34; trying to figure out which planet it was.  I realized that light was much closer and in our atmosphere. I ran several possibilities through my head thinking it might be an airplane but when light finally went out there were no other lights visible i.e. navigation, strobes.  I then thought it might be a streetlamp on the mountain but as I looked I could see silhoutte of the mountain did not touch the light so I shifted position in my seat checking to see if it might be a reflection in the glass but light remained steady through the glass.  As I was watching the light it then dimmed in intensity  3 or 4 times then went out completely then a smaller light winked on briefly then it to went out. I did not see it anymore after that.  I must note there was also a meteor shower that night but the intensity of light was much, much more than any meteor I witnessed.  I cannot tell you the altitude but I can tell you the light was 50 to 60 degrees up in the sky and at my 2 o&#39;clock position as noted from my position on hiway at exit 80 overpass.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was 1 very bright one and 3 smaller ones. At first I thought it was a satelite or something, but it had an unnatural way of speeding up and slowing down, not drasticly but enough to notice with the eye. The lights also gathered together fairly close in the sky at times and spread out again. And would travel in one direction for a while before curving back at a very sharp turn into another direction. Cloud cover finally blocked them out and I had to pack it in around 3 am when they were lost.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing I could think of would be able to travel with no com trail, no blinking lights, so far up in the sky they&#39;re mere dots, zig zagging and changing direction so quickly and with no sounds or anything.

My roommate and I were sitting on our patio when I noticed a base-ball sized dimly glowing object in the sky directly above my house (My patio is on the roof).   I immediately told my roomate to look up, he saw it instantly as it was clearly visible to the both of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was circular, glowing a very dim white light. I couldn&#39;t make out any other physical details other than its circular shape. It passed directly over us, moving in a westwardly direction along dupont avenue making a number of amazing turning maneouvers and moving at a seemingly incredible rate.  After about 10-15 seconds it was on the western horizon no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing made absolutely no sound. When I first caught a glipse of it in my periphery, I assumed that it was a bird or something similar, because of the way it was gently flopping around in the sky and thelack of noise.

I glanced upwards at the stars and, directly above me, I saw what I thought must be a satellite moving in a northerly direction, but much faster than any satellite I&#39;ve seen previously, perhaps three or four times as fast as I would normally expect. It had the appearance of a star, in magnitude about halfway between the brightness of Venus and the dimmest naked eye star. I continued to watch it and, to my surprise, after about five seconds the object made an abrupt wide turn to the left, turning enough to reverse its course momentarily and then turned back again. The turns weren&#39;t particularly smooth and there seemed to be a variation in speed, although I&#39;m no longer sure about that. The object resumed a straight course at an even speed (same speed as at first sighting taking greater distance into account) about ten degrees to the right of its original course. When it reached about forty five degrees above the horizon I lost it in the city haze. Had I seen it at that point I again would have assumed that it was a satellite. I know what high flying aircraft look like. I&#39;ve seen high altitude weather balloons during the day. I&#39;ve seen birds flying high with city lights reflecting off their wings. I see meteors periodically. This looked like a satellite, other than the movement and the speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I could view the night sky from northeast to southeast.  I was facing north, northeast and talking with my grilfriend at the time.  It was a warm, clear evening.  I am an amateur atronomer and I am quite familliar with the nightime sky.  It is probably due to my knowledge that I noticed a star that was not only in the wrong spot , but the brightest, celestial object I had ever witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright, shiny, white light.  As soon as I focused my attention on it, the light seemed to have dissapeared.  I however was able to adjust my vision quickly enough to notice two smaller points of light where the original bright spot was.  The two smaller points seemed to be at quite a high altitude, as a rough comparason for altitude, I would figure slightly lower than most orbital ranges for satellites.  They were positioned in a 45 deg. angle (see bottom for position diagram).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The points reconverged and diverged one last time.  One point went northwest and the other went south.  The point that went northwest, I lost track of when it flew in front of Orion&#39;s belt.  The point travelling south I watched for about 4 minutes until it veered southeast and it faded out of sight.  The speed seemed obviously faster compared to orbiting satellite speeds. No sound of any type was detected by anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Position diagram:        . (point #1)   .

The object seemed to fade, then disappear when it reached about the centerpoint of the skyline. Moments later I began to observe at least three smaller objects move in irregular patterns in small regions of the sky surrounding the spot where the first object disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to say what shape the objects were, but they definitely appeared solid and light reflective. They were at about a 40-50 degree angle in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The altitude appeared to be about the same as a commercial jet liner would fly in. These were no ordinary craft as they appeared to change both altitde and range in jerky and sometimes shaky motions. They exhibited zig-zag patterns, back and forth motions, rounded or circular fire-fly like flight patterns. They changed directions at will and at an incredible speed. Considering their distance, and comparing with the speed of a commercial jet airliner, I would say unhesitatingly that the were capable of hovering, then traveling at several thousand miles per hour and making a 180 degree flight change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to hold their patterns in a region of the sky as if committed to that area. There was some kind of a haze around these objects. No sound could be heard at any point, including the original large, lower flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I brought my wife and 18 year old daughter outside and they too sat in chairs and agreed that they saw the objects and that there was irregular, freakish, awesome movement. We then began noticing that several more bigger, brighter objects similar to the first object I sighted were traveling across the sky. Two went south to north together. Others went seperately in a southerly direction. These sightings were followed by the prescence of many more of these smaller objects, all with jerky, rocking, up-down, fire-fly, incredibly fast speeds/ changes. It was hard to say how many total craft there were  but it was starting to seem intimidating. My wife, in fact, found it important to rationalize these away as military aircraft defending us from terrorists.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are a professional couple with excellent reputations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will telephone the witnesses and attempt to establish whether the objects might have been satellites.

They did not twenkle like stars,just solid steady lights. I tried again to find them with my telescope (my spotter is durty and out of focus) I looked up with my naked eye to see how close I was and one of them was gone, that was about 20:40, it was only then that I noticed Jupiter was visable, I had no problem finding it with my telescope, then turned back to the last object looked at it then into the spotter scope again, still couldn&#39;t see, then look again with my naked eye and it was gone too, at aprox 20:45.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light then hovered and I noticed a brighter white light in the middle of the red light.  It then moved slowly over the house about 200 feet up and went out over the trees.  We then noticed three additional lights hovering above some trees in the front yard about 50 yards out and 2 or 300 feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pointed this out saying &#34;Look at that satilite book it&#34;. Soon after a large plan (looked like a jumbo jet based on wing profile) coming from north heading in a south direction (probably towards Victoria Airport)  The dot suddenly changed its course so now it was moving infront of the plan heading south as well at a slightly faster pace. The dot continued to move infront of the plan then suddenly made a sharp 90 degree turn so now it was heading west again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It preceded to make several erractic turns, one being another 90 degree turn and second being a wide curve. After doing this and moving its self a good 1/3 of the visable sky (from out point of view) it proceded to head in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds of this it started to zig zag back and forth, almost 1 to 2cm from our point of view. It was now heading about south west. It did a couple more small turns but seemed to continue on its new heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the dot suddenly moved out of view (while the plane being far away is yet still visable) and was gone. This happened all in about 1 to 2 minutes and was rather astounding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Orginaly posted by me at ufocity.com on the night of the sighting)<n>

It then started moving east still blinking until it was almost right over us. The shape could be made out as a sphere with blinking rotating lights on the sides. The rate at which it moved across the sky was incredibly fast. It soon became out of sight as it had moved right.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We observed several bright lights hovering in the southwest sky. first there were 2 lights that looked  like huge street lights.  they were amber colored and  flickered brillantly in the night sky. then we saw another set of lights multiply from the first two and then two more from the four.there were  six alltogether and a seventh appeared a little further away from the six. they would stay on for 3-4 mins. then they would dissapear like dim away. just seconds later.. further west over near the tonopah area two more lights appeared. these were atleast 20 miles apart from the set of six that we saw in the estrella mountain sky. First one light came on then quickly went off then another light right next to it. if I had to explain it in detail i would say imagine a tractor truck in the sky and it&#39;s tail lights are what show as it is leaving  going west, well the tail lights being the distance from one &#34;Light to another &#34; is how far apart these lights were to each other. while the other lights are far east more again near the estrella mountain they are a pretty great distance apart in my opinion to be flares or anything military operated. weird as this is we saw them appear and disappear for 3 hours changing location and traveling slowly west toward the palo verde nuclear power plant (while in the off mode of course.) the lights as we saw would vibrate and dance next to eachother and even  seem to colide as if generating energy from one another as to multiply. these lights have been here since we moved in to our new house in May of this year 2004. what are they? nobody seems to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought the light was coming from outside because there are a lot of cars and cross signs around here.  The light lasted for about 3 seconds.  The object looked round, kind of like a disk.  The light was so bright that it was beaming below the craft making the object look bigger than it actually was, kind of like a jellyfish with it&#39;s body hanging below it.  Since it happened so quick I didn&#39;t really pay as much mind to it.  About 2 minutes later I saw a clearer craft.  It was the same shape and the lights were even brighter red.  Both objects seemed far away but very visible.  The second craft kind of floated around like it didn&#39;t know where to go and then it just disappeared so fast.  It was like one minute it was there so clearly and the next it was gone.  I couldn&#39;t even follow it.  It didn&#39;t fly straight either.  It seemed pretty wobbly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was talking to my wife and daughter when I tilted my head back to stretch, and this triangular shape craft was moving from south to north direction, quietly,without much effort. I witnessed it for about 3 seconds, then it went behind the house and I lost contact. It was triangular in shape with a black leading edge, and lighter gray color inboard, with dim white lights at each corner of the lighter gray surface, I don,t know whats its elavation was, but I could see very good detail, about the size of 3/4 full moon. This machine was mechanically and materially beautiful, I have seen up close and in flight all kinds of aircraft,F-14s,F-15 eagles,F-16 falcons,B-1s,B-2s, B-52s, B-58 hustlers,SR-71s, but this craft sent chills up my spine,because of its triangular shape , mechanical and composite beauty. I do believe this is very similar to the Belgium sightings in the 1990&#39;s that I have seen and read about.

He was standing outside at approximately 23:15 hrs., when his attention was suddenly drawn to a very bizarre looking, triangular shaped object in the night sky.  It immediately captured his attention, not only because of its bizarre appearance, but because of the amount of the night sky that it covered in the approximately 2 seconds that he was witness to the object.  The witness estimated that the object traversed an arc of approximately 90 degrees in those two seconds, and it was totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness added that the object did not have the normal red and green navigation lights, required on conventional aircraft during flight at night.  Moreover, he stated that the &#34;edges&#34; of the triangle appeared to be &#34;dark,&#34; and the center portion of the triangle appeared to him to be &#34;empty,&#34; or more lightly colored than the periphery.  The witness estimated that the apparent size of the object, from his vantage point, was three-quarters the size of the Moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Atmospheric conditions at the time were clear, and visibility unlimited (CAVU), with no clouds visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NUFORC is awaiting a written report from the witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report written by Peter Davenport, based on the telephone conversation with the witness on June 20, 2004.

Marginal Way exit, while driving north on highway 509 coming down the hill toward the First Avenue Bridge, I saw a medium size star bright lit object above me, about the altitude of 10K feet, moving from my left to my right as an extreme high rate of speed. It flew in an extreme straight line of flight direction with no slight movement, but with great accuracy in one direction.  It was flying downward at a slant toward the north end of Boeing Field just a tad before it reached that field where it made, in less than 1 second, an approximate 100 degree south-southerly turn, the white star light dropping down, like in a bank turn, to then quickly upward in a steady rise to leveling out going south toward the south end of Boeing Field, it’s speed dropping maybe 10-15 percent after that first turn. It then began to drop lower downward and slowing to about 50 percent less speed, going into a soft rounded south-west-westerly bank turn, the light dropping to the right downward then leveling up and out, for a distance of about one-fifth of a mile, then another similar sharp turn but to a sharp north-north-easterly direction for about the same distance, the light moving upward to the left and then leveling out, then another similar turn south-south-westerly for the same distance, the light moving down to the right and then leveling out, and then one more such turn but wider into a north-east-easterly direction, the light moving to the left upward and then leveling out, where it was then flew out of sight past the hill to the west of the Boeing Renton air field. I could not make out the shape of the object the light was attached to, but over the freeway I had the distinct image of it being long and narrow, but after the turns it made then more like a plane, but that could have been my eyes playing tricks with trying to attach some shape to it. It had no other lights on it. At first I thought it was a shooting star but it was ! not moving in a curve. Then I thought it was a comet, but it didn’t have a changing tail behind it – it did have a tail, but very very faint, but I knew it was too close to the earth to be a comet. Then I thought it was a meteorite since one fell near Chehalis recently. Then I thought it might have been a plane coming in for a crash or emergency landing to Boeing Field. And I also thought it might be a cruise missile or test drone craft that Boeing might be testing. I really did expect an explosion so the whole incident was quite scary causing me to quickly cross all the lanes on the freeway from the left to the right emergency lane to stop where I called 911 to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone at length, and we found him to be exceptionally credible.

Unlike any kind of aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen. They appeared to be barely visible and at an unusually high altitude for any aircraft that I am familiar with. They darted like &#34;insects across a glass window&#34; one after another about 1 minute apart, and along different paths which, in my mind, ruled out satelites. I watched for almost an hour and came back out around 12:30 am and there was no sign of them.

I have never filed a report like this before now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded quite credible to us.  However, when we explored his sightings, it seemed to us that he might have been witnessing satellites passing overhead.

There are a lot of shopping center lights and traffic lights around there, but as I was looking up and towards the west at either of the first two upcoming traffic lights - I don&#39;t remember precisely where I was along this stretch of Imperial Highway - I was startled to see a formation of lights gently angling from the southeast to the northwest, and from there, symmetrically back to the northeast.  There were about seven lights making up the south-lying line, and one or two making up the north-lying line.  There seemed to be one light at the tip, but it may have been my mind filling that spot in with a light.  It was like seeing a marqueed side and tip of a triangle pointing and possibly also moving in the sky in the same direction in which I was moving in my car.  I would estimate that the lights were located above Brea, La Habra, or Whittier.  The color of the lights was uniform - a pinkish gold, similar to street or parking lot lights.  The size of each light was not impressive - about the size of a light from an airplane or jet.  It was the formation of these lights that was startling.  The lights moved completely uniformly, causing me to think that they formed the perimeter of a dark triangular or arrow-shaped object in the sky.  The formation disappeared in a couple seconds, and did not reappear.  I called my brother on my cell phone as I arrived home because he &#34;believes in UFOs&#34; and I &#34;don&#39;t&#34;.  I decided to go back to the intersection where I turned left to see if I could reproduce the optical illusion, and he agreed, asking me to be careful driving.  I retraced my path, but the second time I saw no such formation in the sky, nor could I see how any reflections or glare from Kraemer Boulevard to Placentia Avenue, looked anything like the formation I undoubtedly saw earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(The tent has two air vents at the top that you can look through to the stars) we were talking, and we saw what at first we thought was a plane, because it was red. But then it faded to white, then brite blue. But not one big light, it looked like several little lights in the shape of a triangle. We watched it dart across the skyand then hoover for a few minutes. It looked like it was rotating, like now instead of being a trianlge it was round. there were lights that would change from red to white as it spun. After a few minutes of hoovering it shot up even higher into the sky. It hoovered there for awhile, we then went inside to go tell my mom. (she didnt come out side and witness it.) when we returned to the tent it was gone. so we went back into the tent and talked for awhile. I sat up to look to see if it was back, and it was. I just laid back down and paid no more attention to it. So i am not sure how long it was in the sky. But i am checking again tonight to see if it is in the same spot again tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took approx. 60 shots of the building.  On one series of shots, I shot four shots from the same angle, but varied them by zooming in and out.  The camera used is a Nikon D100, with a 17mm to 35mm lens.  This lens is one of Nikon&#39;s better zoom lenses.  In fact it&#39;s the top of the line.  It is not prone to flare.  The digital camera is a 6mp.  On the second of the four shots, there is an object in the sky over the building.  I did not see it at the time of photography, but only noticed it when reviewing the shots.  In fact, there are several objects in the frame, as well as the other frames, but they are so small you wouldn&#39;t notice them unless I pointed them out.  None of these objects appear in any other frame, either of this building on any other that I shot that day.   What makes this image so interesting is the fact that  the object  is sun lit at exactly the correct angle.  This is not a plane or bug etc.  I reviewed the info in the camera regarding this frame, and it revealed that the shutter was at a 60th and the f stop at f11.  There is a slight blur of the object, probably due to the slow shutter.  I&#39;m am sending a jpeg to your e-mail address.  please respond.  I would like to know your opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the peculiar object is.  It is so odd, we may post it to our website.  Our first guess was that it might be a bird or insect in motion, but the object appears to have two peculiar objects projecting out of it, which seem incompatible with a terrestrial organism.

I was sitting my driveway about 4:30 a.m. local time,listening to radio, when I noticed a bluish colored starlike object moving rapidly from south to north. I assumed it was a satellite, until it began to make a swing towards the northeast. By the time I returned with 8 x 50 binoculars, it was gone. Roughly one minute later, a second, similar object appeared on the same trajectory. Through binoculars, it looked like a satellite or star. No aircraft lights were evident. The second object also turned slowly toward the northeast, dimming slightly as it did do. Initial brightness of both objects was approx. zero to first magnitude. The impression was of very fast moving objects at great altitude. Total time span was approx. 4:31 to 4:34 a.m. Ojects seemed to dim and flicker slightly as they turned.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light appeared to be still in the sky either hovering or coming directly at me.  Behind the light were the much dimmer lights of a township which helped to show the brightness of the light.  It remained in the same location for the duration of my decent down the hill approx. 1-2 mins.  I performed a u-turn and drove to the top of the hill again to see if it was still there but there was no trace of it.  I then stopped my car and opened a window to see if I could hear any sounds (for example curious to know if any familiar sounds could be heard such as a helicopter or plane) but there were no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It would go so far or turn in a way that we would lose it and then all of a sudden it would be back.  It stopped and then moved halfway across the sky. It really did some unusual moves.

I live by a major airport and under a main approach for aircraft.  I&#39;ve seen everything from actual meteor&#39;s entering the atmopshere and breaking up, to the Stealth Fighter during an airshow.  I&#39;ve read a heck of alot about the UFO Phenomenon, but never have ever seen anything other than man made and natural occurances.  I met this girl who&#39;s also a UFO believer and has had some interesting dreams.  I had considered her to possibly be an abductee, as I have a few family members who have seen UFO&#39;s and whatnot in their lifetimes.  I however have been half skeptical because of all the time I&#39;ve spent looking at the stars.. Well .. tonight things changed.  My GF saw a light which I could not crossing the sky.  I figured she was seeing a satellite.  since my eyesight is not too great I figured she was telling the truth but I ribbed her saying she was nuts.  It was the first nice clear night for a major city where the magnitude is pretty horrible.  We went into the backyard, she sat on my lap and we spent some romantic moments looking at the stars.  I told her jokingly &#34;ask the star to come back&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 3 mins another star started moving across the sky.. I had my binoculars ready and watched it .. thought wow! A satellite but it disapeared too early.  Thought that it was odd but probably fell out of the sunlight&#39;s reflection..  It had moved both from South to North across the Northern Cross.  Then again we saw a bright light move, compared to other stars a short distance.  it was like a star that was there.. then started moving slowly,  then moved fast then dissapeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told her to send another wish up the aliens to confirm we saw something wierd as a joke to her again.  This time something beyond my wildest dreams happened.  I am still in shock at this moment.  So far I thought it was just satellites moving in a straight line..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only saw 3.. she saw 4.. in the same area.. about 2 mins after she silently sent a message as I asked for a sign.. 3 lights reddish came out of nowhere right out of the southern side of the northern cross int eh same area we were seeing activity.. move across from the right (south) to the north at VERY high speed. 2 of the lights were converging .. it was like they were in formation getting closer.. then abrubtly turned at a 90 degree angle to the east and disapeared again..<n> <n><n> <n><n> My jaw hit the ground.  I&#39;ve seen video of ufo&#39;s many times and other things.. but always.. ALWAYS said I&#39;d never TRULY believe everything I&#39;ve read about until I&#39;ve seen it for myself.    After seeing so many military aircraft over the years and watching the stars all these years.. seeing bolides, shooting stars, and everything else.. I HAVE NEVER seen anything like this.  It totally blew my mind.. my GF and I were totally ecstatic.  We&#39;ve both wished to see something ALL of our lives to confirm our beliefs.. IT FINALLY HAPPENED!!! I am still pinching myself!!  I felt no need to get a camera it happened all within liek 5-10 mins between all the sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WOW!!! A lifelong wish fulfilled!!! That was nothig man made!!!<n>

It was a very clear night and a lot of stars were visible. Just before our u.f.o. sighting we saw what my boyfirend says were satelites moving across the sky. I also saw a shooting star (only one) in between our satelite viewings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were starring in the section of the sky where the Northern Cross lies when all of a sudden four balls of red light dashed across the sky in front of us. I saw four lights, my boyfriend saw three -- the fourth was somewhat behind the others and farther up in the sky). The objects came from the south and were spred across the sky, they were not flying close together. They dashed in front of us, then slowed down to a stop before they darted off in a right angled turn towards the east and disappeared. I started laughing when they came to a stop because all I could think of was &#34;Oh my God, they are flying in &#34;military V&#34; formation!!&#34; Well..it wasn&#39;t a complete V shape but it was close. It might sound strange, but the lights seemed to me to be....translucent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I’d been seeing some fighter jets and commercial jets and private craft, so got used to seeing these relatively creeping across the sky or horizon.  Well, on Tuesday night (6/19), two very bright white lights moved slightly down at an angle, in a straight line, in unison, from west to east, covering a lot of sky in a couple seconds (what would take much longer for known aircraft).  They then were just as suddenly moving away to the south so fast the bright lights faded from view after a couple more seconds.  I also heard no noise at all, and they were much closer than jets I&#39;d heard during the day.  The bright white lights were exactly as bright and just as unbelievably fast as the one I saw recently near Soap Lake, WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed 1 light sphere, size of Venus in the sky.  I didn&#39;t say anything at first, as I thought it was just a baloon.  When he got back in the car, and we started driving East on Melrose near Paramount Studio&#39;s, I saw it break into 2 round light speheres, at that point, I asked him to take a look up, to see if he could see what I see.  He did.  We pulled over on Bronson Avenue, pulled over, got out of the car, and watched... Now we saw three lights all the size of Venus, forming a triangle, not moving any direction, but further up towards the atmosphere.  I read on this board that at some time in April a couple of hikers saw this same formation over Griffith Park. We had made mention that this event looked like it was over Griffith Park as well.  They were sphere - like, not glowing lights but white round shpere&#39;s.  I have seen this before, over and around Larchmont area, and Paramount Pictures!  Fascinating!  XO<n>

There were three lights in a triangle pattern that slowly moved east/southeast across the sky and got farther away.

The weather was warm with a cloudless sky, without appreciable haze.  The location was a couple of miles north of Tecate on State-94.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I was driving eastbound on 94 and just passed the Tecate cutoff when I noticed what at first appeared to be a low-flying jet transport aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was rather low for the area, maybe about 6,000 feet above MSL.  However, it was very long in relation to its width.  If you could visualize a tall telephone pole you have an idea of its proportions.  It was moving west, straight and level, with the long axis of the body parallel to the direction of flight (it was flat).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that maybe it was an old stretch DC-8, but it was skinnier than that.  I then thought I was seeing a reflection off the curved side of a regular transport, but I then stopped my truck to look closer and I didn&#39;t see any evidence of reflection.  Further, I didn&#39;t see any rudder or wings.  It was too far away to see any markings/windows/portholes, but I certainly should have seen a rudder.  I watched as it proceeded to the west and was apparently several miles away when it looked like it turned slightly to the south.  Once again, I didn&#39;t see any wings, which if it had them I would have seen as it banked.  I would guess that it was at least 200-feet long with a rather bland gray color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The main reason it caught my attention before I drove closer to it, was that it was hovering and turning in a circular motion.

I have seen what you call falling star&#39;s, but never anything like this. I was half way through my route and was making a u-turn when a bright light in the sky cought my eye.I stopped and said, what is that-look! I knew that it was 4:52 am because i had just looked at the time before as i always do. I check the time at that spot to see how soon we will be done.We saw a royal blue round ball going very fast with a long streak of red fire streaking from it in the sky.It looked like the size of a soccur ball from where we were at.The streak of fire behind it was very long and was as thick as the blue ball.There was smaller orange balls coming off the blue ball before dissapearing very fast.There was a trail of grey white smoke like big puffy clouds for a long time after it dissapeared. I have seen jet&#39;s leave streaks in the sky, but nothing like this. The first thing i thought of was an airplane on fire, but nothing fell from the sky, it just dissapeared. This left me shaking for quite a few minutes. it really frightened me. My husband said it was in the direction of Utah. When we got home we called KLAS TV Channel 8. We told them what we saw. They said there was a lot of people calling in that had seen the same thing.They said they called the Airforce and Law Enforcement, but they did&#39;nt have any answers to what it was. The TV station said they would have an update on the 5pm news.When we watched the news that night, they said they had no answers to what everyone saw.

The object appeared to cover 30 to 50 miles in about 5 seconds, traveling from East to West.  Four or five flashes lit the entire area like large lighting strikes do and appeared to me to look like magnesium when it burns.  My first, split second  reaction was that it was a large meteor burning up in the atmosphere, but the flashes were too bright.  It totally vanished after the last flash.  A large trail of smoke was left in the sky from a point where the first flash occured to the last.  I am a pilot and I would estimate the smoke trail to be at about 15,000 feet above ground level.  The smoke trail spread and dissipated like a normal condensation trail of a jet aircraft.  There was absolutely no sound from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My freind and I both looked at each other {we had both seen it}. I have never seen any flying object accelerate so perfectly and effortlessy. No sound was heard. This object was definitely not civilian/military.<n>

The time was between 1 a.m. - 1:45 a.m.I was driving my mother-in-law home when I spied a reflection in the very upper 1/4 of my windshield.It followed me.I kept trying to see if it was a reflection from a street light and such but even when I was not by a street light it was still there.Then as I moved my eyes up and forward in front of my jeep I saw quick flashes of light dance ahead of me.Then there were 5 what appeared to be lighted oblong shaped clouds moving overhead(just above the Holly donut shop)in a clock wise direction....gradually their number dwindled down to four and then three.And they would go strictly in a plain circular motion for awhile and then they would start to dip and dive and it looked as if they were chasing each other.It looked like they may have been playing or doing a dance.Their movements were very smooth and graceful...it was actually beautiful to sit and watch.The air was thick and hazy from the humidity.There was not a cloud or star in the sky.My mother-in-law saw the same as I saw.There was a pay phone right next to my jeep where I was parked so I got out of my jeep to call home so my husband might be able to see this spectacular sight also.When I first picked the receiver up before even placing any quarters into the slot I heard this terrible static that was very loud.When I placed the quarters into the slot I still heard the static.I tried 3 times and on the third try I was able to get thru.My husband was able to make it in time to see what his mother and I were witnessing...I had him bring my camera bag.(I tried to get some pics but was not successfuk in this attempt.All pictures came out as black as night with nothing in them.) We watched them some more and then they hovered together for a sec and disappeared...poof!...into thin air.They disappeared very quickly.If they were not UFOs I do not know what else they could be....there was no beam of light going up into the sky ! from the ground.There is no airport close by and there was no carnival.Plus when I was a little girl 8 years old I saw the exact same thing when I lived in a trailer park in Brighton,MI  in 1967 only there were two and they acted in the same exact manner.My brother and 2 friends witnessed this particular show with me.I am writing to you because of your experiences with such sightings.What do you think it was that we saw?Is there a way that I could report this?And maybe see if anything was reported as being sighted in Holly,MI on this day at this time?I know now that I was not dreaming about what I saw when I was 8 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly something was flying down and took a position between the 2 at about the same altitude and direction it had no flashing airplane lights, it has like 2 half circle orange glowing sections underneath the craft seperated by a dark section running front to back as it flew.I really couldnt see the craft but the orange glowing areas were obvious.I watched as it followed the flight path of the first plane as they all three in a row flew off and faded from view headed south. Note of interest the phoenix news reported a strange fireball or explosion in the area there early the next morning. It was unexplained.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I personally do not believe in little green man although there is inevitable proof of alien lifeforms blabla.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event: I was sitting inside (alone - unfortunatly) when suddenly i saw something moving just in my sight, outside at the sky. When I turned to see what it was it, at first sight, appeared to be a falling star. However with no tail. It kept on flying and flying at a speed much SLOWER than a falling star but FASTER than an airplane (no sound of an airplane heard however at weekends - when the fact occured - several REAL airplanes flew over) untill it was beyond my sight. It seemed to come down, which is impossible because I leave in a small village in belgium and the nearest airport is Zaventem.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do know what a falling star and a plane look like, and I can tell by the mere 10 seconds I saw the object it was none of those 2. It was not a reflection on the window or any other visual delussion because the lights were out inside causing no reflection on the windows. it was NOT a flashlight or so, I live on the second floor. I&#39;m a real sceptic, and do not believe in the X-File way of UFO&#39;s. (Although I&#39;m a fan of the series, it doens&#39;t affect my visual observation.)

It was visible over a tree in the distance. I was able to determine it was large in size. The object was a silver flat disk that was silver bordered by black with a concave center. The object was silent emitted no light. The object appeared to move effortlessly almost as if it was gliding on ice. The object wobbled slightly than immediately vanished.

Then I of course as usual when seeing a ballon I watch it until it disappears into either a dot or into the clouds. So I took a second glance and noticed it was not a balloon. I called Andrew over and he thought I was insane, until he saw it himself. It was in the shape of a disk. The best way to describe it was it looked like a black tube and the inside was silver but was sort of concaved in, making a wide cone lacking a perfect filled doughnut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It lasted for about 25-30 seconds.

But when it was over Bremerton all these people were just sitting totally oblivious to the environment around them, reading or whatever, so I pointed it out to a guy just to see his reaction and he was looking and he said, &#34;Oh it’s something the Navy Yard is doing for Surveillance,&#34; I know he’s wrong, but I tell, &#34; Ya, these times are getting exciting.&#34;  I can’t wait for what’s coming; I think it’s a good thing.

The object seemed to zig and zag a bit, and did not travel in a smooth line (it appeared to be &#39;bouncing&#39; here and there).  The bright light it emitted never waivered and stayed constant (twice as bright as a star might be).  2 other craft were in the vicinity, one following it, while another was comming in from a side direction, almost as if to &#39;flank&#39; the brightly lit Ufo.  The craft that was directly behind the Ufo appeared to be a normal domestic craft (Blinking blue lights, flying in a straight line, ie...nothing out of the ordinary).  This craft continued following the Ufo over the horizon.  The &#39;flanking&#39; craft was a bit more odd, only blinking a deep red light every second or so.  This craft flew in from the Ufo&#39;s side, getting somewhat close to it, but then changed course, and proceeded to fly at a slow rate in the opposite direction of the Ufo, right over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Back to what I saw:  I was on my way home from a movie at Desert Ridge in Phoenix with three of my friends.  We had talked about my sightings from earlier in the week and even had a good laugh about them.  I couldn&#39;t help looking at the sky when I noticed the lights were there again.  This time there were two orbs.  My friend who was driving exited 101 at Scottsdale Road and proceeded south.  We made a right turn at the first street (Mayo) and headed west and stopped 1/4 mile down to watch the lights.  They were blinking on and off just as they had done two nights previous.  There was also another car pulled over just a little further down the street and the driver was standing outside of his car watching them too.  I noted the time immediately when I saw the lights (10:00 p.m.).  The show lasted for about 10 minutes.  This time I took a picture with my cell phone.  The resolution is terrible but it did capture the objects as well as some planes that were in the area.  Interestingly though the color of the objects is not orange in the photo.  One is brown and the other is green.  During the 10 minutes, the planes appear to fly above, below and all around them, going about their business as if it&#39;s nothing unusual.  I just don&#39;t understand why the pilots don&#39;t report these lights.  Are they not seeing them?  In reading the reports in the database, there appear to be a high number in the southwest sky that are very similar over Phoenix.  With all the cameras around recording our every move these days, why do we not have one focused on the sky to capture this phenomenon in Phoenix?  I&#39;m really curious now as to the origin of these lights.  I&#39;ve purchased a compass that I&#39;m keeping in my car to provide better details.  At least my friends saw it this time.  I will see if I can get them to submit their report as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Bright light in sky which stops and changes direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked up into the overcast sky to see what appeared to be a bright star in the sky. However, the star was moving at a quick speed (about 5 to 6 times quicker than a jumbo jet plane) and we noticed that it was only one light, no little flashing lights next to it like a normal plane. After about 5 seconds the light stopped dead in the sky for about two seconds before shooting off at a ninety-degree angle and travelled for about further three seconds before it shot up through the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved forwards and back and turned several times. Soon it sped off to the SSE and about 5 minutes later, a helicopter flew in that direction very low (It was a dark military helicopter with a bubble on top of the rotors) Soon after the first helicopter came 2 F/A 18 hornets flying very low and broke the sound barrier going in the same direction. Shortly thereafter, in the same direction, came a large troop-carrying helicpter that was also very dark. i stood in my coul-asac and watched this as it took place and my dad was with me most of the time, he even witnessed the object. If it means anything, this took place after a large-ish earthquake.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As my mum was exiting the door, my sister and I were standing on the top of our driveway. I looked up, and in the South East area of the sky I saw a formation of four lights fliyng to the left, I suppose flying North/ North West, roughly. There was one red light at the front, and 3 yellow lights in a trangular formation behind. The yellow triangle was on its side, and the top and bottom lights were flashing on and off alternately very quickly. It did not register as aircraft lights, which normally involve a blue light, or a green light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared to be part of the same object, and it flew without sound very quickly, probably crossinb my range of vision within about 7 seconds. However, I cant estimate a speed due to the lack of reference points at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got up and walked towards the tree line.  I saw 2 orange orbs (pumpkin like) skimming slowly over the trees. very slow..like 5MPH. The orbs were paralell to one another. Suddenly one flew in a eastern direction.  The other object stayed in a hovering position. moments later the other orb came back sitting side by side. Then they started moving towards us and the color changed to a red color. One came directly over our campfire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the red orb appeared to rotated and became at least four times the size of my van. It changed it&#39;s appearance to a lange rectangle shape and had portholes with red, yellow, blue and green lights almost firelike. And that was just the beginning of the show!  The only sound I heard was like a turbo sound that lasted less than one second. 2 Hours later we were still watching lights through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was reddish white, apparent size was that of a pea at arm&#39;s length, magnitude about three/ four times Venus. I began taping because I did not hear any noise associated with aircraft. As the object passed to my west, I could see that it was two large spherical lights, one behind the other. There were no &#34;nav&#34; lights, no noise, no change in intensity as these lights went off to the NE.  I also checked the position of the ISS, which was mid Pacific, heading southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Kim Shaffer, MUFON State Director from Tennessee, for submitting the report.

No noise, the lights were the same color as the stars (dim white) and the only reason they caught my attention was that they moved slowly together as one. My husband and I watched and as we continued to watch another object that seemed to be &#34;towed&#34; by the &#34;V&#34; shaped thing made us both ask each other if we were seeing the same thing. It was a roundish, orange, dimpled disk that seemed to be dragged behind the darker &#34;v&#34; shaped thing with the lighted edges. The disk rolled and undulated from side to side, like a kite, as it was pulled along.It was the strangest thing either of us had ever seen. We live very near an Air National Guard base and they fly mostly during the day. But it was odd that just before we sighted this object, 2 or 3 Fighters had taken off, headed to the northwest. Were they aware that &#34;something&#34; was out there? We telephoned the FAT tower, the Air National Guard officer on duty, and a local TV station. No one else had seen or heard anything (even on radar), so they said. It was very strange, but I would like to see this thing again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving slowly at a forty-five degree angle toward a small cloud. I just stopped to watch as the object entered the cloud. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing. It was not a plane or a helicopter,and it made no sound. I stood for awhile waiting for the object to come out of the cloud, but it never did. I never saw it again.

It was a clear night and we were all enjoying looking up at the stars, pointing out patterns, spotting satelites, and even a shooting star.  As we all sat gazing for the next object to spot, a saucer like object with multiple lights on it flew over head. We watched it fly for about 10 seconds and it was gone.  Immediately following the incedent we all turned to each other in amazement asking if we had seen the object.  It was definetly an UFO. It moved quickly and silently through the air drawing little attention.  The object was fairly close and appeared larger then an airplane.  We could definetly clearly see the shape of the object and that it was nothing man made.  Myself, my brother, and two best friends all witnessed and described the same exact object.

Hovering over wooded area|6/18/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37647.html|224|ndxe200406| Triangle object, multiple witnesses, 100 feet from ground.  Hovering over wooded area<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some brief but much needed history behind this sighting is needed before writing this report to you.  My wife is as un-likely a person, in my mind, to discuss UFO sightings as I&#39;ve ever met.  We were sitting on our back deck just talking about our work days the night before when we stumbled upon a dual sighting, hers much better than mine but ironic to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a veteran ((law enforcement officer in Lake County, Ohio)) (20 miles east of Cleveland on Lake Erie)and in good standing within.  I&#39;ll tell you the story in a chronlogical order as it occurred to me and how it unfoled to me as well.  To begin, this is not the first sighting I&#39;ve had but the first in which my wife and I saw something together. We were apart when it occurred and we did not have the opportunity to talk about it when it happened. This is, however, my first report I&#39;ve ever filed with any agency.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I signed up to work a side job for the ((deleted--local community)) and was waiting for the rest of the bingo crowd to arrive. I was in the parking lot waiting to direct the patrons into their spots when there was a lull in the traffic coming in.  As you probably know, there has been some pretty violent weather in the area and I was checking a storm that had blown over (approx. 1745 hrs).  I first saw a very normal jetliner cruising through the sky at normal height and speed when I saw an object not familiar to me.  I&#39;ve seen satellites, helicopters, small planes, big planes and weather balloons due to the fact we live 25 miles from Hopkins Airport and have three smaller air fields in our patrol zone as well as a nuclear plant 10 miles away (busy with with activity).  I followed the plane for about 15 seconds and lost sight of it after it flew over a cloud deck.   I continued to check out the sky to see if threatening weather may be on the way.  I then saw this object in the sky that was much higher than the plane I&#39;d just seen. The speed was unreal compared to the speed of the plane lower in the sky.  I picked it up much further to the east that I&#39;d seen the plane just seconds prior.  At first, I thought it was a satellite because of the small overall look it had and incredible speed it appeared to be cruising at. I then realized that it should have been difficult to see a satellite with it being daylight.  After just a second or two, it appeared to get bigger but I realized it was getting closer.  I saw what appeared to be a triangle object that was still far away...probably at 10,000 feet, but it was oddly shaped and had no wings or tail.  It looked to be about the size of my thumbnail in the sky. I dismissed it, as I have in the past, and just wondered as to its origin.  My day ended with nothing else worth noting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That brings me to my wife and I talking on the deck.  She and I were just talking about everyday things and our work days the day before, I never talk to her about UFO&#39;s and the like and had pretty much forgotten about my &#34;sighting.&#34;  My wife then said something about her needing to call me at 1645hrs the day I worked the bingo detail but she didn&#39;t because I was probably enroute to the location or already in the armory (location of the bingo game) where my cell phone gets no reception.  My wife then told me what happened and said she was driving east on I-90 eastbound between SR 91 and SR 306 and said, &#34; I saw a triangle thing in the sky, I was so scared cause it looked like it was watching something.&#34;  I asked her what she meant and had still forgotten about what I&#39;d seen and expected a normal explanation from her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife proceeded to tell me that the &#39;thing&#39; was hovering and not moving.  She said that the &#39;thing&#39; made no sound and didn&#39;t even bounce in the sky.  I asked her if it could of been one of those self-made gliders moving real slow like they do and she became adamant that this thing was &#34;HUGE, no way.&#34;  I realized at this point that she didn&#39;t have a clue what she was describing in respect to the relevance to UFO reporting. She&#39;s never heard of the triangle phenomena or even the UFO research being conducted. It was like asking an innocent kid about seeing a crime or describing their first home run....it was completely honest and very compelling.  I then recalled what I had seen but didn&#39;t tell her because she gets really freaked out about these types of things, you&#39;d see if you ever spoke to her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then asked her if she could tell how close it was to the ground. I figured she&#39;d give me an airplane type altitude.  She looked at one of the trees in our neighborhood and said &#34;about 100 feet above that tree.&#34;  I then became very curious but skeptical about her sighting and asked her if she was sure it wasn&#39;t a plane or something else she&#39;d seen before.  I know my wife and it was clear that she was freaked out because she had went to work and told her friends she thought something was going on with &#34;911&#34; and we were being watched.  I told her that I would have been the first to know being that I&#39;m in law enforcement and being next to an international airport and nuclear plant (at least I&#39;d like to think so).  My wife then told me that she thought it was a plane but she couldn&#39;t believe it was a plane because it just stood still in the air.  She said that she had to stop looking at it because, as she kept driving, she was losing her field of vision at it, and thought she might wreck if she kept trying to watch it as she kept driving.  She said she saw it over a very thick wooded area and thought it was looking at something.  We live only 5 miles from that location. She then arrived at work and her sighting ended.  She described the object as being a triangle with no wings and no tail.  She said it was a darker grey shape with no lights or no other markings worth noting.  Anyway, our story and wherabouts can be easily verified as well as her telling her co-employees about it and our wierd way we came about this story.  I would have never written if she hadn&#39;t told me about her story. Times dates and actions during the sighting can be verified. Thank you.<n>

Was not able to get pictures of that, but did get pictures as it happened again 2 weeks later, but the second time it was a big bight light and I had my camra with me, 4 out of the 5 pictures turned out, as the shape stayed the same in every shot, made sure that I lined it up with trees so you could see it for what it is. This was very strange, I did call 911 and asked if they where flying anything, Multiple sightings with other people, in day time as well, you have a feeling like something is watching and you look up to see it in the sky, this happened afew times like that, I would say the best time you will see them is from April to June and you will see them at odd times, but you will see them, Pictures are only shown to people in the family, don&#39;t know what to do about them? And yes I know the difference between what all types of air craft look like, I hope it&#39;s your&#39;s, one did come from the lake one time to with no lights or makings(skipped across the water and stoppped then went up) Lake Winnipeg) You will see them this year they do come a few times a year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It will move up, to the right, down, to the left (in no certain order and at varied speeds). It will fall towards the ground at a very high rate of speed (always remaining visible though), and eventually shoots across the sky. Then it changes its appearance and looks and flies just like an airplane, with a red blinking light like airplanes have.

One night a friend and I were sitting on the front deck, enjoying the cool breeze and our view of the ocean. The sky was fairly clear, with numerous stars and a few thin clouds. Several airplanes (both jet and prop) were visible as we talked. Suddenly we both saw a bright orange ball of light to our left, towards the fishing pier at Carolina Beach. The object appeared to be a considerable distance away, at least several miles off the coast. The object moved in a straight line and was extremely bright. It abruptly lost its brilliance and became a tiny point of light (which was still visible), and then several seconds later it regained its former brilliance before completely fading from sight. As my friend and I discussed what the object could have been, a few minutes later we saw a remarkably similar object (perhaps the same?) to our right - this time it was a little closer, and it behaved in the same manner as the first object. Finally, about five minutes or so later, we again saw a similar object - this time it was almost directly in front of us, higher above the horizon, and it was much closer - I would guess it was a mile or less off of the beach. It appeared to be simply a large, brilliantly lit orange ball of light. The object was in view for only a few seconds before it vanished. We did not see the object(s) at any other time that night. My friend and I considered our options - the objects couldn&#39;t have been lights from a ship as they were too far above the horizon. They could not have been fireworks or flares, as we saw nothing go up and the objects moved on a steady flight path - they didn&#39;t arc or go down. I have never seen a shooting star behave in such a manner. The objects might have been lights from one or more airplanes, except for the fact that the objects bore no resemblance to the numerous airplanes that we did see at night throughout our trip, and not one of the objects made any sound what! soever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have considered the possibility that the objects were satellites reflecting the sun, except that we saw three lights in fairly rapid succession (fifteen minutes or less) in different parts of the sky. In short, my friend and I were both stumped, and I admit that on other nights we looked for similar lights, but with no luck. I seriously doubt that we saw something from &#34;outer space&#34;, but whatever these &#34;objects&#34; were remains a mystery to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I wonder if anyone else has seen a similar thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in a house at 1,400 ft elevation that sees clear across the Valley, and often watch the city lights and night sky. As usual, before going to bed, I took one last glance out the window southwest toward Phoenix. There I noticed two bright, orange-hued lights that appeared to be above or past (to the south) South Mountain. I assumed they were on a landing pattern (one behind the other) to Sky Harbor Airport and the orange tinge was due to haze in the air and the angle I was seeing them from. There is always alot of air traffic and though this approach was unusual (for me) to see, an approaching aircraft made sense. They were very bright, though. Then all of a sudden there appeared four, then six. All bunched together (extending my arm they covered the width of about one, maybe two fingers) but not in any perfect geometric formation (at least from my angle.) I thought this had to because the glass in the window was making them appear double or triple. I got my wife on her feet and out we went to see them outisde. There they were, at least six of them (maybe 7 or 8). Very bright, quite orange. They almost seemed to be dancing (this could have been because of refraction due to the heat). Their height was about the same as the radio towers on South Mountain but they were more to the east of them. I got the sense they were over the valley to the south. Then, just as suddenly as they appeared, they one by one disappeared, all in about 10 seconds. It was as if they went below or past the horizon of the mountain, but it&#39;s odd to have so crisp a departure from such a distance (South mountain is about 20 miles away.) Maybe this was due to their brightness. I have seen other objects and lights I&#39;ve wondered about from time to time over/beyond South Mountain but this multiplication, and abrupt departure was unlike anything. Maybe military formation? If they were commercial aircraft why did they appear so suddenly as a group and leave as quickly? Also, usually when I see commercial aircraft that appear orange it! is only from a great distance (or dust storm, smoke from fires, etc.) and they are dull and not nearly so bright. The visbility (from haze, we don&#39;t see clouds in June:) was about average or better last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I come to the end of Forest and Merrideth, and look up at this weird jet flying way up, with really short dual contrails. I start yapping to ((my wife)) about &#34;chemtrails&#34; and how i had noticed 3 or 4 chem trails over Mount Benson for the 3 days after Sept 11, and that i thought that they has been made by 4-52 bombers being scrambled. Anyway, I digress. So we are sitting at the stop sign for 30 seconds staring at this craft, when off to the left from this airplane,  we both noticed this shiny bright, very bright ball, was there for 4 or 5 seconds, then disappeared. We both saw this. The ball was not particularly big, but not just a pinprick either. Really cool, I assume it was a reflection, though what was shining off of what up there i cant imagine.It sort of disappeared from the top down.<n>
6/15/04 21:00|Clinton|MS|Triangle|unknown|On-going UFO sightings ((NUFORC Note:  Multiple sightings reported by witness; date is approximate.  PD))|9/29/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39208.html|232|ndxe200406| On-going UFO sightings<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all started the night that my mother, sister, and I came home from my sister&#39;s Christmas program back in 1992 or so. We had left the local coliseum and were heading home around 9PM. We were headed east on a road that runs behind a cemetery and is only a half mile or so from our home. I happened to look south out over the trees and see this huge triangle moving just above the treetops. It was 100&#39; in length, black, four light (three white ones on each of the corners and a blue colored one in the center), and it moved slowly and silently. We came to a complete stop to watch it. It was odd because the next thing we realized it was moving away from us in a SW direction. In the short distance to our home we never discussed it. And when we got inside our house it was around 11 PM or so. I seriously doubt it took two hours to drive a half mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I tell this is because over the years we&#39;ve seen the object(s) more than once. Sometimes it hovers and at other times it will disappear in, what seems like, a blink of an eye. Not too long after the above incident my mother and sister were coming home from Wal-Mart and saw it again. They said they only saw it for about five seconds but as soon as my sister saw it her mouth broke out in small blisters almost like ulcers. Like I said, we&#39;ve seen it many times over the years, plus other kinds of UFO&#39;s, but the last time we saw it was around the beginning of this summer, about the middle of June. This time it was my sister and me, I was driving, coming home from a friend&#39;s house, probably around 8 or 9 PM, and there was one over the cemetery again. This time we decided to follow it. As we neared the cemetery, heading east, the object started to move off at a high rate of speed, to the NE. I turned down another street heading N, which has a school, I stopped in the middle of the road because we could see that there were two other objects, like the triangle, forming a larger triangle. I started to go forward again and this time all three disappeared in maybe two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stated, we&#39;ve seen many kinds of UFO&#39;s. The triangle, sphere&#39;s, cigar-shapped ones, lights that just hovered, and so on. We&#39;ve also become accustomed to having bruises we can&#39;t explain,my sister&#39;s mysterious ulcers, blood on our bed sheets and pillow cases, and blood on our clothes. I also know that one night I had a very vivid dream about being in the middle of some woods and seeing a UFO above me and when I woke up there were dead leaves in my bed that weren&#39;t there the night before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was slightly longer than an airplane fuselage yet tapered at each end. There were no wings or tell tale signs of such (such as dark areas around it&#39;s mid section). It glowed or shone silver white. I ran towards an elderly couple on a park bench close by. I pointed it out to them and they came into the clearing to get a clear view. They both saw it too. The lady said she had seen it before (I didn&#39;t ask when). They both agreed that it was not an airplane. I put forward the notion that perhaps it was a meteor but dismissed it myself as it left no trail nor did it appear to be moving as fast as one would expect a meteor to. It stayed on a steady course heading west at a somewhat leisurely pace comparable to an aircraft at 30,000 feet. It seemed to flare when it was about 60 degrees above the western horizon, growing brighter for a second. I lost sight of it shortly after as it got further away and trees obstructed my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Almost like someone had taken a razor and made a vertical cut in the skyline and light was bursting through the cut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to moving slowly and steadily, straight upward. I watched it as long as my light lasted and around the corner, it did not appear to be going away anytime soon.

Location to my best descrpition would be Southeast and up passing one of the planets(Can&#39;t name the bright star at that time). What was odd about this light is when it passed this star it then went to an incredible &#34;halt&#34;. And did not move for another 20 minutes. Too tired, went to bed. What I find weird is this pattern of this particular &#34;light&#34; has been going on for years. Has anyone else around the area seen these &#34;moving lights that go then stop&#34;?<n>

It stood still for about 10 seconds and the airplane got closer to the object. I turned on the airplane chatter with me head phones so that I may see if they noticed it. They did, and were attempting to aviod it.

It was several miles away but the outline and wings were still easily visible. As I continued watching, I noticed a white object approaching it from the southeast.  Assuming it was another plane too far away to show any detail, I didn&#39;t think much of it.  However, when it approached the jet, it changed course in a wide arc underneath the jet&#39;s contrail, then continued to the west. Once or twice during it&#39;s flight, a flash of light glinted off it implying it may have been metallic.  At this point I called for 2 women who were in the cubicles closest to the window to see the object.  They came over and watched for a few seconds, and after approximately 1 minute, the object stopped in the middle of the sky and reversed direction back to the east. No arc, or 180° turn or quick bank, just stopped and started travelling back east.  When I saw it stop and change direction I became very excited, though the women with me weren&#39;t impressed even though they also saw it stop and reverse course.  I continued to watch the object fly east till it was lost in a developing cloud formation.  It was roughly 2:00 p.m. (I forgot to look at my watch for the exact time of course), the weather was sunny to the northwest but became cloudy to the east due to a developing thunderstorm system coming over the mountains, and the sky behind the object looking north was blue. I was inside so I could hear no noise, but I assume it was too far away to hear anything at that distance if I was outside. Seeing as it was several miles to the northeast from my vantage point, I estimate the general location of the object would have been high in the sky above the line dividing Larimer and Boulder county in northern Colorado.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will email an edited photo of the view from the window after I send this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I noticed another disk coasting alonge another contrail that was twice as high in the sky. Our eyes felt odd as we observed the second disk we all felt weird . but there was no fearful feeling just a weird feeling .

There were about a dozen white/silver small discs flying sporadically in the sky. I tried to count them, but they were constantly in errantic motion &amp; I found it hard. I turned to a girl (who I don&#39;t know, but works in my building) who was near me in the parking garage. She was talking on her cellphone &amp; apologized for interrupting her conversation in fear of her thinking I was nuts, but I had to ask if she &#34;could see what I&#39;m seeing??&#34; (I was so glad I wasn&#39;t the only one out there)She said into the phone, &#34;Honey, where are you? There are weird things flying around in the sky out here.....yeah, right now!&#34;. We laughed, but didn&#39;t take our eyes off of the show. They seemed silverish &amp; turned really bright white (seeming to reflect the sun)  sometimes when they dipped &amp; flew in certain ways. You could definately see that they had a spinning motion also &amp; they were all moving at different speeds, up, down, left, right, looping, diagonally, you name it. They were definately NOT flying in unison, but they were all grouped together, a few were a little North of me, moving behind buildings &amp; back again, but most were NW. An airplane was ascending from Sky Harbor Airport too at that time &amp; flew right past them (plane was flying North/ Northwest). I was wondering if those people were looking out the window &amp; could they see them?? At first I thought maybe they were pieces of paper that got caught in the wind or something, but they were much bigger than that...and SPINNING. They didn&#39;t look like balloons, helicopters or planes of any kind as far as I could tell. Neither did they look (or fly) like birds. We stood &amp; watched them for about 10 minutes, when they all started going North at the same time until I couldn&#39;t see them anymore. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it. I am curious to know if anyone else caught the show? Someone here at work suggested I write to the newspaper to see, so I wrote that day, no response (shocker!) If anyone has seen similar, please post. Thanks so much.<n>

The object made no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 10min. of watching this object A resident drove into the building from the north side of the building which is 180 Feel away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I took my last look at it, before I turned to enter the doorway the object (ever so slightly) motioned away from it&#39;s position in a very slow and controled manner.  The winds may have been about 5 mph..(a nice little breeze),  But the object was so steady even just sitting there and in it&#39;s slight movement a!way.  I didnt get to stay long enough to watch it completely leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had questioned people who work at the club and they say they have nothing that would resemble what I had described to them.  This club is very exclusive and I know many people who belong to the club and they say they have never seen anything that even comes close to my description.  They believed me none the less because they know me to be an honest and a reputable person that would never fabricate such a story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to know if anyone has ever reported seeing a similar object?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

There was no light out where I was. I had my cell phone with me and I was about to call a friend of mine when I realized a big bright yellowish orange light in the sky.  I dont know how long its been there or if it has just gotten there.  But it happened so quickly.  I was facing north at the time. At first, I thought that it was a helicopter but it stood still in place for about a few second. There was also no sound either. I was really distracted with my phone and my cigarette but when i looked up again. It quickly shoots down. And my first thought was, &#34;Oh, Wow that is beautiful&#34;.  I thought it was a shooting star of some sort. But then it gradually slowed down...and went up again kind of like a zig-zag and then it just disapeared. It wasnt until later when i realized that a helicopter or even the smallest airplane could of not manuver that fast or dissapear that quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I saw 4 silver egg shaped objects (I believe is UFO) appx 2500 ft high under the cloud level flying in a steady speed, not fast, was cruising like a commercial air plane to the east direction. They were flying together and close to each other. It was a cloudy day and I was playing football with two of my little cousins. They were so young and couldn’t remember what they saw now. The objects were just keep going to the east direction toward Long island NY and mins later, its gone.<n>

Other than stars, aircraft are very common in this area (coast gaurd).Having travled this same road for the last 8 years,I know it is very dark, and the stars just jump out at you.But this time it was differant. This star had an inverted light comming from it.In other words,the beam was large at the top,and small at the bottom. Like it was foused on something. Ive seen lots of spot lights, but this was differant.What it was I dont know, but I do know it was not a United States air craft of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I continued to watch it and, when it neared the horizon, it made a right angle turn without changing velocity.  It continued to travel East until I could no longer see it.

It was very clear outside and it was very quite.  I usually look up at the stars everynight when I take them out.  As I looked up I seen this triangular shapped object, similar to a boomerang but with sharp corners coming over the top of me.  It was moving in a South East to North West direction.  It appeared to be just above telephone pole height.  It blocked out the stars as it passed over me.  It appeared to be approximately 150 feet accross and 50 feet wide.  The front appeared to have a 140 degree angle.  It was moving slow enough that a runner could keep up with it.  It was completely silent and it omitted a ripple type of a heat wave similar to what you would see coming off the road pavement on a hot day.  There were no lights yet the heat rippled and gave a distinct shape.  I was amazed by its presence and just watched it as it went out of sight, probably about 300 feet away it just disapeared.  I wish I could draw it for you on this site because I will never forget it&#39;s shape.

I set it up as fast as I could, the object had moved much further than I had initially anticipated it moving, but I did get it in the sights of the camera for awhile, until I couldn’t hold the focus on it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was orange and looked to be a concaved sphere shape, on one end, and pointy on the other, and was rotating around, and shape-shifting, it was heading to the North-West and there was for a brief moment, another object much smaller, flew right up to it, and away again, the smaller craft was traveling to the North-East, I cant imagine the altitude, but it was WAY up there by this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The smaller craft that comes right up to the larger craft and moves away without slowing, I never would have seen the smaller craft without the aid of the video camera, if I hadn’t been following the larger craft, I would never have seen the smaller one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did later record a passing airplane, to show perspective.

When I said &#34;hey, look at that&#34; it disappeared. We started going faster down the road and we saw it again, it was flying over us in the sky and we could see under it.  There were three lights spaced evenly in a triangle formation. It just stayed in one spot in the sky, then took off really fast. We got home and the whole time home we were keeping an eye on it. It was zigzagging through the sky that it was dogging something. we ran inside and got the telescope, when we went back outside we started setting it up, the UFO was still there were we left it but higher in the sky and it was the same pink light that was there when we first saw it. The object started zigzagging again and in the distance of where it just left there were spurts of lights going off at a time. there was also a loud hmmmmm sound going off. There are farms around and the animals were making very weird sounds like they were in pain. We got scared and ran inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were in our backyard at approximately 9 p.m. last night looking due south. We were startled to see 2 strings of golden colored lights, each string containing 8 lights. These lights were brighter than conventional aircraft lights but were in perfect alignment with each other, floating in the air without any observed movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 5 minutes, the lights in the string to the right began to go out, as if a dimmer switch was being used to slowly decrease the light until only darkness remained. There was no obvious logic to the sequence. A couple lights would diminish together and vanish, then a third, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, the string of lights on the left began the same sequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We rushed to get binaculars but saw no craft behind the lights. However, once all the lights were gone, we saw 2 helicopters fly into that zone and circle, as if searching for them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized that just lights may not be sexy in terms of a ufo sighting, but it was one of the most startling events of my life, since this is the city known back in 97 for hosting a similar event. I cannot imagine that the military is still playing with flares over a metropolitan area of millions, although that is the obvious conventional explanation that was also offered in 97. I contacted the author of THE PHOENIX LIGHTS (Dr. Lynne) and she also was quite emphatic that the so-called Phoenix Lights phenomena continues routinely, even though the so-called paranormal media has moved on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for June 14 and June 15.

We both noticed 2 sets of 3-4 orange lights (non-moving and silent)in a horizontal position in the sky over a mountain range in the distance.  We witnessed this for approximately 2 minutes while driving this short stretch of McDowell Mountain Ranch Road and dismissed it as possibly some type of city lights in the distance.  When we turned, we could no longer see the lights due to buildings and trees obscuring the path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday, June 15th when driving the same stretch of McDowell Mountain Ranch Road at approximately the same time, we realized that the &#34;city lights&#34; we thought we had seen were not there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that evening, I went out alone to run an errand and get gas.  At 10:45 p.m., (this time I noted the time)I was travelling west on Bell Road and at the corner of Bell Road and Thompson Peak Parkway, I noticed a set of two lights in the sky, almost identical (in shape and color) to the lights I saw the night before.  I also observed some planes in the sky and determined these lights were much larger in size and different in color from the plane lights.  I called my husband who was at home (1 mile from my location) and he saw the same lights from an upstairs window.  My vision became obscured by trees and apartments (I was driving) while he continued to watch.  He said he could see 4 lights and then they blinked off and there were only 2 lights.  When they came back into my view, we both observed they appeared to be slightly changing colors from orange to orangish red.  I continued to drive and lost sight again due to driving into a lower elevation.  My husband observed them blink off and then he could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled into the local gas station at the corner of McDowell Mountain Ranch Road and Thompson Peak Parkway asked an employee if anyone had mentioned these lights and she said she spoke to a man the previous evening who reported seeing them at approximately the same time (8:45p.m.) that we had seen them.  However, he said he saw two lights separate and multiply to four lights and then separate and multiply to eight lights and then remain stationary in the sky for several minutes before taking off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found her to be exceptionally lucid, objective, and credible.

We live on a mountainside and had a good view of thses lights for 5 minutes, 2.5 of which I have on video tape.  These lights were almost stationary and in formation this did not change.  Brightness of each was Venus maggnitude or brighter.  Lights seemed to flash in a pattern.  While my eyes said they were red and white, video shows green yellow and orange as well.  As the lights went from sight, a movement to NE seemed to take place.  I am an experienced sky watcher and this was not an ordinary occurance.  Size was a minimm of 600 ft and at the most 3000=4000 by my estimates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a photography specialist, and captured several minutes of high-quality video of the light display.

Three members of my family saw apparently the same light formation shown in the photo that appears on the main page of this website.  We watched it for approximately five minutes from our back yard before it blinked out.  The &#34;formation&#34; of lights appeared to our southwest - barely above the horizon in the far distance and were amber colored and &#34;flickering&#34;.  We also watched through binoculars.  From our perspective the lights didn&#39;t appear to be moving, but appeared to be a great distance away and we couldn&#39;t see different colors.  This sighting brought to mind the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; phenomena of March &#39;97 and the videos shown of the so called &#34;flares&#34;.  We didn&#39;t hear anything mentioned about the lights that night on the local news.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As my partner and I were waiting for the last of the employees to depart the facility, we noticed five amber lights in the South West Phoenix(?) area. I question whether or not they were in Phoenix due to the distance. As we were watching these five amber lights, four side by side and the fifth just slightly removed to the West, another seven or eight appeared to the East of the original five. The first five remained for five minutes and went out. The second group waited another five minutes and proceeded to do the same. As we were watching this incredible light show, we also noticed that there was not a single aircraft in the Southern sky! Even the air corridor from the South West was clear. For the rest of the evening we observed one or two amber lights popping up in different locations. The last sighting was at approximatly 22:30 hrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We live five miles from Offutt AFB and what I saw was in that direction.  It appeared to be at first glance an aircraft perhaps coming towards us.  We had seen many Offutt jets during the day and thought maybe this was just another one.  However, it was standing still.  Dead still.  We ovserved it for several minutes, maybe 5 or 6.  Marilyn then brought out the binoculars and we saw right away that it  was not an aircraft like any we had ever seen.  It appeared to be several thousand feet high and north of Offutt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was rectangular in shape, with the rectangle a light green, but with two wing-like protrusions which were brighter green.  It sat perfectly still so we assumed it was not a kite nor a helicopter.  Didn&#39;t look like either.  We are really not familiar with weather balloons, but it didn&#39;t look like a balloon either.  It held this positon for a good 20 minutes, and then it moved fairly rapidly to the south at what we guessed to be a half mile.  However, prior to its moving, a small single engine aircraft flew overhead.  Marilyn commented that it looked like the plane would fly over the object.  I watched with the binoculars and observed that in fact the plane flew under the object, which we then assumed must be much larger than we had first thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It held its new position for about ten minutes drifting down slowly and then started drifting, again slowly, to the north and gradually dropped lower and disappeared over the rooftops.  We saw no lights, but its color changed from green to beige once it had moved to the south as noted above.  When it shifted from one position to another the wing-like protrusions had an appearance of gecko heads or modern day fighter aircraft cockpits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time we observed this, a couple of Offutt planes took off and landed, but went nowhere near the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported the sighting to the local sheriffs department immediately after, and they said no other calls had been received regarding the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both advanced degree college graduates in our mid sixties and have never before experienced any thing like this.  We are not prone to hallucinations nor prevarications.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Other people we passed on Estrealla Parkway heading South had pulled over to see them too. The lights seemed to be in the approach of Sky Harbor but none of the incoming aircraft seemed affected. As we traveled south on Estrealla Parkway we went through some mountains and when we finally got to a place where we could have a clear, south western view again, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports.

It was about the size of a house from where I stood and could not have been more than 200 feet off the ground, traveling at about 50 mph. I shouted at my friends and they caught a glimpse of it as it headed over the trees and disappeared. There were no clouds and it was a completly clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were speculating about what it could have been for about 10 mins when we saw another smaller object heading in about the same direction. It was made up of two smaller white triangles and one dark. It was about the same altitude as the first but one third the size. It was traveling more than double the speed of the first and both objects were completly silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We searched the sight and found a VERY similar sighting in may of this triangular object in Kent, WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is what made me pull over and stop. I drive a crude oil truck. I work one week of days and one week of nights. I&#39;ve done this for 20 years. When it was going across the sky it was about 4 inches below jupiter. When it reached jupiter it went straight up out of sight and i had turned all the lights off of my 18 wheeler to watch it. After it went straight up you could&#39;nt see it no more.At first I thought it was a jet when i saw it but there was no blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then became aware of 5 self-illuminated triangular (maybe diamond-shaped) craft flying in a &#34;V&#34; formation to the east of the north star. There was a sixth craft of the same shape and size flying outside the formation but moving at the same speed and direction. This sixth craft seemed to be leading the others as it moved its position relative to the others occasionally (maybe to signal a change in course). The formation of crafts were traveling west and moved quite rapidly. Although I heard no sound the crafts were fairly high in the sky. The color of the illumination was transluscent yellow-orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/13/04 23:00|Sandy|UT|Triangle|few secs each|2 transparent triangles travel silently through the night sky.|6/18/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37578.html|266|ndxe200406| 2 transparent triangles travel silently through the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were four of us in the front yard Me, my wife, and 2 cousins.  We are all in our early twenties.  We were just going to our homes from my mother’s home, which we visit every Sunday to play a game of Risk, when we found my sister had left her keys in the car.  So one of my cousins took the key out and put it on the doorstep because the house was locked behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my other cousin pointed up at the sky and my wife and I saw this transparent triangle shape.  It flew heading North to South.  I could make out the edges because the transparency did not go all the way to the edge.  It was kind of just fuzzy on the edges.  The object made absolutely no sounds.  There seemed to be no emitted light.  The sighting lasted all of about 2 seconds before it disappeared from view behind some trees.  The cousin who was putting the key on the doorstep did not get to see it there was a porch awning in the way.  He ran out after we all said &#34;what the hell is that?&#34;.  He thought we were lying.  After we all described what we saw and speculated what it could have been, we decided to stay there a few minutes to see if it would come back.  The cousin that did not see the triangle went out to the middle of the lawn and started running in circles staring at the Big Dipper.  Then he all of a sudden stopped and pointed up. A smaller triangle had appeared in the sky and was headed from North to more Southeast.  It looked more like 2 shaded triangles that may have been linked by a transparent piece or something else.  This one had more speed and disappeared into the night sky.  At first we thought this one was just ducks or geese, but then realized that they usually make noise when flying and do not fly in such a perfect formation.  The cousin that had not seen the first one, now believed us.  We stood around and speculated on this one too, we all drew some pictures of what we thought both looked like on the hood of my sisters car, in the dust that was all over it, and the pictures turned out pretty much identical.  My younger brother, age 15, heard all the noise we were making and looked out his window.  We motioned for him to come down stairs and he did.  We explained this all to him then went back to watching the sky.  We waited to see if another would appear but after about 20 minutes we decided it is time to go home. All we saw in the 20 minutes was 2 Satellites in the sky righ! t above us. One went north to south the other south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us have ever seen anything like this.  We all agreed on the shape and transparency of the triangles.  We also all agreed that they appeared to be paper-thin.  They made no noise at all, and also made no apparent air disturbance that we could feel or see.  The night was perfectly clear. Not a cloud in sight or on the horizon.  We also could not see the moon in the sky, it might have not risen over the mountains at that point.  My cousins went home and found this article on this web page http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37316.html which sparked my intrest to post my experience.  I will try to have images posted on my web page that each of us have drawn.  http://www.undergroundvine.net/ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were at least 30 degrees apart in the sky at abot 60 degree elevation above the horizon.  One was directly in front of us and the other to our left.  They were very distracting and the one to our left seemed to be be moving North by Northeast at a high speed.  My initial thought was some kind of specialized rocket or aircraft but my wife insisted they ghad to be comets as they were giving off an immense amount of light energy for the distance they must have been.   We tracked them for at least 15 minutes then they both quickly disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not understand how objects can be &#34;streaking,&#34; but still be in sight for an estimate 15 minutes.

I imediately stopped the car to watch the glowing light. I was in the middle of the road and there were no other cars around.  Eventually the light got bigger and we could tell it was coming towards us.  A Triangular craft with red and blue lights slowly passed over head.  It looked really strange.  I suppose it could&#39;ve been some kind of jet... but it was going slow and sounded sort of different also.  My friend and I were quite sober and neither of us have ever seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Appeared like a drop of mercury, moving in direction of wider end. Although overcast, the object looked like it was reflecting the sun, in that a bright light shown near the top of the object. It moved horizontally, slowly, occasionally making quick (1/2 second) vertical adjustments of 3-5 feet while maintaining a slow, steady northerly horizontal course, parallel to the ground. The quick vertical adjustments were not consistent with the wind nor with the dynamics of a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object drifted behind a tree, where it was lost to view. The object made no sound, and didn&#39;t appear to frighten birds that were plentiful in the area.

The clouds moved very quickly, but the object was below them.  The clouds were moving passed it as the object stayed in place.  This was in the city, so lights were cast the downtown area, but we are a few miles from it.  No blinking lights on the object, just a white circle.  I have watched the sky for years and am an astonomer as well.  This was not a plane, a balloon (too bright in the night sky), or a planet peaking through holes in the clouds.

The light got brighter as it moved north, then faded out. At first I dismissed the light as aircraft and was about to look away when another light appeared in the same spot the first one came from. The light appeared the same as the first and duplicated the same flight pattern, then faded out. This all happened in about 15-20 seconds. I was very interested by this point so I continued to watch this part of the sky. About 1 minute later I spotted two lights traveling side-by-side heading south. The lights were traveling at a very high speed. Faster than any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen, and faster than satallites I&#39;ve seen in the sky. The light on the right veered off from the left one at a higher rate of travel in a looping turn and disappeared. I&#39;ve always been a critic of people that claim to see this type of stuff. I know what I saw was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/12/04 22:00|Southbridge|MA|Other|10 seconds|Scanner beam passes through house and yard.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95250.html|284|ndxe200406| Scanner beam passes through house and yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SO, I am NOT reporting a sighting, but rather a phenomena which I think is also UFO based. Believe me I would love to see and report a UFO. It just hasn&#39;t happened to me.  But this phenomena did and it was unique and unexpected enough that I am now reporting it, after 8 years of sitting on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically I was sitting home one night alone, with no music or distractions, when what I can only describe as a vast scanner beam from above, moved across the area of my house and yard, and the wilderness around us.  Through my house and eventually through me as it passed.  It caught my attention just moments before reaching me, I physically turned my head towards it as part of the realization that something was approaching.  I was hit with an immediate adrenalin rush, before it got to me, the hairs on my skin were alerted, and I had the immediate instinct to get my back against a wall and freeze as if it were something I could hide form.  Which I did, though I was sitting. It passed over the house, through the house and walls, and over and through me,  then continued on until it was gone.  It seemed to take no notice of me at all. It didn&#39;t stop or change in any way as it went over/through me. The whole even took less than 10 seconds.  I waited without moving, but it did not retu! rn.  I stayed alerted to it&#39;s possible return, for days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a unique and strange occurrence.  I swear to you, I don&#39;t typically (not ever) cling to a wall to hide from a mysterious energy force scanning the area and when I do (this one time) it is because it is something real enough that I feel the need to take action.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a pretty open person to subtle energy and I was in a pretty remote place alone at night, and in a pretty open state of awareness at that point in my life, living alone, working from home, and communicating through letters and emails way more than verbally for many days at a time. I think without this state of mind, I might have missed this even all together. But it was stunning how clearly this “beam” became a clear and visible event in my awareness. It felt telepathic, and though I could not see it with my eyes. I could tell where it was in the yard, watch it literally hit the walls and floor and pass over me. It had a yellow leading edge and yellow wherever it intersected with anything, and left a greenish yellow trail as it passed, which seemed to waggle a bit like looking down a hot street.  It passed at an extremely constant machine like velocity, with a speed akin to just slower than a shadow of a cloud passing you at the beach, that same vast angle feeling, but! with an extremely accurate edge. Maybe even more like the beam from a lighthouse in it&#39;s constancy, is the best way to describe it, but the leading edge of the beam definitely ran for a few acres and originated from an point far up into the sky. The beam ran from north to south. And it swept from west to east.  It&#39;s leading edge was what felt like a beam but it could also be described as a field. And its shape, originating from a distant point, farther north than I was, and far up in the sky gave it the feeling of having a vast area. I was facing north as it passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And the final distinct detail of the event was that not only was my mind opened up to receiving this clear visual image of the beam, as the beam passed (an otherwise invisible and soundless event), but as it passed I was also able to visualize and make out two entities, at the source of the beam, though larger in my minds eye, who were clearly monitoring the beam, and discussing that what they were looking for was not found.  They seemed distracted by this goal and through this distraction I feel is the reason that I could get a mental image of their conversation while avoiding that type of mental connection being made back to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And yes, they were large dark eyed, and gray and looked like the sketches you typically see. Am I influenced by other stories?  Am I filling in the details with imagery from previous sightings? Could this have been a strange radio signal from a nearby tower that happened to be particularly strong this evening? All good questions I have asked my self. But I was sober and had not eaten any bad bread. And I am describing what I witnessed, and I am curious if there are other stories of anything similar.<n>

I was looking slightly north when I noticed a jet liner fly by past a glowing white sphere that was just sitting there. This sphere was many miles up since the jet passed below it.  It did start to drift ever so slightly west after about 20 minutes and then all of the sudden vanished.  I looked up towards the sky again 15 minutes later and saw the same craft shoot by on a west-east trajectory at incredible speeds, much fast than a jet but a little slower than a shooting star.  It left no contrail, made no noise.  There have been other similar sightings in the area for years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I was just looking up at the blue sky and noticed a very small point of light flickering.It was a tiny point of light like seeing a satelite at night. It was moving slowly towards the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was strange my wife looked for it and saw it as well as my 6 year old and 9 year old. We then noticed another one further east sitting there flickering too. We noticed a smaller light sort of circling the first light, back and forth around the top of it as it got closer to the second light. The first light seemed to become stationary. Another smaller/dimmer light emerged from the second light and began to move away further east.I then began to fantically look for binoculars etc. No such luck. I got the video camera and tried to film this but I do not think I recorded it as it was difficult to se in the viewer.They were very high altitude. Once you took your eyes off of them it was hard to find them again, but we did and this lasted about an hour. We eventually lost track of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

6/11/04 23:00|Ocracoke Island|NC|Other|4 hours|Stange glowing cloud seen by many over pamlico sound north carolina.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51847.html|289|ndxe200406| Stange glowing cloud seen by many over pamlico sound north carolina.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will try to relate this event in as much detail as possible but please understand that this event was as difficult to witness as it is to describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside sitting on a pier with 2 of my friends on a clear balmy june evening. We were looking at the sky(There is virtualy no light pollution on ocracoke island so stargazing is as involuntary as sneezing around here).We noticed very high up some of the &#34;stars&#34;moving in erradic patterns.At first we thought we were seeing very high planes but then they would grow brighter and fade while moving at high speeds.We could not tell if we were seeing one object appear and reappear in another part of the sky or if there were several.Each time we would see a bright flash that faded as it moved sideways.We have all seen this before,we agreed it was a strange thing to see but we have always blown it off as military aircraft since we live close to so many airbases.After watching these lights for 30 minutes or so(they appeared in the south and to the west)we noticed a dim cloud high to the west over the pamlico sound.It was difficult to make out at first but as we watched it appeared to grow in size and brightness.The cloud was extermely high it looked as if it was occuring in the outer atmosphere and it was its own source of light.The 3 of us flabbergasted decided to go to the southern tip of the island to get a better look.As we walked the cloud kept getting brighter and took on a strange greenish hue similar to the bioluminecent green we sometimes see in the waves at night.Once we got to the state ferry dock the cloud had elongated and formed an arc.There at the docks many others had gathered to look at the massive glowing cloud.There was an air of silent awe and disbelif as people were asking each other,what is it?One man started yelling that we were all witnesses to a major event in history.This is history here!! he kept yelling.My friends and i decided to move away from the gathering crowd so we found a small pier to sit on and watch.As we sat there the glowing cloud seemed to be sort of billowing sideways extending itself in a slowly lengthining round tubilar form.It looked to me as if something massive had entered the atmosphere and was slowly making its way down through the diffrent layers.THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE.The inside of the cloud had small wisps in it that were brighter than the gas around them.They had longish tails and ranged from white to light green.I asked each of my friends to describe to me what they were seeing so that i could be sure i was seeing what i thought i was seeing.One of my friends said that to her the shape of the cloud looked like the long curved neck of a crane(the bird).As an hour,then 2 passed the &#34;arc&#34; OR &#34;cranes neck&#34; had turned on its side as it decended lower in the sky and continued to spead out.As it spread the light it carried weakened and the wisps within the cloud disappeared.By 2 in the morning the cloud had completely turned on its side and continued to spread out growing ever dimmer.At three oclock there was still a faint glow in the sky although the shape of the cloud was nolonger decernable.I must backtrack here to try to better descibe what appeared to have happened.It was clear that the cloud had begun much higher than where it vanished.There was a clear sense of depth and dimension in the clouds shape and movement.It seemed that its entry into the atmosphere had affected it via the different layers of air and tempreture it had passed through.By this i mean to say that the turning motion of the cloud appeared to be caused at least in part by air currents.(yes all of this was visable even at night,that is how bright and massive this thing was)What was I thinking?First it was frightening,an event of that magnitude no matter what is a major deal.I came to many conclusions with my friends.1,it was a collision of whatever aircraft we had been witnessing before.2,It was an outer atmosphere nuclear test by the military.3,it was an electromagnetic blast caused by HAARP experiments or 4 We were finally being invaded by someone from out there.But none of these theories explained very much.On its own the cloud was a magnificent phenomena but coupled with the other strange lights in the sky it becomes simply unexplainable a UFO.As I sat in silence with my friends watching the cloud disappear i assumed i would read of it in the paper,or see it on the news,no matter what i thought i would pursue it for the rest of my life.It never made the news that i could tell.My friends contacted others on the nieghboring Cape Hatteras sea shore.Even as some descibed seeing the same cloud thier sightings differed from ours by hours.I decribed this event to a good friend that also lives on the island but was not present that evening,he told me that he had been told the same story a year earlier by a man living on the mainland.The event that I witnessed with so many others had been seen before in the same place.It has taken so long for me to report this because i was unaware of this website.I am hoping that someone else who was there that night will also end up here in thier search for answers and put down thier own description of this awesome event.It may never be revealed to me what this was but it will always remain clear and unforgettable in my mind and i am quite pleased to have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Some kept a stable light while others dimmed it and one was blinking. An interesting detail, that might have been a coincidence is that I remembered to get my camera from the car right before the sightings (to prevent any robery), I tried to film 2 of the sightings and just as I pointed the camera the lights dimmed imediately, so I put it away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a cloudy night and I was walking the dog when I noticed really weird lights in the sky.  The were  faint (not spot lights) you could tell the lights were on the other side of the clouds.  The lights had a center and the lights would join all together then four different lights would all go out different amounts each time.  They would revolve around the center light about 3/4.  Then they would go back in to the center.  Sometimes they would only go out 10 feet other times they would go out  100+ feet.  Then all of a  sudden the light got really bright and took off and that was it.  I&#39;m not some fruitcake or wierdo, It was like nothing else ever seen before.  The others agreed.  We called the TV news and 911 even but  not 2 minutes later the lights were gone.  I never heard anything.  I&#39;ve lived here a while and never seen anything like it.

The objects vary in speed shape and formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family lives in Montville, Ohio.( Geauga County ) We moved to this rural area 8 years ago from Cleveland. We thought UFO&#39;s were a joke. Boy were we ever wrong. My sons and daughter all have seen strange sightings across the street in a cow pasture.We have seen things that were not planes hovering in 1 space or things darting back and forth very fast. We have seen somthing like a fire ball pass over us. I was driving home from work on route 528 going north when something very large and slow stopped over my car. It was lower that trees so I knew it could not be a plane. When I arrived home, my daughter ran to the car and told me I wouldn&#39;t believe her but this strange object flew very low over the house. Her estimated time was close to when I too saw the object. My 13 year old son watches out the window every night for activities in the sky. He watches in disbelief. The most amazing sight I would never forget is when my husband left for work ( 11:00pm). He pulled out of the driveway and down the street.( I always watch him drive away) He could not have been more than 1 or 2 houses away when we noticed ( my three children and myself ) a strange thing in the pasture very close to the road. It was like red and white lights rotating in a circle very very fast. It looked as if it was a few feet above the ground. We watched in amazement. There is no explantation. It could not be kids doing a prank because the movement was too fast. My daughter had a strange experiance 2 weeks ago. She was driving home from Chardon. She said this green light appeared over her car.Her car stopped. Everything in the car stopped working. She said it looked like the other cars on the road stopped too. My son is reading this and is commenting on the different size and colors. He stated that he saw some split into more than one object. My husband has never seen anything and he thinks we are nuts. When I tell people that we see stuff in the sky we get strange looks. We do not report it to officals or sherriff because! we would be laughed at. I am hoping that you read this and take the time to talk with my son.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my mother about some of the sightings a few years back. She did not say anything. She was quiet. And then she told me a story about her brother. He lived in Ashtabula county. He said he saw something in the sky that looked like a spaceship. He was not drinking. He ran into the house to tell his wife to look. By the time they went back out it was gone. My mother thinks he called and reported it. All the townsfolks laughed at him. His family thought he was nuts. This happened over 40 years ago. My mother never thought of this story until I told her. She was worried if I told others that I would be laughed at too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The information I gave above is not correct because I do not know the exact days or times. The objects vary in size, color and shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pasture that most of the sightings happen at was to be an indain burial mound. Do you think this has anything to do with the sightings<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed, but we doubt that the Indian burial ground has anything to do with their sightings.

Our yard is about 1/2 acre.  The circles are dead bermuda grass with live bermuda grass in the rest of the yard.  A few dirt patches happen to cross the lines of dead grass, and there are no tread marks.  There are no tire marks leading into the circle either.  I found a few long strands of the grass, and the part near the root is green.  The part at the very end is also green.  The middle of the strand that crossed the dead zone is brown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a lab-quality ferrous/non-ferrous metal detector to the entire portion of the yard and found nothing unusual in or out of the circle (my first thought was maybe a really old septic tank started seeping through cracks due to the extensive rain).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are no tread marks at all.  This happened immediately after a big rain, so the dirt spots would easily accept tire tracks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are no bent or broken strands of grass, and nothing else seems unusual except for the dead spots.  The geometry is too perfect to be natural.  I know there are lawn diseases that cause brown circles, but the lines are too thin, too much diameter, and too perfect.  There is too much live grass between the circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the outer circle, there are two equally geometric &#34;dashes&#34; as thick as the circle&#39;s line, pointing outward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lots of pictures I will send if you like.  I still want to make sure this email account works before I take the time to zip and attach them.  I have pictures up close, far away, with/without flash, 12-inch ruler in scene, and the strands of crab/bermuda grass that crossed the dead line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lines that make both circles are 5.4 inches wide.  The large circle&#39;s edge is about 27 inches outside of the small circle.  The outer circle is about 8.5 feet in diameter.  The inner circle has a 5 foot 4 inch diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is driving my curiosity level crazy.  Please tell me if you have heard of anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested copies of the photos, and may post one, or more, if they look interesting to us.

I then began to look at he clouds above as there were not many that day as i remember so my eyes began to wander from cloud to cloud until i thought that i had seen some object darting around a one of the smaller clouds. I had to re-focus and take another look to register what i was seeing. The UFO was definitely a sphere and as to my best guess it would seem to be at an altitude that commuter jet aircraft would fly. All I really remember is that the sphere was dancing around this cloud and making incredible turns as if playing around it. I watched in amazement as it would appear in front of the cloud and travel the lenth of what i can compare to three or four football lengths then stop and make almost a 90 turn then go around the back until i would see it appear in front of the cloud again. The color was a silver or gray in nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was in summer, and in the day time. We were playing in the sprinkler right in front of my house on the drive way.  All of a sudden everything got dead silent, the breeze stopped, the birds stopped, everything.   We turned around to look above my house. RIGHT above my house was a medium sized craft hovering.  It was round with two point on the front, it was shaped like a cat head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 40 secs. of it just hovering there, it began to tilt downward towards us.  The points were now facing down at us.  The craft was dark black, and there was a window on front, the window was too tinted so we could not fully see what was inside.  But we could see 2 figueres inside. After about a minute of it sitting there, it flew off as fast as it came and dissapeared behind a cloud.  The breeze and all the sounds soon came back.  And it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I saw a tear drop shaped craft with spinning red lights beaming light into the water. I sprinted to my friends caravan and got him to see. other residents of the camping ground also had seen it. It moved closer towards the beach sending beams of light accross the bay. It made an electrical humming noise and a thundering sound that could easily be heard by Myself and the residents of McKees Domain, Ruby Bay. The craft moved at a phenominal speeds and disapeared and reapeared in different places, it moved up into the sky. The objects seemed to be interested in the aircraft departing and landing at the nelson airport. It was about 20:00 and over the next hour another 6 craft appeared in the sky. The objects in the sky looked like giant orbs of amber light and over the rest of the night the objects moved around the Nelson Harbour and the hills around Ruby Bay. The objects came in close and shot off randomly over the rest of the night until morning. Flat batteries in cars have occured everywhere at the McKees Domain. and dead fish are being washed up on the beach in Ruby Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If, in fact, the object moved as described by the witness, it could not have been a &#34;twinkling&#34; star.

I thought it peculiar so continued watching. After approximately 15-20 seconds I observed that the motion of the bed sheet was very odd. The only way to describe what I was viewing at this point of the encounter, is to say that I was looking at a large bed sheet that was caught in a rising thermal and being tossed around as it rose. However, the bed sheet was traveling across my field of vision in a perfect horizontal path. As it approached, instead of the bedsheet being swirled around in a random pattern, I could see that it was revolving with some regularity around an unseen object and traveling in a deliberate path. When the &#34;bed sheet&#34; got to within 100 yards from me I could CLEARLY make out the &#34;object&#34;. What I saw was a 3D cube floating above the ground oriented standing on end. I dont believe that it was rotating. The only way to describe the outer surface of the object is to say that if you took video footage of a large sheet caught in a rising thermal (the sheet fully spread out and tossing in the thermal) and projected that footage on the outside of the 3D cube... that is what I saw. I watched this object for some 2 minutes and saw it very easily. It moved from NW to SE and my guess to speed would be 100 - 175 MPH. It was slow enough that I could see it plainly and watch it as it finally went out of site over the south easterly foothills outside my office window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We saw some flashing lights in the sky,to the left of the highway and assumed it was a plane except we noticed that it was not moving. My husband said &#34;Must be a helicopter.&#34; I opened the car window to listen for the sounds of a helicopter and there were none.  Then he said &#34;Maybe it is a UFO&#34;,and he was serious. We kept watching and it still did not move. After about 5 minutes it began to move until it seemed to be right above our vehicle.  It was very high up and it was very large. The very bright lights,3 large ones(white,yellowish,red...I&#39;m not sure if there were other colours)were rotating back and forth so that when it was above our car, I was looking straight up out of the front window of the car and I could see that the bottom of this flying object was completely filled in. Not long like an airplane.  At first I thought it was roundish because I think that is what I expected to see but as the lights reflected underneath it looked more triangular.  I was so excited and things happened so quickly that I didn&#39;t pay as much attention to detail as I wished I had.  We stopped the car on the side of the road to take a better look and it then flew away into the direction of Mt Benson.  The last I saw of it, it was either hovering over the valley just below Mt. Benson or above the mountain.  I couldn&#39;t tell by then as we were still driving north on the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When our group left the factory, we headed into the showroom and while heading outside into the crystal showroom, I noticed &#39;something&#39; bobbing around in the sky, above the horizon.  It was bobbing enough to catch my attention and stop and look.  The rest of the group was unaware and headed into the next building.  The object was in the distance between the two lamp posts.  It bobbed for about five minutes, then stopped and was motionless.  It was silver color.  I had my camera in my hand and snapped a picture of it.  I&#39;m still shaking my head as to what I saw.

Saw what appeared to be neither &#34;space debris&#34; but a round object  that was quite shiny, however, the object did not &#34;disintergrate&#34; nor did it travel in a &#34;straight&#34; line, in my personal observation, it may have possibly attempted an &#34;reverse&#34; orbit i.e. it may have tried to get back out of the earths&#39; orbit, I know about aviation and space travel, I have studied aviation in the past, in my opinion this was NOT a &#34;SHOOTING STAR&#34; as most would want to be &#34;swayed&#34; into thinking about, but rather would be of an origin from another space-time continueum, cannot exactly prove what this object was but was very impressed with the way it &#34;handled it-self&#34; when it &#34;retrograded&#34; back into the stratospherical altittude, possibly, and dissappeared.

It was a huge round green pulsing light descending towards the ground.     It was very graceful and just seemed to float.     I have seen many a falling star in this area,  but this was very different.     It appeared to fall over Winnsboro,  La.,  but that is only a guess.     It seemed to come out of the north and was falling in south east.     Other people may have seen it,  but I did not hear anyone say anything to that effect.     Do you have any idea what it was?<n>

They were above the horizon, which made me wonder what it was. I asked my sister to take a look and the two lights merged into one, then back again. I grabbed the binoculars to see if I could tell what it was. That was when I noticed there were many orange and red lights around the side of it. This went on for about ten to fifteen minutes. My sister got scared and decided she was going to her room so she wouldn&#39;t have to see it. I called for my brother and his friends, who were staying the night, to come look. They all four came to see. We each took turns with the binoculars and everyone but my brother, who couldn&#39;t see where we were looking, agreed that they had never seen anything like it. It occasionally got closer to the ground, then rose up higher again. They all decided to go back in the house, but I continued to watch. Almost as soon as they did, it almost dissapeared. Then it turned into one big red light. I called for them to come back and look. Just as they were getting back to the door, it became one large white light again. Then I watched it slowly turn and became really bright, then dim again. Everyone alse went back into the house because they though I was joking, but then it turned red again so I called them back. As they were coming back, it turned into a long line of several red and orange flashing lights, like you would see Christmas lights in their running fashion. It had an orange glow over the top of it. We again took turns with the binoculars watching it slowly rise and sink in the sky. They all went back inside once more and I continued to watch it. After about five more minutes it began to slowly and steadily move towards my right along the skyline. This all went on for about thirty-five minutes until it suddenly was gone and I couldn&#39;t locate it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I first saw its bright light moving through the trees as I stood on my front porch. (I was looking west-northwest, and the sphere was moving from north-northwest to south-southwest.)My 7 year old daughter saw it just a second later, and together we watched it move in a fast, slightly jerking motion, in a fairly straight horizontal path, just above the treetops across the road from us. When it disappeared, I assumed it was behind more trees; my daughter says it disappeared in the open. Looking at the trees in daylight as I report this, I think it may have disappeared, because I should have otherwise still been able to see the brightness through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My husband, my 2 sons, and I went outside for a late night walk and as soon as we reached the road my husband and I saw a bright white light in the sky right above the treetops traveling from the north heading southward and at first we thought it was a plane, jet, or helicopter but when we stopped to watch it we noticed that there were absolutely no sounds what so ever coming from the object.  We then looked more closely at it after realizing that it was not a plane and noticed that there was a red streak type tail off the back of it coming to a point.  It traveled steady and parallel to the earth for about 30 seconds and then it just faded to just a red light, seemed to almost stop, then disappear completely.  We were in &#34;awe&#34; and somewhate disbelief of what we saw and didn&#39;t even mention it to our boys due to the fact that they are 10 and 6 and that would have been the end of our late night walks.  I have never seen anything like that and neither has my husband.  I know that Venus passed by the sun the next day so is it possible that Venus was able to be seen the evening before also?  It looked alot like a shooting star or meteor with the exception that it was alot larger, brighter, and was traveling horizonally instead of vertically and seemed to be just above the treetops. I could not even begin to tell you how high or how big the object was but if you hold your index fingers together and your thumbs together to form a circle and extend you arms all the way out, that is aproximately how large it was in relation to where it was located and how far away it was. It could have been a large object very far away or a fairly smaller object closer to us but it was too bright to really tell but it seemed to be approx. about 100 feet away and up just above the treetops. Please feel free to contact me and let me know if anyone else has reported this same object. I did not know where to look to see if any other strange sighti! ngs were reported that night in this area and this is the first time I have ever gone to a site dealing with this subject. Our neighborhood is very quiet with very few street lights so I doubt it was seen over by us but hopefully it was seen by someone else in Crestview.  It&#39;s kind of difficult seeing something that cannot be defined or explained.  Needless to say, we did not go walking last night or tonight.  Maybe tomorrow though.

It was about 3:30 AM and there was a power surge, so I went to reset the alarm clock. I turned on the TV to check the time and the cable was out. About 5-10 minutes later I looked outside, and hovering above the trees, was a set of 3 lights giving off a lavender glow. The object/s were 3 lights in an arc shape. The color was like nothing I&#39;d ever seen in the sky. I watched it for 5 minutes as each light seemed to change shape. Then, each light slowly dissolved with the light on the far left dissolving first, then the light on the far right dissolving next, and the largest middle light dissolving last finally to a pin prick of light and then there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a big Orange-Redish ball of light passing above my neighbors&#39; houses. It was coming from a South Westernly direction and continued moving to the North East. My father jumped up and said &#34;What ((deleted)) is that!?!&#34; It was moving faster than any satilite that I had ever seen in my Life. Occasionally it would Zig zag here and there. When We could see it no more, I ran inside my house and looked at the clock. I got the Time. It was around 12:40. Then I ran  back outside and I saw a plane that was going from East and going west at a normal speed.

We were in Charing Park in the Craig Henry area of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was partly cloudy, mostly clear skies. We were facing directly at Jupiter, we had been viewing it with the telescope. I just now checked the evening sky map at skymaps.com and found Jupiter to have been due west of us. Earlier, I called the hotline to report our sighting, and I reported on the phone that the object was Northwest of us, but I did say that it was righ next to Jupiter. I correct myself here, for the record, it appeared just a few degrees South of due West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of us were facing the right direction, at the right time. I can&#39;t speak for the other two, but I&#39;m sure I was looking right at it the moment it appeared. It was a bright object, moving from South to North by Northwest OR from South to North with slight declination. It seemed to be moving in a slight arc, but that may have been an illusion created by its trajectory. It first appeared brighter and bigger by far than any of the stars in the sky. It appeared in the sky about as big as the eraser on the back of a pencil, held at arms length. We estimate that it was 30 to 45 degrees above the horizon, we all slightly disagree on this, but  I think it&#39;s a small enough range to consider it an accurate estimate. We all agreed that it travelled a handspan (at arms length) avross the sky, ending one fingers width south and two fingers widths below Jupiter. During this time it flared brightly three times, bright enough to illuminate a small portion of the clouds with each flare. I have been told that a bright flare from an object close above the clouds will light up a large area of cloudcover, but a bright flare from high altitudes will illuminate a smaller area in a &#39;beam&#39;. This was probably the latter. It did not die out in one of the flares. It appeared, in the first instant, a constant intensity, flared, returned to original intensity, flared brighter (I think), back to original intensity, had its third flare, then a distinct period of slightly lower intensity tham at the start, before vanishing without a trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two more observations that we made, but I think are suspect. We all thought it slowed down as it flared, BUT that could easily have been an illusion created by the flares. My other thought on that, and I&#39;m not educated in this, so don&#39;t take my word for it, but maybe if it was something breaking up in the atmosphere it actually would slow down with each flare. We also thought that it may have slightly changed trajectory, its angle descending slightly with each flare, but again, perhaps an illusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In shape, I suppose one could call it a &#34;fireball&#34;. It had no tail, no debris could be seen coming off as it flared, but maybe if it had been daylight we would hae seen debris, or a tail. The colour, though, we had to discuss. After the event, we tried to note all the details right away, but none of us ever said &#34;What colour was it?&#34; So now, 3 hours later, I remember it being red and green, when it flared it was more red with yellow. The other two remember it as being blue/green and flaring just brighter blue/green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So this was all very exciting, seeing a &#34;UFO&#34;, filling out this report, talking to the guy at the UFO report center. But in the end, I really don&#39;t know what we saw. I&#39;ve seen pleanty of shooting stars in my life, and this was worlds apart from a shooting star. This moved way too slow, it was way too big, bright, and flashy!! On the other hand, I have no reason to thinks it&#39;s an &#34;unexplainable phenomena&#34; or a flying saucer. It made no maneuvers, no course change significant enough to be sure of, nothing to indicate that it was controlled. Though on a side note - if AVRO built an actual flying saucer that successfully lifted off, hovered and maneuvered a little then had a rough landing FIFTY YEARS AGO, imagine what 50 years of development would have done. SO I do believe in flying saucers, but not necessarily aliens. I&#39;m pretty sure that what we saw was not a flying saucer, but we did see something. It wasn&#39;t a shooting star, it wasn&#39;t an iridium satellite flare (which I just learned about at heavens-above.com). So what was it? I gave this organization permission to contact me, so if you have any suggestions, or if you witnessed the event, report it to this website and they can contact me. I&#39;d love to get a reasonable explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OH! I almost forgot!

They all moved in unison. if the front one slightly changed in direction so did all 3. kind of if all 3 were attached to a solid object, they always moved together  and in the same direction and they never changed distance between the lights. This flying thing went west and then turned south-west. The craft was also transparent except for the 3 lights. when it moved you could see the stars as it passed under them. when the craft was south west of us, the thing turned slightly and you could faintly see the sides of it. but you could still see through the middle. then the rear left light turned red and then the craft disappeared. This thing was big .  about 200 yards long on the sides and the rear was about 150 yards wide<n>

Seems like if they were satellites, they would eventually catch up to each other or their rates of travel would change some.

There was a reddish pink light moving slowly &#34;up&#34; the sky. I watched it moved, then go in little circles, then move again. It would brighten then dim then brighten.

I yelled for the other folks on the deck to look up and a group of guys all looked up at once to see the chevron fly by. They were moving faster then a normal fighter jets would. There were no running lights or red and green light you would expect to see on a airplane. As the chevron passed by I noticed a deviation of two orbs moving out of formation and then right back into formation. Since we had music playing through outside speakers I could not distingush a sound factor, I would say the chevron was about 15k up, you would think if they were jets you would have heard something. Knowing that other folks on the deck witnessed this event made me feel much more at easy. We all spoke about the event for a while and drop the subject. This was a very strange event, definitly not planes, jets or satellites, these thing were moving at a very fast rate of speed. At first sight I thought it was one unit, but when the deviation out of formmation happend it seemed they were all separate but moving in tandem with each other.I&#39;m a 51 year old , professional business person.

I shot them on June 5th 2004 in Sacramento at the State Capitol. The photos are historical for several reasons. June 5th 2004 is the day an American President died. Secondly the photos show that the flags at the State Capitol are flying at half mast. Thirdly…the photos are rare in that only less than a handful were shot between 8PM through 9PM on the date specified (6/5/2004). Although I losely use the term that less than three people  were shooting photos on the north side of the Capitol. This is not an assumption on my part. This is a fact. History will demonstrate that fact. A UFO perhaps a mile above ground level hovered over the state capitol while I was aiming up at the dome, or rotunda.

Mom was confused by us yelling to get video camera and never did go get this to capture it on film.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The tiny dots were to the west of an old contrail. I got my binoculars and a digital camera. My wife was thr first to see one of the objects in the binoculars. It was red and white, irregular shape, and appeared to be tumbling about very high up. I also witnessed this with the binoculars. It&#39;s position relative to the contrail did not change appreciably. I lost sight of the other object right away. I took several digital photos in the area where I saw the object and one of them captured it, although the resolution is poor. After about 15 minutes I lost sight of this object too. There were no noises, lights or color changes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were observing tiny round, silver balls in the upper atmosphere that appeared to be stationary. Occasionally they came together to make a pattern, then &#34;flew&#34; apart but stayed in the same general area.  One of the guests remarked that he sees them all the time as he lives near Selfridge Air National Guard Base. He stated that other planes are not allowed to fly in or out when the balls are hovering. I asked what they were and he replied that &#34;no one knows&#34;. Another guest, an off duty policeman, said they were weather balloons.  I wonder if air balloons in the upper atomosphere can remain stationary in the strong winds of that level. The balls stayed in the one spot in the sky for about 1.5 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I couldn&#39;t discern an aircraft shape per se, just a shing object that appeared to be 8 to 10 miles to the south.  It was traveling at a pace one would expect of a small plane, and appeared to be 5,000 agl.  (Lake Alpine is 7,300.)  I watched it travel south for 10 or 15 seconds and suddenly it abruptly changed directions (now S.W.) and shot out of sight in a very short time, two or three seconds.  There was no sound.  This is the fourth (similar) incident I have seen here in Calaveras County since moving here nearly four years ago, but this is my first report<n>

Upon returning to bed at 0415 June 5, 2004 and looking out large window on second story with unobstructed view to the south from our hillside home, I noticed a strange bright star? I continued into master bedroom and then backed up and walked over to side window for second look. The object was gleaming in the sky with star shape form with red tint around center with an estimated distance of 3,500 south and 500&#39; from ground. I rubbed my eyes and continued to watch for ten (10) minutes prior to waking my wife. We then both continued to observe the star like object for several minutes with object maintaining horizontal and vertical position. After approximately 8 minutes the object started to move towards us, north, and to the west the and rapidly moved up behind homes to the west of our home approximately 500&#39; due west. The object was now heading due north behind homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As object moved, we ran down stairs and out the front door. The object moved out from behind and directly above neighbors home and shape appeared to be diamond shape with cylinders at each corner extending up 20&#39; high with white light, bright white light! It appeared to be solid light. The object was estimated to be 150&#39; to 185&#39; long. I purposely listened for any type of engine sound similar to aircraft, none detected. As the object gracefully moved past or from behind house accross street, it headed west with out tilting like typical aircraft and settled below ridge west of neighbors home with out noise and with in 150 to 300&#39; of horizontal distance/travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife contacted police department. She also contacted Mather Airport and Sacramneto Airport, both denied having any aircraft with in 2 miles of location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a Project Manager in the Heavy Construction field for about 20 years, and my wife was a Flight Attendant for a major airline for about 13 years, and now a stay at home mom with 3 children.<n>

This is the second report I have filed with you and this event happened approximately 10 miles from the first event (green fireball).  We were driving home from Bolivar at about 3:30 in the morning on 64 highway.  This particular stretch of the road has several hills on it.  My room-mate was asleep in the passenger seat, and as I start to crest the top of one of the hills, there on the side of the road is what would almost appear as someone sitting on a bike.  I honestly believe that it was not human, and it wasn&#39;t actually a bike.  It was sitting on a silver triangle shaped frame the point of the triangle pointing at the ground.  Honestly it was like no metal I have ever seen.  It had no wheels on it. (just a note I had my high beams on so we both got a really good look at it)  Whatever this thing was that was sitting on the bike was dressed entirely in this white/silverish material.  It had a full faced helmet on, but not like a motorcycle helmet.  It only had a small black oval at the eye area for it to see out of.  Neither of us saw any kind of skin what-so-ever. Every inch of it&#39;s body was covered.  Now it was a very hot night.  There is no way it was a person sitting on a bicycle completely covered including gloves and boots, it just doesn&#39;t make sense. It almost seems like the thing wanted us to see it.  You know when a car passes you at night and they have their bright lights on, you can&#39;t really see into the car.  But this thing, it was almost like in slow motion, looked right at us as we drove by.  I looked at my room-mated and asked her if she had seen it, and she replied that yes she had.  She had been dead asleep and woke up for some reason, just as we were passing this thing.  It scared me bad enought that I quickly rolled up my window and punched the gas.  I just knew that this thing was going to come up beside me on the road which thankfully it didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This triangle had no lights or reflectors on it of anykind.  We drove back by that area the next day to check it out.  And the place that we saw it was at the end of a dirt road that joins highway 64 with no houses around for at least 5 miles.  I know it was not some farmer sitting on the edge of the road on a bike at 3:30 in the morning in a silver outfit with matching boots, gloves, and helmet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Passed directly above the house and could clearly see a formation of 3 lights in a perfect triangle which had its point away from the direction it was travelling. The front had 2 massive square lights giving out this amazing light.

Was head south, approaching I-40, and just happened to glance up at the full moon. Just to the left of it, was what I can only describe as a fireball, headed SSE at an incredible rate of speed. It was about 1/10 the size of the full moon. I stared at it while driving for almost 10 seconds, and lost it in the lights of a mall parking lot as I passed. I looked in the local paper websites to see if anyone reported anything, but haven&#39;t seen any info on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have observed several of them over the years but this one was different somehow. The light seemed to pulsate. I can’t really say but it did capture my attention. As I watched it crossing the night sky it suddenly made a right angle turn on a dime and accelerated to an incredible speed and streaked off to the west. As it did this what looked like a small streak of light shot passed right where the object had been moments before. It seemed as if this streak of light came from the ground up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This night we were sitting on our deck star gazing and tracking satellites.  We are only able to see a small portion of the west and northwest sky above and between the trees in our yard from this vantagepoint.   It was a partially clear night with a sporadic cirrus partial overcast.  We observed many planes and satellites.  The satellites were very visible when the sun reflection was prominent and would fade as they tracked across the sky.   Additionally, these lights would fade and reappear as they past through the wispy clouds.  Pretty typical sky watching fair.   At this time of year, at this time of night, the Big Dipper is at about 1:00 to the W NW.  Perpendicular to the bottom of the cup of this constellation and at a distance near equal to twice the length of Big Dipper is a bright star (planet?)  As I was gazing in the general direction of this bright star, another apparent satellite appeared over the treetop.  It came out of the west and was the same brightness and size of the star.  It was tracking toward us just to the left of it.  I called my wife’s attention to it and we watched it move.  Perhaps it was the viewing angle, but it seemed to slow in the sky.  Then there was an appearance of a momentary horizontal flash that emanated outward from opposite sides of this light.  The total length of this flash was perhaps a centimeter at arms length. The light then returned to its original size and brightness and changed direction.  As it traveled to the right, it got smaller and smaller, then turned orange or dim red and faded from view.  Interestingly, right after the flair manifestation, a shooting star was observed behind and to the left of the light.  (It was quite distant, only travelling an inch or so at arms length.)  At no time did this strange light travel past my sight line with the bright star, always staying to it’s left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Flash from Iridium satellite.

I am currently babysitting my grandchild fulltime.     My daughter and I were on their deck at about 8:30 or a little after because I was telling her about the curious jet/chem trails I had seen earlier in the day. We noticed a jet in the distance going straight up, and I mentioned how odd that seemed to me... I see them every so often and wonder where they came from... anyhow, we watched it for a minute or two, and then it just disappeared, the trail ending abruptly. We remarked that that was odd, because we could no longer see the &#34;jet&#34; either.   A few seconds later, we noticed an object moving in a south easterly direction which meant it was horizontally moving right out where we were looking... which was to the north.  As it came closer, we could see that it was actually more of a stunted blimp shape, but cigar shape is the closest to it that you have for me to choose from here. I was, I believe either silver or gold...<n> <n><n> <n><n> the sunset seemed to make it look slightly reddish, but I could tell it was not red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved slowly overhead..we could both see it clearly. We waited to hear a sound, so we could be sure whether we were looking a plane or not. One can hear the sound of a jet that is so high you can barely see it. This object was not that high at all. NO sound. Nothing. We both watched it until my daughter suddenly asked her husband to get the camera. He ran to get it, and she tried to get a shot of it, but said it didn&#39;t appear in her sights. It didn&#39;t register. It was pretty much gone by then anyhow. Just wish we had thought of the camera right off. Would have been a great photo opportunity. Her husband saw it too, but didn&#39;t seem interested. It was her birthday, so I just looked at her and said &#34;Happy birthday. You have seen your first UFO. The only reason I feel so is that this object definitely did not have wings, was certainly &#34;metallic&#34; (not a blimp) And was absolutely silent in its passage.

I was watching the cloud formations move over Cedar Mt. blocking the sun.  I was also watching planes before the clouds started moving in.  We were watching clouds forming faces ect.  We were just sitting back relaxing and I saw a dark dot south of us moving northeast.  As I watched it I  was trying to figure out what it was. As it got closer I was looking for  wings and thats when  I SAID TO MY friend I see no definition to it. By then it was getting closer. We could see something dark that looked like a squsished donut. It was oblong but not too long.  Then the horses, dogs, two loose goats, started acting up, the wind started blowing, a cottonwood branch fell and and all three of us felt strange after that.  The wind was blowing just a little north of west, at about 20 to 30 mph. It lasted 10 or 15 minutes.  We observed the object for 2 to 3 minutes but the time is hard for me to calculate, it could have been 5 min. We ran around a tree to look at it, because the tree leaves were starting to block our view.  Then we couldn&#39;t see it so we ran around the corral which took 6-9 sec.  Then there was nothing. no sign of it.  I stood there with 2 other people looking, wondering where it went.  One of the two witnesses started crying and her friend who did not see the object consoled her.  she was worried that something bad was going to happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

While I cannot conclusively say that what I saw was an object or in fact a meteorological annomely, it can certainly be called unidentified.  I have a good amount of knowledge in astronomy and physics at a university level. In fact, science and in particular cosmology/astronomy are key components to how I make my living. It is this reason, that I need to really stay annonymos in this context anyway.  This object that I saw clearly moved slowly across the sky in an orbital path as opposed to moving along the ecliptic.  It can best be described as a cloudlike smudge not unlike a comets tail and was in the shape of a sickle when viewed edge on(with a 10% rotation on the x axis)  There was an occassional shimmering and small flashes as in traveled N to S.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was outside observing the moon with my brand new 2 day old telescope. I was observing the moon which was located SW then I decided to take a look at jupiter which was west. When I got my telescope to turn it west I saw 2 stars SW. They were really bright stars. THey acually looked like very close bright planets. I then started to aim my telescope at the objects and when I looked back up one of the objects started to fade away. Then thats when i knew I was looking at something out of this world. The first UFO faded away, I wanted to take a look at them with the telescope but I hesitated and ran and banged on the window to call my sister out but instead I startled her. I was still looking at the last UFO then it started to fade away also. By the time my sister came out it was already gone. All this happend probly within 30-60 seconds. My heart was pounding because iv never seen anything like that in my life before. The objects were really bright. Kind of like a planet but 10 times brighter. My telescope was still aiming where the objects were located so i took a look in the telescope. I then saw a dark Circle with a really really thin line of light from the moon. Whatever the thing was it was still there but I was guessing it was stealthed. If there were any other reports similer to mine please contact me please.

6/3/04 21:00|Doylestown|PA|Changing|8 minutes|A rectangular-shaped object with glowing orange neon lights surrounding its perimiter with separating  and high speed capabilities|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68273.html|384|ndxe200406| A rectangular-shaped object with glowing orange neon lights surrounding its perimiter with separating  and high speed capabilities<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter(2nd witness)and I were driving home; approximately a quarter of a mile before our home, we both looked up to the most amazing sight we had ever seen: a rectangular shaped object, about the size of a large truck, with orange neon glowing lights around its entire perimeter, hovering above what appeared to be our house.  As we drove down the winding hills to our home, our eyes were glued to the sky.  I don&#39;t know how I drove.  When we arrived at our long driveway, the object separated into two glowing objects which were changing their shapes slightly, but were definitely separating.  They then rejoined and shot down in a straight line toward the earth, resembling an elevator; a glowing elevator. We were stopped in our driveway at this point.  As we drove closer to the garage, the object seemed to shoot off a small saucer-shaped, also orange neon and glowing in the same fashion, object which moved very rapidly toward Doylestown Airport which was behind our backyard, lined with trees.  At the same time, the large ship shot off into the distance and was absolutely gone in a second, it seemed. At this point, my daughter and I were in shock; I told her to get my husband because I knew he would never believe it.  I remained outside alone for several seconds, and the small glowing ship was now hovering behind the trees, practically close enough to the ground to say it could have even landed.  I felt that it was watching me. When my daughter and husband came outside, my husband saw it and didn&#39;t know what to make of it, but told us to get in the house immediately. We had a movie camera with my daughter&#39;s school project on it, and we began filming this orange light from our kitchen window.  The orange light and its movement was captured on film, also as it darted away into the distance very rapidly.  Although my husband did not see what we like to refer to as the &#34;mother ship,&#34; he did, at least, see the smaller &#34;saucer,&#34; which, however, was nothing compared to the large object.  My daugh! ter and I knew from that day forward that this was of another world.  I tried calling the police department, the airports, news stations, etc., the following morning, but there were no reports.  We were left feeling that this was a very personal experience.  From other reports that I read, it doesn&#39;t seem as if anyone has ever seen this type of UFO. The most similar report that I can associate it with is that which the airforce men saw way back while flying; I believe that was a huge orange neon long ship as well.  There is even more to tell, but I need to know if you would like to hear the rest? Even more intriguing.  If I were alone that night, I would have admitted myself to Bellevue.  Thank goodness my daughter and I shared this magicial moment, an experience and bond we will share forever.  By the way, it was not a frightening experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They showed it a few times and close up and they have no idea what it is.

It has bothered me since, trying to figure it out with reason.  It is the perfect shape of an octagon with sides being equal to the other.  It can&#39;t be the moon, not a reflection; is it a planet?  I&#39;m really perplexed.  Could you take a look at him and give me a verification.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to reflect sunlight during the entire sighting and alternated between a metallic silver and a metallic red.  It was quite bright and flew in an erratic manner.  At first I thought that it was just a metallic foil balloon, but after observing it longer and based on my perspective with the Sandia mountains, I estimated the distance to have been 5-6 miles.   Given the estimated distance it was flying much faster than a typical small aircraft or helicopter would.  Best guess at size would be 10&#39;-15&#39; in diameter.  It disappeared behind a small mountain in the Sandia chain and was not seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was overcast with cirrus  type clouds at various levels.  The temperature was probably in the  70&#39;s.  At about 12 o&#39;clock in front of me I saw a bright round object  that resembled a large star.  It was approximately 45 degrees  (altitude) from the horizon.  Travel was from east to west.  Velocity  is unknown, but it traveled about 90 degress from in front of me to the  west in about a minute.  It was slow, as much so as a prop plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most curious thing is that I was wearing sunglasses.  They are  probably somewhat polarized.  I looked over the glasses to try to see a  contrail.  The object just seemed to &#34;disappear.&#34;  When I looked  through them again, I could see the bright object again.  I looked over  my glasses for the second time and could see only sky.  Sun was behind  me.  I could only see the object through my glasses!  Cloaking?  ET?  Terrestrial?  As far as I know, I am the only one to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen planes in the evening look somewhat like a bright star, but  not around noon.

I am submitting this because I heard that lights in the sky had been seen at this time by others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound began with a series of soft booms like distant fireworks in rapid succession, lasting about 5 seconds.  It then gradually smoothed to a low rumble, and maintained the same volume for perhaps another 5 seconds.  During the next and final 5 seconds it very gradually faded away, so gradually that I was not sure when it was completely gone.  I am familiar with the tendency for people to overestimate the duration of events, so this morning I ran several timed tests with a stopwatch, reciting to myself the changing nature of the sound, and only looking at the watch after.  I consistently measured within 2 seconds +- of 15 seconds, trying 4 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound occurred at 2:44 am according to my nightstand digitial clock, which I subsequently found to be about 15 seconds fast relative to WWV.  I do not know the time more precisely - there is no seconds indication on the clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound was not loud: it did not awaken my wife sleeping next to me, and I only heard it because I happened to be awake.  At first I thought it was the precursor rumbling to an earthquake, having experienced the 2001 magnitude 6.8 Nisqually quake.  When I realized that it was not being followed by shaking, I thought it must be a heavy jet transport leaving Sea-Tac airport.  We can occasionally hear those, although they typically do not depart at 3 in the morning.  Then I recall noting that the sound had a real &#34;feel&#34; to it, even though it was muted, and I could sense the pressure waves, not just hear the sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to sleep thinking it might have been a distant earthquake.  The next morning, the 6 am local news mentioned that a number of people had reported lights and fireballs in the sky &#34;a few minutes&#34; before 3 am.  I did not see any lights, but I was not facing a North-facing window.  This sound may be connected to those sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Dramatic meteor.  PD))<n>

As I turned my head to the right (NNE: North-North-East toward Victoria, BC.) it increased in brightness and the whole area was lit up very bright. I did not see the object as I was in a mini-van in the drivers seat and the object would have been above the roof of the van. I immediately pulled over to the right and got out to see if I could see anything. I thought because of the brightness that it may have been a Nuclear Reactor accident somewhere but the flash only lasted 3 seconds. I also thought it could possibly have been lightning but there were no clouds. The sky was clear and had the glow of the full moon toward SW: South-West. I looked around to see if anyone else saw it and didn&#39;t find anyone that late at night. I did eventually find a Taxi Driver at 2:45 AM who saw it and he thought it was an electrical box on a telephone pole that blew. He said it was sooo bright and blue-ish that it blinded him and he couldn&#39;t figure out what it was. I called 911 about 2:47 AM and reported it and they said they were getting calls from all over the county and they thought it may be a meteor. Radio stations later that morning were speculating the it could have been a meteor or &#34;Space Junk&#34; from used rockets or a satelite falling into Earths atmosphere. They also reported that there was a boom sound even though I did not hear that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Dramatic meteor.  PD))<n>

I was concerned because he was gone a long time and rarely gets up in the middle of the night.  I had opened my eyes and was about to head downstairs when i saw a very bright flash coming through the small window above my head.  I waited to hear a car backing up as i assumed it had driven in our driveway.  There was NO NOISE and it was eerily quiet.  I instinctively looked at the clock which read 2:40 am which is very out of character for me.  IN my head i heard that its important to note the time.  Then i started getting worried because i thought of an alien ship and my boyfriends previous encounters with things unexplained.  So i raced downstairs half expecting him not to be there.  He was at the foot of the stairs which made me jump.  I asked him if he saw the light and he said yes. Then we both heard a rumble and he exclaimed that it was probably thunder and lightening. I didn&#39;t believe that it was lightening since it was too bright.  Intuitively i felt that it was much more than a meteor when i heard about it the next day.  Inexplicably i have been trying to find out more information which would satisfy me...i have become rather obsessed i&#39;m afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a contemporary ((type deleted)) artist, female ((fifties)) years old with a degree in ((social sciences)); my boyfriend is a ((exotic construction)) expert and is ((forties)) years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Dramatic meteor.

I was sitting up in bed and saw a very bright light cross the skylight above.  It appeared to travel west to east.  Initally, the light was white, then changed to orange.  Based on the brightness I would have judged it to be the hovering height of a search helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a moment I thought it was a helicopter, but there was no accompanying helicopter noise.  My next thought was a marine flare, but I am not near the water.  Shortly after seeing the intense light, I heard a sound similar to fire-cracker bursts. I then thought it must have been a fire work, such as a roman candle, although it seemed much to bright for that, and described it as such to my room-mate over breakfast.  I was relieved to have a more reasonable identification when I heard about meteorite sightings on late morning radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Dramatic meteor over Seattle.  PD))<n>

I had been there for several hours just watching the home and area. The weather was clear and not many clouds - if any at all, the day had been clear and sunny. Then at that time (about 0240 hrs in the am) I observed the entire sky light up. It wasnt continuous but rather &#34;flickered&#34; - if that explains it .. several hours later I heard on the news of a possible meteor breaking apart or something .. interesting …<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Dramatic meteor seen over Seattle.

It was very bizzare.  I was sitting in bed talking to my husband who was standing in the doorway.  We have sliding glass doors facing west.  The door way is exactly to the opposite of where my husband was standing.  The louvres were closed.  All of a sudden there was a tremendous bright white light that lit up the room like one of those old fashioned photograper flashes, but slower.  My first thought was it must be a large lightening bolt, but when we ran to the doors and opened them up there was a full moon and a clear sky.  Our enclosed backyard does not face anything that could have made such a light and we checked to make sure no one had broken into backyard through locked gates.  Maybe it was a meteor--unfortunately we didn&#39;t see the cause of the flash of light, but it must have been terribly bright to light the room up like it did. There was no sound from whatever the source of light was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Dramatic meteor over Seattle.  PD))<n>

I noticed to my SouthWest a bright object and at first I thought nothing of it because I live near the airport. However I kept noticing that it would get really bright and then go dim to the point where I couldn&#39;t see it. I also noticed that it wasn&#39;t moving much. I was trying to be rational but when I went and grabbed my binoculars I saw something about this light that was pretty amazing ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw 6 or 7 small red balls of light shooting downward out of this light or whatever it was. I then remembered a UFO documentary that I saw one time but I can&#39;t remember which one but it was exactly like the video that I saw on that show. The video showed exactly the same thing I saw and I remember in that video there were several people watching and making comments as these red balls of light were dropping/ shooting out of this object. Of course I called several newstations and at the time I called they had no reports of this but I clearly saw the &#34;red balls&#34; of light dropping out of the light or object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((personal information deleted))<n>

There was no sensible pattern to the blinking of the lights sometimes 5 white and 7 red and then 13 white and 2 red would blink on and off, and not all at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told ((name deleted)) to look at it and he said he couldnt because he was driving.  We were about 30 seconds from his development so when we pulled into his neighborhood i leaned out the window and looked above the car and the craft was right over me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time from underneath it i could make out it&#39;s shape instead of a huge cluster of lights.  It looked like a triangle but along the bottom of the triangle, it was inverted, like someone had cut a triangular peice out of it.  It was so close to the ground if I would have shot at it with a paintball gun i could have hit it and made no noise at all, just a dull humming like when your refrigeator kicks in in the middle of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see the outline of what looked like seams in the metal (which was dark) that looked like it had been welded together ( there were little dark dots along the seam).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am screaming for him to stop the car and look at this thing but he saide we were almost at his treet and to hold on (he&#39;s very skeptical).  When he finally parked the car we both jumped out and ooked across the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved into view between the rooves of two neighboring houses across the street and then hovered (a little wobbly) for about 25 seconds in the same spot where we both got a great look at it. The lights wre around the outside of it now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I held up my hands and tried to measure it between the two of them and it was about 6 or 7 inches which means that for as far away as it was, it had to be HUGE to appear that big from my point of perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it just glided back out of view behing the houses from the direction it had come from.  We ran down to the end of the street and tried to see it again but by that time it was way off in the distance and just a cluster of randomly pulsating lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say my boyfriend is no longer a skeptic. for some reason it wont let me put the date right. it was june 2 2004 not 1904<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Normally there are three planes that have the same route fairly close together and I always watch them pass. The first was at 23:11 the second was 23:13 and the third was 23:20 as I was watching this last plane coming towards me all of a sudden a very bright circular looking light appeared not far behind the plane. This was not another plane it was to close and just one very bright white light it seemed to stay at the same pace with the plane for a few seconds then it just stopped for a second it stayed that way then it dimmed a notch so to say then a second later it dimmed another notch a second after that it just went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was just after 11pm on 2nd June 2004. My wife, me and our three children were walking around the garden at the rented villa when my son and I spotted a very large transparent triangle in the sky. We believe it came from the north and was heading north-west. It appeared to travel in a straight line for 2-3mins with changes in speed. It was totally silent. The triangle was travelling on it&#39;s side with the main point facing 9 O&#39;clock. Within the main point was a piercing white circular light. When the triangle faded out of sight to the west, we were drawn to the north again where we saw a huge white shaft of light on the horizon which started from the ground and reached as high as you could see. A friend in Southampton, England confirmed the same sighting by mobile two days later. The locals and radio were talking about the sighting for the next few days. The date and time are accurate. The strange thing is that we saw a fighter jet earlier that afternoon on the same flight path. At all times the skies were crystal clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But then I noticed there was no trail and it was symmetrical and solid.  It was traveling south at a high rate of speed as the military jets do when they fly the treetops around here but it was dark.  There was only one light and no flashing lights the way aircraft have. From my perspective it was about twenty percent the size of the moon.  It seemed to gain altitude and then went around the tip of the mountain to the south the way a military jet would, made a left turn and disappeared.  It was very fast and very smooth.  It had no flashing lights and made no sound.  It was too fast for a helicopter.<n>

I ran to get a second witness, the second person looked through the telescope and also saw the large shadow.  After about 15 minutes passed I noticed the shadow to be moving across the surface of the moon.  As it moved across the surface it also began getting smaller, as if the object casting the shadow was moving further from the surface of the moon.  When the shadow reached the far end of the moon, it moved into dark space and I was able to see the shape of an object moving through space, but could not make out detail.  It definitely appeared to be moving under it&#39;s own power!<n>

The light source rapidly moved outwards from the initial point. It had a definite and prominent tail as it appearded to accelerate away, moving at &#34;light&#34; speed, and disappearing in 8-10 seconds into space about half way between Jupiter and the Big Dipper, to the west of us.

Once it approached us and got near it was nearly 50 ft. above trees maybe less just coasting.  Again, no sounds what so ever where heard from the object.

6/1/04 21:30|Rimrock|CA|Other|10 minutes|Three objects appeared in the sky|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37332.html|420|ndxe200406| Three objects appeared in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting on the front porch and I walked out to shut the driveway gate as my husbands was shutting off the water and to my left up just above the hills was a bright orange glow. I hollered at my husband to look and he came over and we watched it for awhile to see if it was moving which it was not. My husband noticed two others that were not nearly as big or as bright, to the right of the orange one. One was purple and the other was greenish in color. About 4 minutes after noticing them they just went out. About two minutes later they were on again just as bright and in the same position in the sky. I ran in and grabbed my camera. I manged to snap one photo and went to take another when the bright orange object went out. In the second photo only the two smaller ones appear. We waited to see if they would appear again but they did not. We did notice that it seemed to get about 10 dergress warmer after the last sighting for a brief time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

For some reason while we were walkin I glanced over my shoulder behind me.  I saw something in the sky kind of moving slowly.  I didn&#39;t think anything of it, figured it was an airplane. I turned back and continued walking, only getting a few more steps when what was in the distance behind us was right above us.  It was enormous.  It was disk shaped with diferent colored flashing lights around it.  I remember that it kind of reminded me of the Simon game.  It wasn&#39;t quite either, this thing was so loud it sounded like a whole fleet of airplanes.  It hovered above us at tree height for about 1 minute then it was gone in a blink ok an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just want to let anyone know who maybe reading this, that I am certainly no quack.  I am now 36yrs old a mother of a 7 year old daughter and an office manager.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/1/04 18:00|Spanaway|WA|Changing|About half an hour|The outside rim of the objects seemed to wave all around like a fish's tail would, its very hard to describe.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56071.html|422|ndxe200406| The outside rim of the objects seemed to wave all around like a fish&#39;s tail would, its very hard to describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening Myself, my brother and my grandmother stepped out onto our back porch and noticed some odd black shapes in the sky about two or three miles behind our back yard above a tree line.  Using binoculars we were able to get a better view, I noticed they were all black, yet the outer rims seemed to wave all around the circular shape of the object.  IT was odd and it’s a bit hard to describe what it actually looked like, though if you look at the tail fin on a fish, and how it waves through the water, from top to bottom, that might help to get an idea of how it looked.  That’s the only thing I was able to imagine that looked like it.  Once we saw the few that had appeared first a few more just appeared out of no where, then they slowly started moving up into the sky towards the few clouds that were there and also left and right, then down a bit, then stopped in mid air and floated and a few more came, then moved up into the clouds and we didn’t see any others after that.  Not one of us can explain what they were, they were not planes, they were not balloons, they were not birds, we could see them with the binoculars and how they moved, it was...odd and unexplainable , for us at least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I flagged down the US letter carrier and pointed them out - he saw the 3 objects plainly as we watched them together.  Then we saw two Mormon missionaries and I pointed the objects out to them.  One of the boys saw the three objects, the other one did not.  The objects appeared to be round and reflected the sunlight occasionally.  They were mostly white and there were no colors or sound.  When I first saw them, I also saw a biplane heading east to west in their vecinity, but the objects were higher in the sky.   The objects were moving slower than the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and with the U. S. postal employee, and we found them both to seem quite serious-minded and credible.  We do not know what it was they observed.  PD))<n>

I heard a jet coming and was looking overhead to see it pass.  This area is the direction the jets pass for landing at the San Francisco Airport.  I couldn&#39;t see it so I was then looking approximately southwest and about 80 degrees above horizon and saw a lightening fast dot very, very high in the sky.  It passed then the jet flew overhead and it seemed so slow compared the the dot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

Seen by thousands of people!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if you know already about it but in June 1rst, 2004 every people in Portugal could see a light in the sky... Some people film it, other take a photo from it... Some radars, not all of them, from AFBs localized in the south capted it...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The notice can be seen in http://www.rtp.pt/index.php?article=110898&amp;visual=5 (it is in portuguese) and the european space station denies that can be a satellite or atmospheric/astronomic phenomenon but cannot give an explanation for it... The wird of all this is that some scientist came to the tv and said, on june 2nd that it was certainly a meteorological satellite, but in june 3rd they said it was &#34;space trash&#34;!!! Well, people are confused and don&#39;t know in what to believe... Maybe in a few days they give a correct explanation but if they don&#39;t do it I think me and all people from portugal saw a big and bright light surrounded by smoke on that night coming from out of space…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports of this event in Portugal.  PD))<n>
