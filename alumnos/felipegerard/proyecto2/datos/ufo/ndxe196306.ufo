My question is do you have any interest in old reports?   I had an encounter in 1963 with my brother and the next door neighbor, I was eight at the time but still remember it rather well.   I also have a sighting five years ago with two disk and I know a man locally with a sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one with the local man here is interesting to me anyway, he is now into refrigeration repair on businesses.  This story was told to me while we were having lunch together and we got to talking about jobs we had.  He had a small aircraft parts delivery business and mentioned he was a security officer at Malstrom AFB just north of us here in Great Falls Montana when he got out of High School.   The interesting part was I asked him about his time there and one thing lead to another.  His job was to watch over the nukes, he was called out to investigate a alarm.  When he showed up with his partner they noticed a glowing 10 foot diameter object over the concrete top on the missile.  They watched it for 20 minutes when it moved toward town, he said they could keep up with it till it got to the other side of town.  He them radioed in and two jets were sent and he could still see the craft when the jets went bye with after burners on.  He was later told to be quite about it but was told ! the craft was clocked at 4000 MPH when lost over Belt Montana.  He is a rather religious guy and when I asked him if he thought there were alien he said that stuff is B.S.  He did tell me he thought they were Russian crafts because this happen in the 1970&#39;s and the Russian&#39;s were watching us.  ((name deleted))<n>

6/26/63 23:40|Naha (Japan)||Circle|3 minutes|Stealth flying craft were not developed until many years later.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64958.html|9|ndxe196306| Stealth flying craft were not developed until many years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> June 1963 Naha Air Base, Okinawa, Japan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my tour of duty at Naha Air Base, Okinawa, sky watching for aircraft arrivals and departures became a favorite pastime. On one clear night, my Airman buddy ((name deleted)) and I raised our binoculars scanning the skies for aircraft. From experience, we could accurately identify most aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Standing on the second floor sundeck of our barracks, we had an unobstructed view of the runway and skies over the air base. Although we sky-watched for over an hour we saw nothing. Nearing ten o’clock, we became bored, so we opted for stargazing. Frank had much knowledge about the regions of the stars in our galaxy. He had just begun pointing out a few of the more common constellations when it happened. Something strange appeared out of the corner of his left eye. It was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Look! What the hell is that?” Frank yelled. “Marty do you see that?” “Yeah Frank, I see it. Holy mackerel, what is it?” Scared and grateful for Frank’s presence, my first instincts told me to get the hell away from there. However, despite my tendency to panic and run, I had a strange and intense compulsion to keep on watching. At the same time, I was ready to bolt back into the barracks for cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like nothing we had ever seen before. I positioned my binoculars for a better look. We did not use the term “UFO” at that point, but we knew the craft we saw did not match anything in the Air Force’s aircraft inventory. We saw a large, slow-moving disk traveling in a steady northerly direction--right smack over our base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not see the usual flashing navigation lights or red and green wing-tip lights.  All pilots who fly at night must have their aircraft’s navigation lights turned on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not just an unusual cloud formation, flares or a weather balloon. In the Air Force, working as communications specialists at control towers and around busy flight lines, Frank and I became knowledgeable about most types of aircraft in the military inventory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled at an estimated speed of one hundred knots. The craft held a steady altitude of three or four thousand feet. It had a diameter of about seventy-five feet. We saw no antennae, dome, windows or markings. It was silent and produced no engine noise. Having a disk shape, it looked as flat as a quarter.  The craft’s outer surface appeared smooth, constructed of a dull, yet reflective metallic material. Its outer edges appeared razor thin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;If it turns toward us, I’m out of here,&#34; I said shaking all over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Me too,&#34; Frank agreed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our fear level started to dwindle once we realized that it continued moving away from us. To afford us a better view, we climbed up the building’s fire ladder to gain access to the roof. First up the ladder, I hesitated at the top of the ladder and peered out to see if it was safe to advance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Hold it Frank!” I said stopping to look and be sure the craft had not made a turn toward us. Since it continued moving away—“Let’s go Frank!” I said. “It’s still heading north.” I had an eerie feeling that we were about to place ourselves in a vulnerable position on the roof. However, seeing it continued to move farther away from us, our first fear that alien creatures might spot us subsided. Raising my binoculars again, I noticed that it had reflected a noticeable degree of light coming from Naha City, found a few miles to the north of our base. We watched it until it faded away out of sight. The entire sighting lasted for about two and one-half minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “We’ve got to tell someone,” Frank said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After scrambling down the fire ladder, we sprinted to a staircase leading to the first floor. We reached the C.Q. or Charge of Quarters room to use the barracks phone. We had to tell someone in authority. By then, Frank had begun to hyperventilate. I told him to sit down in a chair and stay calm while I called the base control tower operator. From frequent visits to the control tower for communications equipment issues, I intuitively remembered and dialed the correct number.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Tower—Airman First-Class Bernard speaking.” His voice had a calming effect on me. I knew Airman Bernard by his first name, George. Since he occupied the same barracks as we did--ate in the same mess hall and from my many visits to the tower for communications repairs, he knew me as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “George,&#34; I said, trying to catch my breath. “This is Marty from the Communications Squadron.” “I didn’t put a call in for any problems,” George said. “How are you? Wait a minute—let me turn off the phone recorder.” His first impression was that my call was for something unrelated to tower business--perhaps it referred to a question about stereo equipment—one of his favorite hobbies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “No George,” I suggested. “You better leave it on for this.” “So, this is official business huh,” he commented with an official sounding tone of voice. “All right, I turned it back on. What’s up?” “Did you see it?” I asked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “See what?” he replied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “That huge disk-shaped object that flew over the airstrip just two minutes ago.” “I didn’t see anything. Are you sure?” he asked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “I’m sure George. Frank saw it too. We watched it from the roof of the barracks.” After I described what we saw, Bernard paused for a few seconds considering his next action.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “That’s weird,” he said. “Hold on while I check with the radar center.” Waiting for Bernard’s report, I noticed that Frank had calmed down while he listened to my conversation with the tower. The minutes seemed like hours. We were dripping wet since the temperature inside barracks was at least ninety degrees and the humidity at ninety-eight percent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My imagination went into overdrive as I waited for Bernard to come back on the line. I thought that at any moment we would hear the roar of afterburners from our F-102 jet fighters as they went scrambling into the sky in pursuit of whatever it was that we reported. Perhaps the Base Commander would come on the line to ask us for more details about the sighting. We might soon hear the shrill of the base’s alert sirens followed by the sight of speeding trucks carrying frantic troops to their battle positions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instead, Tower Controller Bernard came back on the line. “Airmen,” he said, “I hate to tell you this, but the radar people have had no contacts for over an hour.” “Impossible,” I yelled. “Did you check with Kadena Center?” “Yes I did,” Bernard said, “and the Army NIKE site too. They also said they had no recent radar contacts.” His response was shocking to say the least. Controller Bernard suggested that we file an Unidentified Aircraft Report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heads shaking back and forth, “Thanks anyway,” we told him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided--how could we file a report on something we saw without physical evidence to back it up? We understood we would have needed at least radar reports, photographs, or more eyewitnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never did file that report. We hoped we would hear others talk about spotting it too, but no one ever came forward. For weeks, I spent my free time watching the night sky and hoping for another sighting. I even bought a Nikon 8mm camera. I carried it with me wherever I went—just in case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My hopes of seeing it again began to fade after several weeks. However, just as I started to think the earlier sighting was just a onetime fly-by, I saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Returning to my barracks from a second shift tour at the Communications Center, I decided to relax for a while. I sat in a chair on the second floor outside landing. Propping my feet up onto a railing, I began reminiscing about the first sighting. Since I was alone, the thought scared the hell out of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before 1:00 a.m. I was about to call it a night when it reappeared. A craft similar to the type Frank and I saw one month earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In an instant, my mind switched from a relaxed state to one of “fight or flight.” My body froze and my adrenaline level skyrocketed. My hair hackled. My heart raced. I could not move my legs. My camera—I left it in my room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my mind, I calculated the best course of action. There I was, sitting alone in the dark outside my barracks with no one else around, except--what? Common sense soon prevailed. No light beams were shooting down at me from the craft. It became clear that it took no notice of me and was moving northward away from my position. Thank God.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, my brain regained control of my body and I was able to move my legs. I stood and took the next logical step, I ran like hell. Sprinting down the long hallway to the center of the barracks to get to the stairs, I thought it best not to look back. I did not. Reaching the stairway, I made it down the thirteen steps to the first floor in three or four leaps. At the bottom, I turned and ran straight to the C.Q. office phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Charge of Quarters had been dozing at his desk when I grabbed the phone to report the sighting to the control tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Airman Bernard answered on the first ring. “Tower, Airman Bernard here.” “George, this is Marty from the Communications Squadron. I just saw it again!” I explained. I was nearly out of breath and spoke with a nervous stutter. “It looked the same as the last one.” Bernard must have heard me breathing heavily and sensed that I was anxious. He told me to be calm, relax and tell him what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recounted the event as it happened. He put me on hold as he checked with three different radar sites scanning the island’s airspace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The C.Q. awoke hearing my conversation with the tower controller. “What’s the matter?” he asked. “You look as though you just saw a ghost.” “No, not a ghost,” I answered, “I’ll explain later.” After what seemed like hours, Bernard came back on the line. “We’ve had no radar contacts for two hours,” he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, he advised me to fill out an Unidentified Aircraft Report. I did not bother. For the second time, I declined. I felt that no one would believe me without proof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought if only I had brought my camera with me.<n>

It now appeared as two red lights near the horizon in the South West.Off to the right, a small plane seemed to be approaching It&#39;s  last position,and then to my astonishment a brilliant white light happened near where they would have met.Now I was peering intently;thinking an explosion had occured.But then I saw the two red lights again and now closer and apparently approaching me. It moved slowly and I thought at first I was looking at a large low flying plane however the red lights were steady and not blinking and as it drew closer I noticed it had only a low buzzing sound.However even when it was  just above the roadway in front of my house I still thought it was something from,near by,Stewart Airforce base.But then it turned on a white light which clearly revealed it&#39;s shape.The light wrapped around the front of it as a semi circle and I could also see it had small wings which were more like fins and the red lights were at the ends of the fins. It was 200-250 feet across and 250-300 feet front to back it&#39;s height was 25-50 feet. It was moving very slowly at 150-200 feet above and maybe 15mph ;the whitelight lit up the roadway.I noticed a slight wobble or hesitency in its forward motion as if it were moving within some kind of field. When It turned off it&#39;s main light which may have been on for a minute it began to pivot around one off it&#39;s fins and then I was directly beneath it where I could now see a third red light at it&#39;s rear and it&#39;s full shape from below as a flattened oval and the fins made it seem triangular. It continued over our house and then to the fields behind. I then ran Inside my brother was watching Jonny Carson. We both watched it dissapear banking behind the trees to the North East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/15/63 21:00|Nanaimo (Canada)|BC|Disk|approx. 1 hr.|Unidentifiable Elipitcal object|7/30/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24037.html|11|ndxe196306| Unidentifiable Elipitcal object<n> <n><n> <n><n> The year was approximately 1962 and I was living ina small town Nanaimo, located in British Columbia Canada. Nanaimo is located on an island just off the coast of Vancouver, B.C. Canada. The island by relative standards is not a big island, and not considered to be very wide. The center of the island has a mountain called Mt. Benson in the middle approximately 6000-7000 feet in height separating both the East and West coast coast lines. While my friend and I were playing outside we noticed a rather bright eliptical light that appeared to be hovering over the top of the mountain. Fascinated by the appearence of this phenomenom we continued to watch this light continue to hover over the peak of the mountain for approximately one hour. At that age, not knowing much about aircraft, we continued to watch this object continue to hover over the mountain for the entire time it was visible. The object appeared to be quite bright, and showed no signs of pulsating lights or other distinguishing characteristics. Both of us were amazed at the amount of time this object spent hovering over the mountain top, and it did not appear to eminate any type of sound whatsoever. After viewing this craft for approximately and hour the obejct slowly began to demonstrate ballistic movement and departed the area at a relatively slow speed. I do recall the object slowly began traveling South, then suddenly turned westward and began climbing into the westward sky until it disappeared from sight. We were both curious as to what we had seen, but simply assumed it was some sort of Canadian military project. Since that date I have always wondered what it was that I actually saw that evening. I made an attempt to explain what I had seen to my parents, but they dismissed it as simply a kids fabricated story. What I saw that night is something that has still left an impression in my mind today. I would give anything to know what it what is was that I actually saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The charecteristics that the craft exhibited that evening was nothing similar to any aircraft that I was aware of at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were in a small row boat on the lake just off shore near the point. After dropping the anchor and casting my line toward shore,I looked above the trees and saw a chrome ball just over the trees. At first I thought it was a balloon or maybe a beach ball, but the wind was blowing some and it didn&#39;t move. My Grandfather was fishing off the otherside of the boat and couldn&#39;t see it yet. I continued to watch it and noticed I could see the reflection of the trees below it. There had been a lot of talk on the TV about swampgas and such being the reason for people seeing UFO&#39;s. I remember thinking ,&#34;this ain&#39;t no swampgas&#34;.After watching for just a few min. I said ,hey granpa look at that. I pointed so he could see. He looked at it for a while and then told me to pull up the anchor. I asked why and he said never mind just do it. After putting the anchor into the boat I looked back up while my Grandfather was still watching it. As I saw it just disapear in front of my eyes my Granpa said were going in. I looked all over for it and realized the sun was going down and the lake was now calm. I remember thinking it can&#39;t be that late already! But it was.

I seen my niece beside me frozen too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it released us and we ran into the house. When we came in my sister made the comment that we had been out there a long time. To us it seemed we had only been out there a few menutes.<n>

I was only about 6 years old at the time.  Someone, I can&#39;t recall whichof us, spotted three silver saucer type ufos in the sky, just off to the southwest.  They didn&#39;t appear very far away, and you could easily see them through the treetops (though they may have been much higher in actuality).  There was no sound whatsoever emitted from the space crafts and the view was clear.  To this day we all remember the sighting.

I was operating a Jeep with a canvas top with the top in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had driven half a mile to a gas station where there was a Soft drink machine. I bought a bottle of Coca Cola, and drove to the center of town and into a parking lot with buildings on three sides intending to sit for a few minutes and enjoy my drink. I was backed in near the the rear of the lot facing the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only a car now and then that was passing by, and the area was deserted and very quiet due to the hour. As I sat drinking my soda, I became aware in my peripheral vision of some kind of movement to my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In this direction was a long narrow driveway that rose up from a street below that ran along the banks of the Wepawaug River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shocked and alarmed to see coming up the hill on the ground a deep black &#34;patch&#34;, about 15 feet wide and 30 feet long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had the shape of a large gasoline storage tank of the type buried at gasoline stations, but just the &#34;footprint&#34; as it had no height at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really scared me was that my first assumption that it was a shadow of something passing overhead was not confirmed by my frantic look out the window and up, and by the fact that it seemed to be completely opague, that is I could not see the ground under it, and it looked for all the world like it could have been a huge piece of black velvet, and it had that kind of a visual texture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving toward me very slowly, perhaps less than two miles per hour. I had enough time to really panic and then when I decided to jump out and run, it was too late because it was over me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spun around wildly in my seat looking in every direction expecting something to come in after me, but nothing did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw that it had passed over me and was again on the ground moving very slowly away from me in the same direction, toward the two story building to my left about 100 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I again looked out expecting to see something overhead, but there was nothing. It continued moving toward the building, flowed up off the grounf and up the side of the building at the same deliberate slow pace and dissaperaed across the roof and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were stars out, no lights in the parking lot, and nothing I am aware of drove by during the minue or so that it took for all of this to happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was too afraid to move for about five munutes, during which time I kept looking around to be sure nothing else was going to happen. I then got up the courage to drive out of the lot at high speed. I was afraid to go back there again for weeks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never reported this for obvious reasons (except to family and friends of course), not needing the ridicule that was sure to follow. I was about 22 years old at the time, very wide awake and alert, and not at all tired. I remember it vividly as I was so terrified by it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A relative (sane and rational to the best of my knowledge, as I believe I am) told me he had seen something like it some time earlier near a swamp in Milford, and we concluded that there might be some connection to water, as what I had seen did come up the hill from an area close to a small river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing that stands out in my mind is that I remember questioning my own sanity  halfway through, when the thing was over me and I could not see any sign of it, hoping that was the end of it, but then the shock of seeing it reappear as it continued away from me, and the fact that it took enough time that I had a good opportunity to reconfirm what it looked like the last time I saw it, and the fact that even as it climbed the wall of the building, you could not see the building behind it, and it did not in any way seem to be a shadow, but a solid &#34;thing&#34; of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still make no conclusion about what it was, but I do know I have no desire to see anything like it again, at least not when I find myself in such a vulnerable position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I was worried that they might come into the house.  We never locked our doors and it would be easy for them to just walk in.  I wanted to get up and at least lock the doors but I was too uneasy.

6/10/63 03:00|Fort Collins|CO|Cigar|10 minutes|A bright object followed the deputy sheriff's patrol boat for approximately seven miles.|3/16/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16772.html|21|ndxe196306| ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We are grateful to the gentleman who submitted the report.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright object followed the deputy sheriff&#39;s patrol boat for approximately seven miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a deputy sheriff and a boat warden at Horsetooth Reservoir.  Horsetooth Reservoir is located approximately 5 miles west of Fort Collins, CO.  It lies between two small hills, one to the east and one to the west.  The laske itself is probably 3 quarters of a miles in width and seven miles long.  The length of the lake is north and south.  At approximately 3:00 A.M. I received a call at home from the sheriff&#39;s office notifying me that there was some sort of a light flashing in the water at the very north end of the lake.  I notified ((name deleted)) who was in charge of the Lalrimer County Recreation District.  He said he would meet me at the docks at the south-west side of Horsetooth where I was going to board the patrol boat.  We got in the boat, headed out at Thompson&#39;s Cove and into the main body of the lake.  It was an extremely dark night.  I drove the patrol boat north at a reasonable but safe speed, considering the darkness.  When we got to the north end of the lake, we discovered the flashing light in the water that was reported as a possible distress signal, was actually a bouy that had been placed in the water to mark temperature sensing equipment.  A bouy with a flashing light on it had been placed in the water by the State Game and Fish Department.  Realizing there was no real emergency, we were getting ready to head back south when, all of a sudden, a huge, bright object appeared just to our east and just above the hills on that side of the lake.  I could not make out a structure.  It was a very large, oblong-shaped, brilliant white light.  We commented on it and couldn&#39;t imagine what it was.  I started moving south in the patrol boat when ((name deleted))  said, &#34;((name deleted)), this thing is moving with us.&#34;  I stopped the patrol boat and the object continued just a little farther south along the ridge and then it stopped.  We started south again in the patrol boat, the object continued to parallel us.  When we got near the south end of the reservoir, the object was still with us and directly to our east.  It loo! ked like it was a little lower above the top of the ridge.  It made the top of the ridge appear as if it was almost daylight.  We could see the entire makeup of the hillside, even shadows.  At this point the object started giving ((name deleted)) and me a bad case of the &#34;creeps&#34;.  I stopped the patrol boat and we both sat and looked at the object.  I told ((name deleted)), &#34;This is getting too creepy.&#34;  So I shut of the patrol boat and turned off the running lights.  We sat in the boat quietly and just observed this extremely brilliant light.  After maybe 30 or 40 seconds the object left the area of the lake and in a split second headed north and became a tiny object someplace over Wyoming.  We watched the entire disappearance of the object.  The acceleration of the object was absolutely phenomenal and there was no sound whatsoever from the object.  I started up the patrol boat and turned on the running lights.  ((name deleted))  and I just kind of sat there and looked at each other trying to understand what happened.  When ((name deleted))  said, &#34;Do you need the publicity.&#34;  I said, &#34;No&#34;.  ((name deleted)) looked at me and said, &#34;Let&#39;s go home.&#34;  I turned the patrol boat into Thompson&#39;s Cove, tied it up to the dock and we went home.  This entire situation really shook us up a lot and I honestly don&#39;t believe we ever talked about it to each other again.  I think ((name deleted)) is now deceased and since I&#39;m now 68 years old, I think it is a good time to get this incident recorded.  At the time I did not want to talk to newspapers, radio stations, etc. and be in a position to answer any number of questions and opinions from all kinds of people.  When you are in public service the last thing you want to happen is to be caught in the middle of some kind of a controversy.  That possibility is bad enough when you are able to prove how, what, when, where, why, etc.  It would be a nightmare when, in the case of this bright object, all your proof disappeared in a split second into the night and was somewhere over Wyoming or who knows where?<n>

It appeared to be reflecting the sunlight, but it was also sort of rippling, like water in a brook. It was silver color and long like a cigar, and about a size of a hot dog held at arms length from where we were. It was just howering there and we heard no sound. It was too huge to be reflections of windows and it was not moving as a plane would just howering. I was not frightened rather surprised and curious. My friend wanted to leave so we went home. I did not mention anything to the family, although the next day there were some reports in the paper of strange objects sighted and some sort of apelike animal near Cochrane which is to the WEST of the city. Don&#39;t know if there was any connection to the two. To this day im still curious as to what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/1/63 23:00|Colorado Springs (mtns. NW of)|CO|Disk|5 minutes|UFO hovered and made right angle turns before shooting off at an incredible rate of speed when approached by a jet.|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38299.html|23|ndxe196306| UFO hovered and made right angle turns before shooting off at an incredible rate of speed when approached by a jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 11pm in June 1963, in the company of my father, when outside and looking south down a large valley from our mountain A-frame house high on the mountain side North West of Colorado Springs, CO. We could see the lights of the city through the V shape at the bottom of the mountain valley and the full moon was almost straight S/SE and at maybe a 70 degree angle up. We had NO lights on at the time as we were watching the stars and moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father brought to my attention a glowing single lighted object moving above the mountain ridge to the west of us and traveling south. (this would be to our right side maybe 1/8-1/4 mile away) The entire object glowed in a constant white light and seemed large and elongated. We could see it through and above the trees depending on its position as it was above and on the opposite side of the mountian ridge from our view point. While moving south along and above the ridge it would stop and hover, move at right angles up and down for a period of maybe two minutes before it circled around to the left (easterly direction) at the far south end of the mountain ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (this next part took maybe 3 or 4 minutes) Then it gained in altitude and stopped almost straight south of our view and hovered at maybe a 40 degree angle from our position over what seemed to be the north west area above the city of Colo. Springs just east of the foot hills. It must have been 7-10 miles away from us by this time, maybe more, but was still big enough to see its elongated shape. While it hung in this position two bright orange objects slowly came out of this UFO (about a minute apart). One from the top and then one from the bottom. Once they were a short distance above or below the craft they shoot off at an incredible rate of speed in opposite directions (east and west)and disappeared immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed a very high flying Jet coming from our left side (east)and traveling south west. It was traveling very fast and seemed to be headed directly for the hovering UFO. I speculate maybe 12,000 ft high. I mentioned to my father that it seemed like it was heading straight at the UFO and wondered what would happen when it got close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the jet did get close to this object (UFO) it accelerated up and out at a +/- 45 degree angle straight south and disappeared out of sight in maybe 1 or 2 seconds. Just like a scene in &#34;Star Trek&#34; when they go into warp. I have never seen anything accelerate that fast in my life except for a SciFi movie. At no time during this entire sighting did this object make any noise what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not shared this story with many people through the years and recently had a massive heart attack and felt it was time to tell my story while I can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the witness have his father submit a report, as well, if that would be possible.

We were sitting on the cabin steps (dark out), when we saw a bright light shooting out of the sky. It was very bright, but had no trailing debris like a &#34;falling star&#34; has. We thought it was that at first, but then it stopped in mid air. It looked like a couple thousand feet above the lake and close to the middle. It sat there for about 2 seconds and then another light shot down and stopped parallel to it. They sat side by side for a second or so (no noise) and then both of the lights took off at the same time (side by side) and disappeared over the horizon at a high rate of speed. They disappeared in about a second. The light was bright white, like a halogen light is today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I couldn&#39;t move.  I tried to call my father, but could only make a noise through locked jaws.  Maybe 5 to 10 seconds went by before I could force a loud enough noise to emit from my mouth that was loud enough for my father to come running down the hall and into my room to see what was going on.  I told him the was a blue ball of something that was humming and vibrating and undulating in the corner, but was gone when he busted into my room.  He said I was having a nightmare, but I hadn&#39;t gone to sleep yet.  I sure on this point.  After my father went back to his room I tried to go to sleep.  After I laid there for maybe a minute after he left.  I started feeling like someone was present.  There in the corner of my bedroom came the humming and vibrations again.  I was so scared, but forced myself  to look at it.  It was a blue sphere of light that was completely obscure and looked like it was throbing and vibrating and humming.  I yelled good and loud for my father again.  He came running back into my room only to see nothing when he turned the light on.  That&#39;s it.  That&#39;s all that happened, but it did indeed happen.  I&#39;ll take a polygraph or truth serium or whatever anyone wants me to take, but I was not asleep and this did in fact happen to me. It was around 1962 or 63 and I&#39;ve never mentioned it as I didn&#39;t want anyone to think I am nuts or was exagerating.  I DID HAVE THIS HAPPEN AND I SWEAR ON MY MOTHER&#39;S GRAVE AND I DON&#39;T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS..........

But it was not a plane or small aircraft as we would recognize. My father had just got home from work and several neighborhood kids were playing in my front yard. We all just stood and watched it as it seemed to move ever so slowly from the North-east to the South-west accross the sky just behing my house. It had three main white light, that moved like flashing lights down its side, and a red light underneath it. It moved slowly for about 2 minutes, then litterally shot off into the sky and was gone. There was no noise. We all watched it, and although my father tried to convince us it was a &#34;special balloon of some kind&#34;, I remember the adults talking about it for weeks it seemed. No one ever reported things like that back then. Until I saw the special on Travel Channel tonight, 05-27-07 about the Florissant, Illionois UFO sighting and the engineers rendition of the witness&#39; sightings, I thought no one would ever believe me about what we saw. It was a perfect likeness to what we had seen. My father admited only 15 years ago to me that it was an UFO as far as he knew. He admitted he did not want us kids upset by what we had seen. Thanks to the TV special this evening, I will never again question myself about what I saw with my Dad and friends on that clear summer day. It is as real to me today as it was 40 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I have two grown successful children and have been married 35 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a warm summer day and I was outside where I stayed most of the time in our rural farm community.  I had walked out to the end of our garden fence accompanied by my dog.  For some reason and I will never know why because I did not hear anything but I turned my head back over my shoulder and looked up in the sky and there it was.  It was triangle in shape,silver and flying horizontally although it did not appear to be flying but just hanging in the sky.  I can&#39;t judge distance but it was not low like a small plane flies and it was not as high as a jet flies.  But it looked huge.  It appeared to have some type of nose in front where it seemed to be piloted.  I felt like I was looking at it and it was looking at me so I took off running yelling, Mom, Mom, come look.  My mother came out the back door and I pointed to the sky and it was gone.  Just vanished in a blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

She called out to us kids to look up in the north sky at the strange gray cigar shaped object which was hovering. It was very high, I would now estimate that it was 75 to 90 degrees high, and had no contrail, no sign of movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s hard to estimate how long it was, as it was very high. It was not a blimp or a weather balloon either!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived very close to H&amp;H Guest Ranch, which had gliders and skyjumping on weekends, but this was a weekday and that was NO glider!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object held our attention for a few minutes, but being kids, we went off to play and about five minutes later looked up to see it was totally gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was my first sighting of a UFO.  My second is also documented here.. 05/01/69<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

This cigar shaped object crossed the road in front of me at a tremendous rate of speed.It was appoximately 8&#39; above the ground going south to north. The car in front of me swerved to the shoulder and I immediately pulled of also. I got out of my car and went back to the other driver who was a pregnant woman and I asked her if she saw what I had witnessed.She was trembling as we discussed what we had seen, I looked for the &#34;craft&#34; and it was no where to be seen but I noticed that the pasture grasses were parted where this object had passed by. I drove onto Gonzales immediately to the police station to report what I had seen.The officer dismissed it by saying that it was either a crop duster aircraft or some sort plane from the Air Force base near Galveston. I asked him to call both places and he refused.I wish I had gotten the womans name so as to verify this claim. I&#39;ve waited all these years to come forth because of the ridicule I would have recieved among my family and aquaintences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

A huge red glowing ball came right down beside me on my front sidewalk.  I could have touched it. This thing was huge but it seemed soft to me. It bounced a couple of times barely touching the ground. When I tried to touch it it jump up very fast but then came back down agin slow. After that it went up a little and then went straight up into the sky like it was flying I saw a couple of lights and then they just dissappeared. When I went into my home to tell my mother my face was burned a little. I don&#39;t know what this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For my mother said I looked like I had just been to the beach as she was washing my face with cold water.

The craft could be described as cigar shaped, or a disk viewed edge on. There were &#34;port holes,&#34; or narrow rectangular slits along the edge of the hull of the craft.  These slits were darker than the rest of the craft.  Object accelerated at incredible speed to the north. Gave the appearance of a streak that of a flashlight moved rapidly in the dark. It hovered no more than 5 minutes. Witness was initially asleep, but was awoken by the intense light.  Witness said that the craft could have been hovering over pool for some time before being awoken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There were three stars, a triangle, and a bright ball of light was going from one to the next, west.  The bright ball of light was equally as bright as each star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps fifteen minutes passed when my brother exclaimed again &#34;Look!&#34;   I looked and saw the ball of light leaving the second star and proceeding to the third, south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were amazed, but young, and did not realized the significance of what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again &#34;Look!&#34; rang out and we watched the ball of light return to the star of its origin, north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trip took less than one hour.  We will gladly take a lie detector test, truth serum, hypnosis, or whatever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sighting such as this has ever been reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/1/63|San Francisco|CA|Disk|3 days|San Francisco man, then 22, reported details of 1963 abduction to friend. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57316.html|36|ndxe196306| San Francisco man, then 22, reported details of 1963 abduction to friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a second party report of a UFO abduction which occurred in about 1963.  The abductee was about 22 years old at the time. He told the story to another person approximately in 1965, who first recounted it to me about two years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is of high interest because the abductee apparently was able to remember the event in extreme detail. He worked as an outside salesman at the time of the abduction event, perhaps the reason he was not noticed as missing by person who knew him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The abductee said he was missing for three days. He described the abductors as being small &#34;people&#34; with large heads and large eyes. He considered them to be performing &#34;medical experiments&#34; on him. Evidently, he believed the abductors to be able to communicate telepathically, and reported that they conveyed to him that they would be contacting him again every 10 or 15 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The abductee told the person who reported this story to me that his father owned a drugstore chain in San Francisco. Recently, my source talked to me again about this story, and recalled that he said that his family attended Temple Baptist Church in San Francisco. Evidently, he got married at Temple Baptist Church about in 1966.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was described as being of medium height and slim build, and a Scandanavian ethnic type with blond hair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not personally in a position to investigate this story since I do not live in the San Francisco Bay Area anymore or in California at all, but I think a good investigator could make quick work of finding out who this person was. If he is still alive, I imagine he would be willing to talk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Event.|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62155.html|37|ndxe196306| Event<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 3 years old and riding a tricycle in Apartment building with a pool not quit in its center when I felt something pulling me to the swimming pool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got off my small three wheeled bike and walked over to the pools edge and crawled out to the end of the diving board.  Again something was guiding me to look down into the pool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then that I first found myself just inches from the leaves at the bottom of the pool, and while I was looking at them gently swaying back and fourth, it gave me a feeling of calm and peace. and then all at once, I was flying over a city, and could feel vast amounts of information flowing into my being, not my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time my mother had come out looking for me but did not see me, and after some time had past, I was back on the edge of the diving board. Where my mother had come running out and was yelling at me to get off of the diving board. I remember her also yelling at me and asking me where did I go. After this event I had moments of black and lost time, sometimes I could remember things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve spent my hole life looking at this event in every way that I can, and I cannot find one way that would tell me that it did not happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have no way of knowing whether this report is, in any way, related to UFO activity.  We post it, nevertheless.  PD))<n>
