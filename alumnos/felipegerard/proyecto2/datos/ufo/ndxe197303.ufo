I was outside playing in the street when I felt I was being observed and looked up.  About 50-75 feet (?) above (I will send a Google Street View of the location) I saw a whitish cylindrical object with a few black lines silently hovering above and slowly rotating (Iâ€™ll also email a crude drawing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 20 seconds, fascinated, when I remembered that I had recently been given a cheap pair of plastic toy binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unsure of what I should do, I bolted into the house to get the binoculars so I could see more detail.  I yelled at my parents that there was something in the sky as I ran toward my bedroom.  One of them said that the TV news had reported that a meteor had been spotted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time (2-3 minutes) I made it back outside, the object had d! isappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even at that age I felt I had seen something very important and decided to write down the date on a piece of paper which I would always keep (of course it only took a couple of months before I lost it!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

3/15/73 17:00|Hartford|CT|Triangle|minute|wedge shaped objects flying in formation over hood of car at dusk while driving on highway.|7/26/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23879.html|2|ndxe197303| wedge shaped objects flying in formation over hood of car at dusk while driving on highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back in early spring 1973 a friend and I were driving north on I-91 near Hartford, CT when there appeared three silvery wedge-shaped objects flying from west to east right in front of the windshield of the car.  The objects were small, about one foot in length and were plain, no lights, nothing at all.  What was just as strange is that they appeared and then disappeared but we didn&#39;t see them fly in or fly away - they came and then they were just completely gone.  I looked into the other cars to see if people were waving or pointing but no one else seemed to have seen the objects so I kept my mouth shut.  A few minutes later, my friend said, &#34;You are going to think I&#39;m crazy....&#34;  I said something like &#34;Go ahead...&#34;  He said,&#34;Did you see anything strange?&#34;  I became very excited because he had seen them too and our descriptions matched exactly.  These three objects were flying in a V shaped formation and neither of us could explain what they were.  We knew we were near Bradley Airport in Windsor Locks so we kept trying to explain it on those terms, that it was experimental aircraft of some sort.  Then I said maybe they were remote controlled toys - but who would fly them across a busy highway? and why did they appear and disappear so suddenly like that?  I turned on the car radio to see if there was any mention on the news but there wasn&#39;t.  When we got to my parents&#39; house I ran to the tv to see if they were talking about it but there were no reports and there was nothing in the papers the next day either.  I have never forgotten this incident.  Small, wedge-shaped, close-up, dark silver, appeared and disappeared suddenly, at dusk in early spring.  I shudder when I see the stealth planes now because the shape reminds me, although what I saw back then was small and just straight lines like an arrowhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from same witness, who elects to remain anonymous.

I set my alarm to go watch the comet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got outside I saw a ball of fire passing across the sky and though it was the comet. The size of the object was about the size of a pencil eraser held at an extended arm length away. I watched as it passed by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not falling but holding a straight course going from east to west at a sustained altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an 11yr old kid I had no real idea what a comet was other then knowing it flew in space. But it definitely was a Ball of Fire passing at an altitude of roughly 3000 feet high.  It should have been seen going past or over Detroit Metro Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/13/73 04:00|New Orleans|LA|Circle|approx. 2hrs.|My husband and I stopped early one morning on a highway to look at a bright object, the object was a large round  silver thing.|7/1/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23369.html|4|ndxe197303| My husband and I stopped early one morning on a highway to look at a bright object, the object was a large round  silver thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband at the time, and I were coming from Florida on one of our visits home.  We were driving from New Orleans over the spillway around 4AM.  There was no traffic at that time.  We both commented on how empty the roads were at that hour.  As we drove on we noticed a bright white light on the other side of the spillway (the higway is seperated and elevated).  We decided to stop as the light was so unusual and unexpected.  It seemed to be sitting in amongst the trees.  We got out of our car to get a better look and it dawned on both of us that there was no sound.  There were no frogs croaking, no bird sounds and no sound at all coming from whatever that thing was across from us.  It appeared to be silver and round.  It had large white lights at intervals all around it.  The lights shown down.  My husband and I stood looking at the thing in the dark just mesmerized.  Suddenly we were standing there and it was light.  I don&#39;t know how much time passed but when we first stopped it was dark and around 4:30 or so.  It was now light and about 5:30 or 6AM.  My husband and I both just looked at each other and almost together we said &#34;let&#39;s get out of here&#34; and we did.  We never talked about that.  Every so often I would bring it up but he never really wanted to talk about it.  I&#39;ve told friends about it when talk of UFO&#39;s come up.  I always say that I believe in them because I saw one.  Maybe even went into it but have no memory of it.  My ex-husband is an MD and I am a student now, going back to school to hopefully get my law degree after being out over 20 years.  I have nothing to gain by telling this story.  I just believe that what we saw was a UFO.  It doesn&#39;t scare me.  I don&#39;t have nightmares and I&#39;ve never had such a thing happen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/12/73 02:00|Plain|WA|Other|3 hrs|Flying cubes land, emit small shiny silvery spheres, and large 3-toed 'birdlike' footprints appear in snow.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45849.html|5|ndxe197303| Flying cubes land, emit small shiny silvery spheres, and large 3-toed &#39;birdlike&#39; footprints appear in snow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Summary:  - Flying cubes, 18&#34; on the side, in chain-like &#39;formation&#39;  - Shiny silver spheres, 4&#34; to 12&#34;  - Strange, anomalous &#39;footprints&#39;, birdlike, with 3 &#39;toes&#39; and one heel-spur (or whatever it is called on a bird)  Thank you for your kind consideration. I ask that you send me an email if you can find any similar sightings in your database.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to know if anyone has seen anything similar:  Early AM, very cold; weather clear. Cubic &#39;craft&#39;, about 18&#34; on the side, flew overhead repeatedly, emitting a whooshing sound; a buzzing sound could also be heard, similar to the sound made by an electrical transformer under load.  These flying cubes appeared to be made of &#39;brushed metal&#39;.  They flew in an undulating &#39;chain&#39; formation. They repeatedly &#39;buzzed&#39; me; in other words they dove at me. I was on foot at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to &#39;escape&#39; from this remote location by hiking toward a store (closed at that time of day).  I had to cross a steel bridge over a river, but saw that the cubes had landed in the center of the bridge.  I was terrified by this time.  I watched as the cubes disgorged a number of shiny silver spheres;  the spheres varied in size from 3&#34; to about 12&#34;.  After the spheres had &#39;rolled out&#39; from small square &#39;doors&#39; in the sides of the cubes, the cubes suddenly took flight and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now my path across the bridge was &#39;blocked&#39; by these silvery spheres. They did not glow, but were very reflective. There were several spheres, I do not know how many.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to brave an attempt to pass by the spheres.  As I did, one of them vanished with a tiny &#39;ping&#39; sound.  This was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should mention that there was on the ground, the last of the snow of winter; this was very hard snow, a crust, about 1&#34;-8&#34; deep. There were bare areas of dirt also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked toward the far end of the bridge, my head began to sweat, and my vision fogged.  I became dizzy, and could barely walk.  The sensation of heat _inside_ my head increased radically with every step I took.  My vision &#39;doubled&#39; and I had to lean against the rail of the bridge to stand upright.  I was convinced that I was about to die.  I carelessly walked close to some other spheres, and they too &#39;vanished&#39; with the &#39;ping&#39; noise, similar to the sound of a musical triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon was casting considerable light. I happened to look at the sloped, snow-covered bank of the river, which bank was about 40 feet from the top to the edge of the water.  There, imprinted in the snow, was a huge &#39;footprint&#39;.  It appeared to have been melted into the hard snow.  The &#39;footprint&#39; resembled that of a bird; it had three &#39;toes&#39; and one &#39;heel&#39;.  In other words, it was a &#39;Y&#39; shape, with a middle prong between the uprights. For some reason, this sight deeply shocked me.  I finally began to panic, and indeed felt that my death was imminent.  I gave up the attempt to cross the bridge and went back to the shore which I had started from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was there that I saw, on the hard snow at the side of the road, MANY footprints just like the one described above;  but these were of many sizes,  from small (3&#34;) to large (6&#39;).  They were scattered about, in what seemed to be a random pattern.  One thing did catch my attention; the footprints occured only in pairs. It looked as though some &#39;invisible creatures&#39;, whose feet were hot, had stood around there, in that hard snow.  I could not believe my eyes, so I bent down and ran my finger around inside the footprints. The snow had been melted into hard ice; the footprints were indeed &#39;real&#39;.  Each footprint was literally a depression in the snow, a 3-toed shape, and the snow had been compressed, or melted, to produce these impressions.  The depth of a footprint of about 4&#34; was approximately 1/2&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It occured to me that these &#39;footprints&#39; were made by &#39;something&#39; which had been &#39;hatched&#39; when the silver spheres disappeared as I approached them.  This was totally mind-boggling, to say the least.  The problem was that I was apparently &#39;under attack&#39; by invisible enemies.  I had been sweating, and now I was growing cold, as the heat had diminished when I returned to the end of the bridge.  It seemed to me that the cubes had deployed the spheres, which had deployed the &#39;invisible whatevers&#39;, whose job was to prevent me from crossing the bridge. Strange, beyond words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can describe this &#39;event&#39; in much detail, but my main concerns are the footprints in the snow.  I had managed to forget most of this, until perhaps 5 years ago, when I read a report that an Alpine mountain guide of impeccable reputation, in Switzerland, had filed a report of an event which had greatly upset him.  He had observed &#39;huge, 3-toed footprints&#39; in the snow of a remote mountain valley.  He stated that the footprints appeard to he those of a &#39;huge invisible bird&#39;.  I have forgotten most of the details, but the similarity to my own &#39;sighting&#39; was too close to miss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to know, if you have in your database, any reports of similar cubes, spheres, or 3-toed footprints; especially the footprints.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although witness does not indicate that fact.

A friend and I were sitting in the cockpit of my sailboat at a marina in St Augustine, Fl., just having a general conversation. We were sitting across from each other facing East. My friend stated &#34;Did you see what I just saw&#34;.  I said what exactly did you see. We compared stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw was a &#34;very bright star&#34; high in the ESE sky. (Out over the Atlantic Ocean}. It was a white light similiar to the brighness of the planet Venus and was just sitting there.  Suddenly we noticed a smaller white light coming from the 4 o&#39;clock position and it was very fast it went straight into the brighter light. After maybe a few seconds the brighter light {with the smaller light} went straight up and out of sight. We are both convinced to this day that this was a UFO as it did something we didn&#39;t think regular aircraft could do. It was a first sighting for both of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/1/73 10:30|Upper Hutt (New Zealand)||Circle|2.5 Hours|The Object hung silently above our Town for almost 3 hours. Thousands of people saw it.|8/24/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38759.html|7|ndxe197303| The Object hung silently above our Town for almost 3 hours. Thousands of people saw it.I was a teacher at Oxford Crescent School in Upper Hutt. I first noticed it during the morning-tea break.There was great excitement as the children wondered if it was going to land.It seemed to be hanging less than 250 metres above the ground and appeared to move downwards a couple of times. It was grey metallic and circular in it&#39;s base. It was still there at lunch-time, absolutely stationary. I had to go down to the shops during the lunch-hour and hundreds of people were out in the streets watching it through binoculars and telescopes. The radio stations were &#34;tracking it&#34;and reports came from the weather office to say it was NOT a weather balloon.The airforce sent 3 jets down to check it out. They flew around and around and up and down and then went away. The Government still insisted it was a weather balloon that had floated into the wrong place. We knew that was a story because it sure wasn&#39;t floating now even though there was a small breeze. What&#39;s more it was the size of a bus not a weather balloon.Close to 1pm the object slowly moved straight upwards a little and then a little more. There was no noise but I felt the energy of it. It then moved very rapidly straight up to I guess maybe 1000 meters,slowed and then shot off at great speed straight up into the blue sky where it disappeared from sight.The powers-that-be kept pushing the weather balloon story which didn&#39;t fit the facts. I know of course that they can&#39;t say it&#39;s a flying saucer, else the whole country would go into a panic. I Think half the people believed the story and the other half, like me, knew it was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
