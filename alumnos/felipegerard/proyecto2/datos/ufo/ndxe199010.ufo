It was Halloween which is why I remember the exact date, but don&#39;t exactly remember which year.  Around 6:00 to 6:30 my friend and I were going to be going out trick or treating and we were at my house getting ready and we went into the kitchen.  My friend was the first one to spot it.  He said to me &#34;hey look out the window, look at that, do you see it?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well at first I didn&#39;t even know what he was talking about.  Then I saw what he was referring to.  Keep in mind there was still a little light left outside and the sun was just setting.  I could see this object in the sky, which was actually pretty close.  I would say about 200 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did seem to have a similar shape that people seem to describe when they see so called UFO&#39;s.  Now here is the part that I have never heard anyone describe.  The object seemed to be almost invisible, but you could still see it.  If you have seen the movie predator where the creature could turn invisible, well it had a similar type transparency.  So we both just sat there looking out the window at this strange thing and it was not horizontal with the ground, but leaning to its side and was slowly moving to our right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it slowly started moving up and to the right and then it started to move behind some trees and the neighbor&#39;s house and that was it.... it was gone.  To this day I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t go run behind my neighbor’s house and try to continue watching it.  Well that is my story, which I am sure most people will think that I am full of crap, but have a clear memory of the event and I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Around 1700 hours we saw a white light coming toward us from the valley below as we were sitting on the steps in back of the lodge. Video was taken, but I am not sure that I still have it.  The local paper on November 1st ran an article telling of two policemen who saw and chased a UFO that had been reported the night before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/29/90 20:45|Burlingame State Park|RI|Other|5-10 seconds|Small airborne, manta-shaped object observed from a closest distance of ~15 feet for around 6 seconds by two reliable observers.|5/2/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28590.html|3|ndxe199010| Small airborne, manta-shaped object observed from a closest distance of ~15 feet for around 6 seconds by two reliable observers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the last day of camping season at Burlingame State Park in Rhode Island (back in 1990), an adult relative and I witnessed the close pass of a small, seemingly living object, which was clearly illuminated by the headlights of my vehicle, shortly before 9PM. I remember the time as we were concerned about getting to the office to obtain a campsite pass and the office was to close at 9:30PM. This was a quiet evening with good conditions, clear weather and skies. The expansive 500-site State campground was sparsely populated on that last night of the season, with maybe a dozen campsites taken in the entire park and forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object approached from the ten o&#39;clock position, sweeping down to the right through the upper reach of my headlight beams, proceeding over the road immediately in front of and above our vehicle, then rising abruptly on our right side to a verticle climb up between the heavy branches of broadleaf forest which lined either side of approach road. My observation of the object lasted only 2-4 seconds. My relative in the passenger seat saw more of both approach and egress, totalling for her possibly 8 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A description:  the object could be said to have had a rounded-chevron shape, maybe 18 inches across side-to-side. My own impression was that it had the general shape and the grace, of a manta. We both had an extremely clear and close view of the object and agreed that it did not appear to be mechanical in any sense, but rather living material or possibly a living form itself. For what it&#39;s worth, both of us felt we were in the presence of a highly aware and seemingly social object.   We agreed that there was no possibility that the small thing was any known sort of flying animal. It  did, however, have some attributes of deep-sea animals, including, along with its shape and graceful movement, a circular area near the rear centerline which radiated a distinct and clearly visible internal glow. There was clear structure evident internally in this central area (a subtle pattern of radiating lines) and its glow extended out to give pale illumination to the entire internal structure of the object. Again, the thing was very close to us under good conditions. My passenger reported to me that the object had moved directly upward rapidly after making its pass. She also noticed that there was a recurve to the rounded wingtips. I had not noticed this from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For those interested, I&#39;ll mention that my background has been mainly as an electronics engineering tech. Hobbies have included optics, amateur astronomy  and amateur radio. I have no explanation for what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>
10/29/90 07:00|Paragould|AR|Disk|3 minutes|My freind and I seen a circular craft land.  It was there for at least a minute.  When it took off again, it made a loud howling noise.|9/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13266.html|4|ndxe199010| My freind and I seen a circular craft land.  It was there for at least a minute.  When it took off again, it made a loud howling noise. I,d guess the diameter was around 100feet, and the height to be around 15 feet.  We were about fifty feet away from the craft when it landed.  the color of the light were blue.  Our metal detector circuits were fried becaus of the interference from the craft.   When the craft took off it hovered for a few secons, then it vanished.<n>

She and I were approximately 30 miles north of Wells, Nevada when we saw the object.  It was approximately 9:00 p.m. and the sky was crystal clear partially lit by the moon.  There was plenty of snow on the ground so the desert lights up almost as if it were dawn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cylinder shaped object with 5 amber lights on the side which did not pulse.  They steadily emitted light. We both saw it and proceeded to watch it cross the sky from East to West in about 15 seconds.  The distance from which we first saw it in the east to when it disappeared in the western horizon had to be at least 75 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made absolutely no sound and for as close as it was I found that really odd. Ironically, I fully accepted what I was seeing and kept expecting the car to loose power which thankfully it did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We just looked at each other wide eye and grinned.  We both said we have no idea what we just saw.  We didn’t say anything the rest of the way into Wells.  What an amazing experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/20/90 22:50|Glencoe|OK|Other|5 minutes+|It wasn't helicoptor and it dang sure wasn't swamp gas!|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27367.html|6|ndxe199010| It wasn&#39;t helicoptor and it dang sure wasn&#39;t swamp gas!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been very hesitant to ever talk about this incident over the years because this incident was disturbing and the few I have trusted to share this with have thought it to be ammusing.  We also have had the thought that maybe we saw something that we shouldn&#39;t have.  On this evening My wife, mother-in-law,myself, and our two sons went out for a drive, not really going anywhere we found ourselves just north of Pawnee Ok.  I noticed some lights coming from the west side of the road and slowed the car to take a closer look at what I thought was spot lights from a low flying helicopter.  Which in its self was a strange sight for us to see, at first there were two spot lights shining on the pasture as if looking for something.  So I stopped to watch for a moment,  then one light shut off, as it came closer the light was shined upon our car and continued until the object was very close.  At this time the light was turned off and we realized we were observing something not known to us.  It was a very moon lit night and this thing was very large, and very slow moving.  As far as description it had no apparent lights once the spot lights were turned off with the exception of what appeared as some very white small high intensity light that would flash from the left side and zip across the front and flash quickly on the left.  It made no noise and was very visible as it hovered above our car at about 40-50 ft.  It appeared somewhat stealth like in shape with some sort lower level on the belly side.  It had the appearance of metalic structure and was much larger than a home.  Never did it do anything or move in any aggresive manor.  I did not have the nerve to get out of the car but we did watch this thing over us for at least a full five minutes,  another car had pulled up behind us and stopped so I know someone else saw this same thing, but I was shaken by what I was seeing and did not try to talk to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The final thing that made this so disturbing was several helicoptors came in from the same path and about the same low altitude.  As they approached it started to move to the northeast and within seconds was completely out of sight.  There appeared to be several high flying planes following along the same flight path but this thing moved many times faster than the planes.  I don&#39;t know why I have decide to share this now as most people will not beleive it anyway, but we are still bothered by this to this day without resolve of what we saw.  We watch everything that comes on television about UFO&#39;s in the hope that somewhere someone will have a picture of something similar but so far we have seen nothing that even remotely resembles this thing.  In my mind it is still impossible for something this large and metalic just to float there, a stones throw above my head for so long and then leave with speed I have never witnessed before.  I can&#39;t explain it but maybe there are others that have been witness to something like this and like myself feel they cannot tell anyone. I feel deceived as I beleive someone knows what these things are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the other witnesses to submit their respective reports, as well, together with illustrations.

10/20/90 18:30|Almont|MI|Oval|30 minutes|UFO, Almont Michigan, Tree Top Lelel, Humming Sound|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64618.html|7|ndxe199010| UFO, Almont Michigan, Tree Top Lelel, Humming Sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the fall of 1990; I was in my home in Almont, MI. That time of year it gets dark quite early, it must of been around 8:00 p.m., &#34;the times are now just an approximation&#34;. My son, who at the time was around 12 came running in the house saying there was a UFO right outside our house. Let me add at this point I was not one that believed in UFOs. I went outside and my son pointed south and upwards and said look! The funny thing was at first I didn&#39;t see anything, but I did notice it was unusually dark, then I noticed a very dim light, I suddenly realized that the reason it was so dark was that there was a huge craft right over our driveway. It blocked all the starlight! It was at tree top level and was moving north at a very slow pace, &#34;approximately a slow walking speed&#34;. There was a very distinct humming, exactly like a large transformers hums, there was a very dull light in the middle and as it traveled down or driveway I made out a row of windows around the craft, the windows looked very large. I remember walking down the driveway with my son, and then the next thing I remember is standing out in the field north of my house still looking at the UFO, when suddenly it went from approximately 90 or 100 ft straight up in the sky to where it was a pinpoint of light. It just looked like another star. This happened in under a second. We continued to watch it for quite awhile when it took off in a northwesterly direction like a meteor and was gone in a second. There are allot of things I can describe if your interested, but this is the basic part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t feel like I was abducted, but I honestly do not remember how I got from my driveway and then in the field. I ask my son about it and he remembers things the way I do, but what I find unusual is that 1. I didn&#39;t really focus on it that much after the initial day it happened until a few years ago. 2. My son doesn&#39;t seem as interested as I am, even though he is a very intelligent guy. I have a lot of knowledge regarding aircraft. This will always go down as the most bizarre day in my life. By the way, it seemed like I was being watched by someone in the window, but it was like you could only make out a shadow. I am now fascinated by UFO&#39;s and I know that there out there. Almont is about 20 SE of Brown City. I have never seen another unusual craft. This was defiantly a UFO, there is no other explanation for it, I am the type of guy that checks his facts, there is nothing on our planet that I am aware of that could do what I saw! The pilots would be dead just from the G forces.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It surprises me that there have been so many incidences in that area and I never heard about it. From my house to the field was approximately 1000 feet, “you would think that with what was going on, I would remember that sort of distance&#34;. I am not really concerned weather anyone believes me or not, unless it is someone who’s job it is to investigate this sort of thing. They really need to have an open mind and check the facts. The last few years I have gotten increasingly interested in this subject and there have only been a few incidences that I have read about where people have been as close as I was. I guess I am just intrigued. It really fascinates me! The missing time, and it does bother me, when I put into perspective. I can remember everything about the sighting in detail except from the time the craft went from the barn behind my house until I remember standing in the field watching it go from an altitude of 90&#39; to just another star in the sky in the blink of an eye. This is the most significant event in my life and I can&#39;t remember just that particular part. I did have dreams afterward about all the neighbors being around looking and me yelling for them all to watch, but its a dream. I have brought it up several times to my son who is really a level headed intelligent guy and he remembers the same way I do, but he for some reason never brings it up himself. I really have to catch myself sometime to really put in perspective the significance about what happened that night. It just amazes the hell out of me. I really do think that somehow my mind was altered to either forget about it, or just not think it was that big a deal. Think about that, how could a person with the knowledge I have about aircraft not act in some way . This was the size of a football field! What it did breaks all laws of physics and for several years I really didn‘t give it that much thought. It is not like me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had transformers on appliances that started to burn out. I called Detroit Edison and they had to replace all the electric lines and main transformer on the line that followed the driveway right below where the UFO was following. This was within a month of the sighting. I remember the Detroit Edison crews telling me that all the insulation on the wires were gone. I thought that was a bit strange, but since then I have read quite a few articles about sightings near power lines with the same or similar results. I was so close, 90 ft. The funny thing about it was I didn&#39;t feel threatened, In a weird way I felt like it was something from our future, as bizarre as that sounds. I feel that we need to have confidence in our instincts; I felt like I was on display and was being watched. One thing I didn&#39;t mention and to this day I am not sure why I didn&#39;t act, is that I am a professional photographer. What a dummy! the shot of a life time and I didn&#39;t even think about it. This is another thing I cant explain, I take my cameras everywhere with me. The first ten years, I would occasionally ask my son if he remembered everything about that night and he would say yes, but not really want to talk about it. It seemed like more of a dream. WHY? Neither my son nor I am the type of person not to act on something so significant, an event of a life time .Another factor about that night was the route the craft was traveling, right down my driveway. My power lines go right down the drive and sometime that winter I had to call Edison out, they told me that the wires were completely bare&#34; no insulation at all&#34;, and had to replace them, including the transformer. I am not sure if it relates, but I have read stories about these craft using power lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s funny, you hear people talk about UFOs and some people will tell you that they have seen one, but you never really stop and give it deep thought because it&#39;s a bit hard to fathom the reality about them. I am now a person that can speak the truth about these craft, guess what, you better start polishing your tin foil hat because they are here. Think about all the incidents over the years, especially with all of the NASA sightings, even hovering over the White House. They always have an excuse, a flair, blimp, and the best and most used, a weather balloon. I am sure that a good percentage of reports are something explainable, but I am here to tell you, some aren’t. Sometimes I will think about it and realize that my son and I saw something that would be no less significant than telling your friends you met Jesus Christ. Well, you know what your friends would think. That’s why there are so many people that don&#39;t believe, it’s really too big to grasp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

There were several circling over the trees across from my house where then there were no other houses or trailors. They kept circling but going to the north east toward Tr-City Mall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within the next couple of nights I saw another object in the sky. This object came from the northeast and went sort of to the southwest-westerd over my house and my parents trailor. There were at least several hundred U.F.O.&#39;s/Space ships in the sky at once circling in different directions but heading southwest or westerd. All of these objects were made the same. They were all a like accept for their color. They ranged from solid colored in the rainbow. They were lite solidly all over like vibrant or sort of neon. There was a black circle on the very bottom which was solid black. There were lights that rotated around the outer edge of the craft of orange or red to yellowish or beidge to white. The craft got very close over my house and scared me very much. They never did completely stop but were going very slowly until they were all out of sight. From the time they came into sight until they went out of sight, it took them maybe around a couple of hours or more and this ended around 3:30a.m. or 4:00 a.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of four, seemingly serious-minded, reports from same witness.

I looked up into the night sky to see what if any stars I could see when I saw the following:  From my vantage point I could only see the shape of a square bottom surface about seventy five feet by seventy five feet and nine circles in a 3 x 3 grid. Each circle was protruding from the bottom like a squared edged donuts about 5 feet deep. All were the same size and equally spaced apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to be floating above the south edge of the airport at about one hundred to one hundred fifty feet. It moved very slowly across the sky about five to ten miles per hour toward the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had no lights at any point during my viewing. The only way I was able to see any details at all was due to the light reflected from the surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt no magnetic or electrical fields, but I was never directly under the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the object float by, I moved to get a better view, it never picked up its pace or altered its altitude. I heard a door open and saw my friend come outside to say good bye to me, I ran up to her and pulled her into the street to show her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She did not see what I saw because as I showing her the object, it became blocked by the trees. I ran futher down the street with her in tow and although I could still see the object, it was hard for her to see it as it had no lights. I ran us back to the house and jumped in my car and tried to follow it but as it was not following a street it soon was gone from my sight as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can give no reason why this airport would be of interest because as of now, it&#39;s closed down and a new airport is in operation. The only US Air Force base was just a reserve station at the time and shut down soon after Desert Storm. It became Austin&#39;s new airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally writing about this because I&#39;ve never seen anyone else describe a square object, and I thought someone else may have seen something similar. It has always made me wonder exactly what it was that I saw. I know I&#39;ll never know but the experience was awesome. I keep looking up in the night sky to see what I can find.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for me, I have spent most of my life around US Air Force bases. My father served and I served as well. For the first 28 years of my life I lived on or near a base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched SR-71&#39;s lift off from a California base, U-2&#39;s from a Florida base, I was on the Cape to watch a Shuttle launch, seen countless air shows, and once I saw a F-117 take off from a Texas base in broad day light. The F-117&#39;s profile was so strange I thought I was seeing my second UFO, but then it banked I saw the wing shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My job during active duty was in electronics and communication devices, during my reserve years I loaded aircraft, C-130&#39;s to C-5&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I like to think that I know aircraft, I&#39;ve built many models and continue to keep up with new aircraft design, as best as an ex-military man can. Generally I know what I&#39;m looking at when I look up into the sky but on this occassion I did not have one clue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

While driving I just happened to notice that there were no other cars on the highway going north or south except me. There were no lights on the road nor any house lights on either side of 167 because it was mostly farmland and pastures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of a sudden I saw this bright green sphere shoot down in my vision.  It was right in front of my truck. I could not tell how far away it was but in my view it seemed to be about the size of a quarter.  It was really bright green, almost fluorescent colored.  Its shape had a band that wrapped around it like a tootsie roll lolly pop. It stayed the same shape as I continued to drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going about 60 mph. I quickly looked around to see if there were any type of vehicles or lights coming from the side or anything that could explain this.  But there was nothing remotely similar to this object.  Then as fast as I saw this object it took off into the sky almost straight up in a split second.  I tried to track it but it was too fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I started to see vehicles on the highway going north as though there was a break in the regular traffic.  Then vehicles  heading south appeared in my rear view mirror.  It was almost like I was the only one who was allowed to witness this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never told anybody about this until a few months later. After that I started having dreams of something chasing me. The dreams lasted for several weeks then stopped.  I haven&#39;t seen anything like that again or have had dreams of being chased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Has fiery tail, triangular windows, fighter escort ...was called space junk by<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking home along the railroad tracks between the Omaha Stockyards and my apartment in LaVista near Papillion NE, not far from SAC Headquarters in Bellevue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I heard a low rocket noise and looked up. I saw a shimmering trail of white sparks. I gazed at it for awhile and could just make out a shape of some kind that I percieved to be an elongated shape. It was traveling at about 500-1000 feet. I thought I could make out faint triangular shaped &#34;windows&#34; in a row along the visable side. It was traveling in a North Easterly direction heading towards Millard. The key things that I noted about it was that I could make out a faint engine noise of some kind and that it was traveling very level and straight. It was flying at about the top speed of a single engine Cesna airplane, not very fast but at a good clip. I did gather that it had a rather massive size to it. It was a very big shadow that was darker than the new night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I also noted was this, I could see that it was being escorted by two other aircraft. I could make out their flashing marker lights. One on each side just slightly ahead of the larger object. I figured that whatever it was, it was being escorted by two fighter jets. Of this I have no doubt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, a small story was printed in The Omaha World Herald that some &#34;Space Junk&#34; had fallen and area residents had called in with UFO sightings. It&#39;s interesting that  this term space junk was again used later in another sighting in the same Sector of Nebraska. In the report on your site he was told that his Cigar shaped object was also just Space junk....If I ever go to that region of Nebraska again I&#39;ll make sure to bring my umbrella...it seems that there must be some sort of magnetic field that attracts all of these level flying space junk objects falling from the sky. I&#39;d really like to see how something falling can attain a level trajectory at about 750ft.

Location could be &#34;Pineville.&#34;  ??  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fast moving ball of light that can move at right angles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First,  I need to tell you that I really feel funny giving you a report that had happened  to me more than 10 years ago. The only reason I am giving you this &#34;report&#34; now  is that I feel compelled to do so after I had heard a very similar report on an Art Bell program in June of 1999.  This report was given by, I believe, a pilot who had witnessed this at night near or in some wooded area that either he lived in or was camping near.  Sorry, I don&#34;t remember the exact details except for his description of the object that he saw.  I was getting ready to be married in August of 1999 so I just procrastinated on getting this report to you. My story.  In October of 1990 I went hunting with three other hunting partners about 30 miles east of Prineville, Oregon in the Ochoco national forrest..  We made camp in an area that was fairly open and not too close to trees so we could avoid the risk of setting the area on fire from our much needed campfire.  We found an open area that seemed perfect for camping with a nice view of the surrounding  countryside.   The terrain of this area is somewhat mountainous but is a  combination of  tall pine and lots of open areas which is also fine for hunting.  East of the camp is the ridgeline of mountains that make up parts of the Ochoco national forrest and to the North is one of the main highways that run out of Prineville.  This highway runs parallel to a  river (the Crooked River, I believe), which runs east to west  through a canyon. On our second night there we had finished supper and were getting ready to get some sleep.  My other hunting buddies had already gone to  the tent to &#34;turn in&#34;  while I was standing by the campfire finishing up a cup of tea ( I have to add this part about the tea because, to be honest with you, when I hear of UFO reports coming from hunters I really wonder how much they have had to drink when they see these things).  Anyway,  a few minutes passed and I was still standing by the campfire looking east towards the top of the mountain range  when I saw a very bright bluish-white light traveling at a very high rate of speed above the treeline. .  It was travelling downwords,  heading due north at about a 25 to 35 degree angle.   It seemed to be leaving a &#34;trail of light&#34; behind it , but I think that was more of an optical illusion that  it created because of the speed it was travelling and the intensity of the light. When I first saw this object I thought that is was a meteorite.  I couldn&#39;t tell anything about it&#39;s size or how far away it was from me because, at that point,  I didn&#39;t have anything to reference it to.   It was definately between the mountain range and our camp but that only narrowed it down to be no more than four miles away maximum. It wasn&#39;t until it &#34;travelled&#34; down towards the highway that I could make a reference to how far away it was from me (about a half mile, I guess).  When it got down to the highway I thought I would hear an explosion or something, but it just made a right turn and headed east up the highway.   When I say right turn , I mean &#34;right turn&#34;.  There was no slowing down or anything. There was no &#34;easing&#34; into a turn like an aircraft would do but just a right angle turn. Then as the object headed east it &#34;lit&#34; up the whole area.  Before,  when a car or truck would travell on the highway at night we could just barely see the glow of the headlights because of the distance we were from them, but when this object went down to the highway and headed east it just lit up the whole canyon   I mean,  you could see every detail just like it was daylight except it had  more of  bluish hue to the light,  kind of like an arc welder. It was completely silent.  It made no sound at all, not even a sonic boom. Judging from the time it took from  near the mountain top and by the time it had arrived at the highway not more than 4 seconds had gone by.  That means that it had travelled about a mile per second.  When it continued to travel east it took another two or three seconds before it was gone and out of sight. After all this had happened I yelled over to my hunting buddies about the bright light that I had just seen but got a response about it was probably was a meteorite (yeah,  right!).  I stayed up for another few minutes hoping it would come back or another one might show up, but it never did. The campfire had burned down to glowing embers and to be honest I was getting just a little &#34;spooked&#34; standing out there by myself  so I decided to head to the tent to get some sleep. One of my buddies was still awake so I told him what had happened but I didn&#39;t know if he was really believing the story of what I had just witnessed. Anyway,  not much else was said and we decided to get some sleep. I was so &#34;wired&#34; I just couldn&#39;t think about anything except what I had just seen.  Then the really weird part happened.  While laying there sorting out what I had just seen,  a pack of coyotes started &#34;yipping and yelping&#34; and making the typical coyote noise that they usually make. But this was coming from just east of our camp (you know, from the direction of the UFO).    It got so loud that everyone of us was up.  I always carry a side arm and I was &#34;ready&#34;  if  the coyotes were going to go  bezerk or something. I really thought that they might try to get in the tent. They continued making this comotion as they ran just outside our camp and headed west. I don&#39;t know if this coyote incident  was related to  what I had seen,  but in my many years of hunting and camping I have never had something like pack of coyotes come into a camp like that  with a fire still smoldering. It really did seem like something spooked them. I know that they always try to avoid human contact at almost any price. I didn&#39;t bring up the incident again but a couple of weeks later one of my hunting buddies said that he had read an article in the paper ( The Oregonian) about the &#34;light&#34; that was apperently reported by some other witnesses that were in the area.  Well... I did feel a little more credible.    I never did try to look for the article so I can&#39;t say for certain when it was in there, but it would have been in the paper the last half of October, 1990. I used to be an avid hunter, but that was the last ime that I went and I&#39;ve never had the desire to go hunting again. End of my story.....I hope! If you have any questions please email me and I can either call you or email you. Thanks for listening, Terry<n>

We had gone out there looking at agave roasting rings, and just checking out the country. The date is approx. It could have been any time between 1988 and 1992. The sun had just gone down but it was still light out. We were on the north end of a small valley, having followed a jeep trail up an aluvial fan untill it ended. We had stopped to take a leak and, while looking south toward Las Vegas, we saw a very bright light rise from behind the hills on the other end of the valley and stop. We were a couple of valleys north of Vegas, so it appeared to have risen from a valley between us and Las Vegas. It sat perfectly still for so long that I began to think that I hadn&#39;t seen it rise, and that it was venus or something. But then it slowly dropped back behind the hill. After awhile, it rose back up and then started to move around. The way it moved was amazing. It would go from stopped to moving very fast with no acceleration or deceleration time. It would do geometric patterns with 90 degree angles without slowing down. It would get very bright and then get so dim we could hardly see it. Then it dropped behind the hill. Shortly after it rose the next time, another one came up. They sat perfectly still for just a moment and then they instantly started moving fast, flying in a chaotic pattern all around each other... like gnats, or humming birds. Then, they both darted out of sight. Shortly after they were gone (it was then completly dark) several helicoptors came over the hill from the  southeast (the dirrection of nellis AFB). They seemed to be combing the area. So my friend and I headded back. On the way down out of the park there was an area where we could briefly see the road further down, before a turn in the road obscured our view. In that brief time we saw a white truck with a shell. Looked like a government truck. By the time we could see the road again it was gone, and I&#39;m pretty sure there was no other road. It! must ha ve cut cross country because it didn&#39;t pass us and it wasn&#39;t between us and the 95 once we got out of the canyon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

We were headed east on Rte 302, at the stop light at the junction of Rte. 25. The fireball went in arch from south to north in front of us.  At first it was a shooting star the way it was moving.  We turned on left onto Rte 25 to follow it.  As the arch of the flight crossed Rte 25 over Little Sebgo Lake, it hovered for a second,  dropped and shot off across the lake, off at 90 degrees.  If I had to draw the path it would look like a perpendicular line. The incident was reported as a meteor the next day (Portland Press Herald).  I would have believed that to because it&#39;s path at first except for the perpendicular move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

When we walked outside to see why the car had stopped, we observed that the occupants of the station wagon (4 adults) were looking up to the sky.  When we turned our attention to the sky, we observed 5-6 bright white circular objects flying in a formation in the night sky from North to South.  These objects, which travelled at a slow pace, made no noise and left no trails while they flew overhead.  These objects flew at about a distance of 1000 to 1500 feet above the ground.  As I remember, the objcts flew in a triangular formation but did not stay in this formation.  The objects criss-crossed each other, changing positions in the formation, in a way that I would not think to be possible from any type of aircraft that I know of.  We all stood there and watched these objects until they disappeared over the tree filled-horizon toward Route 17 and SUNY Binghamton.  My mother called the State Police and they commented that they had several calls about these objects but the police did not know what they were.  We watched the local news and looked in the local newspaper for several days following the incident and found no inforamtion describing this event.<n>

It was around 9:00 p.m. I got the dog food and went to do the chore quickly so I could get back on the phone. It was a clear and cool night. While walking to feed the dog I noticed how beautiful the sky and stars were. I bent down to pour the food out into the dog dish as I stood up, I noticed this oval shaped flying object that had green and red lights circling in the middle. There were windows in the craft where I actually seen a green figure with a huge head and big bulging black eyes. This figure is just like what is reported in most alien sightings. This is how I know that I am not crazy. I seen this way before people went Area 51 crazy like they did in the late 90’s. The craft was flying extremely low across a field. After staring at it for about 2-3 minutes, the curiosity left and fear took over because it noticed me and started coming my way. I ran straight toward the house. As I approached the steps I looked back as the craft quickly went backwards out of sight. I was upset and got my parents to walk out to see maybe they could see it. They did not get to, it was gone. I knew what I seen. If you tell people this story they think you are making it up. After almost 18 years, I think about the sighting often and have a lot of questions. This sighting happened in Reidsville, GA. I could understand how people would feel this story is far fetched because if I would not have seen it, believing it  would be difficult, especially since I am almost a 31 year old man.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

They were lined up in a row-vertically.  They were all spherically shaped except the upppermost, which was shaped like a classic child&#39;s top.  They were all self-luminescent, and the appearance suggested some type of connecting, luminous cord.  All objects gave off a bright glow, similar to the glow given off by adjacent, moisture-laden clouds reflecting the bright sunlight.  The bottom sphere seemed to be smaller than the middle two, and, as stated before, the uppermost was shaped like your classic spinning top.  These objects would have never been detected had I not deliberately looked up.  I went in the house-they were first observed from my front porch-to get a camera.  When I returned, they were gone.  They were observed by yours truly, my wife, and eldest daughter.<n>

The clouds were traveling in a southeasterly direction, with the moon behind them the clouds were lit up like a neon sign.  For whatever reason we both looked up at the same time.  There was a translucent object traveling in a southwesterly direction, exactly opposite of the clouds.  All you could see was the outline of the craft.  It looked like a stealth bomber, but 10 times larger and the most remarkable thing of all, it made absolutely no sound what so ever as it passed over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

The exact date I cannot recall as it&#39;s been about 11 yrs. I was pregnant with my daughter, i must have been approximately 4-5 months, as I was not showing much. My husband worked a Saturday at a plant close to Regina, sk. where we lived at the time. He did not come home straight after work, and being a Saturday night, I decided to go looking for him, so i could also have a night out. So because we lived on the west end of Regina, I decided to use the backroads to Pense. I was not very familiar with these roads. There was pavement for a few miles, but after a while it turned to gravel. So once i hit the gravel, it was very difficult to drive due to the heavy raining. still travelling west, i knew i&#39;d have to make a left turn in order to get to Pense, but was not sure which road was the turn-off. So, i took a guess, and saw lights, which appeared to be a small town(it was). So i made a left. When i was turning, I saw no lights, directly in front of me, but once i completed the turn i looked down for a second looked up and there appeared to be a vehicle in front of me. I thought at the time how weird this seemed, but i thought that perhaps someone was pulled over and started their vehicle right then. So i slowed down and followed what i thought to be a vehicle of some sort. i thought the lights at the time seemed unusual, but i kept making excuses, like maybe they looked weird because it was so dark? at first they kind of looked like a vehicles lights? maybe. it was so long ago. but after awhile there seemed to be wiggling lights in between two red lights. i thought &#34;what the heck would make wiggling lights like that?&#34; i thought &#34;ok, it must be a car or something, maybe pulling a trailer, and that would maybe explain the wiggling ?&#34; I was a little afraid, but calmed myself down be thinking i was imagining things. So i was! getting closer and closer to pense, this thing was in front of me, i looked down for a brief second and up again, and whatever it was completely dissapeared. Far fetched hey? i thought there had to be a logical explanation for this. There was no right hand turns for this vehicle to go down, it was not ahead of me as i would have seen it, as highway #1 was ahead a few miles and the road was a little illuminated by lights, so i would have seen it, and the left hand turn into Pense would be the only place that this vehicle could have turned onto, but there was not enough time for this object to make a left-hand turn into town. But i decided to go down this only road and drive fast and look to see if there were any vehicles that may have just turned, but there was nothing for vehicles around, and the adjoining streets also had nothing for vehicles. and that is my story. I still wonder about that night. there are absolutely no explanations. this is the gospel truth, i swear!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My girlfriend was helping me relocate back to coalinga from fresno, ca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 10:00-10:30 at night.  We were driving on the outskirts of Fresno when I notice this bright very fast moving object in the sky. We tried to follow it, but it was difficult to keep up with this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point it stoped and seemed to divide into three objects. There was a fruit orchard on the passenger side of the road, the object hovered then disappered into the orchard. We turned left and drove til we seen the objects fly out of the orchard. Then we followed them for at least a hour. Then they seemed to notice us and they started to follow us. We could not drive fast enough. Then I remember pulling into a diner very scared.  Later, we recounted our story to my friends dad he said it was a weather ballon.  We never believed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, about six mounths later i was driving and seen this big bright hovering light???<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

10/1/90 22:15|Jamestown|NY|Light|20 minutes|A row of porthole shaped lights hovering at an altitude of approx. 500 feet spanning a distance of about 1 mile.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55862.html|25|ndxe199010| A row of porthole shaped lights hovering at an altitude of approx. 500 feet spanning a distance of about 1 mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what Arizona Gov. Fife Symington wintessed, otherwise known as the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34;.  It was a row of circular, porthole shaped lights in a perfect, symetrical straight line. The porthole-shaped lights were equal-distant apart. The entire row of these lights spanned an estimated 1 mile across the night sky. The estimated altitude was approx. 500 feet.  I was on my way home from work when I spotted this.  I was heading east on Baker St. Extension, approx. 2 miles from the city limits of Jamestown, N.Y.  These lights were near a radio station tower. The tower is approx. 200 feet high and by comparison, that&#39;s how I was able to estimate the altitude of these lights.  I did not see the shape or outline of any spacecraft, only the porthole lights. I did not think it was one craft but many in formation. However, after seeing video of the Phoenix Lights, I now know it was one craft.  The video of the Phoenix Lights captured EXACTLY what I saw. When this event occurred, I pulled my car over to the side of the highway. I got out of my car and just observed it for about 10 minutes. I got into my car and kept glancing at it as I was driving into the city.  I lost sight of it as the city lights flooded out my view of the sky.  I checked the local paper the next day to see if this event had been witnessed and reported by anyone else. To my great disappointment, nothing! No mention of it in the newspaper or on the local radio stations. Thank you for accepting my report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/1/90 20:00|San Pedro|CA|Light|2min|a small light in the sky, making the shape of a equiangular triangle then shooting away at a high rate of speed.|1/19/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41501.html|26|ndxe199010| a small light in the sky, making the shape of a equiangular triangle then shooting away at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a night sighting in a backyard in San Pedro CA., at the Los Angeles Harbor and Cabrillo Beach area.  A small light in space that looked like a faint star was just south east of being over head.  At first it was stationary, but then started to move in a perfectly straight line for a few seconds(if you hold your thumb out at arms length the distance moved would be about 2 thumbs width), then instantly changed direction in exactly 80 degrees from its previous course and again went perfectly straight for a few seconds traveling the same distance, then once more instantly changing direction 80 degrees from its previous course. It moved back to it&#39;s original location then a few second later took off like a shooting star torwards the horizon.  The were no obstructions overhead such as clouds, electrical wires, or planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

10/1/90 17:00|Pateros|WA|Oval|05min|One Gray metal oval disc, aporx. 10'x50', clear sky,  1 qaurter mile away|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49230.html|27|ndxe199010| One Gray metal oval disc, aporx. 10&#39;x50&#39;, clear sky,  1 qaurter mile away<n> <n><n> <n><n> While at work, supervising a crew of apple pickers, myself and a tractor driver was talking about hunting,I was facing to the south east, when the noise of Fedex plane caught my attention, it was flying to Omak from Wenatchee up the columbia river and on the side oppisite to us I could see something flying along with the plane, the plane was aprox. one quarter of a mile away from us, the oval shaped craft was so close to the plane it was partully hidden as I watched the oval craft moved over the top of the plane very slowly the look that came over my face caused the person with me to turn around and look.  At the time he looked the ufo was about ten feet above the fedex plane. He said &#34; What&#39;s that one of those Awax planes&#34;?  And I said, &#34; If it is it&#39;s going to crash because it&#39;s falling apart!  As we watched ufo moved over to the side closest to us, at this time the other fellow said &#34; It&#39;s one of those ufo,s&#34;!  At this time I checked my watch, it was) 5:05p.m. I asked him what it looked like to him, and he said it look like a water tower with no legs. We watched it fly north at the same speed and altitude as the plane all the while slowly moving off to the west of the plane. we watched them both until they dissapered into the distance,they where aprox. one quarter of a mile apart at that time. At that I remmembered a light that woke my wife up a week earlier, she woke me up from the deepest sleep I have ever experinced, she was saying some one was outside, I said it was the irrigators, she said that it was to early, that it was only 03:00 a.m. I said that it was someone out partying, she said that there wasn&#39;t any noise. There was light coming through ever window in the house, she said &#34; It&#39;s up in sky&#34; I said it was the moon. In a frantic voise she said &#34;It&#39;s moving&#34;! I jumped out of bed, ran through the house, I could see light coming in through every window in the house, it was slowly moving in a fashion that seemed up and down, up and down, as I reached the front door the light moved up, and gone, I went out side there was nothing there. this story goes on and on for years,I recent sighting by my son and his girl friend prompted me to subment this report. we now live in Arkasas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
