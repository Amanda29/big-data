I was coming from west Chula Vista.  I  came down E St. heading east and got lost.  I grew up there so I was surprised that i was lost.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In those days Bonita still had farmland up in the hills and I  found myself near one and on a dirt road with a great view overlooking  I805 looking west.  It was still light with little  clouds.  I saw the Goodyear Blimp over the freeway which wasn&#39;t unusual, although this one had  lights covering the ENTIRE body, not just a screened area.  The lights moved clockwise together vertically, row by row. I was actually enjoying watching it just floating over the freeway very slowly and calmly going in and out of small clouds and not too high. Blimp height, just like a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was watching this and thinking how I hadn&#39;t ever seen a blimp like this, it suddenly took off upward sooo fast leaving a trail toward the south.  My hair stood on end.  I realized it was dark now and shook all the way down the hill. I found the Chapel and was still shaking when I told my friends.  No one believed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did report it to a UFO reporting sight where you could call in the sighting.  The guy who took my report said there were no other reports in that area that night.  I no longer remember what reporting entity it was but it was in Washington State.<n>

It was bright white with red flashes, moving slowly upward...<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home I pointed out the object to my mother, father and one sister.  (a farm family, 5 miles away from the nearest town)  We watched the object continue slowly upward out the north window of our house.  It then speed up and to the right before stopping.  After sitting still for a minute or so, the main object got lighter as a small red object seperated and slowly moved to the east of the main object. Shortly after, another small red object moved off to the west, again making the main object lighter.  The remaining part of the main object then moved off to the west.  The final three objects looked the same, each having 2 points of red light.  They moved slowly out of site.  The events took 5 to 7 minutes to transpire.<n>

There was no sound! Headed over town, made a left bank, and went south at a very high rate of speed. Very soon after that all the neiborhood dogs started to all bark at the same time.I know what aircraft look like that was no plane! or chopper!<n>

They were moving slowly around each other in no particular pattern.  I yelled &#34;ufo&#34; and pointed to them, but everyone just said &#34;yeah, we know, they&#39;ve been there for days&#34;.  I tried to find out more information but no one wanted to talk about it.  I couldn&#39;t believe their reaction; nor understand it.  It&#39;s been many years since that happened.  I don&#39;t know the exact month or day.  Even the year is in question.  It could have been late 1980 or early/mid 1981.  I&#39;ve never forgotten that incident, however and have often wondered if the source of those lights had been discovered.  Could it have been weather balloons, satellites?  If they had been there for days and those people in the car had known of them, then others in that town must have seen them too.  I looked all through your data base but didn&#39;t find anything reported that was similar either in Nova Scotia or around the same date.  Have never seen anything since and would like to hear of any similar sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>
1/15/81 20:00|Long Beach|CA|Triangle|10-15 sec|5 dull red lights in V formation cruising over the coast of Long Beach|8/7/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82994.html|5|ndxe198101| 5 dull red lights in V formation cruising over the coast of Long Beach<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been thinking about this for years and, due to some recent TV shows, I have decided I should report what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event occurred in either 1980 or 1981.  It has been so long ago I don&#39;t really remember.  I do know where I was living at that particular time so that is how I got the year.  I was also in the presence of a friend when the event occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was sometime around the winter of 1980/81.  I was living in Belmont Shores California.  The evening was cold and very clear with an unusual amount of starts out.  A friend of mine and I decided to walk a couple of blocks down to the beach to look at the stars.  I&#39;m not sure how long we were there when we saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first notice the lights in the South West.  The beach we were at faces South.  The object was actually 5 lights; I think.  They were in the formation of a gigantic &#34;V&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I watched until we lost it in the bright lights of the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.   We did not observe any type of body associated with the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching we were screaming out for others to see but no one was around.  It must have been 10-15 seconds we watched.  I distinctly remember saying it wasn&#39;t making any noise because we could see commercial airplanes high up and hear their engines.  The lights were moving much faster than the aircraft but no noise and it seemed it was just lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was really weird at the time is that the lights did not shine.  I never knew how to explain it but now I think they might have been like a LED light similar to the red ones indicating an electrical device is on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason I am writing now is because I have recently seen a couple of UFO shows where people have seen the same thing we did.  The only difference is that we could not make out any shape or object and could only see the 5 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

1/15/81 10:00|Colorado Springs|CO|Triangle|10|Triangular black craft in broad daylight hovering high and then speeding off.|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54859.html|7|ndxe198101| Triangular black craft in broad daylight hovering high and then speeding off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting has stuck clearly in my memory for 20+ years although I only occasionally thought about it over the years as you hear about UFOs.  It was a sight where you instantly know this is something extraordinary and not what our brains are used to processing and seeing.  I never really investigated anything more about it over the years because the craft I saw was triangular and I never heard of anyone seeing such a thing.  Until yesterday.  I watched a cable special about the UFO incident in 2000 near St. Louis with the various officer sightings of a black triangular object.  I then checked the internet to see about sightings in Colorado at roughly the same time of mine.  I have goose bumps again to see so many similar sightings from seemingly credible accounts.  My story is brief but it left a permanent record on my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t remember the exact date but it was in the early 1980s and I was a passenger in a car with my brother driving.  We were on a small street road near our house and it was daylight and very clear.  As we were driving, I casually glanced at Pikes Peak which occupies a large part of the mountainous view in Colorado Springs.  Near the top (above treeline) and slightly to the right of Pikes Peak was a triangular black object that appeared to be rotating.  It was close to Pikes Peak and probably 5 miles from me - line of sight.  I could tell it was very large given its relative dimension to Pikes Peak just behind it.  Had this been at night I could have dismissed it as any possible craft but being a clear day I was instantly startled as to what this was.  I had a good familiarity with military aircraft with my father in the Air Force and growing up in Colorado Springs near the Air Force Academy.  As I stated, the fact that it was triangular and didn&#39;t seem to have any other discernable shape or markings, I was amazed at what this might be.  I immediately told my brother to look and even told him &#34;stop the car&#34; and look.  By the time he finished asking &#34;what is it&#34; and stopped the car, I watched it disappear at an incredible speed over and behind Pikes Peak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw it or anything like it again but after reading these accounts I felt I had to add my story to the many accounts listed.  I am shocked to see many accounts even older than mine of similar sightings which indicates it could not have been any kind of experimental military craft.  I hope one day I can find out what it was and solve the mystery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was driving north on Inwood drive (in front of the swimming pool) heading toward Rt. 40.  Straight ahead over the trees surrounding Little Darby Creek were three red lights in a triangular pattern.  It was solid in between the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved north a little further, possibly over Haymarket Rd. off Taylor-Blair Rd. and turned completely sideways into a left hand turn and disappeared.  As they all say, it was roughly the size of a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10 pm in West Jefferson the town is empty and everyone I ever asked just looked at me like I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Visibility was about 20 feet. While sitting on my car hood on a known turn out with at least a 100 foot drop off past the guard rail, we realized the crickets in the area became very quiet. A few seconds later we were illuminated by a intense light beam. I looked at the light and saw it was mounted on some type of bracket with a dark projection below it resembling a boom microphone. We ran for the drivers door of my car and as we entered the car the light turned off and the fog swirled as if a large oblect left upward. At no time during the encounter did I hear anything. FYI I am now a police officer and don&#39;t consider myself a UFO buff or even believer. I am just telling you about something that happened 20 years ago that I can not explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I saw in the far northwest a object that looked like a rocket launching. I was taken aback and continued to watch the event as the object came closer I changed my mind on what it was to an airplane on fire. As it came closer to the High School I changend my mind again to a U.S.S.R. Missile, bits and pices were falling off of it and I was stuck not knowing either to run home and warn my mother or run back to warn my girlfriend. I just stood there watching the object come closer two huge beams of light lit up the town looking to me like it was searching for a place to land ( I had changed my mind again to a crashing plane until then.) It came to me that none plane that I knew of had search lights on it as tahey continued to scan the area even reflecting off the silver roof of the hight school. And I didn&#39;t know what it was until both light merged on my in the middle of the band field, I was temporay blinded by the bright white blue light. Cars stoped on the street behind me South Rock Island and people got out yelling what is that! I looked up and saw a craft with the back end blown off ti looked like a cookie with a bite taken out off with bits of white flakes falling off of it and disappering before they reach the ground. I saw windows running the lenght of the ship and red emergancy lights in the background and people running from the the back to the front of the craft. One being stopped and saw me looking up at them I want so badly to communcate with them so I waved the being wave back another being ran by stopped and looked at me. It pulled the being I was waveing at away from the window as the craft continued to the southeast, seven alterating disc of multicolor shot off the the south west the disc changed colors were white,red,blue,green,yellow then back to white. I continued to watch the now crewless ship go the southeast and it split ! into thr ee segments and was gone. I rushed home and told my mother what had happend then rushed to a friends house. He was watching T.V. and the announcer came on saying &#34;If you seen a strang sight in the sky...&#34; She was cut off later in May on the NBC World News Tom Brokaw said it was a Russian Rocket booster. It didn&#39;t look like a rocket booster to me!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the witness attempt to contact other witnesses to the incident, and locate any newspaper articles that may have been written.

1/1/81 00:01|El Cajon|CA|Sphere|30 minute|My husband and I were at home just bringing in the new year of 1981 watching the the ball drop in New York city having not even a glass|1/22/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34606.html|12|ndxe198101| My husband and I were at home just bringing in the new year of 1981 watching the the ball drop in New York city having not even a glass of wine to celebratethe event. To my surprize my cousin Sheree her two childern and her friend Lisa and her daughter knocked on my door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were hysterical and said they saw a ufo, I in turn summed it up to they must have had too much to drink. They insisted that I go outside and that maybe it was still there. To my amazement it was there. From here I will discribe what I saw: It was a large clear sphere about fifteen feet in diameter and about four stories high. I remember the childern were crying with fear but all I could do was stand there with my mouth wide open starring at it. It must have remained ther for at least 20 minutes, I could see right through it and the stars behind it. It did have a thin cloud like substance on the bottom. The object made no sound and when if finnally took off it still made no sound but move extremly fast upward and over, faster and further than anything I&#39;ve ever seen. I immediately went in the apartment and called called the police to report and ask if any one else had seen anything like I discribe. He said no and that was that. The next day I read that somewhere in the south a carousel shaped object was seen. Last but not least the strange thing about this whole story is my cousin and I never spoke of the incident for eight years and yet we spoke almost on a weekly basis. Eight years later when I did speak to her about it she said it was the first for her too. She also mentioned that the kids remember the clouds on the bottom of it where she had not but I had. If it were not for that experience I am sure I would not believe in ufos to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, ((name deleted))<n>
