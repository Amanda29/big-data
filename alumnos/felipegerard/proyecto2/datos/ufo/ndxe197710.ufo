Kind<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was sometime during the fall of 1977. I was six years old.  My father was stationed at Ft. Wayne, Indiana.  Our family was late night fishing at a lake near the military installation.  The lake was in a secluded wooded area.  The approximate time was 11:30 p.m. I recall that it was a clear and cool night.  The object first appeared in the distance flying military crest along the mountains.  We could only see the lights which were approximately 5-8 miles away.  My father, an aircraft mechanic for the Army, was not sure of the object.  He stated that it was moving too fast for a helicopter and flying much too low and fast to be a prop aircraft.  We ignored it after that it wasnâ€™t until 15 minutes later the object was hovering near us at the lake.  It was approximately 100 ft from our location, in the open observing us.  We remained motionless and stared at the craft during the entire duration.  The object was hovering 50 ft off the ground.  It was a disc shaped objec! t about 75 ft in diameter, with domes above and below the main hull.  Lights of various colors flashed around the domes.  The craft was silent and remained hovering for 10 mins before lifting off slowly, heading away from our location then accelerated quickly out of sight.  I will never forget this night.<n>

The kids were asleep early and we were just chatting. They went in side to get more parts for something they were working on and I saw it alone, but the next day the neighbor boy ask me if I had seen it he had also seen it and was looking for some one to validate his siting. There was a hill in between 2 other hills about 30 miles from us and I saw a bright light there on that middle hill, then the hill slowly raised into the sky and disapeared. The neighbor boy saw exactally what I did, we asked around but most people were afraid to commit even though we could tell they had seen something strange. There has never been a hill there again.  Over the years we have seen strange red lights and orbiting formations but nothing like the 77 incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is precise.

At a 4-way stop in the Garden City area of the city, I looked out the passenger window and saw a large triangular object hovering over our car.  It had rained earlier, there were low clouds, and sodium vapor lights made it quite bright in the dark. The triangular object was very dark gray against the lighter low clouds. I noticed black lines underneath it, arranged very like a circuit board.  It was motionless and soundless for about 15 seconds.  It then slowly moved across the street at the rate of a person walking across a street.  It hovered over the convenience store on the other side of the street and then the street lights went out in the vicinity.  I could see the glow of sodium vapor street lights over the city about 3 miles to the south, and the glow of street lights ahead of me approx. 2 miles to the west.  All other lights were out. The object continued to hover for about 10 seconds and then &#34;Whooshed&#34; a! way at a very accelerated rate ... like a &#34;cartoon whoosh&#34;.  When it was out of sight, the street lights in the vicinity came back on.  I noticed there were 1 or 2 cars at the 4-way stop.  We proceeded on our way.  My dad and I did not speak, which afterward I thought was very strange.  We only discussed it the day after.  My dad saw the same object and behavior, but he saw lights around the object - which I did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About me: I was about 15 years old at the time of this incident (and an excellent student).  My dad was a professional symphony musician. I am a Systems Engineer and an alumna of an Ivy League school.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Being the gadget guy that I am, I was fascinated by how humans had put into orbit such crafts.  I usually would observe 5 to 7 satellites a night before retiring to bed.  Then at around 9:30 p.m., I observed 3 satellites that were closely and perfectly equidistant from each other.  The trio caught my special attention.  I thought I was so lucky to have been witnessing a rare coincidence.  They were moving with identical velocities from North to South.  One object led the other two.  Then, without warning, they all STOPPED for at least a full second!  The manner in which they stopped really surprised me because they did not slow down to a stop but simply stopped dead in their tracks.  Then they moved again immediately with the previous velocities, but in three different directions: the leader continued southward, one went 45 degrees to the left, while the third one went 45 degrees to the right.  It was an amazing sight.  I watched them all until they disappeared into the horizon.  Even at that time, I thought about what technology, if earthly, could do that... or from which country.  But to this date, over 21 years later, I know of absolutely no air or space craft technology that could do what those three objects did.  I am a man of science with a Ph.D. and so I always try to find answers to the way things work, especially those that catch my interest.  For this one: extra-terrestrial.<n>

Anyways, This was so vivid that I can still see it.  It was a fall day. The Yankees had just beaten the Dodgers in the World series game in La to go up 3 games to 2. We were outside shooting hoops in the driveway.  Me, a couple of my friends and my Brother. I believe my Mother was inside at the time, I can&#39;t remember if my other Sister or Father were?  Just over the tree tops heading in the direction similar to flight patterns of planes landing at Tweed New Haven airport was this disc shaped object with white rotating lights around the rim of it...Clear as day.  It was maybe a few hundred feet or so above the rooftops of the homes.  We lived on a dead end and it was a crisp cool autumn day. Not too many people were out, other than those at our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to see if my Mother had heard our calls and looked out to see it.  I fumbled for the phone and called information for Tweed New Haven.  Once I called I asked them if they had been receiving calls about a UFO sighting. He blew it off stating that it was a weather balloon and the lights that I was seeing rotating were a messageboard saying &#34;congratulations to the Yankees&#34; for winning the world series! It was at that point, a young boy and avid Yankee and sports fan in general responded &#34;  The Yanks didn&#39;t win the series....they&#39;re up 3 games to 2&#34;!   The man...fumbled for words again and dismissed quickly saying they&#39;ll make note of the report.  But not to worry!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The 5th game of the 1977 World Series was played on Sunday, October 16, 1977, at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.

10/15/77 23:00|Kennewick|WA|Light|5 minutes|Huge circular orbs of flaming red light flew above the river right in front of me one night while I was camping.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14888.html|6|ndxe197710| Huge circular orbs of flaming red light flew above the river right in front of me one night while I was camping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In October of 1977 I was camping along the Snake River at Hood Park which is right outside of Pasco, Washington. My companion and I had been in town visiting friends that evening and since we were both driving our own vehicles, I headed back to the campsite in my own car ahead of him. When I got to the campsite, our two dogs were frantic because their ropes were all tangled around each other and they wanted to be loose, so I walked over to where they were tied up and set them free. I grabbed some soap and a washcloth from the tent and started walking towards a water faucet that was about 40 yards from our tent. The dogs started racing around me in endless circles which I thought was strange because they were extremely excited and unusually rambuncious, but I just figured in that moment that they were just glad that I had gotten home to set them free. However, they were annoying me because they were getting in my way and I yelled at them to go play somewhere else and they took off in a flash. At that point I looked to my right towards the river and up to the sky. It was a brilliantly clear night, no moon, with lots of shining stars all around. As soon as I looked towards the sky, I stopped dead in my tracks because I was staring at two huge orbs of light that were silently cruising right above the river in front of me. They were not very high in the sky at all and were flying right above the river, about as high as a crop duster plane might fly if it was getting ready to position itself for the next pass over a field. I knew immediately that they were not of this world and I dropped to my knees. My mind started racing.....I was not afraid.....in fact, I began to mentally send my thoughts skyward with a million questions......&#34;who are you? Where are you from? What are you doing here? Are you who I think you are?&#34; and so on and so forth. These orbs of light were as big and as round as a full moon can sometimes look as it is rising low upon the horizon. I&#39;m talking huge here. They were definitley orbs of light, but as I stared at them I could see a slight outline behind the light that looked to me like an &#34;H&#34; shape, an &#34;H&#34; that was laying flat and flying. The light itself did not look like the kind of light that we are accustomed to. In other words, the light did not have a neon or artificial kind of quality to it. It seemed to have a life and energy of it&#39;s own. In fact, it reminded me of a burning coal....it had the same qualities and color and glow of a burning ember. The orbs of light also sparkled around the outer edges, similar to how a diamond sparkles when hit by rays of light, and they were exceedingly beautiful. So beautiful that my mind was overwhelmed by the greatness of their beauty and I just kept saying mentally &#34;you are so beautiful!!!&#34; These orbs of light (or celestial vehicles as I like to call them) were moving very slowly above the water, one in front of the other at exactly the same height in the sky. They made no sound, no sound at all. In fact, I was stunned at how quiet it was. They just flew by, right in front of my eyes, and then slowly made a 90 degree turn and headed towards the town of Pasco, the direction of which was going away from me, not towards me. As they continued to move away from me and away from the river, the orbs of light appeared to become one, but that was because one was right in front of the other and they were at the exact same height in the sky. At this point I was feeling extremely disappointed that they were leaving me behind because they had allowed me to see that they existed and I wanted to know much more about who and what they were. My mind began to cry out to them saying &#34;please don&#39;t leave me now that you have allowed me to see that you exist!&#34;....and then I started to pray, and I said to God, &#34;please Father, if these orbs of light are in some way connected to you, please give me a sign&#34;. Amazingly, as that thought and prayer left my mind, the two orbs of light, in unison, suddenly sprang into action and zipped through the night sky in an exact movement that left red tracers in the sky in the shape of a huge triangle. I burst into laughter at that point and said to God &#34;Oh Father!!! Is is too much for this tiny doubting soul to ask to see that one more time?&#34; and in immediate response to that request, the orbs of light zipped through the night sky again and left the red tracers of a huge triangle in the sky. At that point, they disappeared from view, and I rose up from my knees and started walking back towards my tent, but I swear to you that I did not feel the ground under my feet! I felt like I was walking on air. My companion had just gotten back to our campsite and his back was to me as I walked towards him, but he did not hear my approach, which I thought was strange since the night was quie! t and th ere were leaves all over the ground that should have been crunching as I walked, but even I did not hear the sound of my own footsteps. I walked right up to my companion and tapped him on his shoulder, and as he turned around, quite startled, I found myself trying to tell him what I had just witnessed, but my voice was barely a whisper as I felt as if I was under some kind of magical spell that I did not want to break. Unfortunately, my companion did not believe my story, and his disbelief made me decide to keep this experience to myself and I did not tell anyone about this event for another 10 years. I have only told my closest family members and friends about this and I admit, if I hadn&#39;t seen it with my own eyes, I would probably have a hard time accepting it as fact. But fact it was and is and even though I cannot prove that this ever happened, I know what I saw and experienced. This was not a vision or a hallucination.....this was a physical manifestation of something beyond this world and it was decidely celestial in origin. Since then I have continued to watch the night sky and have seen quite a bit of activity way up there where the satellites roam, but some of what I&#39;ve seen leads me to question whether or not it&#39;s all just satellite action up there as I have seen 3 to 4 white lights flying side by side going in various directions a number of times. I believe that we are not alone and it remains to be seen how this is all going to turn out. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to tell my story. I&#39;ve been carrying it around for a really long time. Take care and God bless....<n>

The sighting occurred one evening at approximately 9:00 PM during that interval; the exact date or time was not recorded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I had an off-base apartment just off the beach on highway 90 which runs through Biloxi. We had been for a walk on the beach and were returning to our apartment, looking up at the night sky. Simultaneously we both saw a black, triangular object go across the sky from south to north. The flight path was from the Mississippi Sound and over the western side of Kessler AFB, which was approximately 1/2 mile from our apartment. The object had no lights and made no sound. The object appeared to be black, and it was mainly seen because it blocked out the stars as it flew overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be flying at an altitude of between 500 and a thousand feet, with an airspeed of 100 to 150 mph. It was shaped like a equilateral triangle with sides of approximately 100 feet. However, since the object made no sound, and it flew directly overhead without any distant landmarks to compare for size, it is difficult to estimate the size, speed or altitude of the object with any certainty. I could have been an even larger object, at a much higher altitude flying at a very fast airspeed. The size, speed and altitude are simply my best guess based on my recollection of an event that occurred over 30 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest aspect of the sighting was the absolute silence of the object. It made no sound whatsoever. It was also strange that it was running without lights, and the shape was like no aircraft that I know of from that era. It could have been a test version of the B2 stealth bomber, but that doesn&#39;t explain the silence. There was no engine noise that either my wife or I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I happened to be watching the full moon and mentioned how beautiful it was along with the night, when I saw what appeared to be a glass cylinder comming from behind the moon and was only visible because of it. As the moon shone down and it just appeared to wisp upon whatever invisible material the cylinder was made of.It looked like glass but we know thats impossible, so it would be as a molecular structure that I knew nothing of. We went searching for the end of it as it seemed to touch the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We dorve a little way,maybe 1/8 of a mile and it seemed to end in the woods.We were in a semi-country neighborhood so we just couldnt go trapesing in the trees and leave our vehicle and it was fascinating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we tried to find a closer entrance to the woods , it started to fill with what appeared to be smoke,and the amazing thing was the steam never left the confines of the cylinder,even though it was invisible except for the steam it held. The steam began rising and as we got to a better viewing area the steam turned darker like smoke and the cy;inder kept it&#39;s three dimensional shape thill the smoke became totally black and the cylinder started to rise simultaneously it became more two demensional and looked like a telephone pole in sillouette and then became like a solid object and seemed to pass in front of the moon,rise up further,then cross the moon and move out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all forgot it till years later and my one buddy has passed away and he had finally remembered it.My other buddy is still around, we are just kids around 52 and 48. We always wanted to share it but for some strange reason we let it go.I have often wanted to call NASA and see if others may have saw it.I know it was not of this Earth. It could have been a soul being lifted to Heaven or an Angel transporting. It could have been a molecular transference.(beam me up Scotty )lol. Seriously, this has always amazed me and I saw the show and had to share this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, G. B.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object appeared solid and metalic.  My younger brother and I insist the object was orange, but his friend believed it to be greenish. 2nd Object: Estimated diameter was about 1 foot.  The sphere was red and appeared luminiscent. The first object appeared above a neighbor&#39;s house while we were standing on the sidewalk.  It hovered above the house and some power lines.  The second object, a red sphere, came out of the object and descended about 10 feet below the first object.  After the descent of the sphere, the pyramid object began to rise and move slowly toward the south-east.  After traveling slowly for several hundred yards, it accelerated very quickly on its south-east path and disappeared.  I can&#39;t recall what happened to the red sphere. I was about 12, my brother 9 and his friend about 10.
