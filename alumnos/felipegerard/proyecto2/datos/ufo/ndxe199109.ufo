In San Marcos, Texas  I was stargazing.  The sky was very clear, although there was no moon out that night, the stars could be seen clearly. I turned my attention on a star within the Southwestern part of the nigh sky, at this moment, The star seemed to just &#34;go out, like a light&#34;. I couldn&#39;t believe what had just happened, and immediately this captured my full attention. just then, I began to notice the other stars to left of the star that seemed to have just disappeared a moment ago, also began to go out one by one from my line of sight. I began to strain my eyes to better adjust them with the darkness of the night sky. There were some street lights nearby, but they were behind me at the time, and did not have interference. As I stood there watching the stars seem to continue going out like lights one at a time, I took notice of a large black silhouette in the sky, all I could make of it that m! oment was just a giant black mass, shape still unclear. The unknown object was traveling South, then it began to tilt, and turned towards the south, southwest, now, moving away from me, at the time it tilted to the right, I then noticed it&#39;s shape. It was a giant &#34;V&#34; shaped u.f.o. It had no lights, no sound. It was just a black Silhouette, V-shaped craft. My guess would say it was about 300 yards long, and about 1-2 hundred yards wide. A huge craft! I was truly shocked, and amazed. I thought to myself it was larger than entire football stadium. It drifted silently a few hundred feet above the trees, totally silent, A capitol class cruiser. I don&#39;t know why, but this thought just came to mind; &#34;A capitol  class cruiser&#34; . That night in particular, there was a new home improvement store opening on the opposite side of the highway from where I was when I encountered the sighting. At that time, there were two searchlights used as an attraction for the new building. To me, the c! raft seemed to be heading over the highway, as if to be attrac! ted to t he traffic on the road. But the way it suddenly pitched to the right, away from the highway, it now seemed to me as if it was trying to avoid the searchlights which were still in operation. I know what I had seen that night. And I know it was not man -made, and it was not from this world. I have spoken to only a few people about this incident. And it has been years since I have mentioned this to anyone since then.<n>

I looked and spotted a trinagular craft, with a circle in it&#39;s center.  The circle had lights on it&#39;s edge and seemed to rotate in a clockwise rotation where the triangle did not.  I made my girlfriend at the time look and see it as well.  The craft circled a bit and seemed to hover near the Death Valley football field&#39;s lights, which were on for a game the next day.  It was friday, and games were on Saturday.  After she saw it, and asked me what it was,  I said I didn&#39;t know and it either dissappeared, or accellerated way quickly enough that I could no longer see it.   1991 was before the internet, but I have never forgotten this incident.  I mentioned this on /UFO on the IRC once and was advised to report it then,  but I chickened out.  But after years of looking at UFO pics,  I have never seen one that resembled what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

This light was stationary and what appeared to be a tube of light began decending towards the ground.  It took approximately 10 minutes to reach the ground and the tube was visible from the light above the trees to the ground and could be described as an elevator shaft.  After the 10 minutes or so it began to ascend again towards the bright light in the sky, just as if the elevator was returning to the top of the shaft.  the tube of light began to disappear from the ground traveling upwards toward the bright light in the sky.  This tube seemed to be about 10 to 20 feet in diameter.  When the lighted tube collapsed at the bright light at top, a very large cloud of steam or smoke appeared and began drifting south west at about 5-10 miles per hour.  We had all gotten out of the car to observe this and returned to the car and followed this cloud for about 5-7 miles where we saw a sheriffs car with two deputies standing beside the can.  We stopped and asked if they had seen the same as we and they replied that they had seen the drifting smoke and were looking for the source.  We did not tell them of the tube of light so as to not be embarrassed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object was as black as the night sky and if we were not looking at that exact spot we would have never seen the object. The object was huge in size I would guess the size of a football field it had what appeared to be round circles at each point of the triangle.The circles appeared to be some sort of thrusters but made no sound what so ever,it was as if they were trying not to be seen.The perimeter of the triangle looked cylindrical in nature .The object came straight down for about 1 minute then glided forward for another minute or so then vanished. I think it was trying to avoid the meteor shower but who knows.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Hard to observe but we were all able to confirm that it was triangular in shape.  It was eigther huge and very high up or very small and low....it was hard to make out, I guess because the object had no lights.  We observed it fly by directly above us for about a minute until it dissapeared.  Made no &#34;classic ufo maneuvering&#34; just flew in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/18/91 22:00|Olympia|WA|Changing|2 to 3 minutes|Single star morphs into Hoberman Sphere, rotates, reverts, turns red, divides, flies away in formation|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51287.html|6|ndxe199109| Single star morphs into Hoberman Sphere, rotates, reverts, turns red, divides, flies away in formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t talk much about this (in fact I&#39;ve never told anyone but a couple close friends) but my (then, now long ex) girlfriend and I witnessed something strange together one night in the early 1990s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The exact date is unknown now but documentary evidence from the event indicates it was definitely between mid September and mid October 1991. We were sitting in my car looking at the water at the Port of Olympia, Washington. Time was late evening, with clear sky transitioning from dusk to night. Exact location was parked at the KGY radio station tower at Port of Oly facing north looking over the water of Budd Inlet, with West Oly to the left, East Bay Drive and Priest Point Park to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a very bright star (or so it seemed) shining singularly in the sky out over the water directly in front of us, but looking quite far away, as all stars normally do ( ! ). We must have sat looking at it for a good half hour while talking about life and random things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quite suddenly this star &#39;expanded&#39; for lack of any other way to describe it, exactly the way that a Hoberman Sphere does (I found out many years later what a Hoberman Sphere is, and just about crapped myself the first time I saw one in motion its movement looked so similar), but with no visible structure, just one point of light expanding into numerous points of light, perhaps 20 or more, moving quite fast into a giant and perfectly spherical formation of several star-like lights. The formation resembled a grid over a globe with a light at each connecting point between latitude and longitude, but again, no visible structure, just lights in this formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This assemblage proceeded to rotate there, HUGE, the lights traveling around the far side of the formation visible through the front side lights moving the opposite direction, in the air for several seconds while we stared slack-jawed in disbelief. I sat silent and stared while she repeated like a mantra &#34;this is not happening&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As suddenly as it had initially expanded (and after rotating there in the air for a very long moment) it collapsed in an instant into what appeared to be a single star again, the same as we had stared at while talking all that time before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just when we were wiping our brows and &#34;WTF!!!&#34;-ing over what we had just seen, it slowly began turning red and pulsating. Then it divided. The star (as it were) remained stationary there and began ejecting duplicates of itself (for lack of better description), 5 of them if I recall, appearing one at a time from the stationary light, same color red, all pulsing in time with one another, traveling at an even distance from one another at a constant and relatively slow rate across the sky away from their starting position, heading east / southeast. As soon as they were evenly spaced and enroute the original &#34;star&#34; took up a trailing position in the single file formation and they all flew off slowly over us and eventually the treeline and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this, start to finish took maybe 2 or 3 minutes. The whole thing happened in complete silence, whatever it/they were made no sound at all, which hit us when, as they were flying away, we noticed a small general aviation airplane flying a different direction but at a much higher altitude. We could just make out the distant drone of the prop engine from the airplane but could hear nothing from the light formation traveling visibly well closer to us. This was when it also dawned on us how much closer the whole event had to have happened to us than it looked to the eye at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were praying that pilot would see these things and perhaps react in some way we could take as confirmation he saw it, but no, they were below and behind him and heading away from his position. He flew right on wherever he was going, apparently unaware.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Optical illusion? Sober group hallucination? Swamp Gas? In all the years since, I never have figured out what the hell that thing was, and I would be shocked if I ever did. It / they moved with obvious coordination which implies some kind of intelligence / control, it was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before or since, I am (after seeing it) hard pressed to believe it to be anything of &#34;known&#34; terrestrial technology, I have resigned to the likelihood that I will never know what it was at all. I would have written my own self off as nuts the very evening I saw it (I was never really a ufo &#39;believer&#39;) if not that my girlfriend had sat right there beside me and witnessed the whole thing too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back over a partial video shot of the event (yes believe it or not I had a video camera in the car but the battery had been dead and was only holding a residual charge from sitting around, it was enough to power the camera about ten seconds), the video is completely useless because it was getting dark (everything was plainly visible to the naked eye, but with this cutting edge late &#39;80s video camera, all one can really make out is a blank screen with a few strange flickering whitish dots on it that seem to come and go. The only anecdotal content of any value is the audio track of my girlfriend and myself freaking out (apparently I wasn&#39;t silent the whole time!), ((allusion to profanity deleted)) etc in the few seconds. Unfortunately I didn&#39;t have the wherewithal to hit the &#34;show date/time&#34; function in those few seconds. The best I can do is note that the unrelated video clip shot immediately before it was on September 17th, 1991. This event was probably within the next few nights or up to a couple/few weeks (?) after that, I have no way to know for sure now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was huge. It moved slowly behind a hill, then rose out from behind it, then retreated behind the hill out of view. A Washington State MUFON investigator from Vancouver, WA, investigated the sighting, along with another sighting of a different type in the same area the day before. The cluster of sightings were reported in The Daily News (Longview, WA) on 9-18 or 19-91. I have yet to read a report of a triangular UFO with pairs of lights in rows along its side (as opposed to just one row of lights along each side) - I would like to hear from anybody who has seen this type of triangular UFO (with pairs of lights, pink-orange color).

Here is my story: I was inside my house and my mother asked me to come out and see this weird thing, so I went out and looked up, and there was this definately out of this world flying device.  Since it was during the night, what I could see was somewhat a circular shape, but what I&#39;ll never forget are the lights that it had, they were orange, but very soft, they illuminated, yet didnt hurt my eyes when looking at them directly.  The object also made a very soft and nice noise I&#39;ve almost forgotten know.  The flying object was stationary at about 100m high, it seemed as if it were going down, then my mother got scared, held my hand, and we went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always had that adventurous idea of asking what would of happened if I stayed there a little longer, because the UFO seemed to go down, if you have any comments on this sighting please answer back.  I have always been very interested in extraterrestial life, but sometimes still doubting if mankind has actually had contact with extraterrestial beings.  I appreciate your information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

The 3 objects then contracted their formation until they nearly touched. They then took off, 2 along the horizon {1 north,1 south} while the 3rd{formation leader}went up.I kept them in my field of vision for 2-3 seconds until all I could do was track the leader.3-4 seconds of that and then it lost me. They were white lights that seemed to mimic airplane lights, until I noticed them. I know it sounds funny, but I believe they knew I was watching, so they abandoned their charade, in a flamboyant and blatant display of their technology. Then again, if they were so intelligent,why would they neglect the sonic aspect of their disguise? I would&#39;ve stopped watching before all the good stuff happened if I&#39;d heard anything. It was a clear and silent night.<n>
9/15/91 18:00|Greenbrier|AR|Light|21 years|Orange or amber balls or orbs of light multiplying and maneuvering beyond known and current aircraft abilities|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62126.html|10|ndxe199109| Orange or amber balls or orbs of light multiplying and maneuvering beyond known and current aircraft abilities<n> <n><n> <n><n> The events started in 1991.  I remember this because my brother had been sent to Iraq for Operation Provide Comfort.  It was dark, and it was nearing the fall of the year.  My sister (11), myself (12), and my mother (37) were all traveling north on Highway 65 in Greenbrier, AR on the way to a friend’s home. &lt; sighting location 35.2xxxxxx,-92.3xxxxx &gt; We were approaching the center of town which had been marked with a new stop light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached, I saw a giant ball of amber colored light to the Northwest.  It was about 45 degrees from the horizon and about 300 feet out and must have been 30’ in diameter or more.  I exclaimed to my mother “oh God, what is that?”  I remember having the fear of missile attacks from the war that had been taking place.  My mother and my sister both looked on in awe and my mother stated franticly that she didn’t know what it was.  After about 10 seconds, the orb started to produce “offspring” which went from dim blips to equivalent phenomenon of the original.  They all just popped out and hovered there over the city.  We were all panicked.  After about 8 more seconds, the orbs appeared to shoot straight out to the North at undeterminable speeds.  In a fraction of a second they were at a great distance but then hovered for another moment in formation and then split apart and disappeared into the night again.  We continued to see the orbs in single and sometimes double formations several times as we continued to our friend’s home.  We didn’t have a cellular phone at the time, but as soon as we arrived at the friend’s home, we called a mutual friend who was a hobbyist astronomer.  He too was able to witness the objects and called in an inquiry on all of our behalf to the Air Force.  We along with the other friends (totaling 7 on this event) witnessed them for the next couple of hours sporadically in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next time that I witnessed these objects was about a year later with my friend.  We were playing football in his yard around August of 92.  This was the most peculiar time that I have ever been subject to these types of happenings.  He lives in the same proximity of the first sightings. &lt; Sighting Location 35.2xxxxx,-92.3xxxxx &gt;  As we were tossing the ball back an forth at dusk, there were some scattered patchy clouds in the lower atmosphere, but there was still good visibility.  The next sequence of events is almost unbelievable to myself, and I was very near leaving them out because I want to be taken seriously; however in the name of truth and science I will include them.  I felt an eerie numb come over me and I fell to my knees with a dumb gaze at the Northern sky.  My friend was baffled and ran over to me and was asking “what’s wrong with you dude?”  He was curious as to why I had stopped playing and fell down and was gazing up.  I was paralyzed, and my stare was fixed directly above his neighbor’s home in a small patch of clouds.  He shook me by the shoulder telling me to get up with some concern on his face.  I managed to speak.  I was able to raise my right arm and point to the focal position that I was fixed on and simply said “watch”.  He looked where I told him to look.  Nothing appeared at first and he started asking expectantly “what…what do you want me to see?”  It was no sooner than he had spoken the words that the first one appeared.  A giant orb of amber light appeared over the home, just popping out of the low level cloud formation.  My friend looked on in terror and in wonder and begged me to tell him what it was.  I was still numb and stuck from a fear or reaction that I cannot to this day explain.  Moments later, two more lights formed out of the originator and they hovered in formation by it’s side.  They were in the clouds and caused illumination to the particles around them which created an orange glowing haze.  The objects came very close to us, and this is the closest that! I have ever been to them in all of my experiences.  My friend had his 4 wheeler in the front yard, and he yanked me up off of the ground as he panicked and tried to get us away.  The 4 wheeler had worked all day, but when we tried to start it, no ignition took place.  After about 5 failed attempts to start the ATV, he dragged me inside the house.  He got a gun, and called our friends mother to help us.  We huddled down in the house until she arrived.  My friend’s mother came to get us later and was amused by the story, until a short time later when she saw what we had told her about.  I have continued to see these things, and can document every sighting location.  There are at least 4 other significant events that I would be glad to go over if the interest is there.  Please let me know if you can put this to use.  I am very interested and willing to put forth some effort to document these happenings as I am sure that they can be reproduced.  The areas that I am familiar with have been sites where many of my friends and family have witnessed this phenomenon spanning over almost 20 years.  My friend’s mother has a friend that has recorded these things on VHS, and I believe that they can be observed possibly with time lapsed equipment or intelligent motion sensing equipment.  I personally do not have the means alone to make such productions yet, however I do believe that this is achievable.  Thank you for your time in advance, and I can assure you very credible witnesses and contacts are easily produced.  One interesting fact about the region where I grew up (and I don’t know if this has/had something to do with the frequency but there used to be subterranean nuclear missile silos within just a couple of miles in both directions of the indicated areas.  Although these had been removed for several years before “my” sightings, I feel that it is significant that I mention these because they are the only other source of any sort of combined or specific energy known to be out of the ordinary.  Thanks again for your tim! e and un derstanding in advance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The sky was pitch black and the stars were very bright.  Directly over head I saw what I thought was a satellite moving slowly south to north.  It was a steady dim light, like a star, but moving.  I pointed it out to her and explained the difference, visually, between a satellite and an airplane.  An airplane has blinking lights and a satellite looks like a slowly moving star.  As I was explaining this, the object suddenly took a left turn (a right angle with no curve or change of speed) and began to move east  ((Correction--west.  Please see below.)) for a few degrees and faded to black. I stopped speaking and watched in disbelief as I understood enough about physics to know that what I was watching was physically impossible to take place, at least for a satellite.  I quickly asked her what she had seen and she said, matter-of-factly, that &#34;it turned left&#34; not knowing or understanding that what we saw could not have happened in a &#34;normal&#34; world.  I tried to explain to her what I was thinking and what I understood to be &#34;normal&#34;, but she didn&#39;t seem concerned by the strangeness of what we had seen.  By the fact that my father is a physicist, engineer and an amateur astronomer and that I grew up looking at the stars with more than a basic understanding, and that she had no science background or interest in science at all, my concerns of the abnormality of the moment were not shared.

It appeared to be similar to a &#34;shooting star&#34; with a bright, white head and an orange firey tale.  It traveled across the sky in a straight direction until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening while barbequeing in the backyard, I was on my 2nd story deck facing westward when I looked up and noticed an orange tail behind an object traveling at a fairly high rate of speed.(faster than a commercial jet) I stood there for a few seconds watching this thing heading towards the sunset. It reminded me of a high-flying jet with a vapor trail, except this trail stayed the same length as it traveled. The &#39;head&#39; of the object looked like a very bright whitish color, kind of flashy while it was close, then only the bright orange tail was visible as it moved further away. It seemed to be turning gently more westward as it moved further away.  I would say it took maybe 4-6 minutes before it was completely out of sight, which I am guessing over the Olympic Mountains. My brother saw it through his binoculars and his best guess was that of a piece of space junk re-entering the atmosphere at a very shallow pitch. Or a metoer. He said he thought there might be a &#39;chaser&#39; plane, too. He said it was hard to tell because the trees were in the way.  He is an engineer at Boeing in Everett and has some pretty good knowledge about aerodynamics.  I finally got my wits and grabbed my 35mm camera!  Took 2 photos at the 90mm telephoto setting.  It was pretty far off in the distance when I took the pictures.  I will get the film developed this week and scan them for you if they turn out!   Wow!  How exciting to see it.  (I work at Boeing also, 41 yrs, lived in the Seattle area all my life.)<n>

We were parked in my car talking when I kept seeing something flash/flicker out of the corner of my eye. I finally could not go on talking with her anymore and said &#34;what is that?&#34; as I turned my eyes up towards the sky. She had been noticing it too, but had yet to say anything. We both watched the light slowly pan around as if it was trying to find something similar to what one might see a helicopter do. There was no sound however and every so often it would move positions. It was very very quick when it did this....it took no longer than a snap of the finger to get what looked like many yards away from it&#39;s present position. We watched with curiosity, excitement and fear as it continued this for many minutes. I even went as far as flashing my car headlights out over the lake to perhaps get its attention, but never did. After a while it began to sink in to us what we were looking at and we decided to call it an evening. Fear drove us home as we left the object still panning its light down upon the ground....still speedily moving from one position to another…<n>
9/8/91 22:45|Fort St. James (Canada)|BC|Other|unknown|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  The light grew brighter and brighter and it was engulfing the vehicle..|3/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35528.html|16|ndxe199109| The light grew brighter and brighter and it was engulfing the vehicle..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date: Fall -1991  Time: approx: 10:45 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple were driving home to Prince George after a day&#39;s outing in Fort St. James. As they traveled along Highway # 16 east and passed a well known tourist spot called Bednesti Lake, the passenger, the husband&#39;s wife, commented to her husband about where a light was coming from? A white light seemed to be reflecting off the hood of their car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When she first took notice of the light it wasn&#39;t all that bright, but what got her wondering was they were traveling in a totally darkened out area along the highway. As they drove along the light grew brighter and brighter. It was engulfing the vehicle. The husband started slowing down because the bright light was actually making it difficult to continue. The passenger got up the nerve to lean forward and look out and up to see where the light source was coming from. All the lady was able to see was a beam of light, or just a brightenss which had engulfed the whole vehicle at this point. She said it was blinding to her eyes and it stayed right with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness said whatever it was followed them for a number of kilometers down the highway. Finally, because it was exceedingly difficult to see where they were headed, the husband pulled the car over to the side of the road, got out and as soon as he did the light went out. They did not hear any sound at all. They even thought it was a helicopter when it first appeared, but got very frightened as it paced with them for so long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the couple finally arrived home safely, they got up the next morning, the wife turned on the radio and while listening in she heard a news story about a man who called the radio station to report seeing an unusual beam of light shining down onto the highway the night before. Of course, the man who had made the report had no idea what the couple had experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident happened a number of years ago, but it was still very fresh in the ladies mind when she was telling me the story. The woman mentioned it was very overcast that evening. Even when the passenger looked up through the front windshield the light was so bright it was to hard to see anything. It was extremely difficult to know if there was a craft of some sort above them, if it was below or above the cloud ceiling. I was told it must have been a narrow beam as it did not light up much of the surrounding area, but mainly lit up the outside, and inside of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to thank the people for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Phone 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

9/5/91 22:00|Groton|NY|Triangle|2 sec.|My sister and  I saw a  massive, silent, v-shaped formation of bright white lights fly directly overhead.|9/15/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46215.html|17|ndxe199109| My sister and  I saw a  massive, silent, v-shaped formation of bright white lights fly directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a cool summer night, I arrived home after dark to find my sister and mother star gazing on a swing they had dragged to the middle of our back yard.  My mother got up and walked over to greet me remarking about how clear it was and how beautiful the stars were.  She told me she was going in because it was cold and that I could take her seat.  I sat next to my sister and we both were looking straight up gazing at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about to get up to go inside when I looked straight at the horizon.  Suddenly, I noticed what I can only describe as a v-shaped formation of white lights coming at us from over the horizon.  They looked the way jets flying in a v-formation would.  The white lights were brighter than the stars that filled the background.  I would say that there were 11 lights in all with 5 on each side and one at the tip of the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My heart immediately jumped and I yelled for my sister to look as I extended my arm and pointed at the lights.  She quickly looked as the lights continued toward us.  They shot directly overhead at incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise what-so-ever coming from the object(s) before, during, or after the event.  I remember,  distinctly, that as the lights passed directly overhead, they seemed to be distorting the sky as if they were connected to a &#34;v&#34; or boomerang shaped object - A black object with white &#34;headlights&#34; moving swiftly across a clear, black, star-filled sky.  I assume that the object(s) was flying relatively low because the formation of the lights spread out as it passed over us.  I would estimate the object to be extremely large considering the amount of sky it spanned across- (perhaps 1000 ft. from tip to tip).  My sister and I had no explanation for what we saw.  I am quite positive that it was not a natural event because the lights were spaced evenly apart and did not waiver from their position in the &#34;v&#34; at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Six different people saw these from a area south of San Jose CA. I have seen bats, owls and light air craft in the skys with out lights, but never anything like this No lights, no sound. With field glasses a roundish shape could be made out for the front of the crafts.  It was hard to say how high they were but the sparce local clound cover was reported to be at 3,000 feet at the time and the object were well below that. These object passed over, one at a time a speed similar to a low fling light aircraft over a period of about 30 min. Two other things were noted durring this period. 1) the normaly busy air trafic in our skys was noexistant. 2) The object stopped going over at about the same time the full moon came up. I spend a lot of time under the night sky with my telescope but I have never seen anything like this before or sense. Has anyone else seen this type of dark objects?<n>

It hovered there for awhile and then went down behind the mountain.  Then it would reappear and go back down.  It repeated this for quite awhile.  It finally came back over the mountain and just stayed in one place for a loooong time. It would get very bright and then so dim that you could barely see it.  It slowly went across the sky and stopped.  There were clouds coming in and it would get covered in the clouds but didn&#39;t move other than getting brighter and dimmer it looked exactly like a star.  I watched it until the sun started coming up and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n>

Then it began to move at speeds and G&#39;s thats humans can&#39;t handle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an airforce depended.  We were stationed at Holloman AFB New Mexico (Just out side of Alomgordo and White Sands). One night Me and my brother was out side talking. I looked over and saw a orange star.  It was just above the moutains.  Now I like to look at stars and New Mexico has some beautiful sky most of the time.  This night the sky clear.  I turned to my brother and said, &#34;look at that star.&#34;  then the star started to move to the left.  It was moving about the speed of a fighter jet in afterburner.  Then I thought to myself that is was most like and aircraft and it was most likly experimental.  Holloman is a very big base.  There is a road on it that allows you to drive 45mph and you probably drive for over an half an hour and still be on the base.  So I Know there is alot of experimental aircraft there.  The object move left for about 5 seconds.  Then without hesitation it began to move to the right.  Now I&#39;ve been around aircraft all my life and I had never seen a aircraft of any sourt make a manuver like that, It was a 180 degree turn.  It move right for about 5 more seconds after that it made 90 degree turn up.  it danced in the sky for about three minutes.  And it was moving at speeds imposible for fighter jets to move at.  The reason I Know this is because of the distance the craft was from us.  As it was dancing in the sky the craft made it&#39;s way above us.  And at one point the craft came staight down and I got a good look at it. Now there was no sound at all Coming from the craft.  But there was jets flying around and the reason i know this is because they have flashing lights of red and white.  This jets seem to ingore the object.  Also If there was and UFO flying over a base that at the time had Top Secert stuff on it, The UFO would have been pursued or shot down. It wasn&#39;t.  The object got so close that we ran inside the house.  There are about 5 more times that we saw objects like that in the sky in a two year period, but this one is the best one.  Also<n>

I watched this object spin for about 10(?) seconds and not believing what I was seeing, I leaned forward and to the right to convince myself it was not a reflection.  I could clearly see that the object was 3 dimentional and could see the bulkhead behind it. It continued spin- ning for about 5(?) more seconds and flew out (through) the window on the left side of the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> side of the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The TV was backed by a large window facing east. We both noticed a dark object silhouetted against the clouds. As it appoached we could see the shape as a rectangle. We both jumped up to get a better look. I told him to keep watching the object and I ran through the house to the backdoor, which was its projected path.  When I got outside I looked where it should have been and then where it had been and it was not visible to me. It was strangely quiet. I was looking overhead and to the west over a three story apartment building directly behind the house when I heard the roar of an engine (I have hesitated all these years to admit this)and before my eyes, appearing to &#34;just miss&#34; the top of the apartment building was a commercial airliner as though it appeared out of some other dimension. To say I was dumbstruck would be an understatement. My husnad reported that he watched the rectangle till he lost sight of it over the house. In reinacting the scene and checking the timing, I should have seen it as well, which I didnt. He on the other hand did not hear the roar of the jet, that I did. I have no idea what I witnessed that day, but I had a feeling I would see it again. Of course I didnt believe that feeling which was a big mistake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Submitted by:  Missouri Investigators Group at M.I.G@usa.com, or B.Becker@iname.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Barbara Becker and the Missouri Investigation Group for submitting the report.

Only a week before we had seen a rectangular craft gliding over our house and here it was again. My husband was napping, my mother, who lived next door would not be quick enough to get outside as a witness and I could never get my camera before it went out of sight. I just decided to enjoy it. I stood and watched it take the reverse path that it flew the week before.  This time I heard all the &#34;city&#34; noise that was appropriate for that time of day. I really could not estimate its size. The only real description I can give is a flat black rectangle. As a UFO investigator of over 20 years years...you&#39;d think Id know when to follow a hunch!

We arrived back at the hotel about 11 o&#39;clock. My husband, binoculars in hand, was at the window looking skyward as he often did. He called me to come and look too. What I saw still stays in my mind though it&#39;s been more than ten years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright light was stationary high up in the sky strobing pale yellowish light, then red, then green then back to yellowish and so on.We watched it for more than half an hour.Another white light came from the east and moved horizontally toward the brighter one.It disappeared as though flying into the brighter one, then a second zoomed toward the larger light and disappeared into it in the same manner. The the brighter object then dimmed it&#39;s light and headed straight up very quickly.It stopped briefly straight over where it had been then zoomed off at high speed in am easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We know how long the sighting lasted because Jay Leno was just coming on (11:30). We were still watching the activity when Conan O&#39;Brien came on one hour later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We reported the sighting to Mufon here in Vancouver and spoke about it at one of their meetings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also wanted to see whether anyone else had seen this and put an in the Kelowna paper. I received two responses and a phone call from others who had similar experiences though not of this one.One woman married to a forest ranger saw three large triangular craft flying at night. Another man had seen what he called paisley objects on the lake. The radio station there told me that others had seen this kind of thing quite often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve since heard of an abduction in the Kelowna area involving a former school mate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was driving along and I looked to the side because this light caught my eye--I stopped.  This light didn’t have a beam and it was swaying back and forth between two houses right at rooftop  height.  I looked up above to see where the light was coming from and it was a huge triangular shaped object in the sky.  This round light started to come towards my car--everything around us seemed gray and quiet and no sound--it felt like time standing still..  I have always heard of missing time and I glanced at the time on the car.  I went out right at that time and when I came to I looked at the clock and I was missing one hour.  I asked my kids if I had fallen asleep and they said no--they said we hadn’t been there very long.  I asked them if they had seen the light and they said no.  I didn’t realize there was a place to vent like this and I’m glad I can finally say something.<n>
