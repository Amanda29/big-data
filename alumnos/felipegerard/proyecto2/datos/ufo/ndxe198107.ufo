Witnessed from a bedroom window overlooking a vacant field and rural countryside.  I have often thought about this event as witnesses by myself and my grandfather. I was visiting my grandparents home on the river in Carnation.  It was a long time ago and I have wanted to tell the story in case anyone else witnessed anything similar. The date listed is not accurate but it was around 1980-81.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

When we got to our aunt&#39;s house ,it was early evening and the storms were producing a lot of beautiful lightining over Seminole,Tx,approximatly 30 mile to the east. I saw what I thought was an aircraft landing light coming from the direction of the storm.I commented to my brother how fast it seemed to be moving, I said &#34;this is going to be loud&#34; because it seemed to be moving at a high sub-sonic speed. It passed about 3/4 of a mile to our south with no sound. at our south it appeared to be triangle shaped( a red light on the &#34;nose&#34; and a green light on the tail)I still thought it was an aircraft until it passed another 20 degrees to the west. at that time it appeared that the back was a triangle but there were three lighits that followed eachother around the outside of the triangle. it quickly dis appeared beyond the roofs of the houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

7/29/81 18:00|Vinton|IA|Triangle|5-6 hours|It was Black as night, triangle shaped, with three lights underneath one in each corne|6/14/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89545.html|3|ndxe198107| It was Black as night, triangle shaped, with three lights underneath one in each corne<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the last week in July or the first week of August in 1981. I was only 12 years old.  I have only told about three people of me and my friend’s Experience.  We lived in rural Benton County.  I was spending the night at this friend’s house.  We were going to camp out in a ravine in the pasture behind his house. We went out at around 6:00 PM and had just started a small fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were putting wood on the fire I noticed a big black object in the sky to the west of us.  It was heading in a southward direction.  We were trying to figure out what kind of plane it could be.  When it changed direction and was headed right toward us.  Being kids as we were we started thinking it was the DNR coming to get us for our fire.  (Quite a silly thought now that I am older).  We were trying to put out our fire as it approached we realized this was no plane it was Black as night, triangle shaped, with three lights underneath one in each corner they were like spot lights very bright bluish white light, and one white light right in the middle.  There was no sound coming from this object. And it was moving very slowly between 10 and 15 mph. My friend and I ran up under the tree on the hill. This thing was about half the size of a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The leaves on the trees were moving a lot but I can not remember if I could Feel a wind or not. I could see the lights coming through the trees.  The very next thing either of us remembered was running up the hill until we reached the fence, we were scared and nervous.  We watched this object Flying of in a southeast Direction toward Cedar Rapids, and Palo.  We raced to his house and when we entered the clock said 12:07 AM.  Now mind you the place we were going to camp that night is only about a five minute walk to the house and with in sight of the house.  I cannot say what happened in the time between about 6:25 PM and 12:07 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can go with out thinking of this all year but even now 28 years later this occupies my mind in the last week of July and the first week of August.  And here it is I am writing this on July 29th.  I have always been curious if anyone else had seen what we did.  Even living out in the country someone had to have seen this thing.  A farmer in the fields or someone!!<n>

only to give some idea of there action because in actuality they were black box shapes moving back and forth as though searching the area.I mean black,everywhere they passed went black as coal.I can&#39;t explain it but thats what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We quickly got back in the car and started it up no problem.R1 would not speak to me only stare out at the pond so I told her to watch the pond and I would carefully back out up the  road.I think I saw some color on her face because I stopped backing up and looked forward and realized something large and dark was rising above the mist and it had a red light on top of it.This light seemed fixed,not moving freely like the dark lights were.It&#39;s shape reminded me of a submarine but it was nearly as long as the whole pond and it was rising way to far from the water-I think I was seeing 2/3 of it and that was above the 8 foot wall of mist.The red light was facing forward on the vehicle(shining to our right) and slowly turned our direction as the whole thing began to turn towards us.I returned to the job at hand and carefully resumed my backing when something hit my side of the car hard enough to push us into the steep ditch I was trying to avoid.A return the following day to get the car out of the ditch revealed tire tracks that were proceding up the middle of the road then abruptly made a 90 degree slide sideways into the ditch some two feet or so yet there was no damage to the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were stuck in a steep ditch,no way to open the passenger door yet the next thing I remember was R1 standing outside the car reaching her hand to help me out.We were bathed in the red light.There was no sound.The object was no longer moving but was fully facing us some 20 yards away and I was petrified.When R1 helped me out of the vehicle I actually stopped to relieve myself before beating feet out of there.R1 is a large,strong woman and as hard as she was pulling I kept fighting to look back and the last I saw of it it was sitting on top of the mist staring directly at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We moved up the main road back to our house as swiftly as we could but it became apparent that something was following us along the side of the road just inside the treeline and fear began to rise again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember nothing after that until we rounded the corner into our driveway on foot.We had arrived at the pond around midnight, watched three or four cycles and covered four or five miles it should not have been more than two or three am at most.It was in fact 7:30 am and the sun was up and the birds were chirping and R1 wasn&#39;t speaking to anyone not even to R2 who was impatiently waiting for us to return with her car.I explained what you just read and R1 only nodded at appropriate times to verify what I was telling her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> R1 and I returned with a friend to pull the car out of the ditch (R1 would not again return to that place or let her kids swim there  for quite some time) and found the car as I stated and there was no sign of anything out of the ordinary.We searched the whole perimeter of the pond and saw not one thing that would help explain the happenings of the night before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> R2 and I returned the next several nights to see many strange things,thankfully nothing to compare to the first in fact each night was completely different.What I can tell you is that we brought others there as witnesses that knew what had happened and on other nights we brought poeple that had no idea.R2 and I and one other person saw many strange events while all the others did not-some things going on within feet of us all.Each night before dark we swept the trails clean and set trip wires around the entire pond in hopes of foiling a hoax only to be denied the following morning.Some of the later events even had some audible traits-it really seemed to us that we were being toyed with and were completely helpless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t explain it,it is simply what I saw.It dramatically changed my life and I wish I could say it was entirely for the better but that would be untrue.You learn alot about your friends in situations like this.Some poeple simply cannot deal with things like this and that&#39;s a shame because that is when you need them most.You learn quickly to keep it to yourself.The most bizarre,the most overwhelming and unexplainable event in your life and you can&#39;t let it out.There is some tragedy in that as many of you know I&#39;m sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

7/15/81 19:00|Fayetteville|AR|Other|3 minutes|As an 9 year old child I saw a dumbbell shaped object hovering in daytime at approx. 5000 feet.|8/30/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08882.html|9|ndxe198107| As an 9 year old child I saw a dumbbell shaped object hovering in daytime at approx. 5000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only part of this event I am not certain of is the exact time, or even the year.  I was probably 8, 9, or 10 years old when it happened, unfortunately no adults were present for me to contact and ask the year, and the only other witness was even younger than I was.  But the rest of it I remember with exceptional clarity. I was standing in the parking lot of George&#39;s Majestic Lounge (a live music bar) with my cousin, who is a couple of years younger than me.  Our parents were inside listening to music that we had no interest in, and, as our town used to be more or less completely crime free, we were allowed to play outside, as long as we didn&#39;t wander off. It was afternoon, about 2 hours before sunset, and the moon was visible and nearly full in the day sky.  For whatever reason I looked up into the sky, probably at the moon.  However, while looking up I noticed in the north sky, and slightly west, was a wierd object.  It was following the same path that commuter prop planes used in that era to reach our local airport (though it was flying higher than they do at that point in their approach), at first I thought it might be some kind of wierd helicopter.  As I stared at it, it quickly became apparent that it didn&#39;t look like any kind of flying object I&#39;d ever seen. The object is best described as beeing basically shaped like a dumbell.  Each end, front and back, was a cube, the cubes were connected by a rectangular arm.  Unlike a dumbbell, the arm did not extend passed the ends of the cubes.  The object had no visible lights (it was daytime though, so I wouldn&#39;t have seen any but the brightest lights).  The object was high enough in the sky that its total length appeared equal to half the diameter of the full moon.  The object was uniformly grey.  I have always had very good vision and was able to see a certain amount of detail; the cubes had smooth, featureless faces (at least the ones visible at my angle), but the arm appeared to be of a skeletal, framework construction.  The object also emitted no sounds or trails.  When I was watching it it moved considerably slower than an aircraft at a similar height. I watched, entranced, for several minutes, probably about 3 to 5.  My cousin must have noticed I was staring at something because when I finally became aware that maybe I should point it out to her, I saw she was already looking at it too.  I told her to get my mom, and she refused.  So I told her to watch it, and I went to get my mom and dad.  My parents were not eager to go outside to see &#34;the weird flying thing in the sky&#34;, and so we didn&#39;t go out for what seemed an eternity to me, but was probably only about 5 to 10 minutes.  Of course the object was gone.  My counsin said it had continued along its north to south course, but had moved faster and faster until it was gone, she said it hadn&#39;t dissapeared over the horizon (all paraphrased of course), but had gone up into the sky until she couldn&#39;t see it any longer somewhere in the southwest quadrant of the sky. For years afterwards I drew pictures of the object, on school papers, on the phone notepad, in books, etc.  I&#39;ve never seen it since, nor have I ever heard of any sightings even remotely similar.  I remember some years later, still before I was in my teens (I am now 27, in 1999), that I heard about skylab, and it&#39;s plumet to earth; at that point I just assumed that what I had seen was skylab.  But now I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll never have any idea of what the object really was.<n>

( the distance from us was width wise across the football field ) The ufo hovered for a few moments  or a few minutes and then descended back down , hidden from the woods . Then it rose back up again , hovered again and then moved slowly to the left a little bit and back to the middle . Then it hovered again and  moved slowly to the right and back to the middle where it hovered again until it moved up a little bit and back to the middle where it hovered again and then moved back up slowly and higher up until it took off slowly to the left and then WHOOSH it just dissapeared .The object was silient and had lights around the outside rim and one on the middle of the bottom .I recall they were all white lights .It was very close to us we could see that this was not anything known to us . We did not report this because we were breaking curfew . We were not drinking or  anything like that . Now 18 yrs. later I still think about this awesome experience . I know what I saw .<n>

Hovered silently  5 mins.then headed North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my living room &amp; heard a humming noise, so I went out on my front porch &amp; looked up but didn&#39;t see anything.  I went back inside &amp; a few minutes later I heard the humming again. Outside at the end of my porch I looked up &amp; there was this object directly over the top of my house.  If I had a 30 foot extension ladder, I could have climbed on board.  It was long,about 75 feet long,with windows, amber colored light coming through the windows. To me,it looked like an office building flipped on its side.  I stood there in awe--spiritually moved by seeing this.  It was just there,not moving,stationary, over top of part my house &amp; part of my neighbor&#39;s house to the left. Finally it moved &amp; slowly headed north. What didn&#39;t make sense to me afterwards was that I didn&#39;t hop in my car &amp; follow it. I just went back inside my house. My sons, who were 9 and 7 years old at that time, had a different story to tell later. They said they were out back playing (it was dark out &amp; they wouldn&#39;t be outside that late at night)...and they saw a red beam of light come down from this object.  They got scared and hid in a shed we had in the back yard.  I have no memory of any red beam.  But I was really &#34;spaced out&#34;...no pun intended.  I was in total awe &amp; amazement! I may have had missing time, I don&#39;t know. The only after effect I had was that my hair got kind of thin on the top not long after this happened. I was afraid to report it because I just don&#39;t trust our government.  Because this sighting was SO close up...just 30 feet over my head..I can state for a fact it was not a plane or any known vehicle. I mean what kind of object can hover silently right over top of your house? I&#39;ve had lots of dreams of alien babies after this happened. One time I dreamed that a black helicopter landed in my back yard &amp; I was deathly afraid of it.  The word &#34;Kraft&#34; was coming into my mind when I saw it.  I would love to go under hypnosis to see if I could remember more details, but I don&#39;t know of anyone who does that. I have a small little bump with a red mark about the size of a B-B on my right shin area.  I&#39;ve had it for years but don&#39;t really know when it appeared.  My Mom had one exactly like it on her leg.  Thanks for your website &amp; all your hard work. I&#39;m listening to you on Coast to Coast right now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

At that time was aware of shooting stars, meteors and commets.  I was also aware that satilites and planes cross the sky at night.  Being a farm boy I was also a good observer.  Also I grew up coon hunting at night so I am very comfortable at night and not spooked by things that go bump in the night.  While on the grass looking up the boy next door noticed what at first seemed like a slow shooting star but it was much to slow.  I determined that it was probably a satilite.  The object was no larger or brighter than any of the background stars.  That was all that was normal about this object or light in the sky.  The object was traveling in a east north east direction it was directly overhead.  Our location was almost exactly 45 degrees north.  The object or light moved in a steady striaght track and suddenly took a sharp 90 degree turn (angular not a curve) to the north.  If you held you arm out in front of you and stuck your thumb out the object traveled about the length of your thumb.  Then it took another sharp 90 degree turn to the west and again to the north.  This went on over and over and over until it left our view in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting outside with some friends at around 2000 enjoying the summer weather. As I sat there I noticed what appeared to be a sphere covered by a coat of fire traveling from north to south. As the object passed I was amazed at how well it held it&#39;s course and altitude. It did not appear to be producing any type of trail in the sky, we followed it with our eyes until it was not visible. I would have to say that it was at an altitude of about 1500 ft AGL, traveling between 500 and 700 kts. I&#39;ve always loved flying and currently work in aviation and to this day I know that it was no aircraft. My brother still remembers me running to his room to tell him about what we saw. I whish that I could remember the exact year and date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Upon sighting the object, my dad asked &#34;Wonder what that guy is doing?&#34;, since at first it appeared to be just an ordinary light from a private plane. Then, as it began to circle and change colors, I asked ,&#34;How is he changing colors?&#34;. Dad said &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34; and as the object left at great speed my dad said, &#34;I don&#39;t think we have anything that goes that fast.&#34;. I am now 30 years old, a former army officer (medical) and former army intelligence SGT. My dad is currently military intelligence, and has, shall we say, some difficulty publicly confirming my recollection of this event.This is of course very troubling to me since he does acknowledge it in private (with me), so to share the story without his verification (since I was a kid at the time), makes me look like a liar, or at best possessing a false recollection of an ordinary event.<n>

We had been digging fossils all day along the river.  We went back to camp around 20:00 and started a fire to cook.  My friend said whats that and pointed to a distant tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a huge triangle shaped craft about 1 mile away hovering over the trees and barely moving.  The odd thing was the wide end was in front and there was no sound.  My best guess would be 400 yards long and flat black.  It had no lights.  It moved out of site and we were in awe. It defied the laws of physics.  There is also an air force base close by.  Selfrige I believe is the name.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, althought the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

The object appeared to be a gold solid sphere hovering to the right of the bridge at about two thousand feet.<n>

It zipped around in straight lines but changed direction at sharp angles, like when one draws a five-point star.  It had a short trail of light, traveled thousands of feet in tenths of a second, and paused for tenths of a second at the vertices.  It then disappeared back up into the sky.  This event only lasted for about 3 or 4 seconds.  It wasn&#39;t a plane or helicopter, nor was it a firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was laying down in the front yard on the grass facing the stars. It was a qiet night. As I stared at the sky, a bright light was coming down towards me. It was so bright that it was hurting my eyes. There was no sound coming from the light. The interesting part of this was that the light came from a high distance and down towards me at such a quick speed. The light fritened me, and I ran in the house. As of today I wonder what it was, and what would of happened to me if I syaed and let the light touch me. It was unbeleivable and something that I have never seen before. I am certain that it was not a human made action.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
