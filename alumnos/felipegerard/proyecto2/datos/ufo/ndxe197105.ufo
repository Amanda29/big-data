Perhaps the witnesses observed a launch from Vandenberg AFB, but their description is of something much closer.  Moreover, missiles are launched to the south from Vandenberg, so a missile would not have been seen from the Colorado River moving from left to right, unless it was a launch out into the Pacific.  However, we believe that those launches, intended to test the anti-ballistic missile capability of rockets launched in the mid-Pacific Ocean, began only relatively recently, not in 1971.  We have asked for clarification from the party who submitted the report.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> There seemed to be no dissipation of the glow coming from the sphere. It surrounded it, stretched in one direction and stopped!?<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my friend and I neared the end of our month-long drift down the Colorado River, we noticed a concentrated illumination going from right to left and stretching halfway across, maybe 300 meters downstream. We speculated it was coming from car headlights, but reminded ourselves we were still quite a ways from a driveable road. Guiding ourselves close to the bank using partially submerged stumps and branches to steer us, we came to an inlet and up on the bank which rose at about 30 degrees we observed an incandescent sphere of light hovering about three feet above the ground and perfectly still. It was somewhere between twelve and sixteen feet in diameter and was no more than 30 or 40 feet away from us on the level ground above the bank. We observed it for the longest six minutes or so and noticed that it appeared perfectly symmetrical and hazily transparent except for an irregularly shaped denser bluish-green core, maybe four feet across and two feet high. We could not see through this portion of the sphere. It made no sound and eerily all sounds on the river (muskrats diving in etc.) seemed to have ceased from when we first noticed the (beam) light. Holding our position right by the bank, I considered the prospect of exiting the boat and walking up to the sphere. Before I actually decided on this, the sphere moved both upwards and backwards in the blink of an eye shot into the clear black sky. I kept my eyes fixed at the point where it had seemed to disappear and within seconds observed an emerald green streak shooting from right to left at about 15-20 degrees. The whole thing lasted only a fraction of a second and we let go of the branches anchoring us we resumed drifting downstream. My friend and I and talked about the event(s) facing each other seated in the boat, he at the bow, I at the back facing foward. It was only minutes later that I observed what seemed to be a bright triangular opening in the sky  at 11 or 12 o&#39;clock and this turned into a widening  bright puff and eventually something similar to a smoke ring before disappearing. I have since come to recognize this as a probable VanDeberg launch which would easily enough date the event exactly as I am only guessing now at the date. I was pointing this out to my friend when suddenly the river came alive with the sound of helicopters. We had now positioned our boat close to the center of the river and though it appeared the craft was flying along both banks, we could not tell how many there were. They were apparently painted in a dark color and try as we could, neither of us could make out any markings on the fanthom shapes. If there were any lights, they were minimal and they used no floodlights or other means to illuminate the area. We did not sleep that night and when the next morning we came across the first riverside business in almost a month, we inquired if anything unusual had been reported the night before, and were told &#34;nothing.&#34;<n>

There were 4 or 5 of us in the car.  It was a dark, clear night.  We noticed several cars parked on the side of the road, people looking at something in the western sky.  We stopped and I wondered what the big deal was about the light in the sky.  Looked like a plane or a copter to me.  They told me to keep watching.  The object was about 50 degrees above the horizon, moving in a southeastern direction.  As it got closer, I noticed that the light seemed to change to red and back to white.  It made a right angle turn and went higher in the sky.  No noise, no hesitation.  It made several 90 degree turns, in the meantime traveling southeast to northwest and back again.  The object could also completely reverse direction.  It traveled fast.  It went to the northwest and at that point we noticed there were 2 more objects -one from the southwest, one from the northwest that seemed to be descending on the object we were watching.  They all seemed to merge and after a couple seconds, the object sped off to the northwest at a 75 degree angle and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several cars had stopped and gone,  so I know there were quite a few that saw the event.  However, those that stayed to the end all agreed -Nobody saw a thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess they are still keeping silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I may be sketchy on the dates and time, but I know what I saw.  I will never forget it.  Incidentally, the driver of the car in which I was riding broke the speed limits going back home.  But he didn&#39;t see anything, either. Hopefully. someone else that was there beside that road that night can add to the story and firm up the dates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My friend suddenly said stop the car, I see a unknown object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my friend and I were in the Air Force working as Air Rescure Corpmen, and were very familar with military aircraft. This was no aircraft that we knew of. It was a circular object &#34;frosted ice&#34; in color, heading west.  A pea at arms length would be its approximate size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object for 10 to 15 seconds and then turned 90 degrees, without changing speed, and headed toward the ground. I dropped below the horizon and was not seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My dad said for me to look at that star to our left above the hill. He said that it was not there last night.  He pulled the car over so the headlights were pointing directly at it. He then flashed the lights on and off at it.  He kept repeating this over and over. Then all of a sudden the light started to change colors.  It changed to red, then to blue, then back to white.  Then it moved directly over our car and stopped.  My dad said we need to get out of here. We got back inside the car and proceeded up the road toward home.  The light took off again and moved along the top of the hill till it was out of sight.  There was&#39;nt any sound coming from it.  This happened 41 years ago, but we both remember it like it was yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

5/1/71 02:00|Lewisburg|WV|Triangle|15 minutes|I observed a triangular object hovering without sound for approximately 15 minutes during the night.|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12892.html|9|ndxe197105| I observed a triangular object hovering without sound for approximately 15 minutes during the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking the rim of the rock quarry at approximatly 2:00a.m.  I observed a triangular shaped object moving towards my location from the northern sky.  It stopped above the rock quarry and began to hover.  It was approximately 300 feet away from me and 600 feet up in the sky.  It made absolutely no sound whatsoever.  Nothing could be heard from it.  There were different colored lights on bottom side of the object, white lights on each end or wing of the triangle and lights in towards the center of the craft.  This craft was hugh.  It was capable of moving in any direction, vertically, horizontally, and angularly.  Every movement was precise, controlled, and smooth.  It would hover between moves as if it were observing something.  Needless to say I was in shock and ended up on the ground.  I was hysterical with fear and overcome with curiosity.  I had never seen anything like this before, nor have I ever since.  I tried to remain as quiet as possible so I would not be detected by the craft, but I somehow suspected it knew I was there.  I was really scared to death, and strangely struck in amazement at the same time.  It&#39;s very difficult to put into words.  I just laid there on the ground and watched it.  Finally, from a stand still in the sky, it suddenly took off at a very high rate of speed in the same direction it came from and in about 3-4 seconds it was completely gone.  That&#39;s all I remember.  It was over with the blink of an eye.  I have not spoken but to only a few people about this incident for fear of being ridiculed.  I know what I saw and to read it on paper somehow leaves it lacking in realism.  But nothing can ever change what I experienced, what I felt, what I saw.   For me it was a life changing experience.  My fiance observed that when I speak of this, I get visably shaken and nervous, he feels &#34;there&#39;s more to this than I am aware&#34;.  I am willing to be regressed, to see if I am repressing memories of that encounter.  After all these years it is still hard to think about it, much le! ss talk about it.<n>
