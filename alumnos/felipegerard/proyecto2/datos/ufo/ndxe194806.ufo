They were 2.  One lag to the right of the first.  No sound.  They looked oval, but I believed they were circular,because of the angle we were observing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were a dim yellow orange color.  I believe their color glow were not intentional, but was due to friction of the air.  Large and beautiful.  Their edges were sharp and defined.  They left a trail that was thin like white thread about 2.5 their length and at the end it disputed with a short white wiggly trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mother and sister and others were the observers.  I was too young to do anything then, but it influence my career in physics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know someone must have reported it.  I can&#39;t find any information of UFO over Baltimore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please Help,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We do not know how we can help, except to invite everyone who has been witness to a UFO to submit a written report of the event.  PD))<n>

My Dad is 86 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime in the year 1948 (he can&#39;t recall the time of year) he awoke one morning and went to a field to work on his dairy farm.  He arrived at a location on the farm known as &#34;Knob Field.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> There he discovered a large amount of wreckage (metal which was flexible, what appeared to be plastic and other material unknown to my Dad).  It was spred over an area about 50&#39; x 50&#39; in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He went and got my Mother and showed it to her (Mom died in 2003, but I remember her telling me the same story).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Dad told several other neighbors and friends, but no one believed him and showed no interest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He gathered the wreckage up and disposed of it in a raven ((ravine??)) where the family disposed of its trash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was on a 10 ft. diving board ready to run out and dive when I saw a dull silver disk at about 45 degrees approaching from the east travelling at a high rate of speed, yelled at my friends behind me on the board to look, keeping my eye on the object and pointing as it went past,they could not see it. it was against a broken cloudy sky almost the same color as the disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A description of the size of the elliptical object was a little smaller than the size of a dime at arms length.

6/1/48|Korea||Fireball|few minutes|Project Twinkle green fireballs sighted in Korea during same period of 1948-1950 as in the U.S. Southwest.|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16234.html|5|ndxe194806| Project Twinkle green fireballs sighted in Korea during same period of 1948-1950 as in the U.S. Southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a UFO; however, my father told me an interesting sighting he had when he was in junior high school - sometime in 1948-1950 - in Korea.  It was during the daytime when he saw a bright bluish-green light in the sky.  It was so bright that it seemed to light up the whole area even in daylight.  It seemed to be hovering in the sky and my father assumed that it must have been a comet that was flying directly towards him so that it created the illusion of hovering.  It disappeared after a while, and he never told anyone about it because it was so strange.  Also, he noted that there seemed to be some sort of cylindrical/prism-like shape inside the light and sketched it out for me. I happened to be flipping though a book on UFOs and noticed a blurb about Project Twinkle and realized that the dates and descriptions matched exactly.  So, I guess that this means that the perceived phenomena was not restricted solely to the American Southwest. Also, my father is highly rational and pragmatic and doesn&#39;t indulge in thoughts about the paranormal.  Neither of us previously knew anything about Project Twinkle.  The perfect match between his description and dates with the Project Twinkle sightings confirms that what he saw was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1948-1950 is approximate.

6/1/48|Napan (Canada)|NB|Rectangle|20 sec|while working on the farm they noticed a cube shape object (tumbling) by about the same speed as a plane but much lower.It was the size|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22115.html|6|ndxe194806| while working on the farm they noticed a cube shape object (tumbling) by about the same speed as a plane but much lower.It was the size of a single car garage or more.It made no sound and was metalic in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This farm is located less than 3 miles from miramichi airforce base, was this a snoop from above? or a weather ballon. What they saw was not a plane,but they never said much about it as they would only be laughed at,this was and is a very simple place and folk. Has there ever bin a siteing of a tumbling object?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>
