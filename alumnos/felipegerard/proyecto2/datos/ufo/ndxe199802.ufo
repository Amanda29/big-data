2/28/98 23:30|Columbus|OH|||I just sent a report a few minutes ago, about something seen in Columbus OH, on I270, First, i just realised that 22:30 is not 11:30 ci|12/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20676.html|1|ndxe199802| I just sent a report a few minutes ago, about something seen in Columbus OH, on I270, First, i just realised that 22:30 is not 11:30 civillian time, so my report should actually be 23:30 or more specifically 11:40 ish.  I have been thinking about it more, and wanted to add that the lights seemed to change positions, like they were morphing or somthing, not going off and another going on, just like it was reconfiguring. and at any given time it seemed circular because of the way the lights would spin, but there were three, giving the impression that it was a triangle, the lights were in a triangle shape, but seemd to be on a circular object because of their movement. This is hard to explain. BUt there were three points of light rotating in a circular pattern as the object moved, with white light in the center. Also, i forgot to check the box that said approximate date.  I know it was somewhere in the last 2 weeks of february, but not certain of the exact date, though i know the exact time. Also, i am so excited because i jsut saw a report from someone, saying thay saw something similar in the same time frame, and just so you know they said morse and westerville rds in columbus, my mom lives near the intersection of morse and westerville!!!! That is the direction that i saw it, as i had just entered the freeway from morse rd!! I don&#39;t feel like a crazy person anymore.....=) Someone else saw it too!!!! Their report is listed as 2/20/98. Maybe not on the same night as me, but it could be,I won&#39;t swear to the exact day, but at a similar time and place!! I know generally when it was because my mom had a serious illness and i was taking care of her, but i kinda forgot exactly! Also, if you look at their report, they described it perfectly, way better than i did, but i could see it in my mind again, just as they described.  I am certain we saw the same object.<n>

I AM AN AMATURE ASTRONOMER, SO I&#39;M ALWAYS LOOKING AT THE STARS WHEN WE GO OUT, AND AS IT HAD BEEN RAINY FOR 2 MONTHS PRIOR, THIS WAS ONE OF MY FIRST CHANCES TO SEE THE STARS FOR A WHILE. OUR PORCH FACES NORTH AND I WAS LOOKING AT THE AREA OF THE BIG DIPPER WHEN I NOTICED A BRIGHT, SLOW-MOVING LIGHT. I BROUGHT IT TO THE ATTENTION OF MY FIENCE SINCE IT WAS SO BRIGHT. WE THEN WATCHED IT MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE NORTH 1 DEGREE EAST OF THE NORTH STAR AND FADE OUT OF VIEW IN ABOUT 10 SECONDS AND AFTER TRAVELLING ONLY ABOUT 2 DEGREES ACROSS THE SKY.<n>
2/27/98 22:30|Vancouver|WA|Circle|5 mins?|I saw a cluster of lights darting back and forth in the sky, in manner unlike any modern aircraft is capable of.|12/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20675.html|3|ndxe199802| I saw a cluster of lights darting back and forth in the sky, in manner unlike any modern aircraft is capable of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think I witnessed the same sighting as reported on this website by someone else.  I will never forget what happened, but as I was the only witness in my vehicle, I tried to dismiss it, but I can&#39;t, I marked down the date and time, so that if anything ever came out in the future, I would know I wasn&#39;t nuts. After watching a UFO show on TV, I decided it was time to do research and see if anyone else reported what I had seen. I know what time it was because I looked at my watch, so I would always know what time it happened. I had 3 sightings or encounters in that month, and nothing ever again. This was the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving  SE on highway 270 between the former Morse RD and 670 exits, on my way home from my mother&#39;s house, there were several other cars out at the time, as I was driving, something caught my eye up to my right at about 1 o clock.  It was a round cluster of lights, red blue green and white, from what  could see, I couldn&#39;t make out an object clearly just a cluster of lights in a circular pattern, what caught my eye was the movement pattern.  It was hovering in a spot and it would dart to one driection then another, like center, then  down right, then down left then back up to the hover point.  I have never seen any man made machine capable of such quick and precisely executed movements.  It looked like a pinball, being shot back and forth, though it hoved a bit at each ending point. I pulled over immediately to make sure I was seeing what i thought.  I sat there in awe, watching it dart back and forth so fast and in a way that defied normal flight, no helicopter etc could have moved that way, and it covered large distances in a so called flash. I looked at my watch to verify the time. I was terrified.  i saw 2 other vehicles pull over during that time, i assume they had seen what i saw, but i was scared so i pulled back on the freeway and drove on home.  I finally got the nerve to look online and see if anyone else saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A the next night , i was spending the night at my mothers in this same area, when something equally odd happened. I was in my little sisters room and we couldn&#39;t sleep, so we were talking.  suddenly the room started to shake as if vibrated by some huge motor and the room started to glow red-orange, brighter and brighter, like the light was coming through the window.  We heard a loud whirring metallic sound, like screeching metal that sounded like it had a pattern, almost like music. we were terriified, and it lasted for several minutes, the light kept changing, like it was in a search pattern, but the noise level remianed the same. my sister and i sat staring at one another, afraid to say anything, finally when the light went down a little i jumped up and looked out the window, i had to know what it was, i knew if i didn&#39;t look, someone could try to discount me. But after what i saw the night before, i had to know.  The glow was coming form directly over our house and also from the woods behind it, there was more than one source, i think the metallic &#34;music&#34; must have come from the one overhead, explaining why the volume never changed, but the light did. I am convined it wasn&#39;t a police helicopter or anytthing, i have seen them before. I have never seen one with orange light.  I never saw any craft of any sort, just the glow from above and the woods, obviously i couldn&#39;t see what was over the roof, i thought about popping the screen and sticking my head out her window but I was too scared.  It wasn&#39;t anyhting like the night before&#39;s sighting.  But my mom lives in the same area where i had seen the lights the night before.  i honestly believe the &#34;glow&#34; the following night came from government craft, possibly tracking or searching for the object from the night before in the woods behind her house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange radio frequency&#39;s can be picked up sometimes late at night out there, that have the same sound as i had heard that night, though never on the same channel twice in a row. And no it isn&#39;t static.  My sis and i heard somehting one night that sounded like German and spanish mixed together, being spoken too rapidly for anyone to understand, no music. I really don&#39;t know what else to say. I have no pics or anything, don&#39;t even know if this is usefull. I don&#39;t live there anymore, nor have i ever related this story before, but it feels good to get it out of my system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister saw and heard the same thing I did. I have never seen or heard anyhting else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD))<n>
2/27/98 22:10|Bangor|ME|Flash|4 seconds|Spotted strange pulsing light flying at a high rate of speed north to south.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03252.html|4|ndxe199802| Spotted strange pulsing light flying at a high rate of speed north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Considering the proximity to the airport, I was hesitant to make this report.  However, being past this airport so many times, and never having seen anything that could explain this, I decided to.  It was a somewhat overcast night, and the lights of the town and airport were visible to my left as my girlfriend and I drove north on Interstate 95 towards Orono.  I noticed a flashing out of the corner of my eye and turned to see a white pulsing, circling flash moving VERY quickly across the sky in a southerly direction.  It pulsed intermittently, looking very much like a strobe but a bit slower.  It was out of site in only a few seconds, but the speed it moved at was not explainable by normal aircraft, nor was the strength of the light.  There was no plane attached to the light - just the light.  I saw a plane not a few minutes before that.  I told my girlfriend to look, but it was already out of site and she discounted it.  It was apparently close, only a few hundred feet up and it moved by flashing along, sort of in an incredibly gentle U-fashion to the south.  It was over a small line of trees and the town of Bangor.<n>

It looked like a star, but it twinkled more than a star and was brighter than the stars that were out.  The strange thing is that the object appeared to hover in a general location but would make erratic movements in different directions from the central location, about 30 degrees above the horizon looking East. The object never makes a noise and is higher in the sky than any airplanes that pass under it.  The movements are sometimes quick and sometimes slow, but there is definite movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The eeriest thing is that when looking through binoculars, you could see bright red, green and white lights that appear to be whirling around the object.  No star does that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had 5 witnesses the night that it was closest, and there have been at least two other people see it on 2 other occasions, in the approximate same location.  I am near an observatory, and talking to the operators, the closest thing they can figure is possibly seeing Artuerus.  i plan on filming it the next time I see it on a clear night.   On one occasion, what looked like a shooting star shot out from the object.<n>
2/27/98 21:00|Morganton|NC|light|1 hour|Large amount of lights on a mountain about tree top level|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03253.html|6|ndxe199802| Large amount of lights on a mountain about tree top level<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving home from work, these bright lights caught my attention , on this mountain that was about a mile from where I was, I drive home this way every night and I had never seen any lights on this mt. This was a large amount of lights and at first I thought that they was moving around but after stopping my truck and watched for awhile I summed up that the lights wasn&#39;t moving and that they didn&#39;t remind me of car lights for as I watched and moved about looking at this that it was just as bright from any spot that I looked at them where as car lights would be going in one stright direction and if you moved to a different angle and looked at them they would look different( not as bright) but no matter where I moved to and looked at them , other than the trees blocking the view, they was just as bright. After about 10 -15 min. watching this I raced home , about 5 miles from this spot , to get my binoculars, I was in my house about 5-10 min.then raced back to where I was watching this, thinking that it would be gone, but it was still there. In the same spot from what I could tell. I found a spot to pull over and from here with the binoculars I could tell , whatever it was that it was about tree top level and from my viewing spot it was behind some trees , so I tried to move to a different area and couldn&#39;t find a spot to pull over , so here I am in the middle of the road ( in a good spot now , with a break in the trees where it was at) I couldn&#39;t make out what I was seeing other than it was bright and lighting up the top of the mt. and I didn&#39;t see anything under the lights , but I didn&#39;t get long in this new viewing spot due to another car came up and I had to move and at the same time I noticed that I was a hair away from being out of gas and fearing that if it moved that I would follow and run out of gas and taking a chance of going for gas and coming back. Gas was about 2-3 miles away and you guessed it, When I got back it was gone. Went driving around but didn&#39;t see anything else. Came home and called the sheirff&#39;s office to see if they had any calls on this and was told no. And tried to sum up what I had seen. The best that I can sum up is that it looked liked something I had seen from a movie (as in &#34;Fire In The Sky&#34;) where that object was lighting up the woods. It was light lots of bright flood lights in a large circle and lighting up the whole area. No noise, to me this ruled out a plane or hellicopter, while I was looking at this , it wasn&#39;t like looking at headlights, with binoculars you would be able to tell that it was headlights.It wasn&#39;t moving from what I could tell , the lights wasn&#39;t flickering it was just like it was just hanging there. It was a clear night, you could see stars but then a couple of hours later we had bad fog roll in. I was looking north, but I&#39;m sure I wasn&#39;t looking at a star or airplane for this light was on that mountain. I know that that I shouldn&#39;t had left but I kept thinking that it would still be there when I got back just to find out that I was watching a new house with alot of flood lights around it but that&#39;s not the case cause it was gone when I got back.<n>

It was traveling from east to west at a high speed. The color of the object was blue and it had a tail behind it. My guess is that it was a large meteor that I witnessed. No sound since I was indoors at the time. And I couldn&#39;t see if it looked like it impacted on the ground either. Kind of unusual to see a large meteor like that this time of the year. Haven&#39;t heard of any scheduled showers to be seen. Could be like what was reported over Colorado recently. If you are interested in hearing about a sighting that occurred on 08/17/69 over the San Fernando Valley of California then pleaase let me know and I will post it here. That sighting of seven large orange colored objects in formation was definitely much closer and had some very strange aspects to it. I witnessed it along with about six other persons. At the time, we did report it to the Air Force and all they said was, &#34;We don&#39;t know what they are.&#34;<n>

We watched it for about a minute until it began to move southeast at a  very low speed, it went about a mile down from us and what was odd is there where a couple streel lights out and this thing reflected the light as if it where a mirror, before i could say anything, she was on the phone with the sherrif&#39;s office explaining to them what she had seen, myself of course was telling her to Shhhhhhh, dont say my name, hang up because she was telling them that a UFO just passed over head, that she wants the police to come out and get this thing. I was in shock and embarrased at the same time,she then gave me the phone and the lady officer told me to hold on, i could hear other officers in the back ground on the radio giving a play by play of what this thing was doing,i heard one officer saying OH MY GOD, NO WAY one was being proffesional like a sports announcer,( WE HAVE VISUAL, ITS HEADING TOWARD T.R.A {Tallahassee Regional Airport}COPY THAT then one would say ITS HEADING TOWARDS THE FLEAA MARKET ON CAPITAL CIRCLE, the lady officer was ignoring me on the phone when i asked if everthing is ok, i then heard one of the officer&#39;s say DID YOU SEE THAT, then one came back on and said I CANT BELIEVE HOW FAST IT JUST TOOK OFF, one came back on and said it left like a bat out of hell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> just as the officer was trying to hang up on me by saying WE ARE LOOKING INTO IT SIR, an officer came on the radio and said OH LORD ITS BACK, OVER THE FLEA MARKET, the whole time we are in the front yard still looking up but unable to see it because the flea market was about 10 miles away, the line went dead and she finally left to go home, the next day i told my Dad about what had happend and he looked in the newspaper to no avail, there was nothing, later on that day i called the sherrif&#39;s office back to see if there were any more details about the sighting, they  had no clue to what i was talking about.I did come across some correctional officer&#39;s who said they had heard about something that had happend but no exact details, so i guess it never really happend right?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was amazed|4/1/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16951.html|11|ndxe199802| I stumbled on to this website by accident, looking for anyone else who might have seen what I had on February 26th, 1998. I was amazed to see that the time, date and location of one of the sightings listed on your site is almost the same as my sighting. I am a ((senior aviation specialist)) in Ontario, Canada. I and my friend ((name deleted)) were in the air at the time of the Feb. 26th, 1998 sighting above, that was reported near Ontario, NY. We too had a sighting. We had departed from the Oshawa airport and were flying on an eastward heading of about 080 degrees, eventually passing just north of St. Andrews, which is just west of Cornwall Ontario, Canada. ((name deleted)) tapped me on the shoulder, pointed out the window to my right and said,&#34;what&#39;s that?&#34; I saw an object that looked like the underside of a massive metal bowl with multi-coloured lights on it. This thing was much, much, larger than our airplane (a Piper Cherokee 180) and appeared to be tagging along with us at the same altitude (5500-ft.) about 5 nautical miles off of our port side wing. There were several different coloured lights on the object, some of which are not used in aviation at all. They pulsed from left to right slowly, dimmed out, then pulsed from right to left. The color pattern from left to right was: GOLD-RED-BLUE-GREEN-GOLD, then from right to left: GREEN-GOLD-BLUE-RED-GOLD. When the lights were not on, the thing looked semi-transparent. You could see the outline of it, yet it appeared to me that you could see right through it at the same time. I was very excited to see something like this, but at the same time quite upset and afraid because I was unsure of what is was or might do. ((name deleted)) and I were quiet for what seemed like quite a while, just watching this thing, then I decided to call Dorval Terminal in Montreal, Quebec. I said, &#34;Dorval terminal, this is Cherokee 180&#34;; (I&#39;m holding my callsign until I know what is going to happen with this information). &#34;Cherokee 180 good evening, Dorval Terminal.&#34;. &#34;We are on a VFR cross-country flight plan, passing just north of the town of St. Andrews on an eastbound heading and have traffic to the south of us at the same altitude. Could you tell us what it is?&#34;  &#34;Cherokee 180, squawk code (####) on your transponder and standby.&#34;  &#34;Dorval Terminal, Cherokee (call sign) squawking (####).&#34;  &#34;Cherokee 180, there in no know traffic at that altitude on our radar within a 60 mile radius of your area.&#34;   I couldn&#39;t believe it.  &#34;Cherokee 180, what kind of aircraft is it?&#34;  &#34;Dorval Terminal, I don&#39;t know. It doesn&#39;t look like an aircraft. It&#39;s got multi-coloured lights on it that go from left to right and back again and it looks bigger than a 747. It&#39;s massive.&#34;  &#34;Cherokee 180, how long have you been in the air?&#34;  &#34;Dorval terminal, we&#39;ve been up here for a few hours.&#34;  Maybe you should land and stretch your legs for awhile, maybe take a break.&#34;  &#34;Negative Dorval, we&#39;d like to keep going if that&#39;s O.K. with you, but you don&#39;t know what that is we&amp;#8217;re seeing?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s a u.f.o. Cherokee 180! Ha! Ha!&amp;#8221; I was upset and annoyed at the attitude of the controller, because Stan and I both were seeing that thing and the tower was denying it being there. I didn&amp;#8217;t think it was a joke. &amp;#8220;O.K. Cherokee 180, call us again in another 10 minutes&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;Roger, Dorval. Cherokee 180 checks remarks&amp;#8221;. I said, &amp;#8220;Stan whatever that thing is out there, it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter right now. We&amp;#8217;ve got to pay attention to our aircraft and flight plan right now, so let&amp;#8217;s do that.&amp;#8221; We resumed our time keeping and navigating. The next time we looked out the window, the object was gone. I asked Stan how he felt about seeing something like that and he said he felt sort of scared. I said, &amp;#8220;me too&amp;#8221;. I contacted Dorval terminal and they gave me a VOR radial (a navigational frequency) to track outbound, away from they&amp;#8217;re airspace. I set up the VOR receiver with the proper radial selected and began trying to track it outbound as requested. The needle twitched from left to right and no matter how hard I tried to hold my heading, no matter what I did, I was unable to keep the needle in the center. I tried the second VOR receiver. Same thing. &amp;#8220;They were working when I tested them a few hours ago!&amp;#8221;, I thought to myself. I knew that Stan had no idea what a VOR was and what was happening, so I tried not to draw his attention to the problem. I looked outside for the object we had seen earlier, but there was nothing there. I had a look at my VNC (VFR Navigational Chart) and set myself a new course for our destination in Quebec. The ceiling started coming down and a call to the local FSS (Flight Service Station) revealed that the weather was below VFR minimums where we were headed. Also, I was amazed to see that the fuel gauges read only ¼ of a tank on either side! I remembered passing a small airport a short while ago and decided to find it on the map, turn back and land there. I asked FSS if there was fuel available there and they said they&amp;#8217;d have someone waiting for us. We found and identified the airport quite easily, made the appropriate radio calls and landed safely. I had the tanks filled to the rim on both sides before we left Oshawa. I had been running the engine at &amp;#8220;best-lean&amp;#8221;, to conserve fuel and get reasonable power, so I was surprised to see how much fuel had been used. I&amp;#8217;d never noticed this plane to have had such high fuel consumption before. It was as if we&amp;#8217;d been in the air a lot longer than we actually had been. We couldn&amp;#8217;t find anyone to buy fuel from when we arrived at there, so we called FSS and asked them if they had any ideas. They said that we&amp;#8217;d have to go to another nearby airport, about 15 miles away. I was told I&amp;#8217;d get fuel there for sure. Neither of us had enough money for a hotel for the night and cab fare to and from it, so we considered our options. At the time, Quebec had recently experienced an ice storm and was recuperating from downed power-lines, blocked roads and even food shortages in some areas. The temperature was probably between &amp;#8211;15 to &amp;#8211;20 degrees Celsius, so waiting in the plane all night was not an option either; we had to fly. Again I planned the route to our new destination and we took off. Enroute to our new destination I was in constant contact with Dorval Terminal and they gave me some vectors (directions/headings) to help out along the way. The fuel was running out fast and I told Dorval that I didn&amp;#8217;t think I was going to make it. Stan heard this in his headset and must have been terrified, but he said nothing. For some strange reason, I wasn&amp;#8217;t worried. All the events leading up until the end were so surreal. Dorval told me that I should see the airport soon and sure enough, there it was. I had to fight a crosswind like I&amp;#8217;d never experienced before. On final approach, I had such a great deal of crab (wind correction) in that it seemed as if we were flying at almost a 70-degree angle to the runway. As we got closer to the runway, the wind strength died off considerably and I was able to use the rudder to get more in line for our landing. There were fire and foam trucks, the local police and the Chief Pilot of one of the FBO&amp;#8217;s at the airport, waiting for us. We landed normally and taxied in. Along the taxiway, the engine started sputtering and when I went to do my shutdown checklist, the engine quit before I had a chance to pull out the mixture control. The firemen walked over to the plane as Stan and I got out. One of them took the fuel cap off and said something in French. Stan told me that he&amp;#8217;d said, &amp;#8220;there&amp;#8217;s nothing in there&amp;#8221;! One of the firemen asked me in english what my name was, and when I told him, everybody including the police and Chief Pilot was roaring with laughter. I imagine the reason for that is that my last name is almost the same to the letter as a pilot who flew across the Atlantic in a single engine plane without knowing if he&amp;#8217;d make it or not. We got our fuel, had a bite to eat, I got the Chief Pilot to stamp my logbook and we set out to return to Oshawa. The trip back was uneventful and we landed with&amp;#8230;..plenty of fuel!??! I&amp;#8217;m not sure what happened that night, or if any of the events were connected, but I know what I saw. I haven&amp;#8217;t stopped thinking about our sighting and certainly have kept it quiet in commercial circles. I&amp;#8217;ve told a few people, but they all think I&amp;#8217;m either making it up, or that I&amp;#8217;ve got something wrong with me. I&amp;#8217;ve given up talking to people who are ignorant. I&amp;#8217;m ready to talk to someone that believes me, but I&amp;#8217;m still afraid of being ridiculed. I&amp;#8217;m not sure what to do, but it seems to be bothering me more than usual lately. Also, for some reason I keep having this vivid picture in my head of turning directly toward this object and flying in that direction. When I get the image of this in my head, I feel sick, distressed and the tears start coming out. I don&amp;#8217;t know why. I&amp;#8217;m starting to get worried about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  I will remove all the spurious computer glitches at a later time.  I can&#39;t get all of them tonight.  PD))<n>

First observed at approx. overhead position and took two minutes to travel north then dimmed or burned out with no color change or breakup at approx. 10 degrees from northern horizon. Observation made by my wife and myself. I have 17 years affiliation with the Air Force and am a C-5A Galaxy Flight Engineer. We have both observed many falling stars and both agree this was unusual in its bright intensity and blue color and direction of travel from south to north. I am 100% certain about the charactoristics. Also I used an aircraft transitioning along the eastern horizon for speed comparison. This was not an aircraft we observed. Again either a Meteorite transitioning the atmosphere or a flare traveling from south to north.<n>

Walked one block to drugstore and was looking up at a perfect cloudless blue sky (the first clear day in a week ) Very warm for February. I was looking up at the sky when I noticed ( there were gusty winds but no clouds at all,just very blue sky and sunny ) a glimmer from the North heading South.There was nothing else in the sky but this &#34;object&#34;.I saw distinctly a very shiny silvery &#34;cigar shaped&#34; object that had a pulsating Sphere/light as a companion. This Blue orb zig-zagged behind it and to it&#39;s sides but never went in front of it.I quick checked around to see if anyone else was watching but no one was and there was a fair amount of people around.I wanted to yell to people but I didn&#39;t.It was cruising high up.the orb turned green then back to blue.The craft never veered off the line it was following at a real slow pace.I was transfixed.I stared at this for 23 minutes and no one asked me what I was looking at.I watched until it vanished out of sight into nothingness. It wasn&#39;t a figment of my imagination,Sun-spots,reflections,a kite,a plane,a blimp,a promotional stunt,or swamp gas.no vapor trail or wings. This I swear to be true. I wrote all this down just after it happened and then just stumbled onto this site and thought I will report this anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I sensed something wrong.  I convinced my husband that the clouds didn&#39;t look normal of seem to be forming normally.  I was outside one early a.m. approximately 3:00 A.M., there were no clouds in the sky.  I was loading my car with Work Supplies.  I noticed that long streaks of light (that put me in mind of instant &#34;Icicle Like&#34; Streaks that were suddenly appearing all over the sky, they filled up the sky and then seem to be forming clouds.  I swear... After only an hour or so watching,the whole sky was full of clouds. From nothing? After finally convincing my husband of the bizzarness of this, he agreed that we should to take a drive out and away from the city lights to obeserve.  So, the following A.M., we saw more of the same thing, HOWEVER... in between these clouds, were hovering white lights (posing as stars) that seemed to be hiding behind these clouds.  They moved back and forth, Up and Down. It seemed like whenever we would point them out to each other or notice them, they would move behind a cloud for cover.  We observed at least, 10-15 &#34;At A Time&#34;.   Then, out popped a sporadically moving, (STRAIGHT UP, FAR LEFT, DOWN, FAR RIGHT, THEN UP) A &#34;Extremely FAST &#34;Flashing&#34; RED&#34; Object, this thing was &#34;All over the place&#34;. It moved this way until it found a cloud to hide behind.  The reason I say this, is because, when it popped out again, it wasn&#39;t moving sporadically.  Until, what seemed, it realized it was revealed, then there it went again, &#34;All Over the Place Again&#34;, then disappeared behind the clouds.  We were so freaked out, being that we were out in the middle of a secluded area,and then also realizing that these objects were not far away from us at all.  That they could be aware that we were watching.  We Beat It Out Of There... &amp; Quick!!<n>

Then from afar I noticed a bright light in the sky and I told my boss that maybe its just a tower light. But he told me that no towers are present in the area. After maybe 10 min, it is getting bigger and nearer and so we decided to stop on the road because we got curious. We both dont believe in UFOs but when we stepped down we get to see a certified UFO. It stopped on top of us as if they really wanted us to see them. It is triangular in shape and full of white lights covering the whole triangular shape. It also has a single blue light on one wing and a single red light on the other wing. We stood staring on it with amazement because we dont know what it is because for sure its not a plane because it stopped on top of us and its not a chopper also because it is so quiet.

There appeared to be a straight line (leg of some type) protruding from the lower left side near the bottom and from the lower right side near the bottom. A similar object was protruding straight down from the bottom of the object. I approached a wooded area and could no longer see the object. I rounded a curve and came back into a clearing and the object had completely disappeared. There was no trail of light and never a sound. I got a family member and we rode around the area that I thought the light was in, but we saw nothing unusual. Approximately one hour later, about 23:00, I went outside and looked toward the area where I had previously seen the object and there was a small red circular light and a small green circular light hovering in the same area. No noise could be heard and the object was not moving. I called for family members to come outside, and three other family members witnessed the red and green lights hovering in the sky. Suddenly the lights started moving forward toward the north and we then heard a noise like the engine of a plane and this object moved away to the north. We wondered then if perhaps the military or someone else had seen something in the sky and come to investigate the same bright orange light I saw.<n>

2/20/98 22:57|Columbus|OH|Triangle|8 min.|I first noticed a long, thin, sort of cigar shaped bright white light slowly moving W to E behind my house. Upon looking out the window|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03245.html|30|ndxe199802| I first noticed a long, thin, sort of cigar shaped bright white light slowly moving W to E behind my house. Upon looking out the window that was gone but, after several seconds 3 lights just came on, about 150 or 200 ft. up. They were in a triangular formation, the front being yellow, one red and one green. These lights made several odd manuvers and never flashed or blinked; we are realatively close to Port Columbus so, I am used to seeing airplanes and helicopters yet, I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The long, bright white light was odd because it seemed to be close and flying very low,( 20-40 ft.), and even though this was a very intense bright white light it cast no light on surrounding objects. I could see the trees in my neighbor&#39;s yard silohetted against the light as it moved across the neighbor&#39;s yard. This object was about as long as the first joint of your finger,( from the tip of your finger to the first knuckle), held at arms length - as I sat about 22 ft. from the window that I saw it through. The triangular shaped object that I saw after I got up and went to the window appeared over the intersection of Morse &amp; Westerville Roads at an altitiude of about 100-150 ft. and headed due North, in my general direction. Once it got slightly North of Morse Rd.,( which runs E &amp; W), it banked slightly and headed west, the whole time going about 25-35 mph. The object traveled West until it was 200 ft. or so past Westerville Rd. then, came to a stop rotated 180 degrees and began flying back East at about the same speed as before. When the object got back to where it origanally began moving to the West it suddenly got a burst of speed like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen and made a U-turn that seemed to take it slightly higher and its own width to the South. This U-turn was one of the main things that made me stop and think &#34; Hey this is not a helicopter or airplane&#34; because, just last year I went to the Dayton Airshow and saw how fast these modern millitary planes can accelerate. Let me tell you nothing I have ever seen could do this- not to mention the g-forces this manuver would have exerted on a pilot would have been more than any human could ever stand. After this abrupt U-turn the object immediately returned to its previous snail like speed and continued on to the West. As it got about 300 ft. or so from Westerville Rd. it slowly turned to the South South West and as it made this turn all the lights instantly turned red but, there was no blink or flash as though I was seeing a different side of the object, the lights just simply switched colors!!!! After the object had changed course and color it just flew at the same slow speed out of my field of view to the Southwest. This triangular object seemed to emmit a wide, highly despirsed light at about a 45 degree angle, from the front yellow light- this light is totally different than a normal search light on a helicopter. It also seemed like there was a triangular shadow inbetween the lights so that since the sky was overcast the clouds were slightly brighter than the object itself- so, it was possible to make out the shape but, there was only a slight hint of it. The object appeared to be an equilateral triangle of about 50-75 ft. per side. I also stuck my head out the door during the sighting and heard no sound, other than the usual traffic sounds, and there was no change in the object&#39;s appearance.<n>

It could also have very well been a low orbit satelite. However, where I live there is enough light that I usually cannot see such things. It wasn&#39;t moving very fast nor did it do any spectacular stunts. I figured that I should report it any way, just in case.<n>

Ilooked up and saw a long vertical white glowing light. I thought it was just a sliver of the moon peeking through or even the tail of an aircraft. Then it began to move slowly and suddenly turned bright orange and began moving through the sky like a comet not really too fast though. I had my Mom pull over so I could take some video. As we stopped the object became stationary again but still glowed bright orange. I was able to get this on video. Then it just seemed to move further away until we could no longer see it. I am a very rational person, I also work in the aviation business and I know this was no type of aircraft.  I want to know if anyone else saw this object. I also want to know if anyone would be interested in the video I took since it is actually a very clear view of the object. What should I do with this info?<n>

There was no Tail or ampenage or wings and as it flew and then disappeared behind the ajasoed Buildings. afew moments latter it reappeared now  goingfor waest to east and never made a sound as it flew. Then before going out of sight obsured by the hills to the east in darted upward and into some cloudsand was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Saucer shaped craft having a beam or side on view toward me. It was dull Metallic Grey and light reflected from the surface of the craft. It moved about 150-200 Mph at an altitude of between 1000 and 2000 ft. iT was perhaps 1-1.5 miles away for me .<n>

There appeared to be a beam of light between 2 of the white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting outside Fair Oaks Hospital and saw the following in the sky.  There were 2 very distinct white lights and one other less distinct white light that formed a triangle shape.  Counting the lights clockwise, with number one being the top:  !: bright white; 2: dim white light (barely visable); 3: bright white.  Between number 2 and 3, there was a small flashing red light.  At first I thought it was an airplane because there are many aircraft in the area.  However there was a stream of light between lights number 1 and 2 and a stream of light between lights number 1 and 3.  In other words, there was no line for the bottom of the triangle.  These streams of light I refer to, did not appear solid, but appeared as directed radiance between the other lights.  It moved at the average speed that one witnesses in aircraft when near an airport.  This is my second reporting of a sighting.  I am very skeptical in regards to UFOs, but I cannot explain what I saw, especially the one I reported seeing in December.  I expect this one was an earth-bound aircraft, but the one in December....well...I will never forget it nor the effect it has had on me.<n>

I  watched  as  it  started  to  move  kind  of  up  but  at  an angle  and  it  went  up  to  the  sky.  And  that  was  when  I  noticed  the  big  one.  It  was  3  blue  flourecent  lightes  in  the  shape  of  a  triangle.  The  one  that  had  come  off  the  mountain   flew  up  to  it  and  disappered.  And  starred  athe  triangle  I  have  no  idea  how  high  it  was  up  in  the  air.  But  any  way  then  more  balls  of  light  started  to  come  to  it  and  disapper, while  at  the  same  time  I  noticed  it  was  also  kind  of  like  shooting  more  out.  And  this  lasted  till  I  fell  asleep  again  mind  you  this  wasn&#39;t  the  first  time  I  had  seen  anything  like  this. But  this  one  was  just  so  much  grander  in  amazement.

She alerted her husband to the object and he dismissed it as an airplane.  As she watched it, it started to fade in and out.  She hollered to Mr. S. to pull over because she was convinced at that point that it was not an airplane because of its behavior and the fact that the object was perfectly round.  She saw the object disappear completely while over the mountains and searched for it in the sky through the car windows.  She then looked straight up and saw the object directly over their vehicle.  At that time Mr. S. Saw it also and they both described it as a round, very bright white light that hurt their eyes when they looked at it.  The object suddenly turned bright orange and again faded out.  They said it moved too fast to be any kind of an airplane, helicopter or anything they&#39;ve ever seen before.  Mrs. S. said the sighting left her feeling very disturbed and she felt as if some sort of communication may have taken place between herself and the object while it was overhead.  She felt very afraid that they would be abducted and didn&#39;t feel or sleep well for a few days after the event.<n>

We walked and followed the objects trying to watch them as they went behind some large pine trees. From there we lost sight of them.

Chased by two Ohio Air National Guard F-16&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about 02/15/98 at approximately 23:35 Hrs. I observed a large Charcoal gray to Black UFO. This craft was slowly traversing the sky from North East to South West at between 1000 to 1500 feet in altitude. There was a very low more felt then heard rumbling coming from the craft as it moved. It was approximately 100 to 150 feet long, and 100 feet wide at it&#39;s widest point. There were three strobing lights shifting from dull green to bright blue on this craft. One at each of its three tips. I would estimate the crafts origanal speed at between 150 and 200 MPH. This sighting took place within hearing distance of the local Airport extimated range to the airport is from 3 to 5 miles maybe more. As I spent 21 years in the military I know the sound of Combat Aircraft as they take off under full military power with after burners. I heard two Ohio Air National Gaurd F-16&#39;s take off from the Toledo Express Airport and head in the direction of the Unknown. Both F-16&#39;s passed directly over head I could clearly see they were both armed with two each AIM-9 Sidewinder Air to Air Heat Seeking Missles. As the two F-16&#39;s approched the craft it looked to me as if they were attempting to get a weapons lock. The large Unknow suddely increased it&#39;s speed to well over supersonic but without the resultent sonic boom. It then tilted upward at I would say an almost 90 degree angle and continued to excelerate. Both F-16&#39;s attemped to stay with and chase the craft but they were quickly out distanced. I continued to watch as they both broke off persute and circled back returning to their base at Toledo Express Airport. Again I state that the craft made a very low possibly subsonic rumbling sound that I felt more then heard. I would discribe it&#39;s shape as the same as the expiremental XF-16XL the Cranked Arrow (An expierimental Delta wing configuration of the F-16 Fighting Falcon. I should also note that my 21 years in the military was spent in and around the intelligence community. For 20 of thoes years I held a Top Secret Security clearance with several special compartmented acsesses granted. For the last 6 years I have worked as a private security officer and investigator. I do not know if there have been any other reports of this craft nor do I know if anyone else saw what I saw. I watched the newspapers and the television for any reports of this incident and I have yet to see any it is almost as if it never happend. And this concerns me more then if there had been reports and people were made to look like boobs for reporting it.<n>

Lights went off but glowed hazy green for several seconds before immense lights began to flash over the foggy sky - central location of flashes from us was WNW.  The first flash was a general bright blue followed by several defined rays that spread out from the circumference of the blue lights this was followed by more flashing - yellow and red lines that horizontally crossed the original set of rays.  The flasing continued a few more seconds, was as bright as lightening: air temp. 39f; pressure 29.90.  We later learned that a powerline had been severed at the junction of Highway 61 and the Ryan Road - 15 miles up the shore of Lake Superior from central downtown Duluth.  It seem to us that a rather large craft may have come a bit too close to ground and that some form of its propellent energy caused the power line to snap.  We walked over to the site of the break later and saw several power company vehicles a couple of squad cars were present but left before we actually reached the scene.<n>

I spotted it in the southeastern sky and it was moving in a southwesternly direction. It was visible for about 2-5 minutes before it vanished. It was a very clear sky that night about as clear as it gets around here. I think its altitude was about 100ft to 200ft. It was oval or almond shaped. I thought it was a airplane until it dissappeared. This is my third sighting all in Southgate comunity in Glen Burnie MD.. My mother witnessed the second sighting (two craft). This sighting was only seen by myself.<n>

As we were nearing Sharon, PA,  I noticed a large white round light off to the east, over the areas of Sharon and Wheatland PA.  The object was about the size of a dime held at an arm&#39;s length.  The weather was cloudy, the temperature was 30 degrees.  It was dry at the time. The object moved slowly towards the southeast.  It changes color from white to yellow, then yellow to orange-red, then back to a pale yellow.  It hovered motionless by a set of radio towers for Y-103 FM radio station for approx. 2 minutes. The object then became two round white lights with a red small light in the middle, and began to move west closer to us, over the state line and into Masury and Brookfield, OH.  It crossed behind us as we drove into the Sharon, PA  /  Masury, OH area.  It continued to move west and descended below treetop level in Brookfield, OH.  Several times it showed in the same area on the eastern side of Brookfield, just above the trees, but was a white - to-yellow oval once again.  We pulled into our driveway, and the object was gone.<n>

It moved very quickly across the sky. it moved back and forth and up and down several times every 3 seconds. It changed color a few times. It then went behind the far mountains and reappeared from behind them again a few seconds later before it suddenly shot away and out of sight. There was no way this could have been an airplane, no plane can move that quickly or in such a manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the sunrise for several minutes before I noticed a strange oval shaped object move across the clouds. At first I thought it was an airplane so I paid it no mind. then as I watched it suddenly began to move quite erratically, it shot up and then down and went all the way across the horizon and back to the other side in a matter of seconds. It continuously did this for an estimated time of 20 minutes. When it first started doing this I realized that this could not possibly be an airplane of any sort. There was no way any airplane could move that quickly unless it was travelling very near the sound barrier, it was moving so fast across the skyline. It was at that moment that I began to feel rather nervous and a bit afraid. The craft never came towards me, but just the sight of it frightened me, and very few things frighten me or even make me nervous. I am a very calm, rational person, however this craft had that effect on me for some reason. I continued to watch it and it appeared to change color several times. I do not believe that the color change was due to the reflected light from the sunrise however, because it changed to dark green and red and then to pure white and finally to black, all colors that did not appear anywhere in the sunrise. I am also a rather observant person and I took out my binoculars to try to see if there was any way that this could be a plane, just to put out of my mind the last few doubts I had or to prove that the doubts were for good reason. I looked at it and I saw only the perfectly smooth oval craft still, with some sunlight reflecting off of it&#39;s now dark green surface. when I took the binoculars away from my face I watched as the craft dissapeared behind the far mountains. This craft must have been quite large to be so far away and still be quite visible. My neighbor also witnessed this event, however my neighbor and I rarely speak to eachother due to a personal dissagreement. As far as I am aware my neighbor was the only other witness. Also the craft emitted a! strange sonic pulsing sound that I could hear as could my dog and several of my neighbors dogs as well as all the other animals around my area and as far as I could hear. I do not believe that my neighbor heard this sound. I have a strange ability to hear ultra high pitched sounds such as a dog whistle, that many people cannot hear. I do not believe that my neighbor heard the sound emitted by the craft, even though the animals could. Even the wild coyotes seemed to react to it. After about 20 minutes the craft shot away out of sight. It must have broken the sound barrier at this point.<n>

I doubt they could have been larger than say 8-10 feet in diameter, certainly far larger than any birds, and they sparkled and glissened in the sky at dusk. It startled me and I wondered if anyone else driving on the Merritt at that time saw it. I was travelling North and these things must have been at some point beyond exit 38, so they weren&#39;t overhead. I have not heard any mention of this event on local television. Nothing. There had to have been at least 50 of these things, and possibly a lot more...like crystals travelling in the sky.<n>

Mostly white but some were blue, green, and red.  The area past the trees would&#39;ve given me a perfect view if it was a jet...thusly my curiosity.<n>

It was huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During what I remember as the second week of February, 1998. Myself and three other people (2 girls, 2 guys)went to Villa Roma Ski Resort, Callicoon, NY in the Catskill Mountains on vacation.  The third night we were there, we all got into a big arguement.  One of the women we were with stormed out of the Condo and disappeared. We were getting worried because she was gone for a while, so I left to go look for her. The area was very dark. The areas surrounding the resort were wooded. I wandered around calling for her for about 15-20min. I actually started getting nervous because it was so dark out there that I headed back to the condo. Before I got to the door I looked up to my left because I thought I saw something go by. My first thought was it was a helicopter. But I never heard it go by. I only saw it. I walked to the left of the condo, then along the left side. What I saw next has haunted me ever since. In the sky a little to my right(1 or 2 O&#39;clock position) was an object. This object was huge. Maybe two times the size of a passenger plane, oval and glowing. Not lit up like a lightbulb. Kind of like glow sticks but hazy. And it didn&#39;t make a sound. I began to make all kinds of excuses for what it could be.  It was moving in what I think was a northerly direction. In the most unbelievable way! It looked like when you throw a Frisbee. It almost bounces on air. Like it&#39;s hitting air pockets or something.  I know that&#39;s probably not helping you, but I don&#39;t know how else to explain it. It looked very unstable in the sky. Like it was vibrating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just standing there.  I wanted to run but I didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know why! So,I just stood there with my mouth open.   It was moving north very slowly. Then it just swung around backwards(south), and stopped! Like it saw me! At this point I believe I may have been in shock or something because I was frozen with fear! It was just sitting in the sky, still.Then out of nowhere it took off. Flying straight in a what I think was south-westerly direction. Straight, then up, then gone! Just like that. The speed it was moving across the sky was incredible. The whole time I was telling myself I wasn&#39;t real. But I know it was! I still have the same feeling in my chest everytime I think of it! This incident took about 15-20 minutes from the time I saw it, to the time it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately ran in the house and told everyone what I saw. Although they were very inquistive, I felt like none of them believed my story. So I stopped talking about it. I didn&#39;t want anyone to think I was crazy! Since then I&#39;ve only told two people and you are one of them. Since that night, there&#39;s not one night that has gone by that I haven&#39;t stared into space, for atleast a few minutes. This has changed my outlook on man and God quite a bit now. I&#39;m just looking for answers now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am of very sound mind. For the rest of my life I will swear to what I saw on my children. I would agree to, or volunteer for hypnosis and or a lie detector test. By anyone! I know what I saw and I will never change my mind. All I do now is try to search for answers. So if there is anyone out there who can help me please contact me.  What are they doing and why are they here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was traveling south torwards Salem N.H. along a dark, although fairly well populated road when I noticed how pretty the sky was that night. Suddenly I noticed an odd light in the sky. At first I just thought it was a plane from a nearby airport. The light however,  appeared to be about the size of 6 or 7 airplanes and I could not make out any shape except for the hazy green light. I slowed down, turned my lights off and drove to the side of the road to get a better look. As I pulled of, the object shot off towards what appeared to be away from earth. The car behind me also stopped and a man and a women, about the age of thirty came out and asked me if I had too, just seen what they had. They had actually been traveling on a different road and had seen the light and decided to follow it. According to them, the light had been there for about a minute, although I only saw it for approx. 45. sec before it vanished.<n>

I know it was a comercial airliner because the travel the same route every night. Anything that is that close to a big plane couldn&#39;t fly because it would be in the planes wake!<n>

At the approximate time stated above, I had departed the local theater for home. Heading west on the main thoroughfare for home, I was attracted to this kind of orange glow (as stated above). It seemed to have a flat odd appearance. I indicated rectangle! The shape seemed square but it did seem to change slightly, I guess due to the change in variation in these colors. The night time sky was clear, and a slight breeze was coming from the south. This object was going south. I followed it all the to the overlook at the Battery Point lighthouse vista point. This object veered southwest and drifted out to sea and disappeared into the night.<n>

I viewed it with my telescope, then with the binoculars.  It then started moving in a northerly direction. After about 5 seconds the light dimmed. It kept travelling north and approximately 15 seconds later, it disappeared.  I know this was not an airplane or helecotper because I have seen them through my binoculars before and they( airplanes and helicopters) move much faster.  There have been reports in the local newspaper by others who witnessed the same thing to call them to discuss this sighting.<n>

When we went outside on the balcony to have a smoke, we noticed a beam of light behind Kapiti Island.  This is not necessarily unusual as sometimes Sea and Rescue Searches with Helicopters produce similar visual effects.  However, standing there arguing why S&amp;R was called out again, we noticed that the colour of the light changed from the usual bright white to an alteration at low frequency of a dull, surealistic green and pink.  Slowly, the source of the greenish light appeared to rise from behind Kapiti Island.  At this stage, we could not make out the body of the object emitting the light nor could we hear any sounds.  The objects movement appeared to be relatively slow.  When the light changed to pink, we briefly noticed that the source of the pink light was positioned behind the source of the green light making a huge squshed cylindrical object in front of it visible for a couple of seconds.  Unfortunately, the pink beam of light and the object in front of it synchroneously set slowly behind Kapiti Island.  The whole spectacle appeared to last a long time, but judging by the length of the cigarettes we smoked, it would have had been lasting for less than one minute.<n>

I was laying on the grass looking up.  My 15 year old son saw everything I did.  It was tan and wing shaped and seemed to go in and out of vision when looked at directly.  Merely a curiosity at this point - it flew with some of the characteristics of a hawk, but was much too high and rigid.    I observed it for about fifteen minutes in this holding pattern before it disappeared completely.    I left the park and drove towards town.  At the corner of Mesquite Springs Road and Twentynine Palms Highway I saw what I believe to be the same object at a very low altitude, maybe 50 feet, flying very slow southbound parallel to Mesquite Springs Road towards me.  It was about 100 yards away at this time.  I pulled off the road to get a better look because it was very unique looking.  It looked kind of like a flying wing, with no tail and no propeller, with a slightly raised fuselage in the center.  Golden tan on the bottom and off white on the top, dull with no reflection in the clear desert sun.  No markings that I could see.  I don&#39;t remember seeing any windows, but have an impression of a darker area near the front where you would expect windows.  It was somewhat larger than a piper aircraft, and had pronounced fins on the wing tips.    When I got out of my truck it was not readily in sight.  From the slowness of it I expected to see it right above me.  My son pointed it out traveling East above Twentynine Palms and climbing, already about 3 miles away.  Very fast.  I heard no sound from this craft whatsoever when it turned and accellerated.  It passed out of sight in seconds.  Visibility-unlimited.<n>

My son noticed two pulsing bright white objects approximately one mile away.  They were located low on the horizon and were less than four inches apart when meaured at arms length.  The lights emitted charateristics not common to any aircraft or object previously known to us.  The light was circular with a definite edge, not diffused. We were not able to see any form or shape of the object emitting the lights.  The lights were arranged horizontally, pulsing on and off  but not at the same time.  Alternately, the lights would pulse vertically, diagonally and then return to the horizontal.  This was repeated with no apparent pattern.  When we would move, the lights would move in the same direction.  The objects seemed to move slowly across the horizon then away from us, leaving in a rapid fashion.  As they moved away, they continued to pulsate, sometimes closely together, and other times far apart.  All at once, they disappeared.  We were both very excited/scared for a few hours after this incident occurred, and had a rough time sleeping that night.<n>

I also noticed an airplane circling the sky in that area it went east and coming from the south was another airplane with another plane beside it circling.  i lost track of the moving light while watch theplanes. about 3-5 mins later after the planes were out of site looking south i seen 2 more lights one foollowing the first moving norteast.  this time i wasn&#39;t going to loose sigth of them.  but watching them for about 15 secs and they just went out or dissapeared.  the lights looked like moving stars except stars don&#39;t move like that.<n>

I stopped the car, and watched it go up for at least 30-40 seconds, and then it just disappeared from sight.

It was 8:30 pm and it was slightly southeast of gratis, OH. It is very cloudy and it kept vanishing into the clouds. It moved extremely slow. It was triangular and had a light on each corner. It had 3 more lights in the center. Two of the outer lights flashed alternately with one of the inner lights. The ufo had a glow around the edge that made its shape contrast against the sky. I went in to get a camera. I went back out at 8:45 and it was to far northward to get a picture.<n>

Observed lights crossing a few miles ahead moving from west to east. Assumed that it was a commercial aircraft making approach to Memphis airport. After traveling about 3 to 5 miles, the shoulder of the highway widened, allowing a better view of the eastern sky. Observed a black triangle with white lights near each tip and a red light in the center. Object was estimated to be 300 yards from the highway at an altitude of 4 to 5 hundred feet. It was moving Northeast at a speed slower than traffic on I-55. Two witnesses observed object for approx 10 minutes until it slowly passed out of sight behind the treeline. NO sound was noticed, however the vehicle was never stopped to listen for noise. Sighting was not very exciting to view. Observers were amazed at how much like the computer generated models from televisions program recreations of past sightings. Witnesses were a police officer and an accounting clerk(! Husband and Wife) Husband had 20/20 vision and is former military, familiar with aircraft types.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wife was driving as husband rode in front passenger seat. Husband assumed that it was a commercial aircraft and the appearance was a trick of light and shadow created by the landing lights. Made comment to wife to the effect, &#34;That&#39;s what these people have been seeing&#34;. Wife commented, &#34;How fast do commercial aircraft fly, because we are going 70 mph and we are passing it&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  PD))<n>

It is not a joke.  It is an experience that I had several years ago.  I am not sure of the exaxt date or time,I only know I have been living where I am now for 5 years and it would have been one to two years prior.  Something on the news today got me thinking of it again and I browsed on the internet and found your site.  It looked a credible site so I thought that I would share this with you to see if anyone had experienced anything similair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a sighting.  Rather, I was fast asleep in bed in the middle of the night when a voice boomed through my mind and sat me bolt up right.  The voice only said a few words.  Something to the effect of &#39;Earthlings we come to live in peace on your planet, we mean no harm&#39;  I have ocassionally experienced procognitive dreams.  This was like nothing I had previously experienced in dreams or cognition.  The power of that voice as I said moved me from fast asleep to sitting bolt upright against the wall with it still echoing in my mind.  I kept a lookout on the news to see if anything about ufo was reported.  During that week there were some sightings on the news, the sightings may have been in a couple of different countries.  I cannot remember whether they were in France or Japan, one of them was about something that made a bang and streaked across the sky.  It sounded as if one had exploded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, please do not treat this as a hoax.

I was camped out about 12 miles south east of Apache Junction , up in the foot hills . It was a heavy over cast night with occasional heavy rain , I camped on the top of a ridge so as to not get caught in a flash flood . At 2:45 AM I was awoke by the thud, thud, thud of a choppers rotor . I sat up and out of the NNE direction ,about 1/4 mi. I could see a chopper with a rotating red light , coming straight at me . because I was on a ridge, I was at the same level as it was comming down the vally next to the ridge. The shocker was that it was following a black object that was smaller then the chopper and they were about 40 ft off the ground . The black object made no noise and I could not determine the shape , it was like looking at a blacker then black moving hole . When they went by at about 25 yards from me I noticed that the following chopper was a CIVILIAN not military chopper . The chopper had a two tone paint job, white on light gray or blue with a red rotating light on the under side. The chopper was about 50 yards behind the object and I watched as they flew by me and across Hwy. 60 , at about 35-40 MPH, heading SSW .<n>

I24 at mile marker 67 I noticed an orange light in the sky (like a security light),but it was to high on the horizon to be a ground level light.(this is while i was driving the interstate!)I glanced at the light again and it went out(Just one light)I looked shortly again and while I was watching it reappeared. no big deal Fort Cambell is just up the road 30 mi.probably just choppers on maneuvers using landing lights(see it all the time (but never with orange lights))I looked over again and there was 2 lights ,  looked at the highway looked back again,and there was 3 lights( all bright orange and reflecting against the cloud cover which was very low this night!) As i looked there looked to be something attatching them together like a silver thread or ribbon. and while I watched they one by one went out in the reversed order that they came on(4,3,2,1 bottom to the original(the top))This had my attention now so I began to look for an exit to put my 18 wheeler on (to be safley out of traffic)as I was looking for an exit I noticed that it had completly dissappeared! as I gave this thought the first light reappeared!(miles traveled at this time about7or8(it seemed to be moving or keeping upwith me because it never changed positions in the window ,Just over the passenger mirror)I found an exit to pull my rig over and got out of the truck ,shut off the engine for silence went around the truck and their it was ! 1 light ,shortly followed by another,shortly followed by another!the lights were perfectly round and seemed to cascade from each otherthey seemed to have a thread or silver ribbon(like smoke,only smoke would dissapate,this did not)I noticed that the light was very brillliant and reflected against the low cloud celing.and caused the reflection againt the clouds as that of a strobe light(kind of like a lantern that is hanging from a peg and rocking back and forth on the peg).The lights went out again and I got back in the truck and proceded down the interstate. Then They began to come on back again. ! At this time I thought I would comfirm the siting with others truckers so I got on the c.b. and asked the other trucks to take a look to the west and tell me what they see!. But at the very instant I keyed the mic. the lights dissappeared and this was the end of the sighting(it was like the thing wanted me to notice it but not to allert nobody else(crazy Huh!!)(but there was a car that pulled off the road to observe)before I got off the exit)there was no loud noise that you would associate helicopters with no sound of anything like an engine .<n>

We both saw the object while we were some distance, out of sight from each other. We could see a dark gray or black triangle, or wedge line moving in a southwest direction.  The rest of the craft was much harder to see.  It seemed that the object may have been reflecting the clouds above it.  The craft was in view for maybe 5 mins.<n>
2/1/98 01:00|Newbury Park|CA|Chevron|10 min|It was the largest thins I've ever seen well over a mile in length, and it hovered near the navel base.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32633.html|86|ndxe199802| It was the largest things I&#39;ve ever seen well over a mile in length, and it hovered near the navel base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I just reported a craft I just saw I thought I might as well report the only other one I&#39;ve seen.  It was appx. 1am and I was returning my girlfriend home after a date.  I had just exited the 101 freeway at Wendy Dr. and noticed a group of cars stopped in the middle of the street, as I too came to a stop I looked up and could not believe what I saw.  To this day it is still the largest non natural thing I have ever seen.  It was sort of a triangular shape ( not with equal sides ) and it had a cigar shapped pod at 2 of the chopped off corners.   It was a greenish blue color with the pods being a darker blue or purple.  And it was huge, there is a mountain raned between this town and the pacific ocean ( only 7 miles as the crow flies ) and this thing dwarfed the mountains.  This group of people watched the craft for about 10 minutes it just hovered there in the sky.  I stepped back to my car to turn it off and when I turned around it was gone.  Everyone just got in there cars and left.  My girlfriend was very shaken.  I droped her off and began to think, not to far from where I was there was a very large open area used for cattel grazing.  Just for the hell of it I drove out there to see if I could see any thing else. I rember arriving at this area, now this couldn&#39;t of been later than 1:30 at this point.  The next thing I remember I an turned around driving away from this area and it&#39;s after 3:00 am.  I remember thinking that took longer than it should have. I guess I had one of the now popular missing time experances. The next day I checked the local newspapers and there was no mention of what we had seen.  Just as a note all this took place with in 15 to 20 miles of Point Magu.  This is the Pacific Missle test range where they devloped the walleye, sparrow and tomahawk missles along with who knows what else.  The craft was almost over the base. it was litteraly over a mile in size.  This is the really strange part, if you get a copy of Wham-o giant comics from 1967 on the back inside cover are a few stories of ufo encounters, one of them is about the same craft.  Also there is a artists drawing of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

As the monument was closed, and gated at that hour of the night, we drove about a mile down the highway, and pulled off, and down through a series of small hills, to a riverbank, to car-camp until the morning.  We had been at rest for perhaps half-an-hour, or so, when we noticed bright white lights moving across the southern horizon.  We sat on the tail-gate of the truck, and watched as these lights seemed to almost bounce around the horizon, from east to west, and back at a rate of speed that was almost unbelieveable.  The lights would go from sitting still to extreem speed, and then come to a complete halt, just as quick.  After watching these lights for fifteen or twenty minutes, my friend went to sleep, and I was left sitting up watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly, thereafter, I looked directly above us, and saw what appeared to be a triangle-three points of light, rotating clockwise, and surrounding it a hexagon-eights points of light moving counter-clockwise.  To say the least I was spooked, and only watched these lights for a moment.  The lights were not extremely bright, but had the brightness similar of stars.  Had it not been for the motion and covering up of other starlight (shadow of the shapes) I might have put it off to actually be a constellation.  I don&#39;t have a clue as to what we saw (man-made, or otherwise) but am sure that what I did see was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several months later, back at home in Georgia, my friend and I saw a program that had footage of similar horizon lights.  Both of us got a cold chill upon seeing the footage, and we both exclaimed loudly that that was what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
