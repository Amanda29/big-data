I was very young but remember the event vividly what I do remember of it.  Our house was located in a rural Vermont community called Walden.  The road I lived on had a railroad trestle and our house was gray.  There was a dirt road that ran beside the house running around the property to another house where an elderly lady lived.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One spring evening, I was walking down that road and saw a large silver cigar shaped but larger in the center object fly by right next to me in the field by the road.  It was completely silent and very large.  It was moving incredibly fast and almost floated by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the object passed, the next thing I remember is waking up in the barn on our property lying in the hay.  I had no memory of how I got there and was awakened by my mother who had been looking for me for several hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t tell her about what I had seen or anyone else until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in my 50&#39;s now and the memory of what happened has haunted me my entire life.  I&#39;m hoping someone else saw something around that time period, so I have some sort of confirmation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in May 1964 is approximate.

This is something I have needed to talk about for a long time.  The event happened as follows: Clear spring day me and friend working on car  (no drugs or acho involved) and I broke a spark plug.  We had to go into town (approx 7 miles away).  I lived out in a very unpopulated area next to a Boy Scout Wilderness Camp.  Houses are several miles apart.  On the way into town about a mile and a half from my house I turn right to take the road to the Hiway into town and there sitting on the left side of the road, a road I drove at least twice a day for the past several years was a UFO.  We pulled up alongside and stopped, it was huge.  70-90 feet across 25-35 high.  Color:  dark gray, not shiny but almost a dull or parkerized type finish, smooth but not shiny smooth.  Typical of a nitrided or titaimum applied finished metal.  Shape.  Clearly saucer like with rounded edges and viewing ports (round) at the top.  Lite smoke or steam from the grass was drifting up around the UFO.  The UFO seemed to be bathed in a glow, even tho this was around noon on a clear day.  The glow was almost ultraviolet, it seemed to be glowing around the edges.  We stopped and looked at it, it being about 30 feet from the truck, then we &#34;got the hell out of there&#34;.  We went down the road for about 3/4 of a mile then we went back and it was gone.  We got out and there was nothing but a large depression in the grass where it had set and the ground was warm to the touch.  As the days went by, I noticed the grass died in a large round area where the UFO had sat down.I have thought of this many times since 1964 and every once in a great while I see the guy who was with me, we have never talked about this to anyone since it happened.  But I feel its time to tell what I saw!<n>

We were on our way to buy some worms and minnows to use for fishing, when we noticed three silver objects flying in formation parallel to us in a southward direction just on the other side of the hills East of us.  As we followed the road which is very &#34;curvey&#34; we would lose sight of these objects and than see them again as the road changed.  We heard nothing other than the sound of our car&#39;s engine.  When we got to the bait shop in Woodbury, we asked the owner if he had heard or seen anything.  He had not.  We returned to Hardwick and asked a variety of people if they had heard or seen anything in the sky.  They all scoffed at our story.  I have never reported this to anyone except my family and friends primarily as both my friend and I were ashamed to admit that although we were riding in a convertable with the top down and had an 8MM movie camera under the front seat, neither of us remembered to use the camera.  Vermont in those days and even today is not overflown by many aircraft and to see something in the Vermont sky is an &#34;Event&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

When we got outside there was a huge round pulsating ship that was hovering over the block I lived on.  Lights were emitted from this ship shooting down to the ground and it looked like objects were falling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked down the street and virtually everyone on my block was standing on their porch watching this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as quickly as it came it shot off at high speeds from hovering to superspeed and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I awoke to the sound of my mother screeming, go away, go away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mom was opening a drawer looking for a gun, it was a .22 that grandmother kept hidden away. The house was shaking and the object appeared to be very close to the top of the roof. I was about 5 years old and I sleep with my mother, so I jumped out of bed and ran to mom, she pushed me away and kept looking through the drawer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole house was awake by now and the windows were vibrating, there was a low humming sound coming from over the house. The noise stopped and everything went back to normal for that night but we would be visited many times after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object that my whole family witnessed was round on the bottom with lights that circled in to directions, yellow, orange, and green. It stopped right over us as my aunt, brother, cousin, and myself were walking accross the road to go home from grandmothers. It moved when we moved, it could be gone in a second and back just as fast. It terrified us for years and left my mother scared for her life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now live in WV and my children and I have seen a newer version of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has the smooth look of the ship from Flight of the navagator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It rolls back and forth through the clouds as if it were playing with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has a silver color and the sun reflects off of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have visiters that we know, but what or who they are is our guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

I woke up in the middle of night and found myself alone in the house!  It was dark.  I looked out the window and into the neighbor&#39;s kitchen.  Saw a being there, facing my neighbor, and the neighbor was seated.  The being had something in his hand, and when he jutted it toward my neighbor, my neighbor jerked, like being shocked.  I gasped.  The being immediately turned and looked at me.  I ran and did the only thing I could think of...I tried to hide under my bed.  But the bed was low to the ground and I could only get my head and shoulders under it.  It was too heavy for me to lift.  I was terrified.  I waited and then heard soft footsteps on the wood floor.  The being was in the house.  It came to the door and I believe stood in the door looking at me.  I fainted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have written in detail a number of times, only to never hear back from anyone.  There are other events too:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. My mother had an encounter, possibly that same night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. My mother saw a cigar-shaped craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. My mother and I were on a trip together and both lost about 2 hours of time on the trip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. I had dental x-rays that showed a piece of metal in the front of my mouth below the teeth, in the gums.  A few years later another x-ray was taken that showed nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5. I saw 5 football-shaped craft with stubby wings, flying in a circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6. I saw 5 &#34;stars&#34; high in the sky one night in Montana.  There were 4 in corners and one in the center.  They moved together in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7. Another incident that defies category.  I was camping in a car overnight.  Everyone in the campground had seemingly disappeared.  There were cars and campers but no people.  Fog, I felt drugged, something was outside.  The car lights seemed dim and yellowish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8. &#34;weather balloon&#34; hovering over my schoolyard.  It appeared to be a spherical paper-white craft (unlike any weather balloon, but that is what we were told).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

5/1/64 22:00|Orangevale|CA|Light|Five minutes|Chased by a single light - Sacramento, CA 1964|6/18/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37379.html|9|ndxe196405| Chased by a single light - Sacramento, CA 1964<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime in May, 1964 I had driven with a friend to a somewhat rural spot near my home. We were both 18 yrs old. It was probably around 10 p.m. This area was like a very large open field; today it is probably built over with houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove off the paved road (two lanes) onto a dirt road and maybe an eighth of a mile further on the dirt road went down into a large natural bowl, some 20 feet below the upper part of the land. From where we stopped we couldn&#39;t see any houses and no evidence at all of civilization. It was a typical Sacramento landscape of oaks and scrub brush. I remember that it was a moonless night.I turned off the engine and we sat and began telling ghost stories, scaring ourselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But after a few minutes my friend said, with great fear, &#34;Let&#39;s get the hell out of here.&#34; I was very scared, too and immediately turned on the engine of my VW bug. As we started forward, looking to my right toward my friend, I saw a light outside the window, at a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was round and I thought it must be a motorcycle or a car with one headlight burned out. It began to move as we did. The light began to come down in a steady swooping motion as if it would intersect the dirt road where we were heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I practically screamed to my friend &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34; She saw it and got even more scared, told me to hurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I floored it, got to the other side of the &#39;bowl&#39; and drove up the hill to the top. On the top, on the dirt road I drove as fast as I could, maybe 30 mph and when I looked in the mirror this light was chasing us. It looked like it was about ten feet above the road, maybe higher. It was still the size of a headlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In just a minute or two I was at the paved road. The light disappeared and we sped away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, during daylight, I went back to the scene to try to figure out what had happened. Was it a motorcycle, a car or what? I stopped my car where we had been the night before. Looking toward the hillside where the light had originated I saw a small creek not too far away but the creek basin was loaded with mounds of smooth rocks left over from old dredging operations; these mounds were easily 8 ft tall and extended many feet across to the hill. The hillside itself was covered with scrub oak. No road, no path; nothing that would have made it possible for any motor vehicle to have so smoothly swooped down towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I seem to remember that next to the dirtroad where we escaped there were telephone lines, poles. I had wondered if the light had been ball lightning, but the weather was clear, no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my friend nor myself ever had an explanation for this curious and scary event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both college students at the time. Neither of us thought at all about UFOs (except for science fiction) or the paranormal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>
