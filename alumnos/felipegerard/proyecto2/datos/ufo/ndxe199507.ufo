At 21:24 I noticed a small, bright, diffuse disc in the sky over the ocean seaward of a point of land up the coast from us.  I estimated its elevation with my hand, finding that the disc was just over the tip of my middle finger when my outstretched hand was held vertically at arm&#39;s length with the heel of<n> <n><n> the palm placed on the sealevel horizon: roughly 18 cm at 60 cm distance, or ~.3 radian or ~17-18 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disc was circular, quite bright and pearly white, with no trace of color that we could see. I&#39;d estimate its total brightness as equal to Venus at its brightest; the sky was still fairly light, and no stars<n> <n><n> were visible.  The object was definitely extended rather than point-like.  At a guess, it was three resolution-units across: perhaps 6 arc minutes, or a small but significant fraction of the width of the full<n> <n><n> moon.  No internal detail was noticeable, but there seemed to be some limb darkening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking that the object might be a balloon (many years ago I saw a Skyhook balloon just before sunset, and the appearance was somewhat similar), I stood against a light pole and observed its position relative to another pole.  No movement was perceptible over a period of a few minutes.  We then approached a Spanish family sitting on a bench on the promenade and asked if they knew what the object was.  They didn&#39;t, but said that they had been watching it for a while and it hadn&#39;t seemed to move. (Nobody around seemed to be more than mildly curious about the object)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for a few more minutes until approximately 21:35, during which time the object didn&#39;t move or change appearance, and then returned to our room in the Melia. I got my compass from the suitcase, went onto the balcony, and tried to locate the object. By that time, 21:42, at the approximate location of the object (as estimated from its azimuth relative to the point of land mentioned above and elevation measured by the hand-at-arms-length method) there was a bright star-like object redder, fainter, and more point-like than the object we had been watching.  The magnetic bearing read off the compass (which was likely affected to some extent by the steel structure of the hotel) was due east to within a couple of degrees.  My wife, who was helping me make this measurement, was doubtful that the object I was sighting on was the one seen earlier, due to its considerably different appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as a former technical intelligence analyst.

At first I thought it was just one of those foil birthday balloons that you can get from the grocery store and someone had just let it go. after about 2 minutes of watching it I called it to my friends attention (he was driving) so he started to glance at it while he was driving, then we stopped at a stoplight and he was able to get a full look at it through the moonroof.  We both started to mention that it was definitely strange how it seemed to be following us.  About 7 minutes later I was still watching it when we were just about to arrive at my house (about a city block away) when this one silver thing actually met up with 2 other ones and they began to circle around each other (somewhat like how my sister used to braid her hair).  I then watched these objects for another couple of minutes, I then decided that I had to get my father, so I turned around and took my eyes off of it for a moment and yelled throught the front door to get him to come out and look, I then looked up in the air to continue watching them and they dissappeared.  Please keep in mind that the date I put down for the actual encounter may not be the actual date it ocurred, it was a long time ago and it happened late in the summer of 1995 as I was a senior and it was still warm outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As the three lights travelled across the sky, they suddenly broke up and the one on the bottom crossed over at a right angle and suddenly sped off between the two others at tremendous speed.

I was heading towaard the Army Depot on my way back home. I saw what I thought at the time to be orange Christmas lights. I thought it was odd since it was still July. I continued home still looking at the lights and noticed they were quite a ways away, above the Army Depot. I got home and immediately grabbed my binoculars and told my mom what I saw. While we were looking at it my grandfather came out to have a cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was above the mountains all the way across the valley, approx. 16 miles away due west, from my house. We/I could not see it&#39;s shape. It just had approx. 12 orange lights in a south to north manner. It looked about 3 inches in the sky and it being 16 miles away means it was huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first started watching it, it was stationary.  Then it started moving north. It&#39;s northern most light would dissapear and another light would appear at it&#39;s southern end, meaning it was rotating while moving. It moved about 6 inches in the sky then stopped, but it continued rotating. It stayed there about 2 mins and then started rotating and moving the other way, south. It continued about 3 inches in the sky then started to decend, this is how we knew it was above the mountains and it was also testimony to it&#39;s size. It continued to decend behind the mountains until we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Streaked.|11/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/000/S00628.html|43|ndxe199507| Mr. Peter Davenport<n> <n><n> National UFO Reporting Center<n> <n><n> PO Box 45623, University Station<n> <n><n> Seattle, WA 98145<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Along with my report, I have enclosed a hand-written report from Ben Kwong who witnessed the same UFO&#39;s with me on Saturday, July 22, 1995.  Mr. Kwong is an engineer and lives in San Jose.  I did not get a written report from his 12-year-old son, Michael, but will send it to you if he writes one.  I believe that the reports from Mr. Kwong and myself should be thorough enough.  The only difficulty in writing our reports would be regarding the order in which we saw everything happen.  This is due to the fact that we saw up to five UFO&#39;s (four to five in the air at once).  We were not always looking at the same UFO at the same time.  Since there were several UFO&#39;s in the sky at once during our sighting, we didn&#39;t always focus on the same UFO&#39;s.  Anyway, the following is my accounting of what we saw.  Also, please note that I may have incorrectly given you the time of the sighting as being between 10:30 AM and 11:00 to 11:15.  The time was between 9:30 AM to 10:00 or later.  It was definitely for at least a half hour, maybe an hour (I began teaching my tennis lesson at 9:00 and noticed the first UFO at about 9:30.  When I arrived at home, 2 min. away, it was about 11:00 but I don&#39;t recall watching the UFO&#39;s for more than 45 min. to an hour at the very most -very minimum was a half hour).<n> <n><n> <n><n> To whom it may concern:<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday, July 22, 1995 at 9:30 AM I, along with Michael Kwong (age 12), and his father (Ben Kwong), had a UFO&#39;s sighting which lasted for at least a half hour (to 10:15 AM or later) over the sky of Santa Clara, CA, from the Marina Playa Apt. complex tennis courts located at 3500 Granada Ave. and Lawrence Expressway (El Camino is a close cross street of Lawrence Expressway).  The sighting first began at 9:30 AM when I was teaching Michael Kwong a tennis lesson.  Michael was practicing his serve and was tossing the ball in the air.  I looked at the ball toss as it went up and noticed that the moon was out.  I also noticed an object by the moon which I took to be a star and appeared stationary like a star.  I looked at the object again and thought it might be moving slowly.  The object appeared to be moving slowly at a very high altitude, perhaps just within the atmosphere or at least at a very high altitude.  I spoke to Michael and began to say things out loud like, &#34;What is that?  What the heck is that?  It&#39;s not an airplane.&#34;  Michael looked up at it as well.  I stopped the lesson out of curiosity to watch this object.  I walked over to the fence and yelled to Ben Kwong, who was sitting in his car reading the newspaper.  I asked him to come out of his car to get a look a the object so we could figure out what it was.  He stood down below the tennis courts, looking up at the object as I and Michael were too.  Then Mr. Kwong came up to the court and all three of us continued to watch the object.  The object looked completely round and whitish in appearance (perhaps due to the altitude or even entering the atmosphere?).  The object slowly moved away from the moon and then curved a slowly headed back toward its original position, and then it appeared to hover and then start to move slowly again.  We watched this object for a few minutes and then we saw another object which looked had the same appearance as the first object.  I don&#39;t remember if Mr. Kwong or I spotted the next object first (Mr. Kwong&#39;s son is near sighted, so he had a harder time seeing).  I believe we watched until finally we saw at least four of the whitish objects in the sky.  At one point it appeared like they were hovering and moving slowly in four corners of the sky.  When they were closer to us, they appeared metallic, sort of a metallic, silver to silver-blue in color.  When they were higher up they initially appeared to be more whitish in color.  Anyway, we continued watching several of these objects as they moved slowly, stop, and move in bizarre paths, unlike airplanes.  They were very high but left no exhaust trail.  They moved and changed direction, unlike weather balloons or satellites.  At some point, after watching the (I&#39;ll call them silver, or metallic-silver/blue) objects, Ben and I noticed a red UFO, completely round like the others, but a metallic-red in color.  We then both observed a silver UFO and the red UFO in a staggered formation, with the silver UFO leading in front to the left of the red UFO (doing what appeared to be the same speed).  We noticed another red object at a lower altitude slowly moving up into the sky (not metallic, but more of an all orange to orange-red in color).  I didn&#39;t, nor did Ben, take much notice of this object as it slowly went up into the sky.  It could have been a balloon and didn&#39;t have the metallic look of the other objects which were very high in the sky.  At some point, the silver UFO&#39;s would just disappear from sight.  I don&#39;t know where they went, maybe out into the upper atmosphere,  Then sometimes one would come back into view.  The red UFO really caught my attention next.  Ben had lost sight of it (you really had to &#34;track&#34; with your eyes without looking away from the UFO&#39;s or it would take a few seconds to find some of them again).  Anyway, I told Ben that I could see the red UFO again.  I saw it moving very slowly up in the sky and then it suddenly shot through the sky at an amazing speed.  I said, &#34; There it goes! There it goes! Look at it go!&#34;  Ben kept saying that he couldn&#39;t find it.  We watched some of the other UFO&#39;s until it seemed that there were no more to see (they had all gone, but we didn&#39;t see them leave).  We had about given up on seeing any more UFO&#39;s up there when I caught sight of the first or perhaps another red UFO.  I told Ben to look up as I pointed to its location.  Ben said he could see it.  Suddenly the red UFO shot across the sky at an amazing speed, much much faster than any jet or rocket could fly (we were watching regular passenger jets crawl across the sky every once in awhile as we watched the UFO&#39;s.  The passenger jets, and some jets which may have been military from Moffet Field, were at a much lower altitude than the UFO&#39;s, a testimony to the speed of the UFO&#39;s).  I kept pointing at the red UFO as it sped across the sky.  We were both in awe, and were both speaking out loud in our amazement of the speed of the object (&#34;There is no way that can be a jet.  Nothing is that fast.  Look at it go.&#34; -etc., etc.).  As I was moving my finger across the sky, tracking the object (in what would take a jet several minutes to travel, I followed the object across the sky in less than ten seconds.  It was still at a very high altitude as well), Ben said he could see a silver UFO right next to the red one.  I said I only could see the red one, but just before the red UFO completely went out of sight, I could see another UFO, a silver one, very close to the red UFO or joined to it.  We were then completely convinced that we saw UFO&#39;s, things which are not man-made.  We didn&#39;t see any more UFO&#39;s for a few minutes, so I resumed my tennis lesson, although I had a very hard time teaching.  We stopped a few minutes later.  I looked up again and saw one lone silver UFO (up so high that it appeared white).  It was hovering and then started to move slowly again.  I told Ben and Michael that there was another one up there.  At this point, we already saw the most exciting part of our sighting (the red UFO &amp; silver UFO shooting off).  Our necks were tired from the strain of looking up, almost straight up at times for over a half hour (possibly an hour or more, as Ben stated, although I can&#39;t be sure).  We really didn&#39;t take much notice of this UFO and we didn&#39;t see it disappear from sight, but it did a couple of minutes later.  We parted between 10:30 and 11:00 AM.  I went back to my apartment and called some TV stations to see if anyone had reported anything (I really thought SOMEONE would have witnessed what we saw and would report it.  The TV station personnel said nobody else called in, plus they seemed rather skeptical of my story.  That annoyed me a bit.  I then called the Air Force in Santa Clara County.  They switched me from command post to command post.  I gave my story up to three times perhaps.  They asked me at what time I saw the UFO&#39;s, took my story, and then said they would transfer me to another command post and to just tell them the same thing (that I told the first people I contacted).  Finally, the Air Force gave me the phone # of the National UFO Reporting Agency (for whom I am writing this report).  I, after giving my story to Peter Davenport, was made aware of the fact that another person in California reported seeing up to five UFO&#39;s on the same day I had my sighting.  This was my first time every seeing anything like this in my life (I&#39;m 29-years-old, teach tennis and am also a computer specialist teaching elementary school.  Ben, like I said, is an engineer.  So I believe we are both credible people).<n> <n><n> <n><n> End of Report<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m waiting to get my grandmother&#39;s written report of her two sightings and my mother&#39;s report of a sighting (these all happened many years ago).  I was afraid to mention their sightings because I thought it might make my sighting less credible.  I indeed immediately felt I had something to share with them and also wanted them to retell of their sightings as well.  My grandmother&#39;s sightings are of particular interest to me since she saw a UFO in the Almaden area of San Jose, CA some 58 years ago.  I teach in this area and my ancestors first settled there in the 1860&#39;s.  Someone emailed me who lives in Almaden to tell me she and her daughter &amp; 14-year-old son had sightings in Almaden.  She said that her son saw one hovering over the school that I teach at.  This was before she even knew that I teach at this school!  Anyway, I don&#39;t know how many people you can believe on the Internet re. sightings, but I know what I saw, and that&#39;s good enough for me.  The only other strange thing I observed in my life was described to me by someone on the Internet as being &#34;ball lightening&#34; or something like it.  I was twelve-years-old at the time.  I don&#39;t know if that is UFO related or not.  Is it just a normal phenomenon.  It happened indoors.  It went under a cot.  The cot shot straight up in the air, about five feet, and there was nothing underneath the cot!  The object was indefinable in shape, just grayish/white, and swirling.  It seemed to react to me as I entered the room and skimmed across the floor.  Any ideas?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,<n> <n><n> William D. Bailey<n> <n><n> wbailey@cello.gina.calstate.edu<n>

Myself, my father-in-law,his friend and his friend&#39;s grandson. We were returning home from a Phillies-Cardinals baseball game. We were traveling south on I 95 approximately 2-3 miles before the I 476 interchange (known locally as the &#34;Blue Route&#34;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were traveling south on I 95 we all noticed a very bright light directly ahead of us on the horizon. Because of our proximity to the Philadelphia International airport, I believe we all assumed it was plane approaching for a landing at the airport. After about thirty seconds I remember thinking to myself,why hasn&#39;t the incoming plane closed in distance on us? It seemed we weren&#39;t closing the gap. (which I found strange because we were heading directly toward it. And it initally appeared to be coming toward us.) About 15-20 seconds later the gap between us seemed like it was finally closing. I then commented to the child in the group, &#34;look here comes a plane in for a landing&#34;. Right after that the object shot off to left at an incredible speed on an approximate 60 degree angle. It was totally out of sight in a second or two. We all imediately rolled down our windows and looked up to try and track it. However, it was gone. One of the other witnesses said, &#34;Did you see that? It was like it was yanked on a string! That isn&#39;t anything from this world!&#34;   I also remember was thinking to myself how bright the light was compared to what I remember normal landing lights on a plane to be. It was a brighter and whiter glow than you would normally see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A final observation. There is a Boeing facility within a mile or two of where the sighting occurred. Was this some sort of experimental craft? I don&#39;t know... If it was, I can&#39;t rationalize why they would be testing it in such a densely populated area over heavily traveled interstate highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, but can easily be confirmed because of the baseball game.

I went with a couple friends of mine to a local lookout area. I was 19 at the time.  We got to the very secluded place (Beauty Spot, Erwin, TN, 36°07&#39;03.2&#34;N 82°19&#39;59.0&#34;W) and sat on the tailgate of my truck watching the sky till it got dark.  Not long after darkness fell, I noticed a red star in the sky that was &#34;wiggling.&#34;  By that, I mean moving almost imperceptibly back and forth.  I watched this for several minutes trying to decide whether the motion was real or not.  Once I decided that it was, I elbowed my friend and said, &#34;Hey man, look at that.&#34;  As soon as I did this, as though it cued the event, the light rushed down out of the sky and grew as it approached us. It came to within a hundred yards or so of us.  One of my friends yelled and ran.  The other of my friends and myself stared in wonder at the light for about 2 minutes.  It was very difficult to determine many details about it, but I wi! ll list what I observed: 1) It was an absolutely brilliant red sphere, it lit up the whole damn valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) It seemed perfectly spherical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) It was ~50 feet in diameter. This is a rough estimate as I wasn&#39;t really sure how close it was to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4) It emitted no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, we watched this, one of my most vivid memories of my friend is when I looked over at him and saw him in full rictus bathed in that red light. After the 2 minutes or so had passed, the light lazily floated away from us for a few seconds and then shot up with unimaginable speed. I saw sparks fly off of the light as it passed through the atmosphere. Then, it winked out and was gone. The take off, escape from Earth, and winking out may have taken only a single second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the &#34;event&#34; my friend and I got into the truck and drove around a mile down the road and found our friend. Then I drove home and no one said a word. We were all totally silent the whole way. In shock, I guess. Many, many times I tried to bring this up with my friend who was there, and he would always acknowledge that it happened and then quickly change the subject. If I pressed, he would get angry and clam up. He passed away in 2006 and we never really had a chance to talk about it. My other friend, the one that ran away, I met again only a few times as we weren&#39;t very close. It was basically the same thing with her, evasive, unsure, and eventually angry if I tried to discuss it. I noticed her at a high school football game about 4 years ago and tried to broach the subject, but she was again evasive.<n>

7/17/95 01:30|Holland County|AR|Changing|45 min.|Driving back from a roadtrip we saw a bright light ahead of us that seemed to be morphing into different shapes and eminating energy.|6/21/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13115.html|60|ndxe199507| Driving back from a roadtrip we saw a bright light ahead of us that seemed to be morphing into different shapes and eminating energy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was about 5 of us heading home to Memphis from St. Louis on Sunday morning around 1:30 a.m. and i was looking out the front window from the back seat when i saw what i thought was a star shining abnormally bright.  i told my friend, who was driving, to look and she agreed with me that it was way too big and bright to be a star.  everyone else in the car was asleep, and i didn&#39;t want to disturb them if it was nothing.  i made her pull over off the highway at a closed down gas station so we could get out and have a better look.  there were no other lights around and we were in the middle of nowhere arkansas, so it made our inspection easier. it seemed to grow bigger almost like it was headed in our direction, and eventually we could see that it was moving towards us at a consistent speed.  once it was almost above us it just stopped and stayed in the same place for a good while.  during this time is when we noticed that it looked as if it was rotating while morphing into other shapes.  it would go from a sphere, to a diamond, and then to a cigar shape.  it kept moving from shape to shape the whole time, but there was no sound. after about 7 minutes or so of this we saw what looked to be tiny particles of energy or something to that effect pulsating off the object, only to disappear when it got out far enough from it.  the energy was yellowish-orange, and the object itself was just about the same in color.  we stood there and watched it for a little bit before it occured to me that i should try and wake everybody else up, and also that i just happened to have my camera.  i raced to the car and tried to get everyone up by yelling excitedly and literally shaking them, but for some odd reason no one even stirred.  i was afraid that whatever it was would disappear before i could snap a photo so i gave up on them quickly and grabbed my camera instead.  i wasn&#39;t sure if the pictures would even come out right so i thought just in case i would take some with the flash on and some with the flash off.  i took! two wit hout it first, then i proceeded to take two with the flash on.  i wanted to show it&#39;s size in comparison to the moon so when the pictures were developed you could get some sort of an idea.  right after i took the first picture with the flash on the object flashed back at us with a bright white light.  then i took the other one and the same thing happened!  it was so crazy.  after gawking at this thing for a total of about 30 minutes we decided that we had to get back on the road.  we were headed in the general direction of the object, so we could keep our eye on it while we were driving.  i looked out one of the side windows and i saw another one that had appeared out of nowhere beside us.  it was a litle bit smaller than the first one, but it changed shapes and eminated energy like the other did.  after driving for about 15 minutes or so i saw the 2nd one flash a big flash, and then all of a sudden it was gone.  i told my friend what had just happened so we assumed the other one would do something soon as well.  it did the exact same thing about a minute later, and it too was gone just like that.  i made my friend pull over on the side of the highway so i could take another picture of the place where the object was in conjunction with the moon again.  for proof i guess.  the next day i took my film to be developed not thinking anything would happen. i had marked special instructions on the envelope stating that i wanted every picture back, even the ones that were messed up. several days later when i went to retrieve my photos, i saw pictures that turned out good, and pictures that turned out bad and blurry, but no pictures that i had taken of what i believed to be a ufo a few days before.  somebody had removed those pictures!!  i immediately checked for the negatives, and all were there except the 4 that i had taken of the object. you could even tell that the negatives had been cut. only the negative of the very last picture that i had taken that night with the moon when the ufo disappeared remained of ! that nig ht.  so now all i have is our story.<n>

We observed it coming toward us, following the road, until it was directly over our head. My friend was driving. I looked straight up at this huge craft and could see very clearly that it was not a plane or helicopter. We stopped, but it had vanished. The date was 7/16/95 @ 9:30 PM at 1785 Hwy 105 S, Boone,NC. We called the Police and the News Reporter in Boone the following day to report this sighting, but never reported it to NUFORC until now.

A light appeared out of nowhere among the stars, and began to move unlike any aircraft that I&#39;ve heard of, before retreating at extremely high speed and vanishing with a flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting occurred during the middle of summer,  and I was talking to my friend outside underneath a clear sky. I believe that it was the 15 of July, a day before my friend&#39;s birthday, although I&#39;m not completely sure. My friend was talking to me on her stomach, so she didn&#39;t see anything, but I was on my back looking at the stars. I was randomly looking around, when all of sudden this fiercly bright light appeared at a high altitude (I assume), and it sat still for a second. Then, it began to move in a tight zig-zaggish pattern, with extremely straight lines, at about the speed that you see a plane going at, or a sattelite. It paused for a bit after each movement, and then it changed direction. I then noticed that it stopped and began to grow insanely bright. Not bigger, but just brighter. Then, it sped off extremely quickly... it was like a blur of light, and left with a flash, disappearing from sight at one point in the sky. It&#39;s movements, I noticed, were extremely clean, like a hovercraft does on water, except in very clean, straight lines. This all took place within my approximation of  about ten seconds.<n>

What I saw lasted approximately 2 minutes and in no way could it have been an aircraft or meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at a friend&#39;s house in his driveway talking.  I was looking at the sky, toward the north, at around 11:30 pm.  The sky was very clear and I was looking at a group of stars that seemed to be in the shape of the little dipper, but it was neither the big or little dipper.  This grouping of stars was much smaller.  Aproximately 1/10 th the size.  As I was looking at the stars one seemed to just disappear as if sucked into the darkness.  I thought this was funny and Iblinked and kind of shook my head to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing things and when I looked up again the place were the star or so I thought was a star was just darkness.  I looked at my friend and said did you see that.  He had not seen this so we started to watch the sky in this area.  Within a minute of seeing the star or whatever it was disappear we both saw a light flash.  The light was kind of an off white color almost like the color of light produce by a house lamp.  This light was in the sky next to where the star/UFO was but the light I noticed when it flashed was quick and concentrated, not like glare you may see coming from a light source.  About a minute later we saw another flash in the same general area and of the same nature as before. This went on for about 3 minutes.  All three flashes were in the same general area according to our location.  Then the flashes stopped. My mind at this point didn&#39;t know what to really make of it at the time but I kept watching to hopefully see something else to make some sense of it.  With in a minute or two  we saw a streek in the sky of the same color light as the flashes but the streek was moving in an S-shaped pattern.  I drove home that night scared out of my whits and a little excited.  There was no aircraft in the area and nothing unusual about the night except for the light.  The light was farther away as in out of the atmoshere of the earth or right at the edge of the atmoshere.  Up until a few months ago I never really thought much of it other than I couldn&#39;t explain it.  I was watch a ! documentory on U.F.O.&#39;s and they showed one that took on this S-shaped pattern and one that seemed to become longer and then shorted as it moved.  Which if something moved in an S-shaped pattern, if seen from the right angle it would appear get shorter and longer as it moved.  I would appreciate a response and if possible some more information on how to get reports of recent sightings around the nation.<n>

7/15/95 23:00|Port-au-Prince (Haiti)||Unknown|See text|Sighting during 1995 US Army contingent during United Nations Mission in Haiti|3/23/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80468.html|70|ndxe199507| Sighting during 1995 US Army contingent during United Nations Mission in Haiti<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first of two incidents that I can tell you folks about, this event occurred during the summer and into the fall of 1995, when I was in the US Army assigned to the United Nations Mission in Haiti.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was in the US Army, I was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment S-2 and along with other soldiers in the various S shops worked the Tactical Operations Center (TOC), with rotating shifts working one of three shifts: morning shift (0600 to 1400), evening shift (1400 to 2200), and night shift (2200 to 0600).<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night (I think it was in August ’95), while working my rotation on night shift, as people often do, I had to use the bathroom which consisted of a porta-potty a minutes’ walk from the TOC.  Now, as I was in there doing my business, I was looking out of a small  window in the top of the plastic wall of the porta-potty, which was missing the plastic mesh that was supposed to keep bugs out, I notice odd lights in the sky.  The lights consisted of four diamond shaped lights parallel to the horizon, two on the top and two on the bottom.  The two on the bottom were spaced farther apart than the two on top, they didn’t change, although the colors seemed to, and which is I think what caught my attention initially.  I wondered what the hell these lights were as I finished my business and looked at them as I made my way back to the TOC to resume my station at the S2 section of the TOC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night, of course, I had another trip to the latrine, and still the lights were there.  All that night I noticed them, with one of the times I was watching them with another soldier as I told him of them, I suddenly thought to lay down to eliminate me moving inadvertently as I stood there watching them, and I noticed a few other things.  They were not stationary in the sky; they seemed to me to move very quickly around what seemed to me in the sky a specific point.  And the other thing I noticed after the soldier I was with saw it for himself; he found another one on the horizon.  After I looked at it, I returned my gaze to the one I had been looking at all night, and I noticed another one to my left on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought of it then as the one I first saw being 0 degrees, with the one my fellow soldier saw being 90 degrees to the right, and the second one I saw opposite the one he found being 270 degrees.  For shits and giggles I assumed there must be one at 180 degrees and sure enough it was there.  They all had the same four lights in the same configuration, with colors changing that if you were looking at them for a time you would notice, but not if you just glimpsed at them.  And they all moved jerkily in the sky like the first one did around a fixed point in the sky.  I watched it a few moments, then got up and went back into the TOC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They weren’t there the next night, but I noticed them there every couple of nights, with one night something else occurred to me: that they seemed to be trying to imitate what the stars in the sky look like at night (especially with how the colors of the lights worked), and that made me think of a sort of observation post (actually, cover and concealment is what occurred to me) to watch us while not being an apparent threat by being part of the back drop of the night sky.  I noticed them for a few more weeks, but by the end of October 1995, I didn’t see them anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen them since, but very seldom, and only one group in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Top was identical to bottom with red lights on top andbottom with a red colored section on bottom middle for &#34;beaming&#34; possibly. I viewed it from the side. I saw it for about a second then I went to look for it with my naked eye and I couldnt find it.

I pointed it out to my friends and as we watched it slowly glide over we thought at first it might be a blimp but it had nothing under it and it wasn&#39;t the same shape(it was thinner) we also noticed no sounds and since we seen planes earlier that we could hear we just stood there dumbfounded especially after it got to the area over their garage...it just started to disappear like it was going into a cloud but therewas no clouds in the sky at all.After it disapeared I said &#34;look there&#39;s another and it was followed by a third one that also disappeared in front of us. All we could do after this was look at each other in disbelief...we never heard anything on the news the next day or after that until a month or two later some people had spotted some strange object over Lake Erie.<n>

Pulled off freeway for a while to look at huge object at fixed location in sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wasn&#39;t moving as a plane would be, and didn&#39;t appear to be very high up in sky.  I finally drove on after looking at this object for what seemed like a very long time.  Looked like colors were changing, or the object was rotating in fixed position.  I would guess object was only 1000 feet high over area it was hovering.  There had to be other people who saw this,  as it was hovering over a residential  area,  I believe.  Very striking sighting and has puzzled me ever since- my only sighting as far as I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It stayed that distance at all times as I was going 60mph.Itried to describe it to myself. Itlooked like the color of rust ,triangular,rounded on the corners with flashing lights on each point,red,green and white.No visable windows. There were two bulges on each side .The sides were rounded .For some reason I did not stop as intended and the next thing I remember is looking in rearview mirror to see if I could see the object which I did not.We cotinued on till we stopped just acrossthe line into Minn. Untill that time neither of us spoke nor turned on the radio. A very different mood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is unknown.  Witness indicates both July 15 and 16.

One Friday? night, I was arriving home later than usual, about 5:30 am. Still dark outside. I lived one house from the cul-de-sac. Behind the last house was a large field, with a large house maybe 200 yards up on the hill. I usually make a wide turn (just made it easier to turn into my driveway). As I was going in to my turn, that&#39;s when I stopped. What I was seeing was so unexpected, I think I was just mesmerized for a moment. I kept the object in my view for maybe 10 seconds. Here&#39;s where I screwed up. I thought I would park the car in the driveway (about 20&#39; from the road) and run out to get a better look. Don&#39;t ask my why. You know about hindsight. I did this. The object was gone. There was never any sound. The object  appeared to be circular, maybe 10 - 15&#39; in diameter. But the wierdest thing was that it had a yellow strobe (like on a DOT vehicle) somehow attached to it. But the object did not seem to be solid, more like a holgram or ball of plasma or just a ball of light. No one else saw this to my knowledge, being the time of day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this to MUFON via the web, but did not here back.

While watching, a fast-moving bright light (Possibly due to Sun Reflection) came from behind the satellites&#39; route and quickly made 2 perfect circles around the satellite and then headed back from where it had come.  Obviously, in 1995, we had no aircraft that could fly at near a satellite&#39;s speed while in orbit.

After only a few seconds, I saw a &#34;star&#34; suddenly start to move in a very birarre pattern, in an area about the size of a silver dollar, held at arm&#39;s length.  It moved within that area for about 10 to 30 seconds, then stopped.   When I looked away from it, and then looked back, it looked so much like any other star, that I could not differentiate it from any other star I had been seeing, so much so that I couldn&#39;t even tell if I was looking at the object that had moved, or if I was seeing a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the &#34;star&#34; moved, it did not accelerate the way everything else I had ever seen had; and when it came to a stop, it did not slowly decelerate, either.  When it moved, it was instantly going full speed, and when it stopped, it just stopped.  There was no speeding up or slowing down.  It was either moving at full speed, or it wasn&#39;t.   And when it turned or changed direction, it did not do so with a curving movement; it just suddenly changed directions, often changing it&#39;s direction of movement 45, 90, even 180 degrees, going back the direction it had come from! After performing these &#34;movements&#34; for 30 seconds or so, it would stop for about that same length of time, and then start moving again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing that happen a couple of times, the reality of what I was seeing, that I was definately seeing a genuine UFO, so overwhelmed me, that I actually wondered if I was losing my mind!  So much so that it actually scared me! I needed someone else to tell me if they were seeing this too, so I got up and, unbelievably calmly and quietly asked my wife if she would mind walking out to the end of the sidewalk with me.   She did, and when we got to the end of the walk, I turned my back to where Pete was up on the porch, 40 feet away, and told her, &#34;Honey, I want to ask you something, and when you answer me, no matter what you have to say or how you feel, I want you to WHISPER your answer to me, and I don&#39;t want you to make ANY kind of movements with your arms or hands, or even your head, that Pete can see from up there on the porch.  In fact, I am going to stand with my body between you and Pete, and if you have any pointing to do, be sure my body is between the two of you so that he cannot see you. (I am a full head taller than her, and wider.)  Do you understand?&#34; She said yes, so without looking up or pointing, I told her, &#34;I want you to look up into the sky, where the stars are, right directly above my head, but do it very casually to where Pete won&#39;t notice, and I want you to tell me if you see anything unusual, but remember!  Do not SAY or do anything that Pete could hear or see.&#34; I stood very, very close to her, doing my best to block Pete&#39;s view of her, and she began to search the sky above us.  After about 20 seconds she started to say, &#34;Honey, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re wanting me to see, cause I&#39;m not seeing anything...&#34;, and just as the last word was leaving her mouth, I saw her eyes get big, and a very excited, stunned look come on her face, and knew she had seen it too, so I very quickly whispered, &#34;shhhhh! Don&#39;t say it! Whisper it in my ear!&#34; I leaned over and put my ear close to her mouth, and she whispered, with trembling and excitement in her voice:  &#34;A star!  There&#39;s a STAR moving around in a very weird way!  It&#39;s zipping around, changing directions, and not speeding up or slowing down!&#34;  I told her, &#34;take my hand, and with your finger, trace out the pattern that it is making.&#34;  And she drew the exact patterns on my hand that I had seen the &#34;star&#34; make.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With great relief, having been reassured that I was not going insane, I whispered &#34;thank you&#34; to her, and told her that I was going to call Pete out and go through the same thing with him, and for her to be very careful not to give him any verbal or visual ques whatsoever as to what we had seen, or what we wanted him to look for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To make a long story short, I repeated this same &#34;test&#34; with Pete, and he too, went through almost the same exact stages that my wife had gone through; at first not seeing anything, and then the sudden realization that he, too, was seeing something like nothing else he had ever seen in his life! We watched that object for a couple of hours, as it performed &#34;maneuvers&#34; in a certain area of the sky, about the size of a silver dollar held at arm&#39;s length, and then, after doing that for several minutes, it would suddenly make a &#34;long jump&#34; over to another part of the sky, where it would repeat the same or similar maneuvers that we had seen it do, in the location it had just left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all feel absolutely sure that this object was a long ways outside of any atmosphere surrounding our planet, and while it certainly appeared to actually be as far away as the stars themselves, especially when the objected stopped, I realize it was probably actually between the earth and the stars, probably far closer to earth, than to the stars, although when the craft stood still, it looked so much like all the stars, that there was NO way you could tell if you were looking at a star, or at the craft!  (I have a feeling that this was deliberate on the part of &#34;some body!&#34;) We watched it for perhaps two hours, during which time it slowly made it&#39;s way from almost straight overhead, to towards the southeast.  (My wife says it moved towards the southWEST.)  We watched it for so long that we could no longer stay awake, having all of us put in a hard work week, and seeing that it was apparently going to do nothing but continue what we had been seeing it do for the past two or three hours, my wife and I went in and to bed, and Pete went home.   Even now, years later, we still sometimes watch for it to reappear, as we are sure and hope that it will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then, I visit endless websites and listen to Coast To Coast AM and other programs almost every single day, hoping to hear about others who have seen a similar object, and every now and then, I do!   In fact, I read of someone seeing what is apparently the same exact object, only YESTERDAY, October 16, 2003, on the National UFO Reporting website, and so I felt prompted to also post my report of this similar sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion, I&#39;d like for it to be known that I am 50 years old, that I was born on an Air Force Base, that I have been a student pilot, and have attended dozens of air shows, and have watched many television programs about air craft, but I have never, ever seen anything that could even remotely do the kinds of things that this craft did!   Unless the pilot of the vehicle had some kind of survival gear light years ahead of anything we have now, there is no way a human could have survived the instantaneous application of g-forces that were obviously applied to the body of the vessel&#39;s pilot, (if it even had one!)   And obviously, the craft itself had to be light years ahead of anything we have now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having been a communications technician, and always being strongly interested in these kinds of things, I would dearly love to have the opportunity to work with, and hopefully even to take a ride in, one of these vehicles, some day! PS: Abilene is the home of Dyess Air Force Base, the home of the B1 bomber, and this incident happened about 3 miles from the base, but over East Abilene, not over the base.  I have, however, since seen a missile like object, during the &#34;Gulf War,&#34; take off from the area north of Dyess, go apparently to the edge of the atmosphere, and arc over, then to head east towards the general direction of the Middle East.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This happend above the Marianna mountain chain in the southern Mojave dessert. The verry next day I was watching SIGHTINGS and seen a report of the same exact UFO that I saw, ECEPT this sighting was in England!<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it stood still in the sky,sorta hovering there. It then shoot to the right &amp; back to the left at rappid speeds, it did this for about ten minutes. In the upper right hand of the sky there was this diamond shape of lights red, yellow, and green going around the diamond in seqeunce (rotating) the orange globe then disapered into the center of the diamond. This seems very short,it took about ten minutes for the whole thing to happen. It left me trembling, &amp; my freind crying. Like I said, I saw the same exact thing on SIGHTINGS the very next day ecept the sighting was in England. I&#39;m not sure if there were one or two crafts,I&#39;m sure of the globe bieng seperate from the diamond, but the diamond seemed hollow in the center, because I could see stars through it.My freind said she never talks about it, because no-one believes her. I refuse to stop talking about it, because what ever it was &amp; who ever was behind the controlls, I saw it! and no-one can take that from me. I dont care if people dont believe me. I know what I saw,&amp; it was&#39;nt venus,mars,or jupiter, no it was&#39;nt a weather baloon iether.<n>

They looked like they were dropping into a river not far from where we were.  This went on for about 10 minutes and then the green light flew away.

It was a hot summer day in the middle of nowhere in the Mojave Desert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As our vehicle approached a hilltop, my mom and I both saw something unbelievable.  No more than 30 feet above our car was some kind of object, gold in color and literally hovering in one spot.  It didn&#39;t move at all.  It was completely silent.  Oddly enough, I know this sounds stupid, it was shaped like a sperm!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear on everything! The craft was smooth, no bolts, screws, or seams.

It looked like a shooting star. But it was so bright and in our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The years and dates above could be out by a year or so either way. All i can really remember is that i was still in high school at the time. I used to stay up late at night to have a ciggarette when my parents would go to bed. I live at the top of a three storey house that faces North, in a hilly area in Melbourne. On this particular night, i was lucky to see whatever it was. ( I have seen alot of shooting stars in my time, and it was either the most spectacular shooting star or something else). The reason i was so lucky is that, as i was pulling open my curtains I saw the event happen. It appeard like someone had shot a flaming arrow from a few feet above the roof above my head, which made the lower part of the roof in front of me ligt up, and it lit up the whole sky as it rocketed across the sky and over the nearest hill. All of this happend in about a second or two. There is no way that it was an aeroplane beacause of the speed of the thing. That is why i thought it must have been a shooting star. I dont know if stars can shoot through our atmosphere or not. But this thing sure did. I checked the newspaper and watched the news the following day but nothing was said. So i pretty much thought nothing of it ever again until today when i stumbled across this site. That is pretty much all i can tell you. But if you want to ask any questions, just E-mail me at Benosmoko12@hotmail.com OR Benofromstowe@Yahoo.com Preferably the hotmail.<n>

I put the car in park and realized it emitted no sound, I therefore turned the car off and still could here no sound. I then got out of car,&#34;family still screeming hysterically&#34; and walked directly beneath it and could only discern a slight whirring noise. Allthough I could see 3 small lights, 1 on each corner&#34; I say corners, but body of craft was not visable, even at this close distance 50&#39;. &#34;  I stood directly beneath this object and was completely awestruck, since I could not see the body I bent down to pick up a rock with intention to strike the object &#34;no harm meant&#34; I just wanted to verify a solid structure. As I bent down my family really started to go nuts and my wife screemed that it was beginning to move&#34;south&#34; unable to find a rock in the dark I jumped into the car, turned around and gave pursuit, It never exhibited any great speed but the faster I went the faster it went probably hitting top speed of 60-80mph, when we reached the end of street it did something that in my judgement was more amazing, the front of the craft rose 30-40degrees climbed aprox. 50 &#39; banked hard left and disappeared out of view without any legible sound at all. This occurred on Atlee street &#34;was willow st.&#34;aprox. 6-7 miles from gulf of mexico in somewhat rural area. I reported to sheriffs office, they thought I was a nut.I did not know who to report to who would take serious. Me, my wife and my children know what we saw, and there is no craft in existance that could hover or fly in this manner without any discernable noise to my knowledge. It has made me a believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hovering at tree top level, slightly off edge of roadway, triangular arranged lights with point aiming due south, hovered for at least 5 minutes with no detecktable sound except for very faint whirring. Distance between lights 40-50 feet, my best example of size would be a double wide mobile home cut into triangle. Body was not visable, but should have been!! Allthough it was night time, at this distance it should have been visable. My wife, myself and 3 of my children were present and witnessed it allthough my youngest son at the time was to young to remember the physical aspects he remembers the screeming. After hovering for aprox. 5 min. it started drifting south and steadily gained speed, giving chase I could not catch it traveling up to 50mph on a dirt road, it abrutly climbed about 50&#39; banked hard left and disappeared over the potberg ranch territory. It also appeared the next evening, flew diagnoly over our house then down the backroad and emitted some bright flashes that lit up the whole block, I took some video but all thatwas visable was 3 lites.<n>

Where I made the sighting is about one or two miles west of the lake, as the crow flies, and about five miles east of the Woodlake city limits. It was dusk, about 8:30pm as I rounded a bend that led to the winding road through the foothills. There are two peaks about 500ft+ tall with a small valley between them. As I drove by I glanced up and noticed what looked to be a large water tank setting in the valley between the two peaks with red and green lights, alternated around the upper most rim. They were lit. I could see the curvature of the upper rim. I noticed what appeared to be the seams between the panels used to make the wall of the tank. In retrospect, it must have been huge because it filled over 50% of the space between the two peaks. I could not see the bottom of it as it was hidden behind the crest of the hill between the peaks. As I drove I said to myself, &#34; Hum! I&#39;ve been through here hundreds of times and have never seen that tank before&#34;, then it hit me there can&#39;t be any tank up there. I was meeting people at the lake and was in a hurry so didn&#39;t turn back to investigate. I purposed to come back the next day on the way home and sure enough it was gone; I have never seen it since. No one else from the area that I have talked to has seen anythig like it before but I am told there is an old Indian grave yard up there in the same vicinity. One lady from Woodlake told me she has seen a cigar shapped UFO in the area before. As far as I know there are no access roads up thereh except a few dirt fire roads. Nothing that would accomodate a tank that size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

Many miles away at a 60 degree angle from horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been several years since the event so my memory of the specifics, such as date, time, and number of objects, is not clear. I was up in the Bremerton, Wa. area on a crystal clear night. It is not a big city area so there aren&#39;t many city lights to detract from the view of the sky. I was on the balcony of my apartment with my girlfriend just enjoying the evening and chatting when we both noticed several solid red lights in the sky about the size of 4 or 5 intense stars put together.  They were very far away in the sky. I would say many miles away. They were far up in the sky, probably 60 degrees off the horizon.  I do not remember the direction. And do not want to guess as it would be just that. They were, at times, in formation where they would be close together and then in a split second they would shoot off in different directions of no certain pattern or common distance.  They moved with amazing speed, with no tail, and stopped on a dime and then would change direction effortlessly. It seemed they were covering great distances because they seemed so far away and would cover 10 t0 30 degrees of sky in a matter of a few seconds. Then as quickly as they&#39;d separated they would one by one, in no certain order, come back together (not touching) again as if to huddle. They did not pulsate. They did not change shape or color. They did not seem to move any closer in our direction but for the most part seemed to travel on a constant plain of distance.  They did however seem to move both longitudenally and latitudenally. Meaning that if someone a hundred miles away from my position was directly under them they may have appeared to have a change in depth perception. My first impression, as I mentioned to my girlfriend, was that we were witnessing and extra-terrestrial event. We were obviously surprised and in awe but not frightened. I am very much a pesemist when it comes to this sort of thing and tried in every way possible to figure a logical explanation (planes, helicopters, lasers,...etc.) but nothing I! &#39;d ever whitnessed made sense. I&#39;ve only mentioned this to maybe 2 or 3 people and never reported it or followed up because I figured it was pointless. But I have never forgotten it. I&#39;ve often wondered if there were any other whitnesses and only report it now because when I typed in &#34;UFOs Washington&#34; last week and found your site and saw the story about the mother and daughter and the red fireball it blew my mind.  I felt like I should let you guys know. I don&#39;t know what you will do with this information but I hope it helps.  I also wonder how you are able to determine if someone writing to you is telling the truth or fabricating a story. Please take this as the truth. I work in mainstream society and am very busy (I don&#39;t have time to write fairy tales on the internet). I would not share this with my associates as they would probably think I was nuts. I only do this now because it has always been stored in my memory since then and I never forget it and also because of the account I read in your site. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re related but if they aren&#39;t it is a hell of a coinsedence.<n>

It was about200-300 ft. in the air over this field. It was as far away from us as it was in the air.  It made no noise,then it started to drift in N.E. direction over the mian highway in front of the house. It looked like in was going to come down accross the street by these power lines.

It made no sound, and did not change direction. The shape of the craft could be seen because of the glow of the lights of the town that were behind it.  I do not know what direction it was travelling, or how far away it was, but it was obvious that it was very large.  I come to this conclusion because the treeline that I compared it too was at least 3 miles away, and the object looked large as it went over the horizon.  As it neared the treeline, there was a ring of white lights that started flashing at the center-rear of the craft.  I don&#39;t remember if there was any pattern, as I was very scared at this point, but each &#34;pulse&#34; lasted less than a second.  I also remember seeing diffuse red lights near where I thought the &#34;points&#34; of the triangle would be, but I have less of a memory of them.  I was just out of high school at the time, with my girlfriend, visiting her relatives.  I had wanted to be an airline pilot at the time, and when I saw the craft I started listing any large aircraft that I knew of, but none matched what I was seeing.

It did not slow down or speed up but continued down the road, around the next bend in the road and appeared again on the other side of the bend and continued out of site.It stayed the same distance above the road in the air as far as we could follow it with our eyes.  It was very dark that night, no moon as I can remember but the orb was silver and looked matallic. I dont know if the metal look was a reflection of the headlights or if it made its own glow.  I could not see a tree or surrounding features to compare size and distance in the air, but it seemed to me to be about the size of a soccer ball and within 15 feet above the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw it, my mind was struggling with what it possibly could be, and untill my friend screamed in horror I didnt realize it was something that shouldnt have been there.  It made no sound, or effected anything around us that i could tell.  I am not sure of the date, as i  have not spoken of it but very few times. i could talk to my friend to see what date, or as close as we can figure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have been friends now for 21 years, and have spoken of it very little to each other or to anyone else. We are both home makers, mothers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It looked as if a giant headlight were hanging in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s the best way I can describe it, because it wasn&#39;t a ball of light, but rather a focused beam of light pointing across the sky in one direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure you&#39;re familiar with the term &#34;no inertia&#34;...it hung in the sky for several seconds and then took off without any build-up to a speed of what a small airplane might run at if it were at full speed.  But like I said, when it took off it was instantly at that speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no sound coming from the object as it paced itself to a point in the distance about 1-2 miles away from us and then...WOOOSH!  it shot straight up through the clouds exactly like in the movies...the speed mirrored a bolt of lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, that was it. The friends I had with me, although I haven&#39;t seen them in a few years, still won&#39;t talk about the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

7/1/95 19:00|Wedowee|AL|Sphere|Appx. 30 minutes|MUFON/ISUR (GEORGIA) REPORT:   Investigation-Glowing Orb Chases Church Van|4/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35948.html|125|ndxe199507| MUFON/ISUR Investigation-Glowing Orb Chases Church Van<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background   This investigation was conducted jointly by MUFON of Georgia and ISUR (International Society for UFO Research) beginning on 15May97.  This event actually occurred on an UNKNOWN DATE in 1995, but believed to be in cooler weather, perhaps the autumn, as it was getting dark about 1900 hours.  At the time of the investigation, this writer was serving as Chief Field Investigator for MUFON of Georgia and as an investigator for ISUR.  John Thompson of Lagrange Georgia was State Director for MUFON at that time and also on the ISUR Board.  The multiple witnesses were all Georgia residents of that area, and attended the same church.  The occasion leading to the event was a church trip to Anniston Alabama by this small group of church ladies.  They were being driven in a large van by a male member of the congregation who was a prominent local businessman, and also known as a trusted community leader in that African-American neighborhood.  Accounts vary, but there may have been 10+ total witnesses on this trip, this investigator interviewing 6 of them.  This harrowing account was held confidential by these witnesses for about 2 years, only being discussed among their small group of friends.  Eventually, the information was related to John Thompson in his Lagrange office, and he asked this writer to follow up on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Investigation   15May97, this FI began by interviewing the Primary Witness (PW) at her home in Lagrange.  She was found to be a 62 YOA retired Nurses Assistant.  She lived in a well kept home in an older, established neighborhood, with many family photos and signs of serious religious faith being obvious.  PW stated that on the night in question, she and her church friends were riding up to nearby Anniston Alabama to play bingo.  They were seated to the rear of their friend, the van driver, and as usual talking and having a nice ride, enjoying the nice clear weather.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Note......the driving route was determined as follows; west out of Lagrange and across the adjacent state line into Alabama, then turning north on Alabama Hwy 431 which carries them to I-20 which is about 35-40 miles distant to the north. Anniston is near the intersection of Alabama Hwy 431 and I-20).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the van approached the vicinity of Wedowee Alabama on Hwy 431, the witnesses decided to roll up all of the windows because of the poultry plant located just off the highway (Braswell&#39;s Farms).  PW indicated that the odor of the production there was pretty strong, and this was something they normally did enroute to Anniston.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the van approached and passed the plant, PW and some others noticed what they thought was a large new light over the top of the building (which is located on a rise).  It was large enough that they commented on it being newly installed.  One witness stated that it WAS NOT a light, but some &#34;FLYING THING&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another witness commenting that no, it was just a new light. Then the other witness replying something to effect of &#34;Well if that&#39;s so, HERE IT COMES&#34;!   The light flew down from over the plant and approached the moving van and then began to pace it as it drove north.  The light was described as being round like a globe, about the size of a &#34;dishpan&#34; in diameter (bigger than a basketball).  The light was described as being &#34;yellowish&#34;, with the brightness of a lightbulb or street light.  It continued to pace the van, with descriptions of the light varying it&#39;s distance and altitude to as low as about 12 feet and then back up to 100 feet or treetop level; as close (and closer) as appx. 50 feet and backing away to perhaps 75 yards.......sometimes over the van, sometimes beside it, but always pacing it.  This episode began near Wedowee on Hwy 431 which, at this point in the route, is about 25 miles south of I-20 and the Anniston vicinity, their destination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this wild ride, the ladies became FRIGHTENED, trying to get down below the window level and still taking an occasional peek.  The driver stated that he was trying to drive and look at the same time which he found difficult. He verified that the light appeared to be about 100 feet over the poultry plant before it swooped down and began following them.  He added that eventually he DID IN FACT think about some form of UFO due to having read such accounts. Adding that it was definitely a large globe of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this ride up to I-20, the PW at one time saw what she described as a shape within the light, a shape very similar to a &#34;human embryo&#34;, which she indicated in her sketch. Further that it seemed to be &#34;moving around&#34; within the light. At another point, she recalled something like a beam projecting out that hurt her eyes, and those of her friend.  Adding that they both later developed watery and sore eyes. Another witness did not describe a beam, but told of a &#34;sparkling effect.  Another witness described a &#34;bad glare&#34; that beamed through the window.....just suddenly clicking on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This activity continued as the van moved northwards closer to I-20, passing through the small Alabama &#34;hill country&#34;.  At one point, the vehicle drove through an underpass, finding the globe of light waiting on the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light also demostrated terrain avoidance maneuvers and continuously adjusted it&#39;s speed to that of the van.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this group finally reached the area of the intersection of Hwy 431 and I-20, the light flew off over a field, then accelerated steeply upwards, leaving a streak, then became the size of a star and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A hoax was ruled out in this matter due to the sincerity of these witnesses and their strong church background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Considered was glowing plasma/spook light, helicopter, and advanced military recon drone.  These were ruled out.......this writer does not believe ANY kind of natural &#34;plasma/spook light&#34; would act as described......over so many miles.  Even though it was during darkness, the van was approached SO CLOSELY that a helicopter or drone fuselage would have been observed, as well as engine noise heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A spokesman for the mainly rural Randolph County Sheriff&#39;s Department recalled no similar reports from that time period and knew of nothing that might be related to this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this investigation, there were only the normal differences noticed from witness to witness, due to their personal interpretation and recall, seating position within the van, and level of fright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This writer classified the event as a SIGNIFICANT UNKNOWN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This FI also believes that there may have been more evidence in the offing if there had been a timely report of this event.  The witnesses are not to blame.  They were found to be good southern folks, that did not know whom to contact at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tom Sheets, State Director, MUFON of Georgia<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Tom Sheets, State Director of MUFON/Georgia, for sharing this case.

We were in the middle of our game when we looked up and across the road which was about 50 to 70 yards away and had seen a round disc shaped object that if I had to guess it was only 400 to 500 feet above the ground.  You could see lots of detail including the glass dome on top which was very bright inside.  You couldnt make anything out inside but the light on the inside it was very bright inside.  It was just hovering and moving very slow just moveing up the streetnot making a sound.  There were no other lights on this one just the light emitting out of the glass dome on top of the object.  We stood there and looked at it for what seemed like forever I know it was at least 10 15 min before it drifted out of sig! ht.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried calling the Pittsburgh news stations describeing what we were seeing and they had said they have a large number of calls coming in about the same thing and tried to say we were seeing a blimp. IM sorry but I know what a blimp looks like and there is no way you could tell me that I was looking at a blimp. It was many years ago but I can remember it like it was yesterday. It was so low you could see so much detail on it and from there on I was a believer. I have told guys at work and they laugh at me when I do but I really dont care if anybody believes me or not I know what me my friends and the parents that were there had seen that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It was 5:45 AM and obviously still dark outside.  We were heading down the cut-through road that runs parallel with Mitchell Road in Greenville, SC towards Hudson Road when we spotted this &#34;craft.&#34;   I stopped the truck and we got out to observe.  We watched this thing for over 15 minutes.   It was completely silent and just hovering over the tops of pine trees.  It was absolutely huge. I am guessing that it was as big as a football field.   It was shaped like similar to a blimp.  It had red, green,  and amber/yellow lights all over it.  There were no aviation lights on it anywhere that a typical manmade craft would have.  The UFO slowly faded beyond our sight beyond the pine trees as the Sun came up.   I called the local radio station that morning to see if anyone else had seen it.  I could hardly believe that nobody else saw it.  Another friend of mine lived right near this sighting and is positive that it was a blimp that he saw there all the time.  Michellin is close by, but this was not a blimp in my opinion.   I have searched high and low on the Internet to find a blimp that was anything like this to no avail.  Also, why would a blimp be flying at 5:45 AM? I noticed on a website that indexes sightings that a gentleman in Boone, NC also saw a craft almost identical around the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

7/1/95 04:30|Bellevue|NE|Unknown|1 minute|Silent craft flying extremely low dropping flaming embers|4/1/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12420.html|128|ndxe199507| Silent craft flying extremely low dropping flaming embers<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was located less than a mile north of Offutt AFB (Nebraska) in a grocery store parking lot on Highway 370 when I noticed &#39;fire&#39; in the sky to the north of my location. Upon further inspection, it appeared to be moving very slowly with flaming embers falling from the bottom. There was not any sound associated with the craft and I feared it was a jet crashing. However, it didnt lose any altitude and continued traveling westward until I couldnt see it. I never heard any crash sound and there were no reports of downed aircraft from the base. The details of the event are sketchy for me because I didn&#39;t write them down. I didn&#39;t really think much about it until I heard another report describing the flaming embers. I dont remember any lights associated with the craft other than the embers. It was flying lower than the top of a water tower to the west of my location. I am certified as a weather observer/forecaster and have extensive experience watching the night time sky, though this is what I would consider my first UFO encounter. I just assumed it was an unannounced military aircraft.<n>

They were in a typical fighter pattern(V) so I thought they were aircraft at very high altitudes flying extremely fast.  My girlfriend was next to me and I tried to point them out.  When they were about in front of me they stopped and appeared to stop and quickly moved into an circle.  After a few seconds they abruptly took off in different directions at jaw dropping speeds.  I know this sounds nuts and I doubt my own eyes but this is what I saw.  The date is wrong but I know it was summertime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

What is so strange about this is that, the next day my mom asked if anyone had heard the beeping noise. She said that she woke up to a sound like the microwave going off, but no one was up, then the next day I was wearing a tank top and someone asked what the marks were on my back. They were rectangular shapes, 2 of them,not scratches,welts or burns they were marks made by blood drawn to the surface like hickeys in the shape of  hollow rectangles I still forgot to tell anyone what I had seen the night before, and in fact everytime I would remember I would quickly forget again, to this day I have told one person. I can take a lie detector test, theres more to this thats alittle more strange, a little embarrasing,anyhow I would really like to talk to someone to see if anyone else has had these similar markings. I&#39;m the type of person that would stop and help someone if they were hurt or atleast call 911, I think it&#39;s weird that I didnt but for the longest time I thought nothing of it.<n>

When we came to the radio station on Apache we saw a huge cone shaped object floating above the station.  The illumination on the surrounding street was an intense white and green.  We were not the only people who saw it - someone was across the street making a call from a payphone and was watching it as well.  After roughly two minutes the object lifted into the sky and began to proceed northeast.  We followed it from Apache to Dustin to 30th to Main Street where we drove to the hill overlooking Farmington lake.  The object continued to hover across the sky before disappearing along the south side of Animas Valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I do know that it was in 1995, I believe in the summertime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and a friend (both about 16 yrs of age) witnessed it from my mother&#39;s home in Longbranch, WA.  I have checked on and off for years to see if I could find any similar reports occurred in the same area around the same timeframe and have been unable to find any to date.  I recently found the website for NUFORC, so I thought I would give a shot at reporting it here to see if I could get any further information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to admit that in a way the following description will sound like something you might read or see in a sci-fi story, but I can assure that I and my friend witnessed the event as I will describe in the text below firsthand with the exception of the details from the following morning which were relayed to me by my mother, which seem to bear relevance to the situation so I will include that as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point late night or early morning, I will say around midnight would be a fair estimate, the two of us were sitting in my room.  I looked through my window and saw a bright light through the branches of a tree outside which at first I took to be just a bright star in the night sky.  Within the next several minutes I looked out again and the light was still there in the same position but seemed a little brighter.  Again a few minutes passed and I looked out again, but at this time I could see that the light was in another position relative to the tree, so at this time I mentioned it to my friend and we decided to watch it through the window as the position changed seemed unusual.  Again it stayed in this position for a couple minutes while we watched and then suddenly disappeared and reappeared almost instantly at yet a new point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this juncture we decided to go outside to watch as it seemed to be getting closer and would soon be at a point where we could not easily see it above from the window.  Outside we watched for several more minutes with the same process repeating where the object would be stationary in the sky, disappear, and then reappear at another point.  I would say this went on for what seemed to be at least 20 to 30 minutes.  If I recall the directions correctly the object was north of us to begin with when I first saw it and progressively moved south toward us as it went (I will continue to use this directional assumption for the duration of this account).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time from the southeast we heard the sound of jets approaching from the direction of McChord Air Force Base which is located in Tacoma, which is the nearest large city to Longbranch.  We located them in the sky and saw multiple jets moving in the direction of the light.  When they appeared to be nearing it, it moved to a new point in the same manner as before and the jets turned and went toward it again.  This repeated several times with the same results over several more minutes. More jets approached and this continued with the object now moving further into the east.  They progressively moved out further over the surrounding woods in that direction  until we could no longer see them over the trees.  I would estimate this cat and mouse between them to have gone on for at least 15 to 20 minutes before we lost sight of them all with an estimate of around maybe 8 to 10 jets participating overall.  We watched a few more minutes to be sure they didn&#39;t come back in our directio! n and then saw a large dark object coming just over the trees from the same direction the jets and object disappeared from, passing directly over our heads.  When it got near and passed above us it clearly appeared to be a large black helicopter running with no visible lights and with no discernible sound from the rotors.  This is the end of what we saw firsthand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning my mother returned from a trip she had taken to visit family in the Tacoma area the day before and when she got home she asked if anything unusual had happened the night before.  When I asked why she was asking she stated that when she was passing through Longbranch on the way to our home that there were multiple government-plated cars parked by the road with men in suits stopping any passersby to ask if they had seen or heard anything going on the previous night, without giving any information into the nature of their inquiry.  I informed her of what I&#39;d seen but we agreed to keep the information to ourselves at that time.  We never heard or saw anything further on it.  As stated previously, the last part involving my mother was not first-hand, but it does seem pertinent to the prior night&#39;s event, although she passed away a few years ago and is no longer around to verify that particular aspect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have taken the time to read this in total without discounting it offhand, I appreciate your time and apologize for the length of it, although I did feel I should be as detailed and thorough as possible.  I hope to find out through this outlet if anyone else has seen or heard anything about what happened here, but if not I shall continue to search on my own in the future as I would like to know what occurred here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.
